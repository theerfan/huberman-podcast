00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.970
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.572
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:05.943
for everyday life.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.630
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.050
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.000
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.380
Today, my guest is Dr. David Sinclair,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.980
professor of genetics at
Harvard Medical School

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.740
and co-director of the
Paul F. Glenn Center

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.670
for the Biology of Aging.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.830
Dr. Sinclair's work is
focused on why we age

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.540
and how to slow or reverse
the effects of aging

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.780
by focusing on the cellular
and molecular pathways

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.721
that exist in all cells of
the body and that progress

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:40.547
those cells over time from
young cells to old cells.

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:44.925
By elucidating the biology of
cellular maturation and aging,

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:48.100
Dr. Sinclair's group has
figured out intervention points

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.810
by which any of us indeed, all of us,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.280
can slow or reverse the effects of aging.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.274
What is unique about his work

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:57.130
is that it focuses on
behavioral interventions,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.740
nutritional interventions,
as well as supplementation

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.350
and prescription drug
interventions that can help us all

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.360
age more slowly and reverse
the effects of aging

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.290
in all tissues of the body.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.900
Dr. Sinclair holds a unique
and revolutionary view

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.580
of the aging process, which is that aging

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.629
is not the normal and natural consequence

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:18.630
that we all will suffer.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810
But rather that aging is a disease

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.850
that can be slowed or halted.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.730
Dr. Sinclair continually publishes

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.730
original research articles
in the most prestigious

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.970
and competitive scientific journals.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.770
In addition to that, he's
published a popular book

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.660
that was a New York Times bestseller.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.207
The title of that book, is 'Lifespan:

00:01:36.207 --> 00:01:38.740
Why We Age And Why We Don't Have To.'

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.470
He is also very active
in public facing efforts

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.630
to educate people on the biology of aging

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.790
and slowing the aging process.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.562
Dr. Sinclair, and I
share a mutual interest

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:51.144
and excitement in public
education about science.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.510
And so I'm thrilled to share
with you that we've partnered.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.800
And Dr. David Sinclair
is going to be launching

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.060
the lifespan podcast,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.320
which is all about the
biology of aging and tools

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.560
to intervene in the aging process.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.780
That podcast will launch
Wednesday, January 5th.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.620
You can find it at the
link in the show notes

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.646
to this episode today as well.

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:13.930
You can subscribe to that
podcast on YouTube, Apple,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.330
or Spotify, or anywhere
that you get your podcasts.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.170
Again, the lifespan podcast
featuring Dr. David Sinclair,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.700
Claire begins Wednesday,
January 5th, 2022,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.620
be sure to check it out.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.090
You're going to learn a
tremendous amount of information,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.434
and you're going to learn
both the mechanistic science

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:31.330
behind aging, the
mechanistic science behind

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.100
reversing the aging
process and practical tools

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.800
that you can apply in your everyday life.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.346
In today's episode, Dr. Sinclair

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:40.800
and I talk about the biology of aging

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.530
and tools to intervene in that process.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.570
And so you might view today's episode

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.550
as a primer for the lifespan podcast,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.100
because we delve deep
into the behavioral tools,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.809
nutritional aspects,
supplementation aspects

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.520
of the biology of aging.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.950
We also talk about David's
important discoveries

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.990
of the sirtuins, particular components

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.240
that influence what is
called the epigenome.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.622
And if you don't know
what the epigenome is,

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:05.920
you will soon learn in today's episode.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.360
Coming away from today's episode,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.270
you will have in-depth knowledge
about the biology of aging

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.100
at the cellular, molecular,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.360
and what we call the circuit level,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.830
meaning how the different
organs and tissues of the bodies

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.790
age independently, and how they influence

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.580
the aging of each other.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.540
Today's episode gets into discussion

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.280
about many aspects of aging

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.040
and tools to combat aging

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.780
that have not been discussed
on any other podcasts

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.810
or in the book lifespan.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.346
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.450
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.450
It is however part of my desire and effort

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.940
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.510
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.810
In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.270
of today's podcast.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.030
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.430
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.580
that are the absolute highest quality.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.787
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system.

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:56.240
And I can tell you that the visual system

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.630
has to contend with a number
of different challenges,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.290
such as when you move
from a bright area outside

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.180
to an area where there are shadows,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.033
you have to adjust a number of
things in your visual system

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:07.240
so that you can still see things clearly.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.900
One problem with a lot of
eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.076
is they don't take that
biological feature into account.

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:15.900
And you have to take off your
glasses and put them back on,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.110
depending on how bright or
dim a given environment is.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.100
With ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.840
you always see things
with the utmost clarity.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.430
In addition, they're very lightweight

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.940
and they won't slip off your face.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.530
In fact, they were designed to be worn

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.850
while biking or running
and the various activities,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.260
but they also have a terrific aesthetic,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.950
so you could wear them to dinner or work.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.568
I wear readers at night and when I drive

00:04:35.568 --> 00:04:38.240
and I wear the sunglasses
for most of the day.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.325
If you'd like to try ROKA
sunglasses or eyeglasses,

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:43.860

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.100
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.783
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:00.810
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.340
to help you better understand your body

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.420
and help you reach your health goals.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.290
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.065
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:11.500
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.160
can only be assessed from
a quality blood test.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.880
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.520
you can also get a clear picture

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.350
of what your biological age is

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.490
and compare that to
your chronological age.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.820
And obviously your biological
age is the important one

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.070
because it predicts how long you will live

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.993
and it's the one that you can control.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.250
The great thing about InsideTracker

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.340
is that compared to a
lot of other DNA tests

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.180
and blood tests out there
is that with InsideTracker,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.700
you don't just get your numbers back

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.608
at the levels of various
hormones, metabolic factors,

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:42.260
blood lipids, et cetera,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.840
but it also offers clear
directives to lifestyle factors,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.190
nutritional factors and
supplementation that you can use

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.800
in order to get the
numbers into the ranges

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.700
that are best for you and for your health.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.110

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.750
any of InsideTracker's plans.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.510
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Magic Spoon.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.980
Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.630
keto friendly cereal.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.400
Now I don't follow a
strictly ketogenic diet.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.640
What works best for me is to eat according

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.930
to my desire to be alert
at certain times of day

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.295
and to be sleepy at other times of day.

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:29.700
So for me, that means
fasting until about 11:00 AM

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.090
or 12 noon most days.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.610
And then my lunch is typically
a low carb, ketoish lunch,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.360
maybe a small piece of grass-fed meat,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.620
some salad, something of that sort.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.920
And then in the afternoon,
I might have a snack

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.920
that's also ketoish.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.160
And then at night is when
I eat my carbohydrates,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.310
which for me helps me with
the transition to sleep

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.010
and allows me to get great deep sleep.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.410
That's what works for me.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.830
What that means is in the
afternoon I'm craving a snack.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.090
And the snack for me is Magic Spoon.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.142
What I do lately is I put
in some Bulgarian yogurt.

00:06:58.142 --> 00:07:00.470
Sometimes I just eat it straight.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.140
Each serving of Magic Spoon
has zero grams of sugar,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.810
13 to 14 grams of protein

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.650
and only four grams of
carbohydrates in each serving.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.146
So it really matches that
low carb ketoish approach.

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:13.158
There's only 140 calories per serving,

00:07:13.158 --> 00:07:15.170
and they have a variety of flavors.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.600
Coco, fruity, peanut butter or frosted.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.950
I particularly like frosted
'cause it tastes like donuts.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.710
I try not to eat donuts,
but I do love the frost.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.700
And as I mentioned before,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.850
I lately mix it with yogurt
polo cinnamon on there.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.260
I'm getting hungry just talking about it.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.270
Now, if you want to try Magic Spoon,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.790

And now my conversation
with Dr. David Sinclair.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.450
Thank you for coming.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.520
- Thanks for having me here.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.640
It's good to see you.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.473
- This is mate by the way, that
we're toasting at 11:00 AM.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.790
Unlike other podcasts, we,
well, I don't drink alcohol,

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.023
so I'm boring that way.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.100
But truly, thanks for being here,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.870
I have a ton of questions for you.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.660
We go way back in some sense,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.420
but that doesn't mean that I don't have

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.420
many, many questions about
aging, longevity, lifespan,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.770
actionable protocols to increase

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.317
how long we live, et cetera.

00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:21.167
And I just want to start off
with a very simple question.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.120
I'm not even sure there's an answer to,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.930
but what is the difference
between longevity,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.510
anti-aging and aging as a disease?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.540
Because I associate
you with the statement,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.610
aging is a disease.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.530
- Right?

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.570
Well, so longevity is
the more academic way

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.380
we describe what we research.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.650
Anti-aging is kind of the same thing,

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.690
but it's got a bad rap
because it's been used

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.050
by a whole bunch of people that don't know

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.330
what they're talking about.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.720
So I really don't like
that term anti-aging,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.530
but aging is a disease and longevity

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.650
are perfectly valid ways
to talk about this subject.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.910
So let's talk about aging as a disease.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.830
When I started my research,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.020
disease here at Harvard Medical School,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.310
it was considered,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.913
if there's something
that's wrong with you.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.913
and it's a rare thing,

00:09:09.913 --> 00:09:12.800
it has to be less than
50% of the population,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.240
that's definitely a disease,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.060
and then people work their whole lives

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.370
to try and cure that condition.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.203
And so I looked up,

00:09:19.203 --> 00:09:20.240
what's the definition of aging

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.660
and it says, well, it's
a deterioration in health

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.994
and sickness and you can die
from it, typically you do.

00:09:25.994 --> 00:09:28.770
Something that sounds
pretty much like a disease,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.350
but the caveat is that if
more than half the population

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.460
gets this condition, aging,
it's put in a different bucket.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.030
Which is first of all, that's outrageous,

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.810
'cause it's just a
totally arbitrary cutoff.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:41.643
But think about this,

00:09:41.643 --> 00:09:45.430
that we're ignoring the major
'cause of all these diseases.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.220
Aging is 80 to 90% the cause
of heart disease, Alzheimer's.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.100
If we didn't get old and
our bodies stayed youthful,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.400
we would not get those diseases.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.030
And actually what we're
showing in my lab is,

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.600
if you turn the clock back, in tissues,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.170
those diseases go away.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.230
So aging is the problem
and instead through,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.150
most of the last 200 years,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
we've been sticking band-aids on diseases

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.610
that have already
occurred because of aging

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.340
and then it's too late.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.230
So there are a couple of things.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.550
One is we want to slow aging down

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.560
so we don't get those diseases
and when they do occur,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.900
don't just take a bandaid on,

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.060
reverse the age of the body

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.360
and then the diseases will go away.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.931
- That clarifies a lot for me, thank you.

00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:27.931
Can we point to one specific
general phenomenon in the body

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.070
that underlies aging?

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.900
- Yeah, well, that's contentious

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.760
because scientists like to
come up with new hypothesis.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.250
It's how they build their careers.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.445
But fortunately during the two thousands,

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:43.500
we settled on eight or
nine major causes of aging.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.490
We call them hallmarks

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.240
'cause causes was a little bit too strong,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.480
but these eight or nine causes,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.510
at least for the first time
allowed us to come around

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.343
and talk together.

00:10:53.343 --> 00:10:55.740
And we put them on a pizza

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.623
so everyone got an equal
weighting, equal slices.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.560
But before that, by the way,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.315
we were trying to kill
each other in the field,

00:11:02.315 --> 00:11:03.760
that was horrible.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.350
- Interesting that you guys work on aging

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.320
and you're trying to kill each other.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.153
- Yeah, isn't it?

00:11:07.153 --> 00:11:08.920
Well kill each other's careers.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.660
Well I like to think
I was fairly generous,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.980
but I was one of the kids

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.070
and the old guard really
didn't like the new guard.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.750
We just came along in the 1990s

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.270
and said, free radicals don't do much.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.560
They're actually genes
called longevity genes.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.830
And that caused a whole ruckus.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.288
And there was this competition
for what never happened,

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:29.720
which was a Nobel prize for this.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.201
And it just led to a lot of competition.

00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.070
I would go to meetings and
people would shout at each other

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.440
and backstab, it was horrible.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.660
But then unfortunately
in the two thousands,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.880
we rallied around this new map of aging

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.520
with these causes of hallmarks.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.870
But I think that there's
one slice of the pizza

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.890
that is way larger than the others.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.900
And we can get to that,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.150
but that's the information in the cell

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.366
that we call the epigenome.

00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:56.786
- Well tell us a little bit
more about the epigenome,

00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:01.193
frame it for us if you will,
and then we'll get into ways

00:12:01.193 --> 00:12:05.530
that one can adjust the
epigenome in positive ways.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.000
- Yeah, so in science, what I like to do,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.170
a reductionist is to boil it down

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.210
and I actually ended up boiling,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.681
aging down to an equation,

00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:16.963
which is the loss of
information due to entropy.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.150
It's a hard thing to overcome,
second law of thermodynamics.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.040
That's fair, but this
equation really represents

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.490
the fact that I think aging
is a loss of information

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.740
in the same way that
when you xerox something,

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.540
a thousand times you'll
lose that information

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.410
or you try to copy a cassette tape.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.330
Or even if you send information
across the internet,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.370
some of it will get lost.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.080
That's what I think is aging.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.490
And there were two types
of information in the body.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.460
There is the genetic
information, which is digital.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.250
ATCG the chemical letters of DNA,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.720
but there's this other part of
the information in the body.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.840
that's just as important,
it's essential, in fact,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.310
and that's the systems
that control which genes

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.530
are switched on and off
in what cell at what time

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.447
in response to what we eat, et cetera.

00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:07.380
And it turns out that 80% of
our future longevity and health

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.860
is controlled by the second part,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.870
the epigenetic information,
the control systems.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.770
I liken the DNA to the
music that's on a DVD

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.210
or a compact disc for the younger people.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.043
We used to use these things.

00:13:18.043 --> 00:13:18.900
- I recall.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.160
- Yeah, and then the epigenome
is the reader that says,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.700
okay, in this cell we need
to play that set of songs

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.533
and in this other cell,

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:27.975
we have to play a different set of songs.

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:31.080
But over time, aging is the
equivalent of scratching,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.300
the CD and the DVD so that you,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.221
you're not playing the
right songs and cells

00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:37.248
when they don't hear the right songs,

00:13:37.248 --> 00:13:40.180
they get messed up and
they don't function well.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.370
And that is what I'm saying
is the main driver of aging.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.290
And these other hallmarks
are largely manifestations

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.600
of that process.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.810
- Can we go a little deeper

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.844
into what that these scratches are.

00:13:51.844 --> 00:13:56.844
Is it the way that the DNA
are packed into a cell?

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.880
Is it the way that they're spaced?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.740
What are the scratches
that you're referring to?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.210
- So DNA is six foot long.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.850
So if you join your chromosomes together,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.920
you get a six foot post-sale.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.371
So there's enough to go to
the moon and back eight times

00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:12.780
in your body.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.170
And it has to be wrapped
up to exist inside us,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.300
but it's not just wrapped up willy-nilly.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.390
It's not just a bundle of string,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.180
it's wrapped up very carefully in ways

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.926
that dictates which genes
are switched on and off.

00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:27.446
And when we're developing in the embryo,

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:30.840
the cell marks the DNA
with chemicals that says,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.799
okay, this gene is for a nerve cell.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:35.430
Your cell will stay a nerve cell

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.311
for the next a hundred
years, if you're lucky.

00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.943
Don't turn into a skin
cell that would be bad.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.700
And those chemicals,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.970
there are many different
types of chemicals,

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.550
but one's called methylation.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.900
Those little menthols will
mark which songs get played

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.400
for the rest of your life.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.790
And there are other that change daily.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.320
But in total, what we're
saying is that the body

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.810
controls the genome through
the ability to mark the DNA

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.500
and then compact some parts
of it, silence those genes,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.450
don't read those genes and
open others, keep others open

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.850
that should stay open.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.660
And that pattern of genes
that are silent and open,

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.030
silent, open, is what
dictates the cells type

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.370
the cells function.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.190
And then the scratches are
the disruption of that.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.960
So genes that were once
silent and you could say,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.570
it's a gene that is involved in skin.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.710
It's starting to come on in
the brain, shouldn't be there,

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.000
but we see this happen and vice versa,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.198
the gene might get shut
off over time during aging.

00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:38.490
Cells over time, lose these structures,

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.530
lose their identity,

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.750
they forget what they're supposed to do

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.320
and we get diseases.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.140
We call that aging and
we can measure that.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.820
In fact, we can measure it in such a way

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.020
that we can predict when
somebody is going to die

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.034
based on the changes in those chemicals.

00:15:53.034 --> 00:15:55.434
- Are these changes, the
same sorts of changes

00:15:55.434 --> 00:16:00.146
that underlie the outward
body surface manifestations

00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:02.360
of aging, that most of
us are familiar with,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.440
graying of the hair,
wrinkling of the skin,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.063
drooping of the face.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.590
Walking around New York lately,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.288
it's amazing to me,
there are certain people

00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:15.530
that seem to walk looking
down at the sidewalk

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.780
because their spine is
essentially in a C shape, right?

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.240
A hallmark, if you will, of aging,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.800
that most of us are familiar with.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.900
Are the same sorts of DNA
scratches associated with that?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.733
Or are we talking about people

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:30.240
that are potentially
are going to look older,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.200
but simply live longer?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.000
- Well, it's actually, you
are as old as you look,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.409
if you want to generalize.

00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:39.310
So let's start with centenarian families.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.880
These are families that
tend to live over a hundred.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.050
When they're 70, they
still look 50 or less.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.560
So it is a good indicator.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.393
It's not perfect

00:16:48.393 --> 00:16:50.800
because you can like me
growing up in Australia

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.253
and accelerate the aging of your skin.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.570
But in general, how you look,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.500
and no one's ever died from gray hair,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.400
but overall you can get a sense

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.570
just from the ability of
skin to hold itself up,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.520
how thin it is, the number of wrinkles.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.385
A great paper just came out that said

00:17:07.385 --> 00:17:10.110
that an AI System looking at the face

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.290
could very accurately
predict someone's age.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.730
- Very interesting.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.970
So I started off in
developmental neurobiology.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.167
So one of the things
that I learned early on

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:22.670
that I still believe wholeheartedly

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.670
is that development doesn't
stop at age 12 or 15 or even 25

00:17:28.926 --> 00:17:33.363
that your entire life is
one long developmental arc.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.250
So in thinking about different portions

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.670
of that developmental arc,
the early portion of infancy,

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.960
and especially puberty, seem
like especially rapid stages

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.110
of aging.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.800
And I know we normally
look at babies and children

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.000
and kids in puberty, and we
think, oh, they're so vital,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.890
they're so young.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.180
And yet the way you describe
these changes in the epigenome

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.130
and the way you have
framed aging as a disease

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:06.130
leads me to ask are periods
of immense vitality,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:11.400
the same periods when we're aging faster.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.733
- Yes, yes.

00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:15.120
And this is something
I've never talked about,

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.953
at least not publicly.

00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:18.130
So this is a really good question.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.340
So those chemicals we can measure,

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.750
it's also known as the Horvath's clock.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.950
It's the biological clock,

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.360
it's separate from your chronological age.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.440
So actually what I didn't mention

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.640
is that when the AI looked
at the faces of those people,

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.520
they could predict their
biological age, their internal age.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.860
So your skin represents the
age of your organs as well.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.590
And the people that look after themselves,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.028
we can talk about how to do that later.

00:18:40.028 --> 00:18:42.601
But there are some people
that are 10, 20 years younger

00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:46.110
than other people biologically

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.510
and it turns out if you
measure that clock from birth

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.370
or even before birth,
if you look at animals,

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.500
there's a massive increase
in age, based on that clock,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.010
early in life.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.510
So you're right, so that's
a really important point,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.490
that you have accelerated aging

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.130
during the first few years of life,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.550
and then it goes linear
towards the rest of your life.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.030
But there's another interesting
thing that you brought up,

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.780
which is that we're finding that the genes

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.080
that get messed up, that get scratched

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.672
that are leading to aging

00:19:12.672 --> 00:19:15.550
are those early developmental genes.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.040
They come on late in life
and just mess up the system

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.880
and they seem to be
particularly susceptible

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.530
to those scratches.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.290
So what's causing the scratches?

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.950
Well, we know of a couple
of things in my lab,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.910
we figured out.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.728
One is broken chromosomes, DNA damage,

00:19:29.728 --> 00:19:31.998
particularly cuts to the DNA breaks.

00:19:31.998 --> 00:19:35.370
So if you have an x-ray or a cosmic ray,

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.750
or even if you go out in the sun

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.870
and you'll get your broken chromosomes

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.610
that accelerates the unwinding
of those beautiful DNA loops

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:44.460
that I mentioned.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.900
We can actually do this to a mouse.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.240
We can accelerate that process
and we get an old mouse,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.720
50% older, and it has
this bent spine kyphosis.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.880
it has gray hair, it's organs are old.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.700
So we now can control aging,
the forwards direction.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.271
The other thing that accelerates aging

00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:05.220
is massive cell damage or stress.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.150
So we pinched nerves and we
saw that their aging process

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.780
was accelerated as well.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.130
- Incredible, this is more
of an anecdotal phenomenon.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.810
It is an anecdotal phenomenon,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.450
but at this experience
of in junior high school,

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.710
going home for a summer and you come back

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.590
and then high school in the US

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.120
usually starts eighth or ninth grade,

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.470
or grade eight or grade
nine for you Canadians.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.620
And then some of the kids,

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.630
like they grew beards over the summer,

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.830
or they completely matured
quickly over the summer.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.580
Do you think there's any reason to believe

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.950
that rates of entry
into and through puberty

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.300
can predict overall rates of aging?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.300
In other words, if a kid
is a slow burner, right?

00:20:52.892 --> 00:20:57.070
They basically acquire
the traits of puberty

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.040
slowly over many years.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.447
Can we make some course prediction

00:21:01.447 --> 00:21:03.780
that they are going to live a long time

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.770
versus a kid that goes home for the summer

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.420
and comes back a completely
different organism

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.830
or appearing to be a
completely different organism.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.750
Like they basically age
very quickly in the summer.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.940
Does that mean they're
aging very quickly overall?

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.810
- Well, yeah, I don't
want to scare anybody.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.880
- Sure.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.870
- That there are studies that show

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.760
that the slower you take to
develop it also is predictive

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.510
of having a longer, healthier life.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.130
And it may have something
to do with growth hormone.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.445
We know that growth hormone is pro-aging.

00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:37.310
Anyone who's taking growth
hormone, pay attention.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.979
- Just look at someone
who's taking growth hormone.

00:21:38.979 --> 00:21:39.880
- Yeah.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.990
- They often will acquire these
characteristics of vitality,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.810
like improved a smoothness of skin,

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.130
but their whole body shape changes often.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.708
- Yeah, I mean you'll feel better

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:50.280
for a short amount of time.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.140
You'll build up muscle, you feel great,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.940
but it's like burning
your candle at both ends.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.820
Ultimately, if you want to live longer,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.235
you want less of that.

00:21:58.235 --> 00:22:00.660
And the animals that have been generated

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.000
and mutants that have low growth hormone,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.690
or sometimes these are dwarfs,
they live the longest by far.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.070
A guy in my lab, Michael Bankowski,

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.890
he had the longest lived mouse,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.380
a mouse typically lives
about two and a bit years.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.450
He had a mouse that lived five years

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.020
and he gave it chloric
restriction, so fasting,

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.573
combined with one of
these dwarf mutations,

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:23.633
low growth hormone, I
think he called it Yoda.

00:22:25.336 --> 00:22:27.630
You look at who lives the longest,

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.543
it's the really small people.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.500
This is a bit anecdotal,

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.410
but it sounds like it might be true,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.180
is that the people who
played the munchkins

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.600
in the Wizard of Oz, many
of them went on to live

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.970
into their nineties and beyond.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.803
- Really?

00:22:40.803 --> 00:22:41.636
- Yeah.

00:22:41.636 --> 00:22:42.469
- Huh, amazing.

00:22:42.469 --> 00:22:45.010
- And are there are some
Lauren dwarfs as well?

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.210
There are dwarf mutations in South America

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.420
and they seem to be protected

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.260
against many of the diseases of aging.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.740
You barely ever see heart disease

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.400
or cancer in these families.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.620
- So I having owned a
very large dog breed,

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.350
a bulldog Mastiff who lived
a long life for a bulldog,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.285
11 years, but there are
many dogs that will live

00:23:05.285 --> 00:23:08.900
12, 16 years that are smaller dogs.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.890
Can we say that there's
a direct relationship

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.890
between body size and
longevity or duration of life?

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.250
- Well, there is, but that
doesn't mean that you're a slave

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.260
to your early epigenome
nor have to your genome.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.250
The good news is that
the epigenome can change.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.170
Those loops and structures can be modified

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.870
by how you live your life.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.630
And so if you're born tall and I wasn't,

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.523
and I wished at the time I did grow,

00:23:37.414 --> 00:23:38.880
but no matter what size you are,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.010
you can have a bigger impact on your life

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.930
than anything your genes give you.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.970
80% is epigenetic not genetic.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.260
- So let's talk about some of
the things that people can do.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.440
And I've kind of batch
these into categories

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.246
rather than just diving right
into actionable protocols.

00:23:56.246 --> 00:24:01.246
So the first one relates to
food, blood sugar, insulin.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.166
This is something I hear a lot about,

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.836
that fasting is good for us,

00:24:06.836 --> 00:24:10.113
but rarely do I hear why it's good for us.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.900
One of the reasons I'm
excited to talk to you today

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.214
is because I want to drill
into the details of this

00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:17.620
because I think
understanding the mechanism

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.567
will allow people to make better choices

00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:22.640
and not simply to just
decide whether or not

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.110
they're going to fast or not fast,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.640
or how long they're going to fast,

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.987
I think should be dictated
by someone understanding

00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:28.205
of the mechanism.

00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:32.950
So why is it that having
elevated blood sugar,

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.159
glucose and insulin ages us more quickly

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:40.840
and or why is it that having
periods of time each day

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.230
or perhaps longer can extend our lifespan?

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.390
- Well, let's start with what
I think was a big mistake

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:52.180
was the idea that people
should never be hungry.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.013
We live in a world now

00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:55.490
where there's at least three meals a day,

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.920
and then we've got companies
selling bars and snacks

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.900
in between.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.963
So the feeling of hunger,

00:25:00.963 --> 00:25:03.920
some people never experienced
hunger in their whole lives.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.933
It's really, really bad for them.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.740
It was based, I believe
on the 20th century view

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.040
that you don't want to
stress out the pancreas

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.580
and you try to keep insulin
levels pretty steady

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.430
and not have this fluctuation.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.919
What we actually found,
my colleagues and I,

00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:25.326
across this field of longevity

00:25:25.326 --> 00:25:27.828
is that when you look
at first of all animals,

00:25:27.828 --> 00:25:31.470
whether it's a dog or a mouse or a monkey,

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.770
the ones that live the
longest by far 30% longer

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.120
and stay healthy are the ones
that don't eat all the time

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.099
actually was first discovered back

00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:44.450
in the early 20th century,
but people ignored it.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.950
And then it was rediscovered in the 1930s,

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.849
Claude McKay did Clark restriction.

00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:51.950
He put cellulose in the food of rats,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.580
so they couldn't get as many
calories even though they ate.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.100
And those rats lived 30% longer,

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.287
but then it went away
and then it came back

00:25:59.287 --> 00:26:01.680
in the 2000's in a big way,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.660
when a couple of things happened,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.530
one is that my lab and others showed

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.830
that there were longevity
genes in the body

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.960
that come on and protect
us from aging and disease.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.470
The group of genes that I
work on are called sirtuins

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.430
there's seven of them.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.620
And we show it in 2005 in a science paper,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.330
that if you have low levels of insulin

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.780
and another molecule called
insulin like growth factor,

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.800
those low levels turn
on the longevity genes.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.753
One of them that's really
important is called SIRT1.

00:26:31.753 --> 00:26:35.350
But by having high levels
of insulin all day,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.240
being fed, means your longevity
genes are not switched on.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.510
So you're falling apart, your
epigenome, your information,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.130
that keeps your cells
functioning over time,

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.963
just degrades quick.

00:26:44.963 --> 00:26:49.410
Your clock is ticking
faster by always being fed.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.710
Okay.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.260
The other thing that I
think might be happening

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.860
by always having food around

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.310
is that it's not allowing the
cell to have periods of rest

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.310
and re-establish the epigenome.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.663
And so it also is accelerating
in that direction.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.090
There's plenty of other reasons as well,

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.070
that are not as profound,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:14.270
such as having low levels
of glucose in your body

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.030
will trigger your major
muscles in your brain

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.670
to become more sensitive to insulin

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.650
and suck the glucose
out of your bloodstream,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.740
which is very good.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.550
You don't want to have glucose
flowing around too much,

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.900
and that will ward off type two diabetes.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.749
- So hunger of course is
associated with low blood glucose

00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:34.120
and low insulin.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.200
Do you think there's anything

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.100
about the subjective
experience of hunger itself

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.300
that could be beneficial for longevity?

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.193
- Yeah, I do,

00:27:43.604 --> 00:27:46.770
though you get used to
the feeling of not eating,

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.230
so I'm kind of screwed that way.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.510
- It's like cold water,
you eventually adapt.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.557
- You get used to it, unfortunately,

00:27:53.557 --> 00:27:55.870
but there are some studies
that are being done

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.500
at the National Institutes of Health

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.810
that are able to simulate
the effect of hunger,

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.470
but still provide the calories.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.760
And it's looking like
there's a small component

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.880
that's due to hunger, but most of it,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.300
actually, is because
you've got these periods

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.880
of not being fed and then the body

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.180
turns on these defensive genes.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.420
There's a really interesting experiment

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.280
that was published maybe
a couple of years ago

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.701
by Rafael de Cabo down at the NIH.

00:28:19.701 --> 00:28:22.120
What he did was he took over 10,000 mice

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.678
and gave them different combinations

00:28:23.678 --> 00:28:26.780
of fat, carbohydrate, protein.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.900
And he was trying to figure out

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.681
what was the best combination.

00:28:29.681 --> 00:28:32.068
And then you also cleverly had a group.

00:28:32.068 --> 00:28:35.100
Well, two groups, one
that was fed all the time

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.907
or ate as much as they wanted

00:28:36.907 --> 00:28:40.530
and the other group was only
given food for an hour a day.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.390
And it turns out they ate

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.110
roughly the same amount of calories,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.867
'cause of course in an hour
they're stuffing their faces.

00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:49.830
It turns out it didn't matter
what diet he gave them,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.650
it was only the group that
ate within that window

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.533
that lived longer and dramatically longer.

00:28:53.533 --> 00:28:55.668
So my conclusion is,

00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:58.070
and mice are very similar
to us, metabolically,

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.500
I think that tells us that
it's not as important,

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.900
what you eat, it's when
you eat during the day.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.300
- What is the protocol

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.883
that people can extrapolate from that?

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.130
Or maybe I should just ask you,

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.370
what is your protocol for when to eat

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.130
and when to avoid food?

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.650
Do you fast, do you ever
fast, longer than 24 hours?

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.530
What do you do?

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.287
And what do you think is
a good jumping off place

00:29:21.287 --> 00:29:23.980
if people want to explore
this as a protocol?

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.030
- Well, if there's one thing I could say,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.740
I would say definitely
try to skip a meal a day,

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.770
that's the best thing.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.080
- Does it matter which meal

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.160
or they're essentially equivalent?

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.070
- Well, as long as it's at the end

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.220
or the beginning of the day,

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.700
because then you add
that to the sleep period

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.320
where you're hopefully not eating.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.730
- I think that that's an excellent point.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.080
I realized it's a simple one,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.070
but I think it's an excellent one

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.860
'cause I think one of
the things that people

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.970
struggle with the most
is knowing when and how

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.840
to initiate this so-called
intermittent and fasting.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.820
And the middle of the day
obviously is not tacked

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.550
to the sleep cycle in the same way.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:59.095
So it's much harder as
well for many people.

00:29:59.095 --> 00:30:01.640
- Yeah, well, I'll tell you what I do.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.990
I skip breakfast, I have a
tiny bit of yogurt or olive oil

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.660
because the supplements I have
need to be dissolved in it.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.740
And then I go throughout the whole day,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.870
as I'm doing right now, here
with this glass of water here,

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.930
I'm just keeping myself
filled with liquids.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.403
And so I don't feel hungry,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.616
be aware that the first
two to three weeks,

00:30:20.616 --> 00:30:22.860
when you try that you will feel hungry

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.083
and you also have a habit of wanting

00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:26.010
just to chew on something

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:27.860
that there's a lot of
physical parts to it,

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.210
but try to make it through
the first three weeks

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.230
and do without breakfast
or do without dinner

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.900
and you'll get through it.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.320
And I did that most for
most of my life, actually,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.720
mainly because I wasn't
hungry in the morning.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.450
Some people are very hungry in the morning

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.230
and they may want to consider
skipping dinner instead,

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.110
but I will go throughout the whole day.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.777
I don't get the crashes
of the high glucose

00:30:49.777 --> 00:30:52.650
and the low glucose that anyone who goes,

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.210
oh man, it's three O'clock,
I'm going to need a sleep.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.430
If you do what I do,

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.165
you will not experience that anymore

00:30:58.165 --> 00:30:59.740
because what my body does

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.930
is it regulates blood
sugar levels naturally.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.130
My liver is putting out
glucose when it needs to,

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.720
and it's very steady
and gives me pure focus

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.576
throughout the day.

00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:10.100
And I don't have to even
have to think about lunch,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.780
I'm just powering through.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.640
At dinner, I mean, I love
food as much as anybody.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.040
So I will eat a regular,
pretty healthy meal.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.780
I'll try to eat mostly
vegetables, I can eat some fish,

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.020
some shrimp, I rarely will eat a steak.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.530
In fact, my microbiome is
so adapted to my diet now,

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.150
if I eat a steak, it will
not get digested very well.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.840
I'll feel terrible.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.797
- If I don't eat a steak, I feel terrible.

00:31:35.797 --> 00:31:36.630
[David laughs]

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.370
- Argentine lineage, but
we can talk about that

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.203
some other time.

00:31:40.203 --> 00:31:41.990
- Well, everybody's different,
that's the other thing.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.920
What works for me may
not be perfect for you

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.720
and we do have to measure
things to know what's working.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.580
I rarely eat dessert, I
gave up dessert and sugar

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.480
when I turned 40 and occasionally

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.630
I'll steal a bit of dessert

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.890
'cause it doesn't hurt
if you steal it, right.?

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.490
But other than that I avoid sugar,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.040
which includes simple carbohydrates,
bread, I try to avoid,

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.461
I've actually noticed,
this is just a side note.

00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:10.290
I used to get buildup
of plaque pretty easily

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.123
and every time I went to the dentist,

00:32:11.123 --> 00:32:12.270
they'd have to scrape it off.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.650
And I even bought tools to scrape it off.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.810
'cause it was driving me nuts.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.050
I don't get pluck anymore

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.631
and I think it's because of my diet.

00:32:18.631 --> 00:32:20.400
I don't have those sugars in my mouth

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.410
that the bacteria feed on

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.703
and then form the biofilm on the teeth.

00:32:23.703 --> 00:32:25.383
Much better breath, by the way.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.440
- That's a benefit.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.590
Should you ever fast longer than this.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.563
It sounds if you go to bed,

00:32:34.563 --> 00:32:36.310
well, you used to tend to stay up late.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.760
I know because I get texts from you

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.190
at like two in the morning my time,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.900
which means you're out very
late and up early as well.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.040
But assuming that people go to sleep

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.982
sometime around 1130 or
12, plus or minus an hour

00:32:49.982 --> 00:32:52.240
and wake up sometime around 7:00 AM

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.240
plus or minus 90 minutes,
you're eating more or less on.

00:32:57.262 --> 00:33:00.605
It sounds something like
a 20 hours of fasting,

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:03.047
four hours of eating
or 16 hours of fasting

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:06.020
and eight hours of food intake, et cetera.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.920
But do you ever do longer fast,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.460
like 48 hours or 72
hours a week long, fast?

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.573
- Occasionally I do.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.390
So my typical day I would only
eat within a two hour window.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.457
Just usually I'm either eating out or.

00:33:18.457 --> 00:33:20.240
- 'Cause you're 22 too.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.582
- Yeah, but I love well.

00:33:22.582 --> 00:33:24.707
- And if you exercise,
do you feel like you,

00:33:24.707 --> 00:33:27.890
then you just power through
and maintain that fasted state?

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.854
- Absolutely, I can exercise

00:33:28.854 --> 00:33:30.690
and now I've already so used to it.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.590
I don't feel like I need food
after exercising, I used to.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.403
But have I gone longer?

00:33:36.403 --> 00:33:38.030
Yes, but not very often.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.543
I find it quite difficult
to go more than 24 hours.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.960
But when I do it, maybe it's once a month,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.130
I'll go for two days after
two and actually even better,

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.020
if you go for three days without eating,

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:55.020
it kicks in even greater
longevity benefits.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.830
So there's a system called
the autophagy system,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.189
which digests old and
misfolded proteins in the body.

00:34:01.189 --> 00:34:02.930
And there's a natural cleansing

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.920
that happens when you're hungry.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.681
Macroautophagy its name is
but a good friend of mine,

00:34:07.681 --> 00:34:11.200
Ana Maria Cuervo at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.710
discovered a deep cleanse

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.930
called the chaperone mediated autophagy,

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.210
which kicks in day two, day three,

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.287
which really gets rid
of the deep proteins.

00:34:21.287 --> 00:34:24.530
And what excites me is you
just put out a big paper

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.910
that said, if you trigger
this process in an old mouse,

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:31.133
it lives 35% longer.

00:34:31.133 --> 00:34:31.966
- [Andrew] Wow.

00:34:31.966 --> 00:34:32.970
- Yeah, so it's a big deal.

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.600
If I could go longer, I would.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.450
But I just find that with my lifestyle

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:41.270
and I'm going always
day, 110% I need to eat

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.980
at least once a day unfortunately.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.014
- One more practical question
then a mechanistic question

00:34:45.014 --> 00:34:47.220
related to this, the practical question

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.520
is when you are fasting,
regardless of how long,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.540
I know you're ingesting fluids like water

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.800
and presumably some caffeine
I heard you had several

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.643
or more espresso today,
which is impressive,

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.840
but are you also ingesting electrolytes?

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.570
Like I know some people get lightheaded,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.850
they start to feel shaky when they fast.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.530
And that the addition
of sodium to their water

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.807
or potassium magnesium is something

00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:16.110
that's becoming a little more invoke now.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.180
Is that something that you do

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.450
or that you see a need for people to do?

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.261
- Well, it makes sense, but I
haven't had a need to do it.

00:35:23.261 --> 00:35:26.383
So I don't, I drink tea
during the day and coffee

00:35:26.383 --> 00:35:29.136
when I'm first awake and
I don't get the shakes.

00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:31.853
So I don't fix what's not broken.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.935
And I do add things to my protocol

00:35:34.935 --> 00:35:38.330
that I think will improve
me and avoid those things

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.330
of course that wont.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.403
But yeah, because I
don't have a need for it,

00:35:42.403 --> 00:35:43.236
I don't try it.

00:35:43.236 --> 00:35:44.110
But it does make sense,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.742
especially if you've had a
big night the night before,

00:35:46.742 --> 00:35:49.110
you'd probably want to
supplement with that.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.070
But I think there's fair
amount of good stuff

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.460
in tea and coffee as it is.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.343
- Okay, so then the
mechanistic question is,

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.930
you've told us that there's ample evidence

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.810
that keeping your blood sugar
low for a period of time

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.220
is 24 hours, can help
trigger some of these pro

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.400
longevity anti-aging mechanisms.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.950
And that extending them
out two or three days

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.740
can trigger yet additional
mechanisms of gobbling up

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.210
of dead cells and things of that sort.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:25.830
How is it that blood glucose
triggers these mechanisms?

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.380
Because we've said, okay, remove glucose

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.160
and things get better.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.220
You've talked before maybe
we could talk more now

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.820
about some of the underlying
cellar and genetic mechanisms,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.861
things like this are sirtuins,

00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:37.696
but how our glucose in the sirtuins

00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:40.283
actually tethered to one
another mechanistically.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.664
- There's a really good question,

00:36:42.664 --> 00:36:47.400
that proves you're a scientist
or a world-leading one.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.570
So what we've now know is
that these longevity pathways,

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.300
we call them these longevity
genes, talk to each other.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.133
And we used to say,

00:36:55.133 --> 00:36:56.910
oh, my longevity genes is
more important than yours.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.220
It was ridiculous.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.110
'Cause they're all talking to each other,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.590
you pull one lever and
the other one moves.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.570
And the way to think of it is
that there are systems set up

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.490
to detect what you're eating.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.490
So the sirtuins will mainly
respond to sugar and insulin.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.970
And then there's this
other system called mTOR,

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.070
which is sensing how much
protein or amino acids

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.510
are coming into your body.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.520
And they talk to each other,

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.550
we can pull one and affect
the other and vice versa.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.550
But together when you're fasting,

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:28.840
you'll get the sirtuin
activation, which is good for you.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.680
And you'll also through
lack of amino acids,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.854
particularly three of them,
leucine, lysine and valine.

00:37:34.854 --> 00:37:38.273
The body will down-regulate
mTOR and it's that up sirtuin,

00:37:38.273 --> 00:37:41.470
down MTOR that is hugely beneficial

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.360
and turns on all of the body's defenses,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.550
the pro chewing up the old proteins,

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.210
improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us more energy,

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.580
repairing cells, all of that.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.937
And so these two pathways, I think,

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:55.240
are the most important for longevity.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.451
- So interesting, you mentioned leucine,

00:37:57.451 --> 00:38:01.756
within the resistance training
slash body building slash

00:38:01.756 --> 00:38:02.940
fitness community.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.490
Leucine gets a lot of attention

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.570
because there are long-standing debates

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.830
about how much protein one needs per day

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.750
and how much you want and
can assimilate at each meal.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:15.295
It makes for many YouTube videos
and not much else, frankly.

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:18.621
However, it's clear that
because of leucine's effects

00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:22.590
on the mTOR pathway, that
there are many people,

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.010
not just people in these
particular fitness communities

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.872
that are actively trying
to ingest more leucine

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:32.700
on a regular basis in order
to maximize their wellness

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.950
and fitness and in some
cases muscle growth

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.780
but also just wellness.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.456
But what I interpret your
last statement to mean

00:38:39.456 --> 00:38:43.010
is that leucine, because
it triggers seller growth

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:47.457
is actually pro aging in
some sense, is that right?

00:38:47.457 --> 00:38:50.151
- Well, it could be that's
what the evidence suggests.

00:38:50.151 --> 00:38:52.300
And again it goes back to the debate.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.126
Should you supplement with
growth hormone or testosterone?

00:38:56.126 --> 00:39:00.150
All of these activities will
give you immediate benefits.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.120
You'll bulk up more.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.380
You'll feel better immediately,

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.200
but based on the research,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.580
it's at the expense of long-term health.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.220
So my view of longevity,

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.190
the way I treat my body is
I don't burn both candles.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.210
I have one end of the candle lit,

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.013
I'm very careful I don't blow on it,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.470
but I also do enough exercise

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.470
that I'm building up my
muscle, but I'm not huge.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.180
Anyone who's seen me,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.320
knows that I'm not a
professional bodybuilder,

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.690
but I tried to actually, here's the key.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.088
And I haven't said this
publicly, that I can remember.

00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:37.670
I pulse things so that
I get periods of fasting

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.473
and then I eat, then I take a supplement,

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.040
then I fast, then I exercise

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.650
and I'm taking the supplements

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.410
and eating in the right timing

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.950
to allow me to build up muscle sometimes

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.350
because you can't just expect
to take something constantly

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.570
and do something
constantly for it to work.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.670
And that's why it's
taken me about 15 years

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:00.940
to develop my protocol.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.900
And there's a lot of subtlety to it.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.625
- Yeah, it sounds like a
very rational protocol.

00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:07.800
Does the name Ori Hofmekler
mean anything to you?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.633
- No.

00:40:08.633 --> 00:40:12.350
- Okay, just briefly, I
discovered Ori Hofmekler

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:16.840
about 15 years ago, he was
a in Israeli special forces.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.130
He's now got to be close to 70.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.223
Forgive me Ori, if that
number is inflated.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.140
He wrote a book called 'The Warrior Diet',

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.360
which got very little
attention at the time.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.890
But what he said was when he
was in Israeli special forces,

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:34.340
they rarely ate more than once per day.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.730
And sometimes once every
second or third day.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.490
And this is a guy who maintains

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:43.490
incredible physical stature,
he's very lean, very strong

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.080
and very vital at, I
wouldn't say an advanced age,

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.110
but he's getting up there

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.550
and he just seems to be
getting better and better.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.060
Ori Hofmekler was the person
who essentially founded,

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.690
if you will, although
our ancestors founded,

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.400
to be completely fair,

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.470
the so-called intermittent fasting diet.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:04.780
He called it the warrior diet

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.810
and this book didn't get much attention.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:08.760
But one of the things that you just said

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.430
really reminded me of Ori.

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.200
I sat down with him, I
actually went to his home

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.300
and sat down with him and he
said, fasting is wonderful

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.180
but these pulses where
you nourish the body

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.930
or even slightly over nourish the body

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.210
provided they aren't too frequent,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.970
have a tremendous effect on vitality.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.832
And so I want to use
that as kind of a segue

00:41:27.832 --> 00:41:32.832
to address this issue of
vitality versus longevity,

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.480
because here you're telling me

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.201
and certainly the evidence supports

00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:40.246
that growth hormone will make
you feel better and younger

00:41:40.246 --> 00:41:43.150
taking testosterone or estrogen,
we should probably say.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.090
There are women who take
hormone therapies later in life

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:47.970
who take estrogen,

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.600
they experience a strong
increase in vitality

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.470
if it's done correctly, but
there is an effect of aging,

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.530
the body more rapidly,

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.420
it's sort of a second puberty if you will,

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.670
but this idea of restriction
and then pulsing,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.730
not necessarily feast and famine,

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:08.730
but certainly famine and
feast in lowercase letters,

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.000
there really seems to
be something about that.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.816
So at a cellular level,

00:42:13.816 --> 00:42:16.950
we'd kind of go back to
mTOR and the sirtuins.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:20.510
How do you think that the
cells might be reacting

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.510
to this kind of lowercased
feast and upper case famine

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.140
type protocol?

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:33.140
- Right, well, the pulsing, I
think is what you want to do

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.713
is to get the cells to
be perceiving adversity.

00:42:39.038 --> 00:42:40.827
Okay, 'cause our modern
life we're sitting around,

00:42:40.827 --> 00:42:45.700
we're eating too much,
we're not exercising.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.090
Our cells respond.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:49.490
They go, hey, everything's
cool, no problem.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.530
And they become relaxed and their own turn

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.240
on their defenses and we age rapidly.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.680
We can see it in the clock.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.790
People who exercise and eat less,

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.993
have a slower ticking clock, it's a fact.

00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:03.181
But my protocol is
different than most people's

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:05.139
because I am pulsing it.

00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:07.310
Now, first of all, let's get to,

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.230
why did I even think
that might be possible?

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.475
'Cause I didn't read the warrior diet.

00:43:11.475 --> 00:43:15.700
What I found in my research was that

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.260
if we gave resveratrol on
this red wine molecule,

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.837
that became well known in the 2000's.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.150
If we gave it to mice,
their whole lifespan,

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.400
they were protected
against a high-fat diet,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.560
which we call the Western diet.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.175
They had lean organs.

00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:33.870
They live slightly longer, but not a lot.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:37.910
And if we gave them a high-fat
diet without resveratrol,

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.520
they actually lived a lot shorter.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.450
So it resveratrol protected
them against the high-fat diet.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.283
We gave it to them on a normal diet,

00:43:44.283 --> 00:43:46.500
they just ate it when they wanted,

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.103
and there wasn't much effect.

00:43:48.103 --> 00:43:49.910
This is what's not known though

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.467
it's in a supplemental data of the paper

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:53.591
that nobody ever reads.

00:43:53.591 --> 00:43:57.070
The mice that were given
resveratrol every second day

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.973
on a normal diet live dramatically longer

00:43:59.973 --> 00:44:01.670
than any other group.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.540
- [Andrew] Interesting.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.750
- So people out there, my
critics say, resveratrol

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.390
didn't extend the lifespan
of mice on a normal diet.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.580
Therefore it's not aging,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.730
it's just protecting
against a high-fat diet.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.220
Well, look at the
supplemental data, please.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.880
If you give it to the
mice every other day,

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.970
we had mice living over three years.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.940
- Wow, that's a long time,
I have got many, many mice

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.689
in my owner ownership
at my lab at Stanford

00:44:26.689 --> 00:44:29.510
and that's a very long life for a mouse.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.580
- It was, by far.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.950
And so it was a long life span extension.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.010
And what that told me is that probably,

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.350
you don't want to be taking
a supplement every day.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.200
You can take it either every other day

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.720
or give your body a rest.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.500
And I do the same with my meals,

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.830
I rest during the day and then
I give a nutritious dinner

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.990
to my body and then give it
a rest, same with exercise.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.140
And then I try to time it
because there are times

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.413
when I'm taking the drug
Metformin, which mimics low energy.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.260
For those of you who don't know,

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.954
Metformin is a drug given
to type two diabetics

00:45:01.954 --> 00:45:04.041
to bring down their blood sugar levels.

00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:06.139
But it's been found that
looking at tens of thousands

00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:08.460
of veterans and all those,

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.120
that those two type two diabetics

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.953
live longer than people

00:45:10.953 --> 00:45:12.430
that don't even get type two diabetes.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.950
So it's a longevity drug,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.670
right now you have to get it
from your doctor in the US,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.970
in most of the countries
you can just get it

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.070
over the counter and you protected.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:28.070
It looks like, based on
epidemiological data, cancer,

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.223
heart disease for LT.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.863
What else?

00:45:31.863 --> 00:45:33.490
Dementia.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.630
So I take Metformin.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:35.463
- In addition,

00:45:35.463 --> 00:45:37.990
you take Metformin end
fast fasting each day.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:39.990
So when do you take it
relative to the fasting?

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.253
- Yeah, I always take
Metformin in the morning,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.440
along with the resveratrol,
because for a number of reasons,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.810
but mainly because my body responds better

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.453
and I've been measuring
my body for 12, 13 years.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.292
But here's the thing, if I'm
going to exercise that day,

00:45:59.292 --> 00:46:02.060
I will skip the Metformin.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.460
And a lot of people who do pay attention

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.210
to this kind of thing,

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.030
think that they should
stop taking Metformin

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.530
'cause they're never going to get muscle,

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.380
or it's going to affect their
ability to build up muscle.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.700
But that's not true, what
Metformin does to you,

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.760
it actually just reduces
your ability to have stamina

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.326
because it's inhibiting your
body's ability to make energy.

00:46:24.326 --> 00:46:26.750
And so what happens is
when you're on Metformin,

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.265
you do fewer reps.

00:46:28.265 --> 00:46:29.470
But guess what?

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:32.490
Those muscles that you
do build up on Metformin,

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.120
have the same strength and
have much lower inflammation

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.311
and other markers of aging.

00:46:37.311 --> 00:46:41.930
You just won't have that
extra 5% size of muscles.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.260
So if you want large muscles,

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.970
don't take Metformin and you'll be fine

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.363
during your exercise.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.770
But for me, I'm not trying to get giant.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.900
I want strong muscles
and I want to live longer

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.950
and healthier.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:58.950
So I just try to time it
so that I get the most reps

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.383
out of my exercise regime,

00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:04.890
but sometimes in scientific literature,

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.351
it's worth bringing this up.

00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:09.240
If there's a 5% difference in a graph,

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.430
then either the press release
or some reporter will say,

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.050
oh my goodness, big difference,

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.890
5% contact Metformin during exercise.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:19.060
That's the headline.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.570
And then you go in and
it's barely significant.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.670
And the graph is distorted
because they've changed

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.010
the axes to make it look bigger.

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.210
And now it's become a myth

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.766
that Metformin greatly inhibits
our ability to exercise,

00:47:30.766 --> 00:47:33.824
which is not true, but in
an abundance of caution,

00:47:33.824 --> 00:47:36.991
I skipped my Metformin on
days I'm going exercise.

00:47:36.991 --> 00:47:38.370
And not only that,

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.620
I'm one of the 20% of people

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.650
that has a stomach sensitivity to it.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:43.953
So if I'm not feeling great that day,

00:47:43.953 --> 00:47:45.580
I don't take it either.

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.240
- You mentioned Metformin is available

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.126
only by prescription from a
doctor, at least in the US.

00:47:50.126 --> 00:47:53.440
Berberine is a substance
that comes from Tree Barco.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.283
I also learned about
many years ago from Ori.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.350
He said, if ever, I'm going to overeat

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.740
like a Thanksgiving meal or something,

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.850
I take berberine, those were his words.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.300
And I tried it and what's
remarkable about berberine

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.590
is that you can eat
enormous quantities of food

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:12.420
and not feel as if you've eaten
enormous quantities of food.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.396
I'm not necessarily
recommending people do this.

00:48:14.396 --> 00:48:18.800
But what I noticed was
if I took berberine,

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.240
which my understanding is
it works very similarly

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.407
to Metformin where some
of the AMPK pathway

00:48:23.407 --> 00:48:25.804
and the mTOR pathway, et cetera,

00:48:25.804 --> 00:48:29.920
that if I didn't ingest food
in particular carbohydrates,

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.110
I would feel a little dizzy
and kind of get a headache,

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.323
like almost hypoglycemic.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.600
What are your thoughts on berberine

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.880
as an alternative to Metformin?

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.380
And are there any cautionary notes?

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.810
Obviously people should
talk to their doctor

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:45.260
before adding or subtracting
anything from their life,

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.410
including breath order,
anything that comes up,

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.070
but with all of that set aside,

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.398
what are your thoughts about berberine

00:48:53.398 --> 00:48:57.800
and timing of low blood sugar
and these sorts of things?

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.500
- Right, well, before I
had access to Metformin,

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.490
I was taking berberine.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.223
It's often known as the
poor man's Metformin.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.870
- He just called me poor.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.169
- Women can take it too.

00:49:08.169 --> 00:49:11.490
So the thing with berberine
and we started it in my lab,

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:15.110
it is effective at boosting
energetics in the body,

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.113
just like AMPK and Metformin does.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.830
And we've actually given
it to rats and mice

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.140
and seen that they are very healthy,

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.055
especially on a high-fat diet.

00:49:25.055 --> 00:49:27.720
So I think it's likely to be good.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.700
There are some human studies that exist,

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.670
clinical trials showing

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.870
that it increases insulin sensitivity.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.003
You have to take high doses.

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.730
- Which is a good thing, right?

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:36.780
I think when people hear
insulin sensitivity,

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.190
sometimes people think,
oh, well that's bad, right?

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.250
No, but you want your cells
to be insulin sensitive.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.510
You don't want a lot of
blood sugar floating around

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.530
that can't be sequestered into cells.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:49.220
- Exactly, so this is
anti type two diabetes.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.591
And so that this berberine
does have wonderful effects

00:49:52.591 --> 00:49:55.858
on the metabolism of animals
and in some clinical trials

00:49:55.858 --> 00:49:58.500
on dozens of people that's being tested.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.200
Now, there's one cautionary
tale, which just came up,

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.520
Caenorhabditis lab
published that berberine

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.143
reduced the lifespan of worms,

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:09.817
but I'm not sure worms
trump human clinical trials

00:50:09.817 --> 00:50:10.933
at this point.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:12.923
- Not in my opinion,

00:50:12.923 --> 00:50:15.044
no disrespect to my C. elegans colleagues

00:50:15.044 --> 00:50:17.130
or rather my colleagues that work on C.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.980
- Yeah, well, what I like to do

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.240
is to give all the information,

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.010
people can decide what they want,

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.859
but I would say based on the worm data,

00:50:23.859 --> 00:50:25.617
I wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:25.617 --> 00:50:27.260
And I think berberine has been shown

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.490
to be really safe in humans.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:30.581
- You mentioned resveratrol,

00:50:30.581 --> 00:50:33.031
think now would be a great time
to talk a little bit about,

00:50:33.031 --> 00:50:37.088
protocols for resveratrol,
great seed extract, et cetera.

00:50:37.088 --> 00:50:40.260
Let's start with the obvious
one that I know you get a lot,

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.090
but for the record, can't
I just drink red wine

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:48.020
and get enough resveratrol, David.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.246
- You can try, you need to
drink about 200 glasses a day.

00:50:52.246 --> 00:50:54.090
- I'm sure it's been tried.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:58.060
- There are some, and I drink
a glass of red wine a day

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:01.400
if I get the chance,
but any more than that,

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.380
it's a lot of calories and
your liver will get fatty

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.213
and it's all bad.

00:51:04.213 --> 00:51:05.650
So, I mean, realistically,

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:08.220
you can only get the thousand milligrams

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:13.220
that I take a day from a
supplement that's pure.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.246
Now there are a lot of
people selling resveratrol.

00:51:14.246 --> 00:51:19.110
If it's not light gray or
white in color, throw it away.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:22.990
The brown stuff has gone
bad or is contaminated.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:26.350
And the contaminated stuff
beware it'll cause diarrhea.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.710
But regular resveratrol
should not do that.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.153
- So a thousand milligrams
per day is what you do.

00:51:31.153 --> 00:51:34.840
- Yeah and I had for about 15 years now.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.420
And you ingest that with
some fatty substance,

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.790
like olive oil or yogurt, is that right?

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.880
- Yeah, you have to, and other supplements

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.637
of course it's in curcumin.

00:51:44.637 --> 00:51:45.993
These are crunchy things,

00:51:45.993 --> 00:51:47.773
that is not going to get through your gut.

00:51:47.773 --> 00:51:49.370
And I'm not just making this up.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:53.090
I always base my statements
on human studies.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.440
So we've done a lot of
studies on resveratrol

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.570
as have others since,
and we know that from,

00:51:58.570 --> 00:51:59.718
we found out early, I was
one of the first people

00:51:59.718 --> 00:52:02.213
to take a high dose for resveratrol.

00:52:02.213 --> 00:52:04.720
And when we included it with food,

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.300
the levels in my blood went up five fold.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.170
And so you want to have
something in there.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:10.150
If you just drink it with water,

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:11.358
it's not going to get through.

00:52:11.358 --> 00:52:13.522
And unfortunately, some people
have done clinical trials

00:52:13.522 --> 00:52:15.760
without even thinking that they might need

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.860
to dissolve it in something.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.290
- So are you taking this
all at once in the morning

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:21.481
and chasing it with some olive oil

00:52:21.481 --> 00:52:24.670
or are you dissolving it in yogurt?

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.630
What's the specific protocol?

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.183
- Yeah, I've been improving perfecting

00:52:30.183 --> 00:52:33.170
what I do for about 10 years

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.010
I would take some Greek yogurt,

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:37.840
a couple of spoonfuls, put
the resveratrol on there,

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.293
mix it around, make sure it's dissolved

00:52:39.293 --> 00:52:41.800
and put that in my mouth and swallow that,

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.990
these days, what I like to do,

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.740
because I've realized that olive oil

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:49.150
and particularly oleic acid,
one of the mono unsaturated,

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:54.100
fatty acids is also an activator
of the sirtuin defenses.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.190
So I'm trying to ingest
more of oleic acid.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.860
So I switched to olive oil.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.733
What I do is I put a couple
of teaspoons of olive oil

00:53:00.733 --> 00:53:04.050
in a glass mix around the resveratrol,

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:07.150
and maybe some Coresatin
a similar molecule.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.950
Make sure it's dissolved.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.420
I put a little bit of vinegar

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.270
and if I have a basil
leaf, I'll put that in.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.460
And it's like drinking
some salad dressing.

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.330
And it's very-

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:22.330
- Delicious, that raises a
question that I want to ask

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:27.830
before we get to NMN
and NR and vitamin B3,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.090
which is by doing that,

00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:33.320
do you think that it breaks your fast?

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.171
And I want to just frame this
question of breaking the fast

00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:38.419
in a more general scientific theme.

00:53:38.419 --> 00:53:40.169
And I'd love your thoughts on this.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.645
One of the questions I
get asked all the time

00:53:42.645 --> 00:53:46.190
is does ingesting blank break the fast,

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.340
does eating this or drinking this, coffee?

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.630
If I walk in the room and
someone else is eating a cracker,

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.430
does it break my fast?

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.210
People get pretty extreme with this,

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:57.767
my sense and please tell me if I'm wrong,

00:53:57.767 --> 00:54:00.630
but my sense is that it
depends on the context

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.210
of what you did the night before,

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:04.810
whether or not you're
diabetic, lots of things.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:07.970
So for instance, if I eat an
enormous meal at midnight,

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.300
go to sleep, wake up at 6:00 AM.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.870
I could imagine that black coffee

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.770
or coffee with a little bit
of cream might quote unquote,

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:17.900
break my fast, but the body

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.180
doesn't have a breaking the fast switch.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.140
The body only speaks in the
language of glucose, AMPK,

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.850
mTOR, et cetera.

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:28.600
So do you worry that
ingesting these calories

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.300
is going to quote unquote break your fast?

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.750
And more generally,

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:33.810
how do you think about the
issue of whether or not

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:36.640
you're fasting enough to
get these positive effects?

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.640
Because not everybody can manage
on just water or just tea,

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.660
or we should say not
everybody is willing to manage

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.490
on just water or just tea for
a certain part of the day.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.370
- Well, my first answer is not scientific,

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.810
it's philosophical.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:53.070
If you don't enjoy life, what's the point.

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.940
And so I'd like a cup of
coffee in the morning,

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.393
a little bit of milk, spoonful of yogurt,

00:54:58.393 --> 00:54:59.793
it's not going to kill me.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.290
Olive oil doesn't have protein
or carbs in it, not many.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.830
And so I'm probably not affecting

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:10.830
those longevity pathways
negatively, but without that,

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.413
first of all, I wouldn't
enjoy my life as much.

00:55:12.413 --> 00:55:14.740
Second, well, the olive
oil isn't is not as great

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.080
as the yogurt, but I'm trying to optimize

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.680
and there's no perfect
solution to what we're doing.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.750
And we're still learning.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.860
We don't know what's optimal for me,

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.570
let alone everybody else.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.480
But I'm with you,

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.550
I don't believe that taking a couple

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:30.406
of spoonfuls of something,

00:55:30.406 --> 00:55:34.410
unless it's high fructose corn
syrup is going to hurt you

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.130
because I've now got the rest of the day

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.470
till about eight, 9:00 PM
of not eating anything.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:42.680
And that I forgive myself for that.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.590
And that there's a really good point here.

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:46.540
You and I were discussing this earlier.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:52.690
The point about doing this is
that you try to do your best.

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:57.260
If you go from regular living
to donate the whole day,

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.190
you're going to fail.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:00.310
It's like quitting smoking, cold turkey.

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:02.203
It's easy to chew gum
and stick the patch on

00:56:02.203 --> 00:56:05.160
because your body has to get
used to all sorts of habits.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.770
And it's social, it's physical,
putting stuff in your mouth,

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:10.680
chewing, not just the
low blood sugar levels

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.150
and your brain will fight it.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:13.410
Your limbic system is going to go,

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:15.460
hey, do it, do it, do it.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.660
And you're going to have to fight it

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.930
but once you get through
it, you'll be better,

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.110
but you do it in stages.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.300
Do breakfast first, then do small lunch

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.980
and then eventually cut lunch out.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.630
Don't go cold turkey
because everyone knows.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:32.910
It's a fact that if you
try to do a strict diet

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:35.942
right out of the gates,
they'll almost always fail.

00:56:35.942 --> 00:56:39.102
- Now, I think that captures the essence

00:56:39.102 --> 00:56:43.310
of the fasting rationally
and irrational approach

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.843
to supplementation very well,

00:56:45.889 --> 00:56:47.860
along the lines of supplementation.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:52.613
What about NMN, NR and B3, niacin?

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.430
How does one, I want to know what you do.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.680
I also want to know what I should do,

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.040
and I think most people want
to know what they should do.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.830
These are molecules that
impact the sirtuin pathway

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.920
impact the pathways that control aging

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.147
or rates of aging in the epigenome.

00:57:11.147 --> 00:57:12.597
How do they do that?

00:57:12.597 --> 00:57:14.580
And how does one incorporate that

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.990
into a supplementation protocol?

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:18.200
Should they choose to do that?

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.280
All right.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.109
- Well, disclaimer is I
don't recommend anything,

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:22.963
but I talk about what I do.

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:25.200
So a bit of scientific background,

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.830
these are two in genes that we discovered

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:29.220
first in yeast cells when I was at MIT

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.820
and then in animals as I
moved to Harvard in the 2000's

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.963
one of my first post-docs,

00:57:34.963 --> 00:57:37.770
actually literally my
first postdoc Haim Cohen,

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.719
published a great paper
just a couple of months ago

00:57:40.719 --> 00:57:44.980
and found that turning
on the sirtuin six gene,

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.750
middle of the seven, number
six gene is very potent.

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:50.080
It extended the lifespan
dramatically of mice

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.210
that he engineered both males
and females, which is great.

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.510
So what you want to do
is so naturally boost

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.600
the activity of these sirtuins.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.610
They are genes, but
they also make proteins.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.490
That's what genes
typically make or encode.

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:04.990
And then those proteins
take care of the body

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.430
in many different ways as we've discussed.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:09.682
So how do you turn on these
genes and make the proteins

00:58:09.682 --> 00:58:11.600
they make even more active?

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.630
You want to rev up that system.

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:16.600
So exercise will do
it, fasting will do it.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.459
What about supplementation?

00:58:17.459 --> 00:58:21.470
Well, the first activator of
the sirtuins that we discovered

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:23.502
that acts on the enzyme
to make it do a better job

00:58:23.502 --> 00:58:27.530
of cleaning up the body
and protecting resveratrol

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:30.330
We looked at thousands
of different molecules,

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:31.566
eventually tens of thousands.

00:58:31.566 --> 00:58:35.840
And the one that was the best
was resveratrol in the dish.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.360
And then we gave it to
little organisms, worms,

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.400
and then flies and
mice, eventually humans.

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.050
And we saw that it activated that enzyme.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.217
So resveratrol is one way to activate it.

00:58:46.217 --> 00:58:49.350
And you can think of it as the
accelerator pedal on a car.

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:52.545
It revs it up, but there's
something else that the sirtuins

00:58:52.545 --> 00:58:57.423
need to work and that's NAD
and is a really small molecule,

00:58:57.423 --> 00:59:00.630
little chemical in the
body that we need for life.

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:03.310
It's used by the body
for chemical reactions,

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:04.580
for a hundred different
reactions in the body.

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:09.210
And without it, you're dead
within seconds, you need NAD.

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.800
The problem that we've
seen is that NAD levels

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:16.800
decline as you become
obese, as you get older,

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.930
if you don't ever get hungry and the body

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:22.740
not only doesn't make enough of it,

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.970
it's chewing it up as well.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:27.780
There's an enzyme called
CD38 that Eric Verdin

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.713
over at UCSF showed choose up.

00:59:30.713 --> 00:59:33.420
Now he's now at the Buck
Institute in California,

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.530
choose up NAD as you get older.

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.390
So it's a double whammy.

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:38.133
You don't make as much and chew it up,

00:59:38.133 --> 00:59:40.570
which is really bad because
what we've shown in my lab

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:42.580
and so have others is that NAD levels

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.307
are really important for keeping
those sirtuins and defenses

00:59:45.307 --> 00:59:47.260
at a useful level.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.444
And you can give a lot of resveratrol

00:59:48.444 --> 00:59:50.163
but if you don't have the fuel,

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:52.265
you're basically accelerating a car

00:59:52.265 --> 00:59:54.200
that doesn't have enough gas.

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.150
So you want to do both.

00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.983
And that's what I do.

00:59:55.983 --> 01:00:00.540
I take a precursor to NAD called
NMN and the body uses that

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:05.170
to make the NAD molecule in one step.

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:09.370
And so I know from measuring
dozens of human beings,

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:13.520
that if you take NMN for
the time period that I do,

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.450
I've been taking it for years.

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.360
But if you take it for about two weeks,

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.210
you'll double on average,

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:20.730
double your NAD levels in the blood.

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:22.170
Okay, that's not public information.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.830
That's from clinical trials
that are not yet published

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.710
over the last two years.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.190
There are other ways
to increase NAD levels

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.023
in someone like me, who's
getting older, I'm 52 now.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.830
You can take NR, which
is used to make an amend,

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:41.020
which is used to make
NAD, and both NMN and NR

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.233
are sold by companies in the US.

01:00:45.233 --> 01:00:49.470
NR is laxter phosphate,

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:52.070
the phosphate is a small
chemical the body needs.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.370
You've probably heard
of the atom, phosphorus.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.040
Let's go back one step.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.580
How do you make NR?

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.750
NR gets made from vitamin B3, often.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:05.800
You can also find it in
milk and other foods,

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.900
but sometimes people ask me,

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.590
why don't you just take vitamin B3?

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.083
And won't that just force
the body to make NAD?

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.890
And the answer is no, it
doesn't work very well.

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:17.900
We know this just by doing the experiment,

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:21.107
but the reason I think is is that NAD,

01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:22.700
I said, it's a small molecule,

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.600
but relative to vitamin B3, it's big.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.893
It's got those phosphates
on there, it's got a sugar,

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.470
it's got the vitamin B attached.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:35.710
So you've got all these
components that come together

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:39.547
to make this very complicated
little molecule called NAD.

01:01:40.428 --> 01:01:43.580
When you give NMN, it
contains all three components

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.640
that the body needs to make NAD.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.380
If you give NR or just vitamin B3,

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.130
which is an even smaller molecule,

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:51.880
the body has to find
these other components

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.190
from somewhere else.

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.180
So where do you get phosphate,

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.560
well, the body needs it for
DNA, it needs it for bones.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.930
So high doses of something

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:03.560
that requires additional phosphate

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.500
makes me a little concerned.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.860
And we have compared to
NMN and NR head-to-head

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:10.870
in mouse studies, for instance in NMN,

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.560
we've shown in a cell
paper a few years ago,

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.320
makes mice run further, old
mice can run 50% further

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.180
'cause they had better
blood flow, better energy.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.060
NR are at the same dose, did not do that.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.350
In fact, it had no effect.

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:26.350
- I see, dosage wise, if
I were elect to take NMN

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.970
in supplement form to
increase my NAD levels

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.543
and presumably slow my aging,

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.280
how much NMN should I take?

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.713
What's the protocol that you do?

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.160
And are the various
forms that are out there,

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.773
are some better or some worse?

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.610
- Well, I'm always happy
to tell you what I do

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.320
and what my father does,
my 82-year-old father,

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.020
we take a gram of NMN every day.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.060
- So it's a gram resveratrol
and a gram of NMN.

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:56.893
- Right.

01:02:56.893 --> 01:02:58.090
- Okay a thousand milligrams.

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:02.060
- Now another important point,

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.920
which is, I'm not the
same as everybody else.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.420
I have a different
microbiome, age, sex, right?

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.460
And so I've been measuring myself

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.540
and so I know if something's,

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.300
or I think I know if
something's making me better

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.940
or worse based on measuring
45 different things.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.620
So I just want people to be aware

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.110
that what I do may not perfectly
or work at all for others,

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.880
but I have studied, as I said,

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.250
dozens of people who take NMN, at a gram,

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.320
sometimes two grams.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.900
And I know by looking at all those people

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.830
that without any exceptions,
that if you do what I do,

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:42.070
your NAD levels go up by
about two fold or more.

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:44.520
And so I do that every day,
the thousand milligrams.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.870
Now people sell it.

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:48.270
Now I never get into brands and all that.

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:51.950
First of all, I don't have
the time to measure products.

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:54.280
I don't know, though I should say,

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.070
I do want to say I'm working on a solution

01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.340
for people to know what works

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.360
and what's real and what
isn't, but I'm not there yet.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.370
And in the meantime, I would say,

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.150
if you do want to buy this,
let's say you want to buy NMN,

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:10.800
look for a company that
is well-established

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.950
that has high levels of quality control.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.300
Look for three letters, GMP,

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.150
which is good manufacturing practices.

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.230
And so that means they make
it under a certain level

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:22.310
of quality control.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:25.540
You're not going to find
iron filings in there

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.093
and it probably has the stuff
in it that they say it does.

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.640
But so that's all I can say right now.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.010
I'm working on something that's
going to be much more helpful,

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:38.497
but overall, make sure it's
white, crystalline NMN,

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.520
and that to me, it tastes
like burnt popcorn.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.810
- You crack open the capsules,

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:44.960
and you'll take a little sample

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.820
to make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.340
- Well, when I'm making
my capsules, I'll taste it

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:53.600
and I do a lot of quality
control on the stuff that I take.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.160
- Do you take that gram all at once

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.120
with the resveratrol

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.620
or do you take it spread
throughout the day?

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.580
- It's all in the
morning for those things.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.860
So if I take Metformin, it's NMN

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.540
and the resveratrol altogether.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.400
And there's a good reason for that.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.433
It's all scientific, I try to be.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.830
The levels of NAD go up in the morning

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:14.810
in our bodies naturally.

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.270
Our bodies actually have a
cycle of NAD, it's not steady.

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:18.103
- It's Arcadian?

01:05:18.103 --> 01:05:18.936
- It's Acadian.

01:05:18.936 --> 01:05:22.280
In fact, NAD controls your clock.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.240
This was shown by Shin Imai and colleagues

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.110
in this nice science
paper about a decade ago,

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:28.910
that if you disrupt the NAD cycle,

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:33.050
which is controlled by the
sirtuin gene that we worked on,

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.890
that is what's telling your
body, oh, it's time to eat,

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.370
it's time to go to sleep.

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:41.310
And if you take these, the NMN
late at night, for example,

01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:43.360
you can disrupt your circadian rhythms.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.193
- Interesting.

01:05:44.193 --> 01:05:47.220
- Conversely, when I travel
and I want to reset my clock

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:52.220
to the time zone, I will take
a boost of NMN in the morning

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.900
and I feel great.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.152
- Does this protocol for you,

01:05:57.152 --> 01:06:00.180
does it produce any immediate effects

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.970
of increased energy, et cetera?

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:06.030
You mentioned that one would,
if it's right for them,

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:08.220
would have to take it
for at least two weeks

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.150
to start to see the NAD levels increase.

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:13.620
At that point, when NAD levels increase,

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.060
could one possibly expect an increase

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.683
in overall energy, focus, et cetera?

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.030
I realize we're not making promises here,

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:24.060
but I'm just wondering whether
or not the only measure

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.900
of whether or not this protocol is working

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:30.900
is whether or not you die at
age blank or blank plus 20.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:33.979
And of course, once you're dead,

01:06:33.979 --> 01:06:36.560
you can't really know if
you would've lived longer

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.600
if you'd done something
differently and vice versa.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.230
- Sure, well, there was a
study again by Shin Imai

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.930
my good friend at Washington
University in St. Louis

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.670
that showed that improves,

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:50.460
remember this insulin sensitivity,
which is a good thing.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.170
But you can't know your
insulin sensitivity

01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:53.870
unless you're measuring glucose,

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.230
have a glucose monitor on your arm.

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:56.360
- Do you have one on right now?

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.970
- No, no, I used to, I learned a lot.

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:01.116
- Yeah, last time I
saw you had this thing,

01:07:01.116 --> 01:07:02.940
it looks like a small leach,

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:06.230
not a large leach and it was
measuring your blood glucose.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.050
- They're very informative
because you learn

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:11.400
what your body reacts to
and grapes were really bad.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.400
Rhonda Patrick agrees with
that, but the issue was,

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:19.660
was what, where were we, Andrew?

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.260
- The issue is whether
or not you can expect

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:25.450
any immediate effects on
energy, vitality, focus,

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:26.530
just even subject.

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:28.070
- So what do you feel, is the question.

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:29.680
And anecdotally,

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.040
'cause I've been taking
this for a long time,

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.150
if I don't take it, I
start to feel 50 years old,

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:34.030
it's horrible.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.134
I can't think straight.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:38.900
It may be placebo, but who knows?

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.510
But what we're doing now are
very careful clinical trials.

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.360
We've done the safety for two years,

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.730
and we're now treating elderly patients

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:49.120
at Harvard Medical School with
some wonderful colleagues.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.900
And those people are actually going

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.770
to be an currently in MRIs.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:57.640
So you can measure the
energetics and the NAD levels

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.840
in their legs as they
exercise in real time.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.450
And that will tell us if
what we see in the mice

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:05.830
is increased endurance actually works.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.890
In the meantime, it's fun
to talk about anecdotes.

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:10.500
I have a number of athlete friends,

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.070
some of which have increased their load,

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:15.293
their time in marathons, for example.

01:08:15.293 --> 01:08:18.880
There's a good friend
of ours in our circle

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.947
that is winning marathons at age 50 now.

01:08:21.947 --> 01:08:24.720
And he attributes that to
the protocol that he's on.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.880
- Interesting, I haven't
started taking NMN,

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.090
but I'm planning to do that
when my next birthday arrives,

01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:31.400
which is in a couple months.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.290
But I do experiments on my
sister and have for years,

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:37.300
I have a sister who's three
years older than I am,

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.160
who is very enthusiastic
about these protocols.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.080
And I'll tell you that
after reading your book,

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.580
I started purchasing
for her and giving her

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:50.140
an NMN supplement and she
claims and I believe her.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.640
She has a quite sensitive system

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.950
and she's very tuned into it.

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:56.410
She feels far and away
better when she takes it,

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:57.710
as opposed to when she doesn't

01:08:57.710 --> 01:09:01.240
and I've done the control
experiment of removing her supply,

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.390
and then giving it back to
her in this kind of thing.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:06.023
So that's my other laboratory.

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:10.140
This is what younger brothers
do to their older sisters.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.400
I have a question about something

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.650
that if it has no relevance,

01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:16.140
we can just treat it as a speed
bump and then move right on.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.990
And the artificial sweeteners,

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:21.900
these things that we
should say non-glucose,

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.040
increasing sweetener.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.120
So you've got Stevia,
which is a plant basically.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.160
And then you've got
sucralose and aspartame

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.090
and all these things.

01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:33.350
There is some evidence that
I know we're both aware of,

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:35.440
they've been publishing
quite reputable journals,

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.710
showing that they can
disrupt the gut microbiome

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:40.620
in certain cases in particular saccharin,

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.883
the one that basically
nobody uses anymore.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.540
And it's questionable as
to whether or not Stevia

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.070
has the same negative effects, et cetera.

01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:48.210
That's not what this is about,

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:51.910
but in terms of the sensation of,

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:54.750
or the perception of sweet taste,

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:57.720
is that itself a possible detriment

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.040
to these pro-longevity,
forgive me for using the term,

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.320
the pathways.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.250
If I were to drink a
diet coke during a fast,

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:08.650
am I somehow disrupting this?

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:09.540
And I'm asking this question,

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.690
because I get asked this question a lot.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.850
- Well, there may be small effects.

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:16.540
I don't think they're
worth worrying about.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.170
Joe Rogan laughed at me 'cause
I was drinking a diet coke

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.750
during the first
interview I did with them.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:25.030
I will drink diet coke, I've
read the scientific literature.

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.543
And again, it's this 5% thing

01:10:26.543 --> 01:10:29.290
that I think is blowing out of proportion.

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:31.780
If I was to put a number
on it, I would say,

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:36.240
if eating a high sugary meal

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.970
or drinking a sugar-filled soda,

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.270
what is that, 30 grams of sugar?

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:45.920
Let's say that's a 10
out of 10 bad for you.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.883
A diet coke might be a one.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.930
And if I'm, which am I going to do?

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:54.160
I could have a 10 or a one
or go without in my life.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.150
I'll do the one on occasion.

01:10:56.150 --> 01:11:00.680
I try to avoid them because I
don't like the ones as much.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.360
But you can't say that sucralose

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.270
is equivalent to drinking a sugary soda.

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:07.370
There's just no comparison.

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:08.940
And I think suc, what is it?

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.300
Stevia, I do use Stevia whenever I can,

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.060
because it's a naturally sourced product.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.930
And I haven't seen any good evidence yet

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:18.690
that it's bad for you.

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:20.940
But I think a lot of this is overblown,

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.160
and a lot of it's the media trying

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.220
to give equal weight to stories
as you know as a scientist.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.764
It can be frustrating
when something's a 10

01:11:29.764 --> 01:11:32.023
and something's a one,
and they're equated.

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.620
- How do I say this respectfully?

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.690
I think if science
journalists were required

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:42.530
to post their credentials
alongside their name, [chuckles]

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:44.550
then people would take the articles into,

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.770
with additional grain of salt, right?

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:47.603
I mean, in other words,

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.180
that I think that the science media

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.410
is mainly generated
around two specific goals.

01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:55.290
One is to make people very, very afraid

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:56.900
or get people very, very excited,

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.290
and oftentimes the get people excited part

01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:00.450
is sponsored content,

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:03.340
and I think that's overlooked in any case.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.190
Thank you for that.

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:07.660
I want to talk about iron and iron load.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.940
We were talking earlier about ferritin.

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.323
And of course, women menstruate.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.350
And so their iron needs
are greater than people,

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.110
men that don't menstruate

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:20.660
or women that don't menstruate.

01:12:21.981 --> 01:12:23.020
I don't think we can get right down

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.890
into how much iron somebody needs

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:26.470
because it'll vary person to person.

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:29.660
But I was surprised to learn that iron

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.310
is actually going to accelerate

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:36.030
the aging process in various contexts.

01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:39.910
- Well, this is a new
finding out of Spain.

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:44.030
Manuel Serrano's lab has
found that excess iron

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.143
will increase the number of
senescent cells in the body.

01:12:48.172 --> 01:12:49.880
And senescent cells are these zombie cells

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.300
that accumulate as you get
older and they sit there

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.450
and they cause inflammation mainly

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.350
and also can cause cancer.

01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:58.660
And it's found that if
you get rid of these cells

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.130
or never accumulate
them, you stay younger.

01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:05.410
In animals, and there's some
really interesting studies

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.260
out of Mayo Clinic in humans as well.

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:13.530
So iron is a pro-senescent metal.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.960
And so what I think

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.950
is that if you're taking
excess iron as a supplement,

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:21.120
you're probably accelerating
your aging process.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.860
The other thing that I
found really interesting

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.450
is I've looked at hundreds of thousands

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:29.240
of people's metabolism and
their blood biomarkers.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.770
I was one of the first people

01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:33.310
in InsideTracker as a board member,

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:37.550
and I'm still their scientific lead guy.

01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:39.130
So I can look anonymously

01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:41.360
at hundreds of thousands
of people's blood work.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.453
And we also know how fit
they are, how old they are.

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:47.040
Some of them are marathon runners,

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.463
some of them are CrossFit.

01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:52.090
And there's a signature of health

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.000
that actually is different
than your average person.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.837
Now, I'm not going to
say bad things about MDs

01:13:57.837 --> 01:14:00.127
'cause a lot of my best friends are MDs

01:14:00.127 --> 01:14:02.477
and I work with them at
Harvard Medical School.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.023
The issue though, is
that with MD training,

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.950
there's a scale of what's normal,

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:12.020
and if you're out of that normal range,

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.010
something must be wrong,

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:15.270
that's the paradigm that they work under.

01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:16.987
But first of all, everybody's different,

01:14:16.987 --> 01:14:18.310
and you want to know their baseline

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:21.929
and track people over years to
know what's normal for them.

01:14:21.929 --> 01:14:23.110
And what I find for example,

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:26.497
is people who are really
healthy and live the way I do

01:14:26.497 --> 01:14:31.497
and have a diet that's fairly
vegetarian, but not strict,

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.280
still have slightly low hemoglobin levels,

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.120
slightly low iron, slightly low ferritin,

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.200
but we have super amounts
of energy, we're not anemic.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.730
And we're getting along great in life.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:46.310
But a doctor who just
looks at that might say,

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:48.420
oh, we need to give you more iron.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.170
All right, so what I'm
getting at is an example of,

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:53.380
we need to personalize medicine

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.620
and look at people over the long run

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.113
to know what works for them
and what's healthy for them,

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:02.080
and not just work towards
the average human,

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.750
but work towards what's optimal for human.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.390
- I love that answer.

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:08.500
You mentioned tracking
and tracking over time.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.880
And this is a really interesting area

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.010
that I know you have been
focused on for a long time.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.646
I've been getting blood worked
on about every six months

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:18.410
frankly, since I was in college.

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:19.589
I just got, I like data

01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:23.030
and I got interested in
supplementation and exercise

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:24.290
'cause it made me feel better,

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:27.060
but I also want to know what
was going on under the hood.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.380
So you get numbers back, you
get this hormone, that hormone,

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.850
this blood glucose measure, et cetera.

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:35.850
How do you make sense of the data?

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:38.290
I mean, what InsideTracker is doing aside,

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:40.360
how do you personally
make sense of the data

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.690
in ways that might differ from the way

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:45.170
that a standard MD might
look at one of these charts?

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:46.960
Because the standard practice is to say,

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.350
is it red, yellow, or green, right?

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:52.250
Is it basically too high or too low?

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:56.037
Is it somewhere close to
the margins or are you okay?

01:15:56.037 --> 01:15:57.930
Are you in these ranges?

01:15:57.930 --> 01:16:00.310
Are there any things
that you pay attention to

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.830
that you think are
particularly interesting

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.320
for people to just take note of?

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.153
I mean, we're not asking you

01:16:05.153 --> 01:16:06.943
to go against anybody's physician.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.930
But what sorts of things
should people start

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:13.110
to educate themselves about

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:15.570
in terms of what these
molecules are on their charts

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.760
if they choose to get them,
and what do you look at?

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.700
- Yeah, well, there's a lot there.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.890
The first is that you
should be tracking things,

01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:25.430
because one measurement isn't enough.

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:27.060
These things vary and over time.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.500
And if you can have a
decade or more of data,

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.920
it's super important, informative,

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.000
as you know, well know, as you know.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.140
So the physician, interestingly,

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.423
my physician, let's
take him as an example.

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:45.947
So he sees me, he says,
"How are you feeling?"

01:16:45.947 --> 01:16:47.067
"I'm feeling great."

01:16:47.067 --> 01:16:49.260
"Okay, see you next
year," that's craziness.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.000
Anyway, so I say, okay, stop.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.840
Let's talk a little bit about.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.670
- Let me educate you, that's
what David tells his physician.

01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:58.180
I imagine that the
12-year-old David Sinclair

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.013
says to a physician,

01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:01.070
"Listen, let's have a
different discussion."

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:02.557
Is that how it works?
- It is.

01:17:02.557 --> 01:17:06.150
He finds me pretty annoying
as does my dentist.

01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:09.760
But so I say, so hang
on, I've got this data.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.110
I've got the InsideTracker data.

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:13.060
So I pull that up on the screen,

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:16.950
and I'm showing him the
changes in my cholesterol

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:20.960
and my CRP, which is
inflammatory marker as you know.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.793
And we're going through it,

01:17:21.793 --> 01:17:23.340
and you can see things change over time,

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:24.670
and I've corrected them

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:27.750
as they go slightly out of
the optimal range for me,

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:30.020
which is different than
what he would do, of course.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.830
But what was funny is that he says,

01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:34.260
this is great, I love this data.

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:37.280
But I'm not allowed to get
this because of course,

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.890
the insurance companies won't pay for it.

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:41.900
So again, you can pay out of pocket.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.150
It's not super expensive.

01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:48.150
I would say, if you save a
bit of money on a coffee,

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.320
you can afford this kind of stuff.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.570
But the main point is that
doctors do like this data.

01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:55.840
It's just that they're
unable to spend the money

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.080
on every one of their patients to get it.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.630
- Is there a code word

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:01.060
that someone can use with their physician

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.550
that will trigger a
comprehensive blood test?

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:06.030
I keep trying to figure
out what's the code

01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:08.660
that one needs to ask
or tell their doctor,

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.761
I'm feeling blank so that
they get a full blood panel.

01:18:11.761 --> 01:18:12.730
- Well.

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:16.090
- Do you have to be hemorrhaging
from the gut or something?

01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:18.660
- Well, I usually use the WTH method,

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.920
which is what the hell?

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.256
And then he says, "Okay, we'll do it."

01:18:22.256 --> 01:18:24.140
- 'Cause I think a lot of
people out there are thinking,

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.830
look, I'd love to have blood
work repeatedly over time,

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:29.400
but that's hard to get
for financial reasons,

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.700
but also a lot of people
just don't know how

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.820
to approach the conversation.

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:33.653
And this is one of the things

01:18:33.653 --> 01:18:36.050
that I hope that we can educate people on,

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:39.420
that they deserve to know what's
going on inside their body,

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.070
and that it makes a
doctor's visit worthwhile,

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:46.070
and that you don't have to
feign illness in order to do it.

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:47.910
- Right, yeah, and a lot of people do.

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:49.980
So I would say, if you
can't afford these tests,

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.050
there are increasing number of companies

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:55.960
that offer these tests,
InsideTracker is one of them.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.740
And you just do it a couple
of times a year at a minimum.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.840
And then you can share
that with your doctor.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.100
If you can't afford that, then
I would say to your doctor,

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.990
here are the main ones
that Andrew and David do.

01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:10.460
- Yep, and we must.

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.380
And there's an email

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.270
that is something like 555,

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.650
or a phone number, rather, it's 555-5555.

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:17.930
I think if they have any complaints,

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:19.970
they can just call that number.

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:22.880
David will pick up on the
east coast business hours

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.830
and I'll pick up outside of those hours.

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:26.870
- But there was the
main ones, I would say.

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:29.240
Your blood sugar levels,
you want to do your HbA1c,

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:32.270
which is your average glucose
levels over the month.

01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:34.950
There's CRP, which I
mentioned for inflammation.

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:37.010
- Yeah, let's talk about
C-reactive protein for a second.

01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:39.250
'Cause I think it's been shown

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:42.130
to be an early marker
of macular degeneration

01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:45.360
of heart disease, of a
variety of different things.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.193
CRP is something

01:19:46.193 --> 01:19:48.980
that we don't hear enough about, I think.

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.690
Maybe, what do you know
about CRP that I don't,

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.310
I'm guessing a lot, but.

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:54.850
- Oh, it was originally picked up

01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:56.960
as something that was
associated with heart disease

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.420
in the Framingham study, I believe.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.530
It is the best marker for
cardiovascular inflammation

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:07.290
and is also, we use it as
a predictor of longevity,

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:12.170
and its levels go up with mortality.

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:13.610
And so this is an association,

01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.810
but there's enough data that I would say,

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.600
if you have high levels of CRP,

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.450
you need to get your levels down quickly.

01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:22.973
And the levels usually go up with age

01:20:22.973 --> 01:20:24.570
and with levels of inflammation.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:28.040
So the ways to get it down
would be to switch the diet,

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.280
eat less, try to eat more vegetables.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.267
You'll find it will come down,

01:20:31.267 --> 01:20:33.730
and there are also drugs that can do it.

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:37.250
Anti-inflammatories can do it as well.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:40.030
But CRP is, it's actually, hCRP,

01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:43.300
there's a high sensitive
hCRP, your doctor will know.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.270
Get one of those readings.

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:47.230
'Cause if you've got
normal blood sugar levels,

01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:50.300
your doctor, or fasting
blood sugar levels,

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.020
your doctor might say you're fine.

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.030
But a lot of people
have normal blood sugar,

01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:58.510
but have high CRP, which is
just as bad for you longterm,

01:20:58.510 --> 01:21:01.070
and can predict a future heart attack.

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.370
- On the lines of heart attack.

01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:05.120
I want your thoughts on cholesterol

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.650
and serum cholesterol
and dietary cholesterol.

01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:09.920
I cannot, for the life of me,

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.090
get my arms around this literature.

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:16.070
And even if I ignore all
the essentially nonsense

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:19.250
that's out there in various
social media groups,

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:22.750
as saying cholesterol is the
worst thing in the world,

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.587
or cholesterol is not,

01:21:24.587 --> 01:21:27.040
or dietary cholesterol has nothing to do

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.840
with serum cholesterol and
nothing to do with longevity.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.840
I can't seem to sort
through the very basic data

01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:37.393
that essentially ask,

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:43.110
is having high levels of LDL
going to kill me earlier?

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:47.230
Should I be striving to always
reduce LDL and increase HDL?

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.680
Is that a reasonable goal?

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.470
And if so,

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:53.550
is dietary cholesterol the
primary determinant of that?

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:56.680
And just as a final point about this,

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.830
I am aware of quite good data
that shows that anorexics,

01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:01.560
people that essentially eat no food,

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.560
unless you force them to,
can often have very high LDL.

01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:10.380
So their dietary cholesterol
is essentially zero,

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.290
and so they're manufacturing
a lot of their own.

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:15.890
So realize this isn't your
primary area of expertise,

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:17.441
but you're a smart guy

01:22:17.441 --> 01:22:19.770
and you think about this
kind of stuff a lot.

01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:20.920
What do you think is going on

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.140
with the cholesterol literature?

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.670
And will we ever get to the bottom of this

01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:26.460
as a scientific and medical community?

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:29.223
Because to me, it is rather perplexing.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:34.650
- It is, but you can get
through the politics.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:35.980
I know a fair bit about cholesterol

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.100
'cause it's in my family history.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.620
And I was headed for an early death,

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.440
my grandmother had a stroke 30,

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.860
that's how bad I am in
terms of my genetics.

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.290
So I went on a statin, and I
know there's a lot of people

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.120
who say that statins long-term are bad.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.313
It's associated with Alzheimer's disease.

01:22:57.487 --> 01:22:59.823
I've been taking a statins since I was 29.

01:22:59.823 --> 01:23:02.750
And that's 'cause I forced my same doctor

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:04.459
to give me the statin,

01:23:04.459 --> 01:23:06.090
the conversation was something like this.

01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:08.360
You're too young to be on a statin.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.193
And I said, what?

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.170
You want me to have a heart attack

01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:12.030
before you give me
something, give it to me now.

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:13.777
So 29, I'd been on a satin,

01:23:13.777 --> 01:23:16.780
and my cholesterol was
way up in beyond 300,

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.140
which is a massive mess up.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.600
Basically my blood was creamy to look at.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.180
So I've now got my cholesterol down

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:25.983
to low, low levels to what would it be.

01:23:25.983 --> 01:23:28.130
You can check on my InsideTracker,

01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:30.460
but so my ratio of HDL to LDL,

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:33.090
which you want to be less
than five, is now two,

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:36.290
and the LDL is below a
hundred, so it's all good.

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:39.310
And I've measured my
cardiovascular health with an MRI.

01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:41.350
I've got a movie of my heart beating.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:45.400
I've still got a heart of a
20-year old, so that's working,

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.810
I'm willing to forgo the risk

01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:48.690
that the statin is causing problems later

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.460
because of my family history.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.733
But other people, I would say,

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.050
be aware that statins
aren't perfect drugs.

01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:58.430
There were some interesting new ones.

01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:00.820
There's one called the PCSK9 inhibitor,

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:04.390
which is, I think fortnightly,
every two weeks injection,

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:08.053
that blocks the release
of LDL from the liver.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.270
And then that seems to be
great for lowering cholesterol,

01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:17.360
but also has other benefits
that might be prolongevity.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.640
And there were some people

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.910
that I was just talking to
on the cutting edge of this,

01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:23.950
and their doctors are
trying them on this drug

01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:25.820
instead of the statin.

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:28.290
So you could talk to your doctor about.

01:24:28.290 --> 01:24:32.800
- Do you avoid dietary
cholesterol for that reason also?

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.100
Red meat, butter.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.330
I mean, I have been to love butter.

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:36.651
I love red meat.

01:24:36.651 --> 01:24:38.893
I realized there's some people who don't.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.960
My cholesterol is a little bit high,

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.490
but I'm working to bring that down a bit,

01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:46.693
although not by altering
my food intake yet.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.390
But what do you think is the relationship

01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:51.780
between dietary cholesterol
and serum cholesterol,

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.530
and what's going on with the liver?

01:24:53.530 --> 01:24:54.983
Why are anorexics?

01:24:54.983 --> 01:24:57.550
Why is there a certain cholesterol so high

01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:58.760
when they're eating nothing?

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.690
- Well, there've been in a
number of papers over the years

01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:02.060
that have been ignored.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.050
And our friend, Peter Attia,

01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:06.290
brought to my attention recently,

01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:09.180
a new study that I think definitively said

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.500
that dietary cholesterol
has almost zero impact

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:13.860
on blood cholesterol levels.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.693
- Good.

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:18.690
- Yeah, so I'm annoyed
'cause I'd been avoiding eggs

01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:22.190
and butter for most of my
life and I didn't have to.

01:25:22.190 --> 01:25:24.140
So I have eggs-

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:25.865
- Plenty of time, or
at least in your case.

01:25:25.865 --> 01:25:26.960
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.319
So that's the thing.

01:25:28.319 --> 01:25:31.720
You can eat these foods
that were ones banned

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:32.825
because it's very difficult

01:25:32.825 --> 01:25:36.180
to take cholesterol up
into the body from the gut.

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:39.330
And most of it's being
synthesized in the body.

01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:41.190
- Well, I'm just pausing
there for a second

01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:45.940
because I think that it's
what we've been told.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.890
Six meals a day, eat a
lot of grains and fruits

01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:54.890
and this kind of thing, avoid cholesterol.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.380
I mean, basically everything we learned

01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:00.320
in the '80s and '90s and early 2000s

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.070
is getting flipped on its head now.

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:07.900
But, and I think this
is a very strong caveat

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:12.600
that's important to mention, amino acids.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.030
In particular, the amino acids

01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:17.220
that come from animal products, right?

01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:21.280
Seem to have some pro aging
effect on them, right?

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.617
At least the way that I've
heard you describe your diet.

01:26:24.617 --> 01:26:27.870
And I'm somebody who
enjoys meat, I like it.

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:31.200
But so I'm by no means, a vegan at all.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.853
But I've heard you say
you eat mostly plants,

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.780
but a little bit of fish

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.690
or chicken or something
of that sort of eggs or.

01:26:40.690 --> 01:26:42.240
But is that specifically

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.210
to avoid excessive amino acid intake?

01:26:45.210 --> 01:26:47.000
Or is it something specific about plants

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.140
that excites you with
respect to? [chuckles]

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.690
I mean, vegetables are
delicious too, but what is it?

01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:53.940
Is it something great about plants

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:56.480
or is it something bad
about when I think of meat,

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.440
I guess the biologist in me
thinks amino acids, right?

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.537
I don't think top sirloin,
I think amino acids.

01:27:01.537 --> 01:27:03.340
And I think top sirloin as I'm eating it,

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.810
but really what they are, are amino acids,

01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:07.260
including leucine.

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.390
- Yeah, well, there are two
good things about plants,

01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:13.840
and neither of them is taste for me.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.700
I would eat steak all the time if I could.

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:18.520
I did when I was a kid, I'm an Australian.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.780
But plants have two benefits.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:22.830
One is that they're highly nutritious,

01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:26.550
and they'll give you a lot of the vitamins

01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:28.100
and nutrients that I need.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:29.340
I don't take multivitamin,

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.220
I don't want to have the
excess iron in my body.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:34.210
So there's that high density nutrition.

01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:37.703
So those dark leaves, if
it's a spinach salad, great.

01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:40.760
The second is that there

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.410
is what's called xenohormetic
molecules in plants.

01:27:44.410 --> 01:27:47.010
That term, xenohormesis is a term

01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:50.220
that I came up with
with my friend, Conrad.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:54.710
How it's, which means
stressed plants make molecules

01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:56.260
that benefit your health.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.160
I'll break it down.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.410
Xeno means between species,
and hormesis is the term,

01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:02.390
whatever doesn't kill
you makes you stronger

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:03.940
and live longer.

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:07.660
And the idea is that when
plants are stressed out,

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.640
think of a great vine that's dried out

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.230
and then starting to harvest the grapes,

01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:13.200
which is typically how it's done.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.550
They are full with resveratrol,

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:17.960
because resveratrol is
a plant defense molecule

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.280
that I think is made

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.520
to activate those
sirtuin genes in a plant.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.250
So plants have sirtuins just like we do.

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:27.050
But by purifying or at least concentrating

01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:30.950
in a light-proof bottle and
keeping it out of the air,

01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:33.650
we stabilize the xenohormetic molecule,

01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:36.940
or it's a cocktail, not just
one, there's others in wine.

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.730
We then ingest those and get the benefits

01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:41.240
of activating our own defenses,

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.590
because our food was getting stressed out.

01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:45.620
And by stressed, I don't mean
psychologically stressed.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:46.920
I mean, biologically stressed.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.570
And so I try to eat plants

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:51.820
that have gone through a bit of stress.

01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:54.020
They might be brightly colored,
they've had too much sun

01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.193
or got nibbled on by a caterpillar.

01:28:57.350 --> 01:29:00.420
So you go to places where it's
organic or it's fresh, local,

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:01.900
and those are the plants
that aren't perfect,

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.240
and they probably have high concentrations

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.073
of these molecules.

01:29:04.073 --> 01:29:06.690
And in addition, I also
buy the supplements

01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.700
to make sure I'm getting
enough of those as well.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.170
- Which supplements mimic that?

01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:11.110
- So resveratrol will,

01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:12.900
there's another one called quercetin,

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.443
or quercetin, some people call it,

01:29:14.443 --> 01:29:18.530
what you find in trace
amounts in apples and onions.

01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:20.760
And we also showed back in 2003

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.270
that it activates sirtuins as well.

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:25.440
But others have, 20 years later,

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.640
found that it kills senescent cells

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.730
or helps kill senescent cells.

01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:33.560
So it's a double whammy
with that molecule.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.610
- And are you actively
picking out the peaches

01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:38.750
that look like they were
nibbled on by a caterpillar?

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:43.370
- No, but I don't worry if
they've been banged up a bit.

01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:45.310
- What's the story with antioxidants?

01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:47.000
Are they of any value whatsoever,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.340
because the way that you
describe them at the beginning,

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.920
and what I've heard recently

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.063
is that they are not all
the rage for anti-aging.

01:29:57.450 --> 01:29:58.860
What are they doing that's useful?

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.220
Should we be seeking
out antioxidants anyway

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.630
for other seller health purposes?

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:06.730
- Well, yeah, antioxidants
are not going to hurt you

01:30:06.730 --> 01:30:08.410
unless you take mega doses.

01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:12.150
We do need some oxidants
for our immune system.

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:14.220
And there's even, what's
called mitohormesis,

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.280
which is your mitochondria power packs,

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.590
need to have a little bit
of these free radicals

01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:19.913
to be able to function.

01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:23.540
So you don't want to overdose
on these antioxidants,

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.840
vitamin C, vitamin E, don't overdo it.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.550
- You don't take a multivitamin, correct?

01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:29.830
- Right.

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:31.910
- I think I'm going to stop
after this conversation

01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:33.140
'cause I've always just taken one

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.700
for the kind of insurance purpose,

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.373
which is a stupid purpose.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.110
Not actual insurance, but just thinking,

01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:42.900
oh cap top off on my ACBD.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.170
- Right, and I'll pee out what
I don't need, right, sure.

01:30:45.170 --> 01:30:46.690
- But that never bothered me.

01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.490
The whole expensive pee thing never got.

01:30:48.490 --> 01:30:51.660
That argument never got
made because of that.

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.803
A good vitamin is not that expensive.

01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:56.440
I just figured better safe than sorry,

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.870
but it may be that it's detrimental.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.780
- Well, it can in the case of iron

01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.730
as we discussed and the antioxidants.

01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:07.670
So when I came into the aging
field in the early 1990s,

01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:09.160
it was all about antioxidants.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.100
And we thought that enzymes
by the name of catalyze

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:13.930
and superoxide dismutase, well,

01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:16.560
they're going to be the key to longevity.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.970
It turns out that it's
largely been a failure

01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:23.840
that giving animals and
humans antioxidants,

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:27.613
haven't had the longevity
benefits that we dreamed of.

01:31:27.613 --> 01:31:31.470
And the main reason is that
there's a lot more going on

01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:33.123
than just free radical damage.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.760
The epigenome gets disrupted,

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.560
we've got these proteins misfolding.

01:31:38.959 --> 01:31:42.110
And so the problem really has
been that we didn't realize

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:44.310
that you need to turn on

01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:46.510
the body's natural defenses against that

01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:50.150
plus a whole host of other
things to get the true benefits.

01:31:50.150 --> 01:31:51.861
But I'm not going to say
it's a problem taking it,

01:31:51.861 --> 01:31:53.960
an antioxidant drink,

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.050
pomegranate juice for one
is full of good stuff,

01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:58.600
including xenohormetic molecules.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.930
But resveratrol is a good case in point,

01:32:00.930 --> 01:32:03.400
which is when I worked on resveratrol

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.100
as a longevity molecule,

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.950
first we showed it in yeast
and worms and flies and mice.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.680
Before that, it was
thought that resveratrol

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.770
was good for your heart in red
wine when you drink red wine,

01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:16.780
because it's an antioxidant.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.920
So then we showed that
it extended the lifespan

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:23.920
of yeast cells through this
genetic pathway, the sirtuins.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.450
And we then tested whether resveratrol,

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.770
if we change one atom

01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:32.250
to make it not an antioxidant, guess what?

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:33.670
It still worked fine.

01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:35.540
So it wasn't its anti-oxidant activity

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:36.590
that was extending lifespan.

01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:37.820
It was its ability to turn on

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.190
the yeast's defenses against aging.

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:42.780
Conversely, when we gave
the yeast antioxidants,

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.550
they lived shorter.

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.910
So yeah, that was the
beginning of my transformation

01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:49.070
into thinking turn on the body's defenses,

01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:50.830
don't give it the antioxidants.

01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:52.897
- This is an opportunity
for me to say something

01:32:52.897 --> 01:32:55.680
that I've been wanting
to say for a long time,

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.690
which is that, what's so
wonderful about science

01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:01.560
is that because the goal is mechanism,

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.970
you can really start to understand

01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:07.890
as you just described, what
actually mediates a process

01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:10.060
is very different than
what modulates a process.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.210
I mean, if a fire alarm goes
off in the building right now,

01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:14.010
it's going to modulate our attention.

01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:16.480
That doesn't mean that it
controls our attention,

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.380
it's not mechanistically relevant.

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.210
And so I think this
thing about antioxidants

01:33:20.210 --> 01:33:21.940
is one of these cases,

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:24.870
it sounds like where it's
in the right ballpark,

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:27.760
but until one really unveils
the mechanism as you have,

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.450
you can be, one can or in a field,

01:33:31.450 --> 01:33:34.523
can be badly wrong for a
very long period of time.

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:37.250
It sounds like the sirtuins

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:39.960
and really getting down to
the guts of the machinery

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.440
of what causes cells to age
is really what it's about.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:48.030
Zooming way out, what
are the behavioral tools

01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:49.390
that one can start to think about

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.563
in terms of ways to modulate these?

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.860
Basically the way that DNA

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.510
is being expressed and functioning.

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:58.080
I've heard you talk before

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.990
about hormesis of other
sorts, cold exposure.

01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:03.490
We talked about fasting.

01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:05.610
We talked about exercise in broad terms,

01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:10.610
but what about any evidence, if it exists,

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.700
as to whether or not aerobic training

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.100
versus weight training,
these sorts of things.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.660
In other words, what
are the sorts of things

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:21.350
that people can do to improve
their sirtuin pathway?

01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:23.290
And I realized that there are caveats.

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:25.050
We can't go directly from
a behavior dissertations,

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:27.350
but in the general theme,

01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:29.380
what can people do, what do you do?

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.110
- Right, well, we know
that that aerobic exercise

01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:34.950
in mice and rats raises their NAD levels

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:38.740
and their levels of sirt,
one of the genes goes up

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:41.200
two actually, number one and number three.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.980
What we don't know yet
is what type of exercise

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.600
is optimal to get them to change.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.230
We will learn, we're doing work.

01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:50.890
Now it's revealed that we're doing work

01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:52.590
with the military in the US,

01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:55.040
to try and understand that kind of thing.

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.190
And I'll always tell you and the public,

01:34:57.190 --> 01:35:00.393
when I don't know something
I'm not going to extrapolate.

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:02.103
But what do I do?

01:35:02.103 --> 01:35:05.120
I base my exercise on the
scientific literature,

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.800
which has shown that
maintaining muscle mass

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.910
is very important for a number of reasons.

01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:12.760
The two main ones are,

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.280
you want to maintain your hormone levels.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.960
I'm an older male,

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.890
losing my testosterone
and muscle mass over time.

01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:22.894
And by exercising, I will
maintain that and have,

01:35:22.894 --> 01:35:26.090
in fact, I probably haven't
had a body like this

01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.923
since I was 20.

01:35:26.923 --> 01:35:30.330
So that's one of the benefits
of having this lifestyle.

01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:31.163
- Sorry to interrupt you.

01:35:31.163 --> 01:35:33.590
You do know we did an episode on hormones

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:35.130
and there are data in humans

01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:39.663
that show that there are some
males in their '80s and '90s

01:35:39.663 --> 01:35:41.890
where their testosterone is equivalent

01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:44.620
to the average of 25 and 30-year-olds.

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.880
I can get you that information,

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.363
is really impressive studies.

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:50.960
Unfortunately, they didn't
include a lot of information

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.870
about the lifestyle factors, et cetera.

01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:55.703
But this idea that testosterone
goes down with age,

01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:59.680
it might be the trend,

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.433
but it's not necessarily a prerequisite.

01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:06.620
- Right, I believe in naturally increasing

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.080
and maintaining these hormone levels

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.760
and I've been measuring
them for a long time.

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.350
And I could see for me,
my testosterone levels

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:15.190
were steadily, levels were going down.

01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:16.923
- And then you got tenure
and they went back up again.

01:36:16.923 --> 01:36:18.244
[both chuckle]

01:36:18.244 --> 01:36:22.130
- No, I actually became complacent.

01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:23.490
And it was the worst.

01:36:23.490 --> 01:36:26.700
Actually my age changed in the
wrong direction after that,

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.260
'cause I was relaxed.

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.093
- Interesting.

01:36:29.093 --> 01:36:30.410
- And not worried about the future.

01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:32.670
But then I got serious.

01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:34.532
And I actually, according to
the InsideTracker algorithm,

01:36:34.532 --> 01:36:39.532
got my age down from 58 to
31 in a matter of months.

01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:41.860
So that was a big drop.

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:43.480
And I've been getting steadily younger

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.690
over the last 10 years,

01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:46.560
according to that
measurement, the blood test.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.450
- What about estrogen?

01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:49.860
Because women are different in the sense

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:53.070
that they do the number of eggs that they,

01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:56.070
and the ovaries change over time, right?

01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:58.902
Do you think that they can
maintain estrogen levels

01:36:58.902 --> 01:37:01.650
in over longer periods of time

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:03.350
using some of these same protocols?

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:06.640
- Well, yeah, I get into trouble
from a certain university

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.950
when I talk about this too much.

01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:10.270
- About estrogen?

01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:14.593
- Just about fertility and long story.

01:37:16.683 --> 01:37:18.444
I don't want to get too
much into the anecdotes,

01:37:18.444 --> 01:37:19.780
but I'll tell you the science,

01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:24.780
which is that if you take a
mouse and put it on fasting

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:29.920
or caloric restriction
for up until the point

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.810
where it should be in fertile,

01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:33.480
so that's about at a year of age,

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.210
a mouse gets infertile, female mouse.

01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:38.057
- Due to fasting or
due to simply to aging?

01:37:38.057 --> 01:37:39.970
- Due to aging, due to aging.

01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:42.840
The fasting, it's not extreme fast,

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.750
it's just less calories.

01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:47.360
Then you put them back on a regular food,

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.230
and they become fertile again

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.550
for many, many months afterwards.

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:55.150
So the effect on slowing down aging

01:37:55.150 --> 01:37:57.050
is also on the reproductive system.

01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:58.100
- Interesting.

01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:00.280
- And so that, I wouldn't
say to any woman,

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.690
I wouldn't think that they
should become super skinny

01:38:02.690 --> 01:38:05.540
to try and preserve fertility,
that's not what I'm saying.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.120
But these pathways that we work on these,

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.120
sirtuins are known to delay
infertility in female animals.

01:38:12.170 --> 01:38:14.670
Case in point, I'm one of the lead authors

01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:16.710
on a paper where we used NMN.

01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:18.770
Remember, this is the gas, the fuel,

01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:20.493
the petrol for the sirtuins.

01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:23.500
We gave old mice.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.580
One group of mice was 16 months old.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:32.234
Remember they became infertile
at 12, gave them NMN.

01:38:32.234 --> 01:38:34.687
And I think it was only six weeks later,

01:38:34.687 --> 01:38:37.740
they had offspring.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:39.040
They became fertile again,

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.350
which goes against biology,
the textbook biology,

01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:45.690
which is that female
mammals run out of eggs.

01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:47.720
Turns out that's not true.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.810
You can rejuvenate the
female reproductive system,

01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:53.620
and even get them to
come out of mouseopause

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:54.980
as we call it.

01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:57.590
So that's a whole new
paradigm in biology as well.

01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:58.820
- That's super interesting.

01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.660
Sorry to interrupt you,

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:02.340
but I'm reminded by a set of studies

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:04.127
that were done by your former colleagues

01:39:04.127 --> 01:39:05.420
'cause they're no longer there,

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:06.850
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,

01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:08.240
my scientific great grandparents.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.200
Won the Nobel prize for discovering,

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.040
what are called critical periods,

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.410
this phase of early development

01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:16.120
when the brain is extremely plastic.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.840
And a big part of their work

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.540
was to show that after a certain point,

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.920
the critical period shuts down,

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.760
essentially the brain can't
change or not nearly as much.

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.230
And then people came
along later and showed

01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:28.330
that you could open up these
critical periods again,

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:29.820
but very briefly,

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:34.220
and it takes a very specific
stimulus, essentially,

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.400
high degrees of focus, et cetera.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.380
However, there's a well-known
phenomenon in this literature

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:44.430
where if you take an
animal and to some degree,

01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:46.940
this has been shown in humans as well,

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.900
and you let them pass
through the critical period,

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.810
but then you essentially
sensory deprive them.

01:39:52.810 --> 01:39:56.270
You take away experience,
you close both eyes.

01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:59.030
You essentially reopen
the critical period.

01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:01.270
So it seems like I couldn't
help but mention this,

01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:02.530
that there's this parallel

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:04.440
between what we're talking
about here with fertility

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.330
and neuroplasticity, where yes,

01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:09.210
there is a timer where
certain things are available

01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:11.010
to the organism early in life,

01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:12.560
and then they tend to taper off.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.710
It's not an open and
shut, but they taper off.

01:40:14.710 --> 01:40:18.180
But then a deprivation
can actually reactivate

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.250
the availability of that process.

01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:22.860
Forgive me, I just couldn't
help him mention it,

01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:24.290
but to me,

01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:26.490
so both of those things
are associated with youth,

01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:28.310
fertility and neuroplasticity.

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:30.670
And so I think that
it'd be so interesting.

01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:32.110
I'd love to collaborate with you on this

01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:35.070
to explore how neuroplasticity
might actually be regulated

01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:37.520
by these things like the sirtuins.

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.810
- Right, and the sirtuins
do control memory

01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:41.970
in neurons as well.

01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:44.280
So what I think is really interesting

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.810
is that what we're learning from work

01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:48.210
that you and your colleagues have done

01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:49.790
and in my lab as well,

01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:52.870
is that the body has
remarkable powers of healing

01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:56.860
and recovering from illness and injury.

01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.920
And what we once thought
was a one-way street

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.150
and you just can't repair,

01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:03.320
or you can't get over these diseases,

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.620
you can reset the system,

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.540
and the body can really get rejuvenated

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.253
in ways that in the future will wonder,

01:41:08.253 --> 01:41:10.483
why didn't we work on this earlier?

01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:12.700
The future of humanity

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.130
is more like us walking
around like Deadpool.

01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:16.570
We'll probably be cleaner,

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.110
and we won't smell as badly,

01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:20.405
but Deadpool, if you don't know,

01:41:20.405 --> 01:41:22.510
can get injured and just recover.

01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:25.186
It's very hard to injure this guy,

01:41:25.186 --> 01:41:26.750
and we're going to be the same.

01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.870
There are many species
you cut off the limb,

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:29.730
the limb grows back.

01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:30.800
- Salamanders or.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.633
- Yeah.

01:41:31.633 --> 01:41:34.010
We are now learning how
to tap into that system.

01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:35.390
And in part, what we're doing

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:38.180
is reversing the age of those cells,

01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:41.210
and telling them how to read
the genes correctly again,

01:41:41.210 --> 01:41:43.710
reversing the age of that epigenome.

01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:45.530
And when you do that, the cells,

01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:48.320
the brain, for instance, the skin.

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.320
We did the optic nerve.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.830
- Let's talk about those
results for a second.

01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:53.150
Then I want to make sure that we return

01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:54.760
to some of these behavioral protocols.

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.850
You have this amazing paper
at the end of last year,

01:41:56.850 --> 01:42:00.160
cover article, full article in nature,

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.280
showing that essentially a small menu

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.490
of transcription factors,

01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:07.853
which control gene expression, et cetera,

01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:11.850
could essentially reverse
the age of neurons in the eye

01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:14.973
and rescue those cells against damage.

01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:18.810
Essentially allow blind mice to see again,

01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:21.610
and offset degeneration
of these retinal cells,

01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:26.610
incredible paper, and
such a boom to the field.

01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:30.130
Where does that stand now in
terms of human clinical trials?

01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.710
I mean, how do, what are you envisioning

01:42:32.710 --> 01:42:35.280
in terms of the trajectory of those data

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.690
from mice into human someday?

01:42:38.690 --> 01:42:43.510
- Right, well, to get to
the point immediately,

01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:48.510
we're going to be testing
the treatment on monkeys,

01:42:48.598 --> 01:42:50.850
just for safety reasons.

01:42:50.850 --> 01:42:55.210
And then the first patient
should be done sometime in 2022,

01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:58.590
early 2023, and we're going
to try to recover blindness.

01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:00.360
- This involves making an injection

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.730
of a virus into the eye, right?

01:43:02.730 --> 01:43:05.320
Right now, there's no
way that I am aware of

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.643
to manipulate these transcription factors

01:43:06.643 --> 01:43:08.587
through a pill or some other?

01:43:08.587 --> 01:43:10.500
- And that's why, we working on in my lab

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:11.780
at Harvard right now.

01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.613
So it will be-

01:43:12.613 --> 01:43:14.423
- It will base moderation of-

01:43:14.423 --> 01:43:15.550
- Well you pop a pill in the whole body

01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:16.980
gets rejuvenated by 20 years.

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:18.460
That's what we're aiming for.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:22.770
Now we do it with gene therapy
in the eye and other places.

01:43:22.770 --> 01:43:25.760
So in the IES, it's single injection,

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.160
the genes go into the retina
and we can turn it on,

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.240
with a drug called doxycycline.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.670
And we do that in the mice
for four to eight weeks,

01:43:34.670 --> 01:43:36.170
then the eye gets younger.

01:43:36.170 --> 01:43:38.950
We can measure that' cause
you can measure the clock.

01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:41.820
And then the vision
comes back in those mice.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:44.900
And I don't see any reason,
why it shouldn't work in people

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:48.410
because it's the same structures
and mechanisms that are

01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:49.900
on in the human as well.

01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:50.968
Now these-

01:43:50.968 --> 01:43:51.801
- And it's one injection.

01:43:51.801 --> 01:43:52.634
- It's one.

01:43:52.634 --> 01:43:53.630
- I should mention injections into the eye

01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:55.100
obviously nobody should do this

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.063
outside of a ophthalmology clinic.

01:43:58.319 --> 01:44:00.669
And there definitely by
an ophthalmologist but,

01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:04.660
the injections into the eye
are painless if done correctly

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:05.500
by the right person.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.420
It sounds dreadful, but it's actually,

01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.310
I've seen it done hundreds of times.

01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:11.420
I've done it, thousands of times

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.760
and it's not to myself,
but to other creatures.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.870
And there's a way of doing this

01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:17.911
as completely painless to the person-

01:44:17.911 --> 01:44:18.744
- Oh you don't feel it.

01:44:18.744 --> 01:44:20.290
It's a tiny, tiny needle too.

01:44:20.290 --> 01:44:21.670
But the great thing about this is that

01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:22.870
it's a one-time treatment.

01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:26.180
Those genes go into the back
of the eye and stay there,

01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.490
forever.

01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:29.880
And you can just turn
them on whenever you want.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.420
So what we found is you can
turn them on in the mice,

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.054
they get their vision back,

01:44:34.054 --> 01:44:35.480
and then you turn it off again.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.530
And so far, many months out,

01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:39.560
the benefit has remained,

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.320
but if it does decline,

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.650
we'll just turn it back
on and reset the system,

01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:45.170
rinse and repeat.

01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:46.600
So one day what's exciting is that

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.150
we could potentially do
this across the entire body

01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:52.700
and just take this antibiotic,

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:55.543
every five years and go
back time and time again.

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.620
- And thinking about the body

01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:00.530
and what's going on under
the head I'm amazed,

01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:03.960
still that there isn't a
simple, affordable technology

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.070
that would allow me to just
look into my body and see

01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:07.820
whether or not there are
any tumors growing anywhere.

01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:10.820
I mean, it's not that hard
to look into the body.

01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.510
I mean that the technology exists.

01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:14.610
why hasn't anybody created an at home

01:45:14.610 --> 01:45:17.900
or pseudo at home solution,
like a clinic where you can go

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.780
and pay 50 bucks or a hundred bucks

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.370
and see if you have any
tumors growing anymore.

01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:22.960
- Yeah, it's still expensive.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.390
You can get your doctor
to try to get you in,

01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:28.420
there's some companies
that offer blood tests

01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:30.290
that look at circulating DNA,

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:31.620
that'll measure it.

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:32.453
We're getting there.

01:45:32.453 --> 01:45:34.050
It's still probably five to 10 years away

01:45:34.050 --> 01:45:35.613
from being really cheap.

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:40.490
You can do things like a
colon cancer test at home.

01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:42.814
I think it's a hundred
and something dollars.

01:45:42.814 --> 01:45:46.210
You ship off your shit,
excuse my language,

01:45:46.210 --> 01:45:47.963
and they measure it.

01:45:47.963 --> 01:45:50.440
And they tell you if
you've got colon cancer,

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.010
with high probability,

01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:54.050
I did that during the pandemic

01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:55.650
because I didn't want
to get a colonoscopy.

01:45:55.650 --> 01:45:58.930
- Mhmh, is it more accurate or
as accurate as a colonoscopy?

01:45:58.930 --> 01:46:01.050
- I believe it's close
to being as accurate.

01:46:01.050 --> 01:46:03.280
The downside is that during a colonoscopy,

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.600
they can pinch off the polyps
that are looking dangerous,

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.780
whereas this obviously isn't that,

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.500
but it's certainly easier to do.

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.690
And my father who's
Australian tells me that

01:46:13.690 --> 01:46:14.860
it's free for Australians.

01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:17.050
They get this test routinely.

01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:18.893
- Mhmh, interesting.

01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:22.700
I want to return to the topic
that I took us away from.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.810
So I apologize, which
is behavioral protocols.

01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:28.350
Do you regularly do the cold shower thing?

01:46:28.350 --> 01:46:32.061
Ice baths, cold water swims,
are you into that whole biz?

01:46:32.061 --> 01:46:34.350
[David chuckles]

01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:37.060
- Well, you do know that
I've done it at least once

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:38.100
'cause we did it together.

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.206
- That's right.

01:46:39.206 --> 01:46:40.800
Not the same bath, just to be very clear,

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.408
same sauna, different ice baths,

01:46:42.408 --> 01:46:43.241
[David chuckles]

01:46:43.241 --> 01:46:44.110
the idea of Sinclair

01:46:44.110 --> 01:46:46.370
and Huberman taking an
ice bath together it's a,

01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:48.080
it might warm some people's hearts,

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.490
but just to be very clear, different,

01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:53.770
same ice bath, different, different times.

01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:55.530
- Yeah, thank you for clarifying.

01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:56.410
- [Andrew] Yeah.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:57.823
I don't do them regularly.

01:46:59.471 --> 01:47:01.393
I do try to sleep cool.

01:47:02.490 --> 01:47:04.270
I sleep better anyway.

01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:07.300
I try to dress without
a lot of warm clothes.

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.307
I'm here in a T-shirt and
it's middle of summer,

01:47:09.307 --> 01:47:12.332
but in winter, I'll try
to wear a T-shirt too.

01:47:12.332 --> 01:47:14.950
- So you're challenging your
system to thermoregulate?

01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:16.020
- Right, right.

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.050
I've got this,

01:47:17.050 --> 01:47:18.960
hypothesis with Ray Cronise.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.530
We published what's called The
Metabolic Winter Hypothesis,

01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:24.800
which is, few tens of
thousands of years ago,

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.120
we were either hungry or cold or both

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:28.800
and we really experience that now.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.700
And so, we try to give
ourselves the metabolic winter

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:35.830
and part of the problem I
think with the obesity epidemic

01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:37.580
is that we're never cold and cold,

01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.000
when you're cold you have to burn energy.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.910
It may be only slightly,
but over the whole night,

01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:42.930
if you're a little bit cool,

01:47:42.930 --> 01:47:44.330
you'll actually expend more energy.

01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:45.800
So I try to do that,

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.400
but I'm not a big fan of cold showers.

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:51.290
The sauna, I don't have access
to my gym as much as I did.

01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:53.320
So, but I do want to get back into it.

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.840
I used to do it regularly with my son

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.560
and I posted on Instagram once

01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.190
that he could stay in there for 15 minutes

01:47:59.190 --> 01:48:01.163
and I could only stay in for about three.

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.240
Anyway, long story short,

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.030
I try to compensate with
changes in my diet and exercise

01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:07.470
until I get back into it.

01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:10.400
- You reminded me of something
that I meant to ask earlier

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.283
that obesity reduces NAD
levels and accelerates aging.

01:48:15.370 --> 01:48:16.240
How?

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.073
I mean, okay.

01:48:17.073 --> 01:48:18.880
So again, this is the,

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.220
the scientist in the us,

01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:24.370
so someone's carrying a lot
of excess adipose tissues,

01:48:24.370 --> 01:48:26.120
subcutaneous and,

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:27.093
visceral fat.

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.890
But why should that reduce NAD in any ways

01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:34.810
that are independent of
effects on glucose and insulin?

01:48:34.810 --> 01:48:35.643
If it, you know,

01:48:35.643 --> 01:48:38.250
is there's something direct
about white adipose tissue.

01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:40.380
And the reason I ask this,

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:43.210
is not simply to dig into mechanism alone,

01:48:43.210 --> 01:48:45.130
but I think there are
really interesting data now

01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:47.490
that fat actually gets neural innervation.

01:48:47.490 --> 01:48:48.500
I mean,

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:49.849
it's not just a,

01:48:49.849 --> 01:48:51.790
it's not just stored fuel.

01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:52.820
It's stored fuel,

01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:55.790
that's acting as an
endocrine organ, essentially.

01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:57.430
So,

01:48:57.430 --> 01:49:00.563
why would being fat
make people age faster?

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:03.760
- Yeah, that's a question that,

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.250
is so obvious, but so few people ask it,

01:49:06.250 --> 01:49:08.390
that's what makes you a good scientist.

01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:09.830
And so that we don't know,

01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:12.273
but I'll give you my best
answer, which is that,

01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:16.313
obesity comes along with
a lot of problems that,

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:20.100
include a lot of senescent cells in fat,

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:23.840
if you stain old fat for
senescent cells, it lights up.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:24.673
- Mhmh.

01:49:24.673 --> 01:49:26.550
And when you kill off those cells,

01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:28.470
at least in mice, and maybe in humans,

01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:32.160
it looks like the fat is
less toxic to the body.

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.610
'Cause those senescent cells
in their fat are secreting

01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:36.020
these inflammatory molecules

01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.990
that will accelerate aging as we now know.

01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:41.813
We talk about the sirtuins in NAD.

01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:44.463
So if we,

01:49:44.463 --> 01:49:46.180
if we just look philosophically,

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:49.260
at why this would be the sirtuins only,

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:53.310
like to come on or get
activated when the body needs,

01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:55.140
is on the right adversity.

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:59.790
And if a cell is surrounded by
fat or contains a lot of fat,

01:49:59.790 --> 01:50:01.110
it's going to think times a good,

01:50:01.110 --> 01:50:02.230
it doesn't need to switch on.

01:50:02.230 --> 01:50:05.140
So that's the evolutionary argument.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.647
Mechanistically, we don't know,

01:50:06.647 --> 01:50:09.040
but it could have something to do with

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.420
the response to glucose,

01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:13.290
which then responds to the sirtuin gene,

01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:15.287
but that hasn't been worked out very well.

01:50:15.287 --> 01:50:16.910
- And is there any evidence that leptin,

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:19.250
this hormone from fat can actually,

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:21.323
interact with the sirtuin pathway?

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:23.670
- I don't recall seeing that-

01:50:23.670 --> 01:50:25.270
- Maybe I could do a
sabbatical in your lab

01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:26.930
and that'd be a fun one.

01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:27.770
- Definitely-

01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:29.850
- Because leptin during
development is what triggers,

01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:33.860
the permission for the hypothalamus
to enter puberty, right?

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:34.693
- Yeah.

01:50:34.693 --> 01:50:36.670
- This is why kids that eat
a lot when they're young

01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:39.160
and get overweight will also start to go

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.390
and undergo puberty more quickly,

01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:43.323
although they have
reproductive issues later.

01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:45.043
- Well yeah.

01:50:45.043 --> 01:50:47.290
We should study the
hypothalamus together 'cause,

01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:48.390
the hypothalamus is,

01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:50.210
can control the aging of the body.

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:52.074
- The most interesting part of the brain.

01:50:52.074 --> 01:50:52.907
[Andrew chuckles]

01:50:52.907 --> 01:50:53.740
- For sure.

01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:54.573
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:50:54.573 --> 01:50:55.560
- If you turn on the SIRT1 gene,

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.920
the SIRT2 that we work
on, in the hypothalamus

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.830
that actually, will extend lifespan.

01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:02.350
Also, it's been shown by Dongsheng Cai

01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:04.080
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.030
that if you, inhibit
inflammation in the hypothalamus,

01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:09.563
in a mouse, it will increase

01:51:09.563 --> 01:51:13.380
or maintain the expression
of what's called GnRH,

01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:15.540
which is the hormone that,

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.550
he found actually controls
longevity in the mouse in part.

01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:21.260
And so keeping inflammation
down in the hypothalamus,

01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.850
is sufficient to extend
the life span of animals.

01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:25.890
And I reviewed that paper for nature

01:51:25.890 --> 01:51:27.760
all about seven years ago.

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.250
And that was the first demonstration

01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:32.350
that the hypothalamus is one
of the leading regulators

01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:33.550
of the body's age.

01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:36.090
- I find this fascinating GnRH,

01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:38.470
for those of you that don't
know actually comes from neurons

01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:40.010
in the hypothalamus that then,

01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:42.270
literally reached down into the pituitary

01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:44.750
and trigger the release of
all the things that control

01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:46.700
fertility, luteinizing hormone,

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:48.690
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera.

01:51:48.690 --> 01:51:50.220
It's such a powerful set of neurons,

01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.980
and it's never really been clear,

01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:54.780
what at a behavioral level
triggers the release of GnRH.

01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:57.560
There's all the stories about pheromones

01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:59.360
and timers and puberty, et cetera,

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.450
but environmental conditions
and dietary conditions

01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:05.563
and behaviors that can
control GnRH release, I think,

01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:10.170
is an incredible area for exploration.

01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:12.520
I'd love to do that sabbatical by the way.

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:16.250
I have a couple, well
seemingly random questions,

01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:18.560
but I can't help, but ask
because one thing I like to do

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:22.600
is forage the internet for
practices that at least more than

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:23.680
a few people are doing,

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.480
and then wonder whether or
not there's any basis for it.

01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:31.600
You mentioned methylation
as a detrimental process,

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:35.090
the way it disrupts the
epigenome and the CD reader,

01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:36.580
so to speak.

01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:40.350
There are people out there who
are ingesting methylene blue.

01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:41.580
And when I was a kid,

01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:44.620
I used methylene blue
to clean my fish tank.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:45.870
And I love fish tanks.

01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:47.713
I know you're into aquaria also,

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:50.980
a different podcast episode,
we'll talk about aquaria,

01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:55.980
but why in the world, would
people ingest methylene blue?

01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:58.360
Meaning is their logic correct?

01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:01.760
And or is that a dangerous practice?

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.200
I'm not sure I'd want to
ingest methylene blue,

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.470
sounds not like a bad thing to do.

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:09.740
- It stains your body if you've
seen, yeah methylene blue-

01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:13.440
- Yeah, there was someone
in my lab as a postdoc

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.420
was using it to study a
completely different process

01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.610
related to the blood-brain barrier

01:53:17.610 --> 01:53:20.500
and used to inject into animals
and they would turn blue,

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:23.000
but then again, people
ingest colloid silver.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.450
You know they'll put
in there, there's this,

01:53:24.450 --> 01:53:25.870
please people don't do this

01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:27.563
or if you do, just don't tell me,

01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:29.950
'cause I won't like it.

01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:32.270
They, people put it in their eyes

01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:34.550
and some people actually stain their skin.

01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:38.330
They actually become kind of
a silver purple brown color

01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:39.670
if they do it excessively.

01:53:39.670 --> 01:53:42.080
I mean, there's a lot of
crazy stuff out there.

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.410
But what do you think they're thinking

01:53:44.410 --> 01:53:45.630
with this methylene blue thing

01:53:45.630 --> 01:53:48.130
or should we just get them
to a good psychiatrist?

01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:51.780
- I don't know, for sure.

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.060
I think methylene blue was found

01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:55.300
to extend the lifespan
of some lower organism

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:56.800
and that's where it came from.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.830
My recollection-

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.830
- With the emphasis on lower organisms.

01:53:59.830 --> 01:54:02.420
- Yes smaller organisms.

01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:04.833
I think doesn't, do you
remember Andrew does it,

01:54:04.833 --> 01:54:08.123
interrupt or interfere
with mitochondrial activity

01:54:08.123 --> 01:54:09.011
and that's-

01:54:09.011 --> 01:54:09.844
- Maybe that's why the are doing it.

01:54:09.844 --> 01:54:10.920
- Yeah.
- [Andrew] Okay.

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.660
- We need to look this up and post it.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.493
- [Andrew] Okay.

01:54:13.493 --> 01:54:15.370
- We'll get to the bottom
of this, but those methods,

01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:16.528
let's talk about those.

01:54:16.528 --> 01:54:17.400
- [Andrew] Yeah.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:19.870
- Those methods have to
be placed on the right,

01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:21.260
part of the genome.

01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:23.340
They get attached to the right
genes in the wrong genes.

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:26.070
And if you have a lot of methylation,

01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:27.823
it's going to mess up the epigenome.

01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:32.320
Smoking will do that, lack of
exercise, all that good stuff.

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.810
So you, what you actually want
to do is you want to measure it

01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:37.620
and make sure what you're
doing with your body,

01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:38.453
is working.

01:54:38.453 --> 01:54:39.870
How do you know that if you do this

01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:41.960
or that is actually helping.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.630
And so you can test your age.

01:54:43.630 --> 01:54:45.810
I could take, a swab from your mouth

01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:48.160
and tell you how old you are biologically.

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.380
And then we could work on
trying to bring that down

01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:53.440
and actually there were anecdotes now,

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.220
that people are reversing
their age by a decade or more

01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.340
just by doing some of the
things that we've talked about

01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.240
and some other cutting edge stuff

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.603
that I'm going to write about.

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.330
But yet, but you have to measure stuff.

01:55:07.330 --> 01:55:10.620
That's, I didn't want to
forget to bring that up.

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.970
I'm measuring stuff all the time.

01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:14.100
I have blood tests like you,

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.510
I've got this monitor that
stuck to my chest right now

01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:18.970
that's measuring myself
a thousand times a second

01:55:18.970 --> 01:55:20.690
and I measure my biological age.

01:55:20.690 --> 01:55:22.870
- What's it measuring a
thousand times a second?

01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:24.050
A huge list of things.

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.883
- Yeah, yeah.

01:55:24.883 --> 01:55:26.497
So this, this little device is stuck here

01:55:26.497 --> 01:55:29.510
and it's for two weeks
that you just recharge it

01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:30.810
or send it back and get a new one.

01:55:30.810 --> 01:55:33.360
It's got a body temperature movement,

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.620
heart rate variability.

01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:37.180
It's an FDA approved
device, it's not a toy.

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:40.530
It's not one of these recreational things.

01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:42.490
It also listens to my voice,

01:55:42.490 --> 01:55:44.780
eventually will me if
I need a psychiatrist

01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:46.423
or if I'm depressed,

01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:49.680
it will tell me how I sleep, obviously.

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.070
But when you put all that data together

01:55:51.070 --> 01:55:53.253
and it's individualized and anonymized,

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.950
it can now tell my doctor in real time,

01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:59.370
if I've got a cold that
needs an antibiotic,

01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:01.140
or it's just a virus.

01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:06.140
If I am suffering from COVID-19

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.830
or even if I'm going to have
a heart attack next week.

01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:12.260
And so these little devices
are going to be with us

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:14.910
all the time, instead of going
to your doctor once a year,

01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:16.073
which is ludicrous.

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.900
- I have to ask you about x-rays.

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:22.300
'Cause every time I go through
the scanner at the airport,

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:24.870
I think, "Sinclair would never do this."

01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:27.900
And the argument I heard
you give about this before

01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.950
was a really excellent one, which is that

01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:33.850
it's a low level amount of radiation,

01:56:33.850 --> 01:56:35.210
going through at the airport,

01:56:35.210 --> 01:56:36.333
but the argument is always,

01:56:36.333 --> 01:56:38.740
well, it's just as much as on the plane

01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:42.137
and your argument, your
counter-argument I should say was,

01:56:42.137 --> 01:56:44.390
"Well then why would I
want to do both, right?

01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:45.223
Why would?"

01:56:45.223 --> 01:56:47.230
So when you go to the airport,

01:56:47.230 --> 01:56:48.590
assuming you're not running late

01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:50.630
and you have to go
through the standard line,

01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:52.300
what do you say to them?

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:54.200
And do you say, "I'm David Sinclair."

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.890
And then they shuttle
you to your own line.

01:56:56.890 --> 01:56:57.723
What do you say?

01:56:57.723 --> 01:56:59.440
You do say, "I don't like this thing."

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:01.630
Do you have to give them a reason?

01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:02.463
- No, you don't.

01:57:02.463 --> 01:57:04.660
You can say, "I don't want this."

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:07.360
And they'll get annoyed
'cause it's hard for them

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.300
to pat you down,

01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:09.790
but you get a pat down and you you're done

01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:12.520
as long as you're not
in a hurry, it's fine.

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.900
If you want to pay for
the TSA Pre in America

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.350
or the way to get around those
scanners, you can do that.

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:20.120
So I travel a lot, so
it's worth it anyway,

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.633
but I just go through the metal detector,

01:57:21.633 --> 01:57:22.920
I don't get scanned.

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.470
- And the metal detector
doesn't have the same,

01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:26.490
same problem.

01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:28.450
And what about x-rays at the dentist?

01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:29.283
Yeah.

01:57:29.283 --> 01:57:31.230
- Well, you know one x-ray
is not going to kill you.

01:57:31.230 --> 01:57:32.650
Two's not going to kill you, but I-

01:57:32.650 --> 01:57:33.740
- Three will kill you.

01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:34.823
No, I'm just kidding.

01:57:34.823 --> 01:57:35.656
[Andrew chuckles]

01:57:35.656 --> 01:57:37.567
- I try to limit it
because it's cumulative.

01:57:37.567 --> 01:57:38.400
- Right.

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:42.210
- And I went for six years
without having a dental x-ray

01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:45.120
and then my last visit, I just gave up.

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:47.450
I was tired of arguing with my dentist.

01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:48.310
So they gave me one,

01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:50.130
but they've got led coats on

01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:52.410
and they put lead all over your body.

01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:54.460
That's telling you something right there.

01:57:55.690 --> 01:57:58.490
And funnily enough, my
teeth hadn't changed.

01:57:58.490 --> 01:58:00.217
Now you can balance that by saying,

01:58:00.217 --> 01:58:01.960
"Well, one x-ray, two x-ray,

01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.680
three x-rays is worth
it if I have cavities."

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.513
And that's true,

01:58:05.513 --> 01:58:07.410
you want to know what's in there,

01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:10.680
but doing it regularly, for me,

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.990
I don't think it was worth it because it,

01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:14.283
my teeth are in perfect
health and I've always been,

01:58:14.283 --> 01:58:17.070
I don't have any cavities,
didn't have braces,

01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:17.903
they're fine.

01:58:17.903 --> 01:58:18.900
So stop scanning me.

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.640
I mean, I know you have
to pay for the machine,

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.480
but you know, do I have a choice?

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.820
Yes, so stop pressuring me.

01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:26.980
- You know, who shared your
sentiments about x-rays

01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:28.640
and the dentist in general?

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:30.760
My apologies to the dentists out there,

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.913
was the great physicist, Richard Feynman.

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.530
This is a story about him that's
not especially well-known,

01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:41.010
but he had very serious
concerns, health concerns,

01:58:41.010 --> 01:58:44.230
about x-rays because he
understood the physics

01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:46.410
and he understood enough biology that,

01:58:46.410 --> 01:58:49.180
he was actually quite vocal about his,

01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:52.750
dislike of dental
technology and its dangers.

01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:54.540
And he talked about some of that.

01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:58.630
People can find that on
the internet, if they like.

01:58:58.630 --> 01:59:01.200
Speaking of people who,

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.710
are like Feynman,

01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:06.190
who've been engaged in public
discourse about science.

01:59:06.190 --> 01:59:08.270
One of the things that I
appreciate about you, in fact,

01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:10.070
the way that you and I,

01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:13.330
initially came to know one
another is through your

01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:15.880
public health education efforts.

01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:19.340
So, obviously we're doing this podcast,

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:20.910
you've done the Joe Rogan Podcast,

01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:23.670
Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse me Lex,

01:59:23.670 --> 01:59:24.700
I'm still adjusting that.

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.900
Lex Fridman's Podcast
and many other podcasts,

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:30.450
you've written an amazing book.

01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:33.170
What are you thinking these days

01:59:33.170 --> 01:59:36.983
in terms of what the
world needs in terms of,

01:59:38.210 --> 01:59:41.160
education from scientists,
education from MDs,

01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:44.883
education in general as it
relates to these things because,

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:49.730
I think if nothing else
2020 revealed to us that

01:59:49.730 --> 01:59:50.690
there's a gap,

01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:52.510
there's a gap in understanding.

01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:55.070
And that the scientists too are guilty of,

01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:57.990
not knowing what to do
with all the information

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.910
that's out there on pub med or elsewhere.

01:59:59.910 --> 02:00:01.440
I'm just, you know,

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.130
what are you thinking for
yourself and in general,

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:04.963
I'd like to just know,

02:00:04.963 --> 02:00:06.390
what do you think the world needs there?

02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:09.680
Maybe we can recruit some
more public educators.

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:10.870
- Yeah.

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:14.480
Well, we've gone from a
time, when you and I were,

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:17.770
in college and young
professors where the only way,

02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:20.460
to get our voice out to
the public was either

02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:24.760
through a newspaper or a
very short radio interview,

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:28.370
which for me was extremely
frustrating 'cause particularly

02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:31.060
the newspapers and my topic,

02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:33.430
every time was twisted into something that

02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:35.560
was not just embarrassing,
but Harvard university

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.520
used to bring me into the back office and-

02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.592
- Frankenstein.

02:00:38.592 --> 02:00:40.550
- "How did you say such a thing?

02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:41.540
We're all going to live to a 250."

02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.950
I didn't say that.

02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:45.780
So, we're now also in a world where

02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.660
we're overwhelmed with information,

02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:49.800
and most of it is wrong

02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:52.173
and anyone can pretend to be an expert.

02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:56.760
So we've gone from early
days to now the future,

02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.790
and we're experiencing it right now

02:00:58.790 --> 02:01:01.320
thanks to guys like you, people like you,

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.570
is that the experts, some experts,

02:01:03.570 --> 02:01:07.570
a small number who are
brilliant and good communicators

02:01:07.570 --> 02:01:09.420
are talking directly to the public.

02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:12.360
This has never been able to be possible,

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:15.510
until this time, right now.

02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:19.550
So another five years from
now, and certainly by 10 years,

02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:23.210
I would hope that there are
trusted sources of information

02:01:23.210 --> 02:01:28.210
of people who can not just
communicate, the ideas directly,

02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:31.910
but are able to talk about
things that are going on that

02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:33.677
aren't even published yet to say,

02:01:33.677 --> 02:01:35.710
"Here's what's really going on.

02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:38.000
And this is what the future looks like."

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.600
But this is somebody, like yourself

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.980
who spent their whole life
studying a particular topic

02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:45.350
and knows what they're talking about.

02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:46.183
And this,

02:01:46.183 --> 02:01:48.260
this is also something
that I think most people

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:52.140
don't know that we
scientists, if we tell a lie,

02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:53.300
we burst into flames,

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:56.487
we absolutely cannot tell
something, that's untrue.

02:01:56.487 --> 02:01:57.424
And to the best of our
knowledge, we say it as it is,

02:01:57.424 --> 02:01:59.984
because if we don't, we're beaten up,

02:01:59.984 --> 02:02:02.259
and we, or we kicked
out of the university.

02:02:02.259 --> 02:02:06.780
So the people who survive to our age,

02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:07.810
and I'm a little older than you.

02:02:07.810 --> 02:02:09.420
So I've survived a bit longer.

02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:11.216
- But a lot younger inside.

02:02:11.216 --> 02:02:12.139
[Andrew chuckles]

02:02:12.139 --> 02:02:12.972
- Nah, but we have to measure you with-

02:02:12.972 --> 02:02:13.805
- Yeah we need,

02:02:13.805 --> 02:02:15.940
I probably need a little
help, hopefully not too much.

02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:16.810
- We'll measure that,

02:02:16.810 --> 02:02:20.610
and we'll work on your
eating, but this is really,

02:02:20.610 --> 02:02:22.050
really important is that,

02:02:22.050 --> 02:02:25.420
finally people like your are
allowed by our universities

02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.960
to talk to the public.

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.530
I used to do it,

02:02:28.530 --> 02:02:30.700
with a real threat to my survival.

02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:31.533
People would look at me,

02:02:31.533 --> 02:02:33.750
"Oh, he's a salesman, he's
promoting this and that."

02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:35.910
It was seen as a real
negative, but finally,

02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:37.320
I think we're in a world where,

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.630
it's not negative anymore.

02:02:38.630 --> 02:02:42.380
And the pandemic showed that
we needed voices of reason,

02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:45.490
voices of fact, that you could trust.

02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:48.550
And you can see the
popularity of your podcast,

02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:50.450
shows that the public,

02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:52.950
they're desperate for
facts that they can trust,

02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:55.372
'cause they don't know
what to believe anymore.

02:02:55.372 --> 02:02:56.970
- Well,

02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:59.950
I'm being completely honest
when I say this, that,

02:02:59.950 --> 02:03:01.290
you know, I followed your lead.

02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:04.760
I saw you on the Joe Rogan
Podcast and my jaw dropped.

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.300
I was like, "This is amazing, like this."

02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:08.133
Because,

02:03:08.133 --> 02:03:10.210
you get out other good
scientists on before but,

02:03:10.210 --> 02:03:13.070
you're tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,

02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:14.700
Department of Genetics.

02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.300
And for those of you don't know,

02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:20.440
there's the Harvard and of
course, Harvard Medical School

02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.573
and they're both excellent, of course,

02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:26.400
but these are the top,
top tiers of academia.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.530
And I certainly understand
what it takes to get there

02:03:28.530 --> 02:03:30.720
and survive there and to thrive there,

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:32.370
it's like a game of pinball.

02:03:32.370 --> 02:03:33.203
You never win.

02:03:33.203 --> 02:03:34.540
You just, you just get to,

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.630
if you're doing really well,
you get to keep playing.

02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:38.600
And that's the truth in academia.

02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.973
And if you're not, you
stop playing basically.

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:45.070
But when I saw you,
explain what you were doing

02:03:45.070 --> 02:03:47.040
in a way that was accessible to people

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:48.630
and also talking about,

02:03:48.630 --> 02:03:51.310
possible protocols that they
might explore for themselves

02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:53.870
to see if those were, right for them.

02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:57.090
I was just, I was just
dazzled and excited,

02:03:57.090 --> 02:03:59.440
and I made every effort to
get in contact with you.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.290
And, the rest is history,

02:04:02.290 --> 02:04:05.800
but, I think what's really
exciting to me these days is

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.370
because of 2020 and with
everything that's happened

02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:09.870
and it continues to happen.

02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:12.270
There's a thirst for knowledge.

02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:15.420
There's also this direct
to the public route

02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.680
that you mentioned.

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.993
And, I think there's also an openness,

02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:21.760
I'd love your thoughts on this,

02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.540
but it seems to me that
there's an openness in,

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:26.190
from the general public,

02:04:26.190 --> 02:04:28.840
about health practices,

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.270
that there are actually things
that people can do to control

02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:33.830
their stress level, to control,

02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:36.500
their sleep, to control their cholesterol

02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:39.260
if that's what they to
do, maybe they don't

02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:41.840
and to even control their lifespan,

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.820
which I think is remarkable.

02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:47.070
And, I know I speak on
behalf of so many people,

02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:47.903
when I just,

02:04:47.903 --> 02:04:48.736
I want to say, thank you.

02:04:48.736 --> 02:04:51.340
You've, truly changed
the course of my life.

02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:53.270
I would not be sitting here doing this

02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:55.350
were it not for your example.

02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:58.760
And I always say Sinclair,
many people have written books,

02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:01.210
many academics have
written books, as you have,

02:05:01.210 --> 02:05:02.740
but in terms of doing podcasts

02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:05.010
and really getting out there
with your message in a way that

02:05:05.010 --> 02:05:07.140
I have to assume raised
your cortisol level

02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:08.833
and heart rate just a little bit,

02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.403
but you did it nonetheless.

02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:15.300
You are truly first man in and that,

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:17.280
that deserves a nod.

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.880
And, I have a great debt of
gratitude to you for that.

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.950
So thank you so much.

02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:21.910
- Oh thanks, Andrew.

02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:22.743
You're a,

02:05:22.743 --> 02:05:23.576
you've become a good friend

02:05:23.576 --> 02:05:26.060
and I'm super proud of what
you've done and what you,

02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:27.310
I know what you will do.

02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:29.090
- So in addition to your book

02:05:29.090 --> 02:05:32.780
and your presence on social
media, Instagram, and Twitter,

02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:34.670
and appearances on podcasts,

02:05:34.670 --> 02:05:37.320
recently I've noticed
that you've opened up,

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.253
a survey email/website
that people can, access,

02:05:42.250 --> 02:05:43.420
excuse me,

02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:45.700
to get some information
about their own health

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:46.830
and rates of aging.

02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:49.480
Tell us about that and
what's being measured.

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:53.160
And what is this test that
you've been working on,

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.703
secretly and now soon, not so secretly.

02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:58.120
- Yeah, well that,

02:05:58.120 --> 02:05:59.100
what I want,

02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:01.110
is a credit score for
the body to make it easy

02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:03.680
for people to follow their health.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:04.776
And there is a number,

02:06:04.776 --> 02:06:05.609
there's a,

02:06:05.609 --> 02:06:06.960
there's a biological age
that you can measure.

02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.793
Unfortunately,

02:06:07.793 --> 02:06:10.040
the test is many hundreds
of dollars right now,

02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:13.770
but in my lab, we've been
able to bring that down a lot.

02:06:13.770 --> 02:06:15.470
And so I want to democratize this test

02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:17.610
so that everybody has access to a score

02:06:17.610 --> 02:06:19.370
for their health that can predict their,

02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:23.320
not just their future
health and time of death,

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:24.790
but to change it.

02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:27.700
And I'm building a system
that will point people

02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:28.620
in the right direction

02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:30.640
and give them discounts for certain things

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:33.590
that will improve, not
just their health now,

02:06:33.590 --> 02:06:35.720
but 10, 20, 30 years into the future.

02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.960
And we can measure that,

02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:39.070
and very cheaply, keep
measuring it to know

02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:40.420
that you're on the right track,

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.500
'cause if you don't measure something,

02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:42.960
you can't optimize it.

02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.640
And so this is the biological age test,

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:47.660
we've developed it, it's
a simple mouth swab.

02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:49.000
We're rolling it out.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.040
We're building the system right now.

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.090
And there was a sign up sheet

02:06:52.090 --> 02:06:54.330
'cause a lot of people
want to get in line,

02:06:54.330 --> 02:06:56.050
go to doctorsinclair.com,

02:06:56.050 --> 02:06:57.530
you can get on that

02:06:57.530 --> 02:06:59.310
and you'll be one of the
first people in the world

02:06:59.310 --> 02:07:01.320
to get this test and see what we're doing.

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.230
- Oh, fantastic.

02:07:03.230 --> 02:07:06.220
Will people be celebrating their,

02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:08.040
biological age birthdays?

02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:10.690
In other words, if I'm
minus, like if I can imagine,

02:07:10.690 --> 02:07:12.640
so I'm 45 right now, soon to be 46.

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:13.473
But if I,

02:07:13.473 --> 02:07:17.400
if I were to be so lucky as
to get my biological age to 35

02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:20.390
within 12 months, maybe
you can help me do that.

02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:21.685
Do I get to celebrate,

02:07:21.685 --> 02:07:23.960
a negative birthday?

02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:24.793
- Absolutely.

02:07:24.793 --> 02:07:28.120
And my plan is that those
people who take their age back

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:31.890
a year or more, we think we can
go back 20 years eventually,

02:07:31.890 --> 02:07:33.270
they'll get a birthday card from me

02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:34.923
and it's a negative birthday card.

02:07:34.923 --> 02:07:35.820
[Andrew chuckles]

02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:36.653
- I love it.

02:07:36.653 --> 02:07:38.370
And probably very little,

02:07:38.370 --> 02:07:40.820
actual birthday cake being ingested but,

02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:42.930
who cares 'cause you're
living that much longer.

02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:44.691
- That's full of stevia,* that'll be fine.

02:07:44.691 --> 02:07:45.524
[Both chuckle]

02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:47.560
And thank you for talking to us today.

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:52.530
I realized I took us down deep
into the guts of mechanism

02:07:52.530 --> 02:07:55.950
and as well, talking
about global protocols,

02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:59.260
everything from what one can
do and take if they choose,

02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:01.500
that's right for them to,

02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:03.410
how to think about this
whole process that,

02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:07.021
that we talk about when
we talk about lifespan

02:08:07.021 --> 02:08:10.040
as always an incredibly illuminating.

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:11.120
Thank you, David.

02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:12.610
- Thanks Andrew.

02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:14.560
- Thank you for joining
me for my conversation

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.350
with Dr David Sinclair.

02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:18.960

Also, I teach science

02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:44.610
and science related tools on Instagram.

02:08:44.610 --> 02:08:46.180
It's hubermanlab on Instagram.

02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:48.770
I also have a Twitter

02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:50.120
So be sure to check those out.

02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:51.150
A lot of the material,

02:08:51.150 --> 02:08:52.960
covers things similar to the podcast,

02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.880
but oftentimes I'll
cover a unique material,

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.840
not featured at all on the podcast.

02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:00.070
So that's hubermanlab on
Instagram and on Twitter.

02:09:00.070 --> 02:09:01.680
In addition, we have a Patreon,

02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.320
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.460
And there you can support the podcast

02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:08.060
at any level that you like.

02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:10.015
Today, and in many other
previous episodes of

02:09:10.015 --> 02:09:11.630
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:09:11.630 --> 02:09:12.960
we discuss supplements.

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:16.160
While supplements aren't
necessary or right for everybody,

02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:18.920
many people derive tremendous
benefit from supplements.

02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:20.600
For that reason, we partnered with Thorne,

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.150
T-H-O-R-N-E,

02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:23.380
because Thorne Supplements

02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:25.080
are the absolute highest quality

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:27.180
and the absolute highest precision,

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:29.030
meaning what you see listed on the bottle

02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:30.370
is what's actually in the bottle,

02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:31.790
which is not the case

02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:33.610
for many supplement companies out there.

02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:36.150
Thorne is one of the
partners of the Mayo Clinic

02:09:36.150 --> 02:09:37.450
and all the major sports teams.

02:09:37.450 --> 02:09:40.730
And so they really are very
trusted, very highest quality.

02:09:40.730 --> 02:09:42.970
If you want to see the supplements
that I personally take,

02:09:42.970 --> 02:09:46.850
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:09:46.850 --> 02:09:48.500
and there you'll see the
supplements that I take,

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.970
you can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

02:09:50.970 --> 02:09:53.110
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site,

02:09:53.110 --> 02:09:54.120
through that portal,

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.510
you'll also get 20% off any
of the other supplements

02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:57.343
that Thorne makes.

02:09:57.343 --> 02:09:58.230
So again, it's Thorne,

02:09:58.230 --> 02:10:02.430
thorne.com/u/huberman

02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:05.650
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:08.240
Also take note that the
lifespan podcast featuring

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:10.130
Dr David Sinclair as a host,

02:10:10.130 --> 02:10:11.950
launches Wednesday, January 5th,

02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:13.580
you can find the first episode here

02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.450
on the Huberman Lab Podcast channel.

02:10:15.450 --> 02:10:17.810
They also have their
own independent channel.

02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:19.900
You can find the link to that
channel in the show notes.

02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:21.670
So please go there, subscribe on YouTube,

02:10:21.670 --> 02:10:23.560
also on Apple and Spotify.

02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.790
I've seen these episodes,
they are phenomenal,

02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:27.950
and you're going to learn
a tremendous amount,

02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:30.600
about aging and how to
slow and reverse aging

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.890
from the world expert
himself, Dr David Sinclair.

02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:35.990
And last, but certainly not least,

02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:37.173
thank you for your interest in science.

02:10:37.173 --> 02:10:39.756
