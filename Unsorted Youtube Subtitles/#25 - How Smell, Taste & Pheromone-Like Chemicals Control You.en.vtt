00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.420
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.427
where we discuss science

00:00:03.427 --> 00:00:05.875
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:09.220
[gentle music]

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.720
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.660
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.700
This podcast is separate

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.000
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.910
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.610
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.710
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.580
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.730
Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.400
that in my opinion are the
absolute best out there.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.640
The sunglasses and eyeglasses
that are made by Roka

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
have a number of properties
that are really unique.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.760
First of all, they're
extremely lightweight,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.850
you never even notice
that they're on your face.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.030
Second, the optical clarity is fantastic.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.950
One of the things that's
really hard to accomplish,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.220
but that Roka succeeded in accomplishing

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.140
is making sunglasses that you can wear

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.950
in lots of different environments.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.460
As you move from bright to
shadowed regions for instance,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.800
or as the amount of sunlight changes

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.410
many eyeglasses will make it such

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.720
that it's hard to see your environment

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.290
and you need to take the eyeglasses off,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.060
or you can't see or detect borders.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.030
With Roka sunglasses,
all of that is seamless,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
they clearly understand
the adaptation mechanisms

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.120
and habituation mechanisms,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.520
all these fancy details
about the human visual system

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.670
have allowed them to design a sunglass

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.250
that allows you to be in any environment

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.593
and to see that
environment extremely well.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.910
The eyeglasses are terrific,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.210
I wear readers at night

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.440
and again, they just make the
whole experience of reading

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.640
or working on a screen
at night very, very easy,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.850
very easy on the eyes.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.120
The aesthetic of the eyeglasses

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.150
and sunglasses is also suburb.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.250
You know, I chuckle sometimes

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580
when I see sports frames
or sports glasses,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.580
a lot of them just look
ridiculous frankly,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.950
but the Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.130
have a terrific aesthetic,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.220
they have a huge variety to select from.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.760
If you'd like to try Roka glasses,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.940
you can go to Roka,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.320
that's roka.com and
enter the code Huberman

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.540
and you'll get 20% off your first order,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.010
that's roka.com and
enter the code Huberman

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.230
to get 20% off your first order.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.723
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:11.370
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.180
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.770
to help you better understand your body

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.930
and help you reach your health goals.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.560
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.290
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.490
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.950
can only be detected from
a quality blood test.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.360
One of the major problems
with blood tests however

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.200
is that oftentimes you'll
get information back

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.250
about levels of metabolic
factors, hormones, et cetera,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.650
and there won't be any directives

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.750
about what to do with that information.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.770
With InsideTracker, it
makes all of that very easy.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.480
First of all, they can come to your home

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.210
to do the blood test and DNA test

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.480
or you can go to a local clinic,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.780
they make that very easy.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.280
Second of all, when you
get the information back

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.580
about the levels of hormones,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.030
and metabolic factors, and
other things in your blood

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.350
it gives you simple directives.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.070
They have a dashboard
that allows you to assess

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.200
for instance, whether or not
you ought to make changes

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.590
in your nutrition, or
changes in your exercise,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.340
or changes in your sleep regimen,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.020
any number of different lifestyle factors

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.440
that can help bring the
markers and the various factors

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.540
in your blood and DNA to
the appropriate levels.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.000
So, really they're putting you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.880
in the driver's seat for your health.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.520
In fact, one of the
listeners of this podcast

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.100
contacted me recently and said
I took an InsideTracker test,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.660
I felt like I was in great health,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.370
but I noticed from the test

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.150
that I had high CRP, C-reactive protein.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.130
C-reactive protein is a
marker that if it's too high

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.320
is a cautionary note

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.530
about various cardiac
and even eye diseases,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.390
so it's something that they
are now taking actions on

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.560
as a consequence of getting
their blood work done

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.940
and taking the InsideTracker test.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.360
So, I think that's just
one of many examples

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.320
that we hear about.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.620
I have examples from my own life

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.227
for instance of different
factors in my blood being off

00:03:53.227 --> 00:03:55.550
and making adjustments to nutrition

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.680
and other aspects of my life

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.220
that have allowed me to bring
those into the proper range.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.609
So, if you care about your health

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.970
InsideTracker may very
well be right for you.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.920
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.940
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.070
And if you do that, you'll get 25% off

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.860
any of InsideTracker's plans,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.320
just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.360
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.580
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.630
mineral probiotic drink.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.800
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.550
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.920
Athletic Greens is terrific

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.640
because it covers your nutritional bases.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.120
If I drink Athletic Greens once

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.330
and I sometimes drink it twice a day,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.950
then I'm sure that all
the vitamins I need,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.783
I'm getting those.

00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:40.150
All the minerals I
need, I'm getting those,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.670
and the probiotics.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.340
There's now a ton of data

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.810
showing that a healthy gut microbiome

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.560
is vital to brain function,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.880
vital to immune function,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.290
and vital to all aspects of our health.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.210
So with Athletic Greens,
you get the vitamins,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.140
the minerals, and the probiotics
to cover all your bases.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.180
In fact, anytime people ask
me what should they take

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.190
or what could they do
to support their health,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.880
provided that they
already have their sleep

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.800
and other aspects of their life in order,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800
Athletic Greens is the
thing that I recommend

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.250
because it covers all the
foundations, all the bases

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.410
of what one really wants from a supplement

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.520
without having to take a
ton of different things.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.800
It also tastes great,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.220
almost everybody that tries it

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.040
and then reported back to me has told me

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.390
that they really liked the taste.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.610
I mix mine with water,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.910
a little bit of lemon and lime juice,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.310
and I really like the
taste, it's delicious to me.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.330
I drink it once or twice a day.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.670
It's keto compatible,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.950
it's compatible with
most fasting regimens,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.520
it's compatible with if you're a vegan

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.980
or if you're not vegan, it's compatible

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.930
with essentially every
nutritional plan out there,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.430
so it's just a terrific
all around supplement

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.280
and benefit to one's health and diet.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.710

to claim that special offer.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.230
This month, we've been
talking about the senses,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.320
how we detect things in our environment.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.700
The last episode was all about vision,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.810
how we take light and
convert that information

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.600
into things that we can perceive

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.110
like colors, and faces, and motion,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.943
things of that sort

00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:21.800
as well as how we use
light to change our biology

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.240
in ways that are subconscious
that we don't realize,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.720
things like mood, and metabolism,
and levels of alertness.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.580
Today, we're going to talk
about chemical sensing,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.360
we're going to talk
about the sense of smell,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.720
our ability to detect
odors in our environment.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.680
We're also going to talk about taste,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.310
our ability to detect chemicals

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.900
and make sense of chemicals
that are put in our mouth

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.810
and into our digestive tract.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.770
And we are going to talk about chemicals

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.270
that are made by other human beings

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.030
that powerfully modulator
the way that we feel,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.510
our hormones, and our health.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.090
Now, that last category are
sometimes called pheromones.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.170
However, whether or not
pheromones exist in humans

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.600
is rather controversial,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.240
there actually hasn't been a clear example

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.000
of a true human pheromonal effect,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.200
but what is absolutely
clear, what is undeniable

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.100
is that there are chemicals
that human beings make

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.580
and release in things
like tears onto our skin,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.120
and sweat, and even breath
that powerfully modulate

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.160
or control the biology
of other individuals.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.720
In fact right now, even if
you're completely alone,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.270
your chemical environment
internally is being controlled

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.160
by external chemicals,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.370
your nervous system, and your
hormones, and your metabolism

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.200
are being modified by
things in your environment,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.080
so we're going to talk about those.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.350
It's an absolutely fascinating
aspect to our biology,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.090
it's one of our most primordial,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.450
meaning primitive aspects of our biology,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.653
but it's still very
active in all of us today.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.740
This episode, believe it or not,

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.673
will have a lot of tools,
a lot of protocols.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.320
Even though I'm guessing most of you

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.220
can probably smell your
environment just fine,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.420
that you know what you like
to eat and what tastes good,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.870
and what doesn't taste good to you,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.770
today's episode is going
to talk about tools

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.550
that will allow you to actually leverage

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.300
these chemical sensing mechanisms,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.610
including how you smell

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.007
not how you smell in
the qualitative sense,

00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:28.210
but how you smell in the verb sense,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.930
the action of sniffing and smelling

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.310
to enhance your sense of smell

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.550
and to enhance your
sense of taste as well,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.010
believe it or not, to
enhance your cognition,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.560
your ability to learn and remember things.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.270
Everything we're going
to talk about as always

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.630
is grounded in quality
peer-reviewed studies

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.510
from some excellent laboratories,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.440
I'll provide some resources along the way,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.100
so that means tools and protocols

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.933
and also basic information.

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.680
You're going to learn
a ton of neuroscience

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.810
and lot of biology in general.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.160
And I think what you'll
come to realize by the end

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.300
is that while we are clearly different

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.770
from the other animals,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.740
there are aspects to our
biology that are very similar

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.430
to that of other animals
in very interesting ways.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.660
Before we dive into chemical sensing,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.620
I want to just briefly
touch on a few things

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.390
from the vision episode.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.020
One is a summary of a protocol.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.930
So, I covered 13 protocols last episode,

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.050
if you haven't seen that
episode, check it out.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.570
Those protocols will
allow you to be more alert

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.010
and to see better over
time if you follow them.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.120
All of them are zero cost,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.350
you can find any and all
of them at hubermanlab.com,

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.610
there's a link to those videos
and tools and protocols,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.910
everything is timestamped.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.640
The two protocols that I just
want to remind everybody of

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.670
are the protocol of near-far
viewing that all of us

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.110
regardless of age, should
probably spend about five minutes

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.770
three times a week, doing some
near-far viewing exercises.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.780
So, that would be bringing a pen or pencil

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.420
up close to the point where
you're about to cross your eyes,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.130
but you don't cross your eyes

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.840
and then out at some distance.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.580
And then look beyond that pen

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.280
or other object that you're using

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.120
off as far as you can into the distance.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.280
It would be great if you could
do this on a balcony or deck

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.900
and then look way off in the distance

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.150
and then bring it back in.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.080
This is going to exercise
that accommodation reflex,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.010
the change in the shape of the lens

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.330
can help offset a number of things

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.760
including myopia, near-sightedness.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.620
The other one is this incredible study

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.670
that showed that two hours a day outside,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.180
even if you're doing other
things while you're outside

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.300
can help offset myopia, nearsightedness.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.700
So, try and get outside,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.920
it's really the sunlight
and the blue light, right?

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.660
Everyone's been demonizing
blue light out there,

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.960
but blue light is great

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.810
provided it's not super, super bright

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.180
and really close to your eyes.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.070
Blue is terrific if it
comes from sunlight.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.390
Two hours a day outside

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.390
is going to help offset
myopia, nearsightedness.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.390
Now, that's a lot of time,

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.560
I think most of us are
not getting that time,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.840
but since you can do other
things like gardening,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.170
or reading, or walking, or running.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.770
If you can get that two hours outside

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.080
your visual system and
your brain will benefit.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.190
I also would like to
make one brief correction

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.380
to something that I said incorrectly

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.100
in the previous episode.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.520
At the end of the episode,
I talked about lutein,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.600
and how lutein may help offset

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.490
some moderate to severe
age-related macular degeneration.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.910
As well, I talked about how some people

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.550
are supplementing with lutein

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.750
even though they don't have
age-related macular degeneration

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.800
with the idea in mind

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.210
that it might help offset some vision loss

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.780
as they get older.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.310
I said lutein, and lutein
was the correct thing to say,

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.970
but once or twice, when
I started speaking fast

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.480
I said leucine and not lutein.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.790
I want to emphasize that leucine,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.560
an amino acid, very interesting,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.550
important for muscle building
covered in previous episodes,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.250
but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.910
is the molecule and compound
that I was referring to

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.540
in terms of supplementing
for sake of vision.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.560
So I apologize, please
forgive me I misspoke,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.960
a couple of you caught that right away,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.860
in listening to the
episode after it went up

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.670
I realized that I had misspoken.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.530
So, lutein for vision,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.550
leucine for muscles, and muscle growth,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.160
and strength, et cetera.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.080
Before we dive into the
content of today's episode,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.840
I want to just briefly
touch on color vision.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.420
Many of you asked questions
about color vision

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.850
and color perception.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.280
And indeed color perception
is a fascinating aspect

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.120
of the human visual system,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.180
it's one of the things
that makes us unique.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.400
There are certainly
other animals out there

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.560
that can detect all the
colors of the rainbow,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.940
some can even detect into the
infrared, into the far-red

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.440
that we can't see,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.190
but nonetheless, human color vision,

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.190
provided that somebody isn't colorblind,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.100
is really remarkable.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.200
And if you're interested in color vision

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.900
or you want to answer questions

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.630
about art or about for instance

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.590
why that dress that showed
up online a few years ago

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.200
looks blue to you and
yellow to somebody else.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.010
All the answers to that
are in this terrific book

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.690
which is "What Is Color?:

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.480
50 Questions and Answers
on the Science of Color".

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.870
I did not write this book, I wish I had,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.630
the book is by Arielle and Joann Eckstut,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.420
that E-C-K-S-T-U-T.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.800
So, it's "What Is Color?:

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.650
50 Questions and Answers
on the Science of Color".

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.130
It's an absolutely fabulous book,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.240
I've no business relationship to them.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.330
I did help them get in contact

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.900
with some color vision scientists

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.330
when they reached out to me.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.300
And you can know that all
the information in the book

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.210
was vetted by excellent
color vision scientists.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.120
It's a really wonderful
and beautiful book,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.630
the illustrations are beautiful.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.320
If you're somebody who's
interested in design or art,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.400
or you're just curious
about the science of color,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.430
it's a terrific book,
I highly recommend it.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.880
If you just look it up online,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.270
there are a variety of places

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.240
that will allow you to access the book.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.430
So, let's talk about sensing chemicals

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.563
and how chemicals control us.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440
In our environment,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.750
there are a lot of
different physical stimuli.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.230
There is light,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.050
photons, which are light energy

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.550
and those land on your retinas

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.060
and your retinas tell
your brain about them,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.940
and your brain creates
this thing we call vision.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.030
There are sound waves,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.680
literally particles moving through the air

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.130
and reverberations that create

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.570
what we call sound and hearing.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.310
And of course there
are mechanical stimuli,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.370
pressure, light touch, scratch,

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.770
tickle, et cetera, that lands on our skin

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.070
or the blowing of a breeze

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.440
that deflects the hairs on our skin,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.440
and we can sense mechanical
touch, mechanical sensation.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.210
And there are chemicals,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.760
there are things floating
around in the environment

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.650
which we call volatile chemicals.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.900
So, volatile sounds oftentimes
like emotionally volatile,

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.410
but it just means that they're
floating around out there.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.030
So, when you actually smell something

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.760
like let's say you smell

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.770
a wonderfully smelling rose or cake.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.000
Yes, you are inhaling the
particles into your nose,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.570
they're literally little particles

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.250
of those chemicals are
going up into your nose

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.883
and being detected by your brain.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.350
Also, if you smell something putrid,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.890
disgusting, or awful,
use your imagination,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.780
those particles are
going up into your nose

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.593
and being detected by neurons
that are part of your brain.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.460
Other ways of getting
chemicals into our system

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.460
is by putting them in our mouth,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.550
by literally taking
foods and chewing them,

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.810
or sucking on them and breaking them down

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.440
into their component parts,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.350
and that's one way that we sense chemicals

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.050
with this thing, our tongue.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.140
And there are chemicals that can enter

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.650
through other mucosal linings

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.070
and other kind of just think damp,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.390
sticky linings of your body.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.810
And the main ones would be the eyes,

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.900
so you've got your nose,
your eyes and your mouth.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.640
But mainly when we have
chemicals coming into our system

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.320
it's through our nose
or through our mouth.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.880
Although, sometimes through our skin

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.270
certain things can go
transdermal, not many,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.090
and through our eyes.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.440
So these chemicals,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.370
we sometimes bring into
our body, into our biology,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.930
through deliberate action.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.810
We select a food, we chew that food,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.960
and we do it intentionally.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.140
Sometimes they're coming into our body

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.860
through non-deliberate action.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.490
We enter an environment,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.560
and there's smoke and we smell the smoke,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.300
and as a consequence we take action.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.500
Sometimes we are forced to eat something

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.310
because somebody tells us we should eat it

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.820
or we do it to be polite.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.653
So, there are all these ways

00:16:45.653 --> 00:16:48.520
that chemicals can make it into our body.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.840
Sometimes however, other people

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.770
are actively making
chemicals with their body,

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.550
typically this would be with their breath,

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.330
with their tears,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.830
or possibly, I want to
underscore possibly,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.530
by making what are called pheromones,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.590
molecules that they release
into the environment

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.730
typically through the breath

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.370
that enter our system through our nose,

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.070
or our eyes, or our mouth

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.123
that fundamentally change our biology.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.400
I will explain how smell and taste

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.840
and these pheromone effects work,

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.310
but I'll just give an example,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.460
which is a very salient
and interesting one

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.470
that was published about 10 years ago

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.000
in the Journal Science.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.830
Science Magazine is one of the three

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.090
what we call apex journals.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.410
There are a lot of journals out there,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.810
but for those of you that want to know,

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:40.390
Science Magazine, Nature
Magazine, and Cell

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.590
are considered the three
top kind of apex journals,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.000
they are the most stringent

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.760
in terms of getting papers accepted,

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.730
they're even reviewed there.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:53.410
They have about a 95% rejection
rate at the front gate,

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.370
meaning they don't even review 95%

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.680
of what gets sent to them.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.170
Of the things that they
do decide to review

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.300
then get sent out,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.510
a very small percentage
of those get published,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.800
it's very stringent.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.490
This paper came out in Science

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.350
showing that humans, men in
particular in this study,

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.460
have a strong biological
response and hormonal response

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.310
to the tears of women.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.790
What they did is they had women,

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.500
and in this case it was only
women for whatever reason,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.470
cry and they collected their tears.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.120
Then those tears were
smelled by male subjects,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.590
or male subjects got what
was essentially the control,

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.270
which was the saline.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:43.050
Men that smelled these tears
that were evoked by sadness

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.530
had a reduction in their
testosterone levels

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.210
that was significant.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.770
They also had a reduction in brain areas

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.590
that were associated with sexual arousal.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.360
Now, before you run off
with your interpretations

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.440
about what this means
and criticize the study

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.210
for any variety of reasons,
let's just take a step back.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.210
I will criticize the study
for a variety of reasons too.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.550
One is that they only used
female tiers and male subjects,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.450
so it would have been nice for
them to also use female tears

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.100
and female subjects smelling those,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.800
male tears and male
subjects smelling those,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.290
male tears and female subjects
smelling those, and so on.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.450
They didn't do that,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.940
they did have a large number of subjects,

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.203
so that's good, that
adds power to the study.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.280
And they did have to collect these tears

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.730
by having the women watch
what was essentially

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.420
a sad scene from a movie.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.960
They actually recruited subjects
that had a high propensity

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.600
for crying at sad movies,
which was not all women.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.120
It turns out that the
people that they recruited

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.270
for the study were people who said, "Yes,

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.430
I tend to cry when I see
sad things in movies."

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.263
What they're really trying to do

00:19:49.263 --> 00:19:53.430
is get just get tears that
were authentically cried

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.250
in response to sadness,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.420
as opposed to putting
some irritant in the eye

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.210
and collecting tears that
were evoked by something else

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.780
like just having the eyes irritated.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.360
Nonetheless, what this study illustrates

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.750
is that there are chemicals in tears

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.500
that are evoking or changing the biology

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.560
of other individuals.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.740
Now, most of us don't think about sniffing

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.940
or smelling other people's tears,

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.110
but you can imagine how in close couples,

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.200
or in family members,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.730
or even close friendships, et cetera,

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.780
that we are often in close proximity

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.590
to other people's tears.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.140
Now, I didn't select
this study as an example

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.110
because I want to focus on the effects

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.240
of tears on hormones, per se,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.860
although I do find the
results really interesting.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.360
I chose it because I
wanted to just emphasize

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.710
or underscore the fact

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.670
that chemicals that are
made by other individuals

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.760
are powerfully modulating
our internal state,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.330
and that's something that
most of us don't appreciate.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.540
I think most of us can appreciate the fact

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.100
that if we smell something
putrid, we tend to retract,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.770
or if we smell something
delicious, we tend to lean into it.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.790
But there are all these
ways in which chemicals

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.350
are affecting our biology,

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.650
and interpersonal
communication using chemicals

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.560
is not something that we
hear that often about,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.910
but it's super interesting.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.250
So, let's talk about smell

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.340
and what smell is and how it works.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.940
I'm going to make this very basic,

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.090
but I am going to touch on
some of the core elements

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.550
of the neurobiology.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.690
So, here's how smell works.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.610
Smell starts with sniffing.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.240
Now, that may come as no surprise,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.210
but no volatile chemicals
can enter our nose

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.660
unless we inhale them.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.930
If our nose is occluded, or
if we're actively exhaling

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.270
it's much more difficult for
smells to enter our nose,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.700
which is why people cover their nose

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.420
when something smells bad.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.440
Now, the way that these volatile odors

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.180
come into the nose is interesting.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.440
The nose has a mucosal lining,

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.190
mucus that is designed to trap things,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.223
to actually bring things
in and get stuck there.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.540
At the base of your brain,

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.630
so you could actually imagine this

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.927
or if you wanted, you could
touch the roof of your mouth.

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:11.180
So, right above the roof of the mouth,

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.540
about two centimeters
is your olfactory bulb.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.660
The olfactory bulb is
a collection of neurons

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.410
and those neurons actually
extend out of the skull,

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.100
out of your skull into your nose

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.760
into the mucosal lining.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.370
So, what this means in
kind of a literal sense

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.090
is that you have neurons that extend

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.360
their little dendrites
and axon-like things,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.330
they're little processes as we call them,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.330
out into the mucus,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.170
and they respond to
different odorant compounds.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.090
Now, the olfactory neurons

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.220
also send a branch deeper into the brain

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.930
and they split off into
three different paths.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.930
So, one path is for what we
call innate odor responses,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.260
so you have some hard wired aspects

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.130
to the way that you smell the world

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.160
that were there from the day you were born

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.910
and that will be there
until the day you die.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.730
These are the pathways and
the neurons that respond

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.210
to things like smoke,

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.470
which as you can imagine there's
a highly adaptive function

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.730
to being able to detect burning things

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.860
because burning things
generally means lack of safety

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.973
or impending threat of some kind.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.670
It calls for action,

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.570
and indeed these neurons project

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.210
to the central area of the
brain called the amygdala,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.100
which is often discussed in terms of fear,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.980
but it's really fear and threat detection.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.660
So some compounds, some
chemicals in your environment

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.930
when you smell them, unless
you're trained to overcome them

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.750
because you're a firefighter

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.960
you will naturally have a
heightened level of alertness,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.030
you will sense threat,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.090
and if you're in sleep,
even it will wake you up.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:52.990
All right, so that's a good thing,

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.180
it's kind of an emergency system.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.720
You also have neurons in your nose

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.160
that respond to odorants

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.130
or combinations of odorants
that evoke a sense of desire

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.530
and what we call appetitive
behaviors, approach behaviors,

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.700
that make you want to
move toward something.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.690
So, when you smell a delicious cookie,

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.390
or some dish that's really
savory that you really like,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.363
or a wonderful orange,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.800
and you say, "Mmm,"

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.330
or it feels delicious,
or it smells delicious

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.220
that's because of these innate pathway,

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.660
these pathways that require
no learning whatsoever.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.250
Now, some of the pathways from the nose,

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.210
these olfactory neurons into the brain

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.280
are involved in learned
associations with odors.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.970
Many people have this experience

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.730
that they can remember the smell

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.560
of their grandmother's home,

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.140
or their grandmother's hands even,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.560
or the smell of particular items baking,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.870
or on the stove in a
particular environment.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.850
Typically, these memories tend
to be of a kind of nurturing

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.490
sort of feeling safe and protected.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.370
But one of the reasons why olfaction smell

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.310
is so closely tied to memory

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.880
is because olfaction is the
most ancient sense that we have,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.270
or I should say chemical sensing
is among the most primitive

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.400
and ancient senses that we have,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.110
probably almost certainly evolved

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.140
before vision and before hearing.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.010
But when we come into the world

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.030
because we're still learning
about the statistics of life

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.410
about who's friendly
and who's not friendly,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.830
and where's a fun place to be

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.890
and where's a boring place to be,

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.600
that all takes a long time to learn.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.720
But the olfactory system seems to imprint,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.900
seems to lay down memories very early

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.380
and create these very
powerful associations.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.120
And if you think about it
long enough and hard enough

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.170
many of you can probably realize

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.540
that there are certain
smells that evoke a memory

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.800
of a particular place,
or person, or context.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.870
And that's because you also
have pathways out of the nose

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.930
that are not for innate
behaviors like cringing,

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.850
or repulsion, or gagging,

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.410
or for that appetitive mmm sensation,

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.620
but that just remind you of a place,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.430
or a thing, or a context,

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.270
could be flowers in spring,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.140
could be grandmother's home and cookies.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.620
This is a very common occurrence,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.960
and it's a very common occurrence

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.340
because this generally
exists in all of us.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.730
So, we have pathway for innate responses

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.620
and a pathway for learned responses.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.090
And then we have this other pathway,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.120
and in humans it's a
little bit controversial

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.410
as to whether or not
it sits truly separate

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.890
from the standard olfactory system

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.460
or whether or not it's its
own system embedded in there,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.470
but that they call the
accessory olfactory pathway.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.720
Accessory olfactory pathway
is what in other animals

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.010
is responsible for true pheromone effects.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.140
We will talk about true pheromone effects,

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.470
but for example in rodents

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.990
and in some primates, including mandrills.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.890
If you've ever seen a mandrill,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.040
they have these like
big beak noses things,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.970
you may have seen them at the zoo,

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.540
look them up if you
haven't seen them already,

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.930
M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.320
mandrills, there are
strong pheromone effects.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.160
Some of those include things like

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.910
if you take a pregnant
female rodent or mandrill,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.480
you take away the father
that created those

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.960
fetuses or fetus,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.100
and you introduce the scent of the urine

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.880
or the fur of a novel male,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.457
she will spontaneously abort
or miscarry those fetuses,

00:27:43.457 --> 00:27:45.453
it's a very powerful effect.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.400
In humans, it's still controversial

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.470
whether or not anything
like that can happen,

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.600
but it's a very powerful
pheromonal effect in other animals.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.050
Another example of a pheromone effect

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.560
is called the Vandenbergh effect

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.150
named after the person who
discovered this effect,

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.970
where you take a female

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.200
of a given species that
has not entered puberty,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.040
you expose her to the scent or the urine

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.850
from a sexually competent,
meaning post-pubertal male,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.780
and she spontaneously
goes into puberty earlier.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.960
So, something about the scent

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.200
triggers something through this
accessory olfactory system,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.120
this is a true pheromonal effect

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.880
and creates ovulation,
right and menstruation.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.380
Or in rodents it's an estrous
cycle, not a menstrual cycle.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.430
So, this is not to say
that the exact same things

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:37.263
happen in humans.

00:28:37.263 --> 00:28:39.100
In humans, as I mentioned earlier,

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.520
there are chemical sensing
between individuals

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.550
that may be independent of the nose.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.240
And we will talk about those,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.320
but those are basically the three paths

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.840
by which smells, odors impact us.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.990
So, I want to talk about
the act of smelling,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.830
and if you are not somebody who
is very interested in smell,

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.370
but you are somebody who is interested

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.230
in making your brain work better,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.830
learning faster, remembering more things,

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.020
this next little segment is for you

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.780
because it turns out that how you smell,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.810
meaning the act of smelling,
not how good or bad you smell,

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.920
but the act of smelling,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.790
sniffing, and inhalation
powerfully impacts

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.240
how your brain functions

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.970
and what you can learn
and what you can't learn.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.740
Breathing generally
consists of two actions,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.690
inhaling and exhaling,

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.020
and we have the option of course

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.260
to do that through our nose or our mouth.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.280
I've talked on previous
episodes about the fact

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.310
that there are great advantages
to being a nasal breather,

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.040
and there are a great disadvantages

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.250
to being a mouth breather.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.230
There are excellent
books and data on this,

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.760
there's the recent book
"Breath" by James Nestor,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.410
which is an excellent book

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.640
that describes some of
the positive effects

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.520
of nasal breathing as well
as other breathing practices.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.190
There's also the book
"Jaws" by my colleagues,

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.620
Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.050
with a foreword by Jared Diamond

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:05.030
and an introduction by Robert
Sapolsky from Stanford.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.810
So, that's a book chockablock

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.580
with heavy hitter authors that describes

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.210
how being a nasal breather is
beneficial for jaw structure,

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.440
for immune system function, et cetera

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.310
Breathing in through your nose,

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.430
sniffing actually has positive effects

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.083
on the way that you can acquire
and remember information.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.370
Noam Sobel's group
originally at UC Berkeley

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.780
and then at the Weizmann Institute

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.690
has published a number of papers

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.390
that I'd like to discuss today.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:42.310
One of them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.730
Phase-Locked with Inhalation,

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.680
this was published in
Nature Human Behavior,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.823
an excellent journal.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.017
Showed that the act of inhaling

00:30:51.017 --> 00:30:52.050
[Andrew inhales deeply]

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.400
has a couple of interesting
and powerful consequences.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.110
First of all, as we inhale

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.410
the brain increases in arousal,

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.960
our level of alertness
and attention increases

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.140
when we inhale as compared
to when we exhale.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.050
Now, of course with every
inhale, there's an exhale,

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.930
you could probably
double up on your inhales

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.340
if you're doing size or something,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.230
physiological size I've
talked about these before,

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.400
so double inhales [inhales twice]

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.960
followed by an exhale [exhales],

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.860
something like that.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.290
Or if you're speaking, you're
going to change your cadence

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.670
and ratio of inhales and exhales,

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.523
but typically we inhale, then we exhale.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.530
As we inhale, what this paper shows

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:34.040
is that the level of alertness
goes up in the brain,

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.300
and this makes sense because
as the most primitive

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.500
and primordial sense by which we interact

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.430
with our environment and bring
chemicals into our system

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.530
and detect our environment,

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.800
inhaling is a cue for
the rest of the brain

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.310
to essentially to pay
attention to what's happening,

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.540
not just to the odors

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.920
as the name of this paper suggests,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.910
Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked with Inhalation.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.100
What that means is that
the act of inhaling itself

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.220
wakes up the brain,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.300
it's not about what you're perceiving

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.500
or what you're smelling.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.010
And indeed sniffing as an action,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.060
inhaling as an action
has a powerful effect

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.710
on your ability to be alert,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.200
your ability to attend, to focus,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.050
and your ability to remember information.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:30.250
When we exhale, the brain
goes through a subtle,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.460
but nonetheless significant dip

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.870
in level of arousal and ability to learn.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.300
So, what does this mean?

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.450
How should you use this knowledge?

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.860
Well, you could imagine,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.750
and I think this will be
beneficial for most people

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.820
to focus on nasal breathing

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.180
while doing any kind of focused
work that doesn't require

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.543
that you speak, or eat,
or ingest something.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.940
There's a separate paper published

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.240
in the journal of neuroscience that showed

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.410
that indeed if subjects, human subjects,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.530
are restricted to breathing
through their nose,

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.920
they learn better than
if they have the option

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.620
of breathing through their mouth,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.630
or a combination of their nose and mouth.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.880
These are significant effects

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.430
in humans using modern
techniques from excellent groups.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.210
So, sniffing itself is
a powerful modulator

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:22.140
of our cognition and our ability to learn.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.320
You can imagine all sorts of ways

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.230
that you might apply that as a tool.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.400
And I suggest that you play with it a bit

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.470
that if you're having a hard
time staying awake and alert,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.460
you're having a hard time
remembering information,

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.550
you feel like you have a
kind of attention deficit,

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.330
nonclinical of course,

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.030
nasal breathing ought to help,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:43.030
extending or making your inhales
more intense ought to help.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.940
Now, this isn't really about
chemical sensing per se,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.020
but here's where it gets
interesting and exciting.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.910
If you are somebody

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.050
who doesn't have a very
good sense of smell,

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.370
or you're somebody who
simply wants to get better

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.240
at smelling and tasting things,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.880
you can actually practice sniffing.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.130
I know that sounds ridiculous,

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.560
but it turns out that
simply sniffing nothing.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.835
So, doing something like this.

00:34:06.835 --> 00:34:08.590
[Andrew sniffs deeply]

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.510
I guess the microphone sort
of has a smell [sniffs],

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.420
I guess my pen doesn't have a smell.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.060
[Andrew sniffs deeply]

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.700
It turns out that doing
a series of inhales,

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.830
and of course each one
is followed by an exhale,

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.730
10 or 15 times and then smelling an object

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.089
like an orange or another item of food,

00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:27.990
or even the skin of somebody else

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:31.280
will lead to an increase in your ability

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.940
to perceive those odors.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.450
Now, there are probably
two reasons for that.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.640
One reason is that the brain systems

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.190
of detecting things are waking up

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.240
as a mere consequence of inhaling.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.470
Okay, so this is sort of
the olfactory equivalent

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:49.790
of opening your eyes wider in
order to see, more or less.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.070
Okay, last episode I talked about

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.130
how opening your eyes wider

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.100
actually increases your
level of alertness,

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.710
it's not just that your level of alertness

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.040
causes your eyes to be open wider.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.900
Opening your eyes wider

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.800
can actually increase
your level of alertness.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.370
Well, it turns out that
breathing more deeply

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.700
through the nose, wakes up your brain

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.470
and it creates a heightened sensitivity

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.870
of the neurons that relate to smell.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.010
And there's a close crossover,

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.270
I'm sure you know this,
between smell and taste.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.160
If any of you have ever had a cold

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.700
or you have for whatever reason

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.070
you've lost your sense of smell,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.610
you become what they call anosmic,

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.550
your sense of taste suffers also.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.500
We'll talk a little bit more

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.560
about why that is in a few minutes,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.960
but as a first protocol,

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.660
I'd really like all of you to consider

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.070
becoming nasal breathers

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.110
while you're trying to learn,
while you're trying to listen,

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.730
while you're trying to wake
up your brain in any way

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.630
and learn and retain information,

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.900
this is a powerful tool.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.790
Now, there are other ways

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.990
to wake up your brain more as well.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.480
For instance, the use of smelling salts.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.460
I'm not recommending that
you do this necessarily,

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.250
but there are excellent peer reviewed data

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.900
showing that indeed, if
you use smelling salts,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.770
which are mostly of the
sort that include ammonia,

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.870
ammonia is a very toxic scent,

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:10.180
but it's toxic in a way that
triggers this innate pathway,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.170
the pathway from the nose to the amygdala,

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.770
and wakes up the brain
and body in a major way.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.010
This is why they use smelling salts

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:17.080
when people pass out,

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.710
this is why fighters used to use

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.640
or maybe sometimes
still use smelling salts

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.250
in order to heighten
their level of alertness,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.180
this is why powerlifters
will inhale smelling salts.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.630
They work because they trigger the fear

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.320
and kind of overall arousal
systems of the brain,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.970
this is why I think most
people probably shouldn't

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.280
use ammonia or smelling
salts to try and wake up,

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.150
but they really do work.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.630
If you've ever smelled smelling salts

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.450
and I have, I tried this,

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.710
they give you a serious jolt,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.550
it's like six espresso

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.420
infused into your bloodstream all at once,

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.610
you are wide awake immediately

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.860
and you feel a heightened
sense of kind of desire to move

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.290
because you release
adrenaline into your body.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.780
Now, inhaling through your nose

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.800
and doing nasal breathing
is not going to do that,

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.950
it's going to be a more subtle
version of waking up your system

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.680
of alerting your brain overall.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.760
And for those of you that are
interested in having a richer,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.260
a more deep connection

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.300
to the things that you smell and taste,

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.123
including other individuals
perhaps not just food,

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.430
practicing or enhancing
your sense of sniffing,

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:24.510
your ability to sniff

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.530
might sound like a kind
of ridiculous protocol,

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.210
but it's actually a kind
of fun and cool experiment

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.043
that you can do.

00:37:30.043 --> 00:37:32.580
You just do the simple
experiment of taking for instance

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.150
an orange, you smell it,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.950
try and gauge your level of perception

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.010
of how orange-ish it smells,

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.830
or lemony, lemonish, lemony, I don't know

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.830
is it lemonish or lemony?

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.210
Lemony it smells, then set it away,

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.211
do 10 or 15 inhales

00:37:50.211 --> 00:37:51.440
[Andrew inhales and exhales]

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.610
followed by exhales of course,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:53.629
or just through the nose.

00:37:53.629 --> 00:37:54.636
[Andrew breaths rapidly]

00:37:54.636 --> 00:37:56.010
I'm not going to do all 10 or 15.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.250
And then smell it again,

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:59.367
and you'll notice that your
perception of that smell,

00:37:59.367 --> 00:38:01.810
the kind of richness of that smell

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.810
will be significantly increased.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.420
And that's again, for two reasons,

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.280
one, the brain is in a position
to respond to it better,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.430
your brain has been aroused
by the mere act of sniffing,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.660
but also the neurons that respond

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.310
to that lemon odor, that lemony or odor

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.880
are going to respond better.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.590
So, you can actually have
a heightened experience

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.890
of something, and that of
course will also be true

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.040
for the taste system.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.690
You also can really
train your sense of smell

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.520
to get much, much better.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.170
When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.750
I happened to be a graduate
student around that time,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.350
and every once in a while I'd look outside

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.740
and there would be people
crawling around on the grass

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.590
with goggles on, gloves on,

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.470
and these hoods on with earmuffs.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.470
And they looked ridiculous,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.140
but what they were doing
is they were actually

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.920
learning to follow scent trails.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.450
So, in the world of dogs

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.520
you have sight hounds that use their eyes

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.730
in order to navigate and find things,

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.480
and you have scent towns
that use their nose.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.890
And the scent hounds are remarkable,

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.920
they can be trained to detect a scent.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.390
These are the sniffing,

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.223
you know, the bomb sniffing

00:39:05.223 --> 00:39:08.270
and the drug sniffing dogs in airports.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.630
There are now dogs actually that can sniff

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:14.190
out COVID infections with a
very high degree of accuracy,

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.430
they can be trained to do that.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.940
There's something about the COVID

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.580
and similar infections
that the body produces

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.100
probably in the immune response,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.390
some odors and the dogs
are I think as high as 90%

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.960
in some cases, maybe even 95% accuracy,

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.140
just remarkable.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.870
There are theories that
dogs can sniff out cancer,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.720
this stuff all exceeds
statistical significance.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.810
It's still a little bit
mysterious in some ways,

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.950
but you may not ever achieve

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.260
the olfactory capabilities
of a scent hound,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.120
but what Noam Sobel's lab
did is they had people

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.330
completely eliminate
their visual experience

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.210
by having them wear
dark glasses or goggles,

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.610
so they couldn't see,
and they couldn't hear,

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.660
they couldn't sense anything
with their sense of touch,

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.050
they had thick gloves on.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.830
But they had these masks on

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.170
where just their nasal passages were open

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.950
and people could in a
fairly short amount of time

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.890
learn to follow a chocolate
scent trail on the ground,

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.550
which is not something that
most people want to do,

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.220
but what they showed using
brain imaging, et cetera

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.360
in subsequent studies
is that the human brain,

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.090
you can learn to really
enhance your sense of smell

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.930
and become very astute in distinguishing

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.860
whether or not one particular odor

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.180
or combinations of odors

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.520
is such that it's less than,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.190
or more than a different
odor for instance.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.270
Now, why would you want to do this?

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.430
Well, if you like to eat as much as I do,

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:40.263
one of the things

00:40:40.263 --> 00:40:43.530
that can really enhance
your sense of pleasure

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.660
from the experience of ingesting food

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.570
is to enhance your sense of smell.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.270
And if you don't have
a great sense of smell,

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.670
or if you have a sense of smell

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.190
that's really so good that it's
always picking up bad odors,

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.270
we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.730
Well, then you might want to
tune up your sense of smell

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.000
by doing this practice
of 10 or 15 breaths,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.660
excuse me, sniffs, not breaths,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.450
sniffs and then interacting
with some food item

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.480
or thing that you're
interested in smelling more of.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.290
So, these could be the ingredients
that you're cooking with,

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.670
I really encourage you to
try and really smell them.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.610
You sometimes hear this

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.930
as kind of a mindfulness practice

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.967
like ooh, really smell the
food, really taste the food.

00:41:21.967 --> 00:41:23.190
And we always hear about that

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.840
as kind of a mindfulness
and presence thing,

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.100
but you actually can
increase the sensitivity

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.910
of your olfactory and your
taste system by doing this.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.160
And it has long-term effects,

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.320
that's what's so interesting.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.153
This isn't the kind of thing

00:41:35.153 --> 00:41:36.660
that you have to do every time you eat.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.180
You don't have to be the
weirdo in the restaurant

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.840
that's like picking up the radish

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.710
and like jamming it up your
nostrils, please don't do that.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.780
You don't have to
necessarily smell everything,

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.810
although it's nice
sometimes to smell the food

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.660
that you're about to
eat and as you eat it,

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.070
but it has long-term effects

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.670
in terms of your ability to distinguish

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.630
and discriminate different types of odors.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.890
And these don't even have
to be very pungent foods

00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.723
it turns out,

00:41:59.723 --> 00:42:01.050
the studies show that doesn't have

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.650
to be some really stinky cheese,

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.050
you know, there are cheese shops

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.230
that I've walked into where
like I just basically gag,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.315
I can't handle it, I
just can't be in there,

00:42:08.315 --> 00:42:09.910
it just overwhelms me.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.900
Other people, they love that smell.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.380
So, you have to tune it to
your interest and experience,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.210
but I think even for
you fasters out there,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.400
everybody eats at some point,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.817
everybody ingests chemicals
through their mouth.

00:42:21.817 --> 00:42:25.180
And one of the ways that
you can powerfully increase

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.240
your relationship to that experience

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.560
and make it much more positive

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.770
is through just the occasional practice

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:35.210
of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing,

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.930
which almost sounds ridiculous
like how could that be?

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.210
But now, you understand why,

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.680
it's because of the way that
the sniffing action increases

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.070
the alertness of the brain

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.470
as well as increasing the
sensitivity of the system.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.000
No other system that
I'm aware of in our body

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.300
is as amenable to these kinds
of behavioral training shifts

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.070
and allow them to happen so quickly.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.700
I would love to be able to tell you

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.140
that just doing 10 or 15
near-far exercises with a pen

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.430
or going outside for 10
or 15 seconds each morning

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.940
is going to completely change

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.870
the way that you see the world.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:08.270
But it actually isn't the case,

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.060
you actually, it requires more training,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.990
a little bit more effort
in the visual system.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.247
In the olfactory system,

00:43:13.247 --> 00:43:15.680
and your smell system,
and in your taste system

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.480
just the tiniest bit of
training and attention,

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.280
and sniffing, inhaling
can radically change

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.700
your relationship to food

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.090
such that you actually
start to feel very different

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:28.950
as a consequence of ingesting those foods

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.530
as well as becoming more
discerning about which foods

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.067
you like and which ones you don't like.

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:35.330
And we're going to talk about that

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.320
because there's a really wonderful thing

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.040
that happens when you start
developing a sensitive palate

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.160
and a sensitive sense of smell

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.540
in a way that allows
you to guide your eating

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.980
and smelling decisions,

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.620
and maybe even interpersonal decisions

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.900
about who you spend time with,
or mate with, or whatever,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.110
in a way that is really
in line with your biology.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:59.340
In fact, how well we can
smell and taste things

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.520
is actually a very strong
indication of our brain health.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.440
Now, that's not to say

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.010
that if you have a poor sense of smell

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.740
or a poor sense of taste, that
you're somehow brain damaged

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.580
or you're going to have dementia,

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.680
although sometimes early signs of dementia

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.200
or loss of neurons in
other regions of the brain

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.220
related to say Parkinson's
can show up first

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.823
as a loss of sense of smell.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.270
Again, it's not causal,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.670
and it's certainly not
the case that every time

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:28.860
you have a sudden loss of smell

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.330
that there's necessarily brain damage,

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.040
I want to be very about that,

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.283
but they are often correlated.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.140
There's also a lot of interest right now

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.530
in loss of sense of smell

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.610
because one of the early
detection signs of COVID-19

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.490
was a loss of sense of smell.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:46.680
So, I just briefly want to talk
about loss of sense of smell

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.340
and regaining sense of smell and taste

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.230
because these have powerful
implications for overall health.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.820
And in fact can indicate
something about brain damage

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.760
and can even inform how
quickly we might be recovering

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.130
from something like a concussion.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.010
So, our olfactory neurons,

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.490
these neurons in our
nose that detect odors

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.840
are really unique among
other brain neurons

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.750
because they get
replenished throughout life,

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.590
they don't just regenerate,
but they get replenished.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:23.110
So regeneration is when something
is damaged and it regrows,

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.150
these neurons are constantly turning

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:26.330
over throughout our lifespan,

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.890
they're constantly being replenished,

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.380
they're dying off and they're
being replaced by new ones.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.040
This is an amazing aspect of our brain

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.953
that's basically unique to these neurons,

00:45:35.953 --> 00:45:37.700
there's one other region of the brain

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.750
where there's a little bit of this maybe,

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:42.410
but these olfactory neurons

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.483
about every three or four weeks they die.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.090
And when they die, they're replaced

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.040
by new ones that come from a
different region of the brain,

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.840
a region called the subventricular zone.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.620
The name isn't as important,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.540
but as the phenomenon,

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.920
but these neurons are
born in the ventricle,

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.100
the area of your brain that's
a hole that contains...

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.110
It's not an empty hole,

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:06.030
it's a hole basically that
contains cerebral spinal fluid.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.070
Well, there's a little
subventricular zone,

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.460
there's a little zone
below, sub ventricles.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.450
And that zone, if you
are exercising regularly,

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:18.123
if your dopamine levels are high enough,

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.370
those little cells there
are like stem cells.

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.400
They are stem cells and they spit out

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.300
what are called little neuroblasts,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.570
those little neuroblasts migrate

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.960
into the front of your
brain and then shimmy,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.793
they kind of move through

00:46:33.793 --> 00:46:35.860
what's called the
rostral migratory stream.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.390
They kind of shimmy along

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.720
and land back in your olfactory bulb,

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.740
settle down and extend little wires

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.870
into your olfactory mucosa.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.150
This is an ongoing process
of what we call neurogenesis

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.230
or the birth of new neurons.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.120
Now, this is really interesting

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.390
because other neurons in
your cortex, in your retina,

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.510
in your cerebellum, they do not do this,

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.370
they are not continually
replenished throughout life.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.660
But these neurons, these
olfactory neurons are,

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.883
they are special.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.760
And there are a number of things

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.850
that seem to increase the amount

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.230
of olfactory neuron neurogenesis.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.800
There is evidence that
exercise, blood flow,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.310
can increase olfactory
neuron neurogenesis.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.150
Although, those data are fewer

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.290
in comparison to things
like social interactions,

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.780
or actually interacting with
odorants of different kinds.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.750
So, if you're somebody who
doesn't smell things well,

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.120
you have a poor sense of smell,

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.710
your olfactory system
doesn't seem very sensitive,

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.500
more sniffing, more smelling
is going to be good.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.253
And then the molecule
dopamine, this neuromodulator,

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.540
that is associated with
motivation and drive.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.880
And in some cases, if it's
very, very high with mania,

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.110
or if it's very, very low with
depression or Parkinson's,

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:53.850
but for most people where dopamine

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.680
is in essentially normal ranges

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:01.190
dopamine is also a powerful
trigger of the establishment

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:03.030
of these new neurons and their migration

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.893
into the olfactory bulb
and your ability to smell.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.790
Now, you don't want to confuse
correlation with causation,

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.390
so if you're not good at smelling

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.830
does that mean you have low dopamine?

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:13.960
No, not necessarily.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.040
If you have low dopamine,

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.860
does that mean that you
have a poor sense of smell?

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.400
No, not necessarily.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.610
Some people who take
antidepressants of the sort

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:25.830
that impact the dopamine
system strongly like Wellbutrin

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.240
will report a sudden, meaning
within a couple of days,

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.530
increase in their ability
to smell particular odors,

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.720
and it's a very striking effect.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.170
Some people when they
are in a new relationship

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.110
because dopamine and the hormones,

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:44.040
testosterone and estrogen
are associated with novelty

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.850
and the sorts of behaviors
that often are associated

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.670
with new relationships
those three molecules;

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.400
dopamine, testosterone, and
estrogen kind of work together.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.290
And oftentimes people will say

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.100
or report when they're newly in love

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.870
or in a new relationship that
they're just obsessed with,

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.320
or they just so enjoy the
scent of another person

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.980
so much so that they like to borrow

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.200
the other person's clothing

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.040
or they'll sniff the
other person's clothing

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.920
or they can even just in
the absence of the person

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.650
they can imagine their smell
and feel a biological response,

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.260
something that we'll talk more about.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.840
So, these neurons turnover
throughout the lifespan

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.410
and as we age, we actually
can lose our sense of smell.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.580
And it's likely, I want
to underscore likely,

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.260
that that loss of sense of smell as we age

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.760
is correlated with a loss of other neurons

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.250
in the retina, in the
ears, a loss of vision,

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:36.450
loss of hearing, loss of smell,
loss of the sense apparati

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.450
which our neurons is
correlated with aging.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.320
So, what we've been talking about today

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.450
is the ability to sense these odors,

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:46.940
but what I'd like to do
is empower you with tools

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.010
that will allow you to keep
these systems tuned up.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.700
Last time, we talked about tuning up

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.870
and keeping your visual
system tuned up and healthy

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:54.920
regardless of age.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.750
Here, we're talking about really enhancing

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:01.990
your olfactory abilities,
your taste abilities as well

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.990
by interacting a lot with odors,
preferably positive odors,

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:10.270
and sniffing more, inhaling more,

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:11.420
which almost sounds crazy,

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.160
but now you understand why.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.200
Even though it might sound crazy

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.810
it's grounded in real mechanistic biology

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.260
of how the brain wakes up and
responds to these chemicals.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.660
Now, speaking of brain injury,

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.610
olfactory dysfunction is a common theme

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:27.090
in traumatic brain injury
for the following reason,

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.400
these olfactory neurons as I mention

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.310
extend wires into the mucosa of the nose,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:35.990
but they also extend a
wire up into the skull.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.620
And they extend up into the skull

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.280
through what's called
the cribriform plate,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.680
it's like a Swiss cheese type plate

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.780
where they're going through.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.940
And if you get a head hit,

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.910
that bone, the cribriform plate,

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.597
sheers those little wires off

00:50:48.597 --> 00:50:50.980
and those neurons die.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.100
Now, eventually they'll be replaced,

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.340
but there's a phenomenon
by which concussion

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.770
and the severity of concussion

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.710
and the recovery from a head injury

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:01.720
can actually be gauged in part,

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.740
in part, not in whole,

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:06.780
but in part by how well
or fully one recovers

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.480
their sense of smell.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.890
So, if you're somebody that unfortunately

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.200
has suffered a concussion,

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.820
your sense of smell is one readout

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.410
by which you might evaluate
whether or not you're regaining

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.030
some of your sensory performance.

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.930
Of course, there will be others

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.330
like balance, and cognition,
and sleep, et cetera.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.770
But I'd like to refer you
to a really nice paper

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.140
which is entitled Olfactory Dysfunction

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.000
in Traumatic Brain Injury:
the Role of Neurogenesis

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.135
the first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N.

00:51:33.135 --> 00:51:34.540
The paper was published

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.070
in Current Allergy and
Asthma Report, this is 2020.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.150
I spent some time with this
paper, it's quite good,

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:41.270
it's a review article,

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.910
I like reviews if they're
peer-reviewed reviews

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:46.480
and in quality journals.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.140
And what they discuss

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.560
is and I'll just read here briefly

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.097
'cause they said it better than I could,

00:51:51.097 --> 00:51:53.080
"Olfactory functioning
disturbances are common

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.020
following traumatic brain injury, TBI,

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.620
and can have a significant
impact on the quality of life.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.270
Although there is no standard
treatment for patients

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.590
with the loss of smell."

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:07.420
Now I'm paraphrasing,
"Post-injury olfactory training

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.380
has shown promise for beneficial effects.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.880
Some of this involves,"

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.590
they go on to tell us
the role of dopamine,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.960
dopaminergic signaling,
as I mentioned before,

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.930
but what does this mean?

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.940
This means that if
you've had a head injury

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.730
or repeated head injuries that
enhancing your sense of smell

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:28.820
is one way by which you
can create new neurons.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.750
And now, you know how to
enhance your sense of smell

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.060
by interacting with things
that have an odor very closely,

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.810
and by essentially inhaling more,

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:39.390
focusing on the inhale
to wake up the brain

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.400
and to really focus on some
of the nuance of those smells.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.330
So, you might do for instance a smell test

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.180
by which you smell something like a lemon,

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.330
put it down, do 10 inhales or so,

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.890
smell again, et cetera.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:52.870
You might also just
take a more active role

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.470
in trying to taste and smell your food,

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.540
and taste and smell various things.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.770
I mean, please don't ingest anything

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.910
that's poisonous that you're
not supposed to be ingesting,

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.090
but you know what I mean,

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.800
really tuning up this system,

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.500
I think is an excellent review,

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.130
we're going to do an entire episode

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:10.600
all about the use of the
visual system in particular,

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.460
but also the olfactory
system for treatment

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.020
of traumatic brain injury,
as well as other methods.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.030
But I wanted to just mention it here

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.450
because a number of
people asked me about TBI.

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:22.650
And here again, we're in
this place where the senses

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:23.703
and our ability to sense these chemicals

00:53:23.703 --> 00:53:25.910
through these two holes
in the front of our face,

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:29.170
our nostrils is a powerful readout

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.600
and way to control brain function

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.480
and nervous system function generally.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.130
Just a quick note about
the use of smelling salts,

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.700
I have a feeling that some of
you may be interested in that

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.630
and its application.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.360
If you are interested in that,

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.420
I recommend you go to the
scientific literature first

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.180
rather than straight to some vendor

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.850
or to the what do they call it these days?

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.210
Costello bro science, he says,

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:54.390
bro science, the bro science.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.470
You can go to this
paper, which is excellent

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:58.960
and is real science, which
is Acute Effects of Ammonia

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.940
Inhalants on Strength and Power
Performance in Trained Men.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.537
It's a randomized controlled
trial, it was published

00:54:03.537 --> 00:54:05.930
in the Journal of Strength
and Conditioning Research

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:09.130
in 2018, and it should
be very easy to find.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:11.830
I will provide a link to
the so-called PubMed ID,

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.940
which is a string of numbers,

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.950
and we'll put that in the caption

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.410
if you want to go
straight to that article,

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.230
does show a significant what they call,

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:21.267
this is what the words they
use literally in quotes,

00:54:21.267 --> 00:54:24.540
"psyching up effect through the use

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.610
of these ammonia inhalants

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.480
and a significant
increase in maximal force

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.410
in force development in a
variety of different movements."

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.880
So, for those of you that are interested

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.310
in ammonia inhalants,
so-called smelling salts,

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:41.230
that might be a good reference.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:42.380
The other thing I wanted to talk about

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.010
with reference to odors is this myth

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:48.780
which is that we don't actually
smell things in our dreams,

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.580
that we don't have a sense of smell.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.380
That's pure fiction, I don't
know who came up with that,

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.960
it's very clear that we are capable

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.490
of smelling things in our sleep.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.010
However, when we are in REM sleep,

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.220
rapid eye movement sleep,

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.840
which is the sleep that predominates

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.630
toward the second half of the night

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:12.570
our ability to wake up in
response to odors is diminished.

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.500
It's not absent, but it's diminished.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.040
If smoke comes into the
room, we will likely wake up

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.810
if the concentration
of smoke is high enough

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.040
regardless of the stage of sleep we're in,

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.320
but in REM sleep we tend to be less likely

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.040
to smell, to sniff.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.640
And that actually was measured
in a number of studies

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.590
that sniffing in sleep is possible.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.360
So, if you put an odor like a lemon

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.650
underneath someone's nostrils

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:40.350
in the early portion of
the night, they will smell,

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:41.480
and they will later...

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.030
They will sniff, excuse me,

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.000
whether or not they smell or
not, I guess depends on them

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.910
and when they showered last,

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:47.610
but they will definitely sniff

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.940
and they will report later,
especially if you wake them up

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:54.030
soon after that, they had a dream

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.940
or a percept of the scent
of a lemon for instance.

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.470
Later in the night, it's
harder for that relationship

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:01.303
to be established,

00:56:01.303 --> 00:56:03.210
it's likely that because
of some of the paralysis

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:05.470
associated with rapid eye movement sleep,

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.520
which is a healthy paralysis,
so-called sleep atonia,

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.020
you don't want to act out
your dreams in REM sleep

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.880
that there is a less
active tendency to sniff.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.850
And actually this has real
clinical implications,

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:20.220
the ability to sniff

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.280
in response to the introduction of an odor

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.990
is actually one way in
which clinicians assess

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:31.050
whether or not somebody's
brain is so-called brain dead.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:32.620
That's not a nice term, but brain dead,

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.050
or whether or not they have the capacity

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:37.610
to recover from things like coma

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.270
and other states of deep unconsciousness,

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.660
or I guess you'd call it subconsciousness.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.430
So, what will happen is
if someone has an injury

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.080
and they're essentially out cold,

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.940
the production of a sniffing reflex,

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.760
or a sniffing response to say a lemon

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.080
or some other odor
presented below the nostrils

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.890
is considered a sign that the
brain is capable of waking up.

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:03.780
Now, that's not always the
case, but it's one indication.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.090
So just like you could
use mechano sensation,

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.480
so, a toe pinch for instance,

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.240
you know, or scraping the
bottom of somebody's barefoot

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.020
to see if they're conscious,

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.850
or shining light in their eyes,

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.810
these are all things that you've seen

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:17.820
in movies and television,

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.470
or maybe if you've seen
in real life as well.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.140
Well, odors and chemical
sensing is another way

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.090
by which you can assess

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.010
whether or not the brain
is capable of arousal.

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.300
And actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.090
is one of the more prominent ones

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:33.450
that's being used in various clinics.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.120
As a last point about
specific odors and compounds

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.480
that can increase arousal and alertness,

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.350
and this was simply through sniffing them

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:42.880
not through ingesting them.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.210
There are data, believe it
or not, there are good data

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:49.340
on peppermint and the smell of peppermint,

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.080
minty type sense,

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.750
whether you like them or
not will increase attention,

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.300
and they can create the same
sort of arousal response

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.900
although not as intensely

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.310
or as dramatically as ammonia
salts can for instance.

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:06.540
By the way, please don't
go sniff real ammonia,

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.690
you could actually damage
your olfactory epithelium

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:10.670
if you do that too close to the ammonia.

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:11.740
If you're going to use smelling salts

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.480
be sure you work with someone

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.970
or you know what you're getting
and how you're using this.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.460
You can damage your olfactory pathway

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.560
in ways that are pretty severe,

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.980
you can also damage your vision.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.220
If you've ever teared up
because you inhaled something

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:27.150
that was really noxious,
that is not a good thing,

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:28.860
it doesn't mean you
necessarily cause damage,

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.820
but it means that you have
irritated the mucosal lining

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.530
and possibly even the
surfaces of your eyes,

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.170
so please be very, very careful.

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:40.370
Scents like peppermint,

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.370
like these ammonia smelling salts,

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:43.550
the reason they wake you up

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:46.690
is because they trigger
specific olfactory neurons

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.060
that communicate with the
specific centers of the brain,

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.460
namely the amygdala and
associated neurocircuitry

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.440
and pathways that trigger alertness

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.010
of the same sort that a
cold shower or an ice bath,

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:58.750
or a sudden surprise,

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:01.350
or a stressful text message would evoke.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:05.309
Remember, the systems of your
body that produce arousal,

00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:07.300
and alertness, and attention,

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.550
and that cue you for
optimal learning, aka focus.

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:12.090
Those are very general mechanisms,

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.740
they involve very basic
molecules like adrenaline

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.130
and epinephrin same thing actually,

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:17.413
adrenaline and epinephrin.

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:22.210
The number of stimuli, whether
it's peppermint or ammonia,

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.823
or a loud blast,

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.990
the number of stimuli that can evoke

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.060
that adrenaline response
and that wake up response

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.620
are near infinite.

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.630
And that's the beauty
of your nervous system,

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:37.080
it was designed to take any
variety of different stimuli

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.740
placed them into categories,

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.970
and then evoke different categories

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:43.120
of very general responses.

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.650
Now, you know a lot about olfaction

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.050
and how the sense of smell works,

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.820
here's another experiment that you can do.

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.730
I'll ask you right now.

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:54.890
Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.183
to the smell of microwave popcorn?

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.800
Some people, including one
member of my podcast staff

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.750
says it's absolutely disgusting to them,

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.830
they feel like it's completely nauseating.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:08.663
I don't mind it at all,

01:00:08.663 --> 01:00:09.910
in fact, I kind of like it.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.620
I think the smell of a microwave popcorn

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.453
is kind of pleasant.

01:00:12.453 --> 01:00:13.550
I don't particularly like it,

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:15.253
but it's certainly not unpleasant.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.770
Some people have a gene
that makes them sensitive

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.390
to the smell of things
like microwave popcorn

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:26.753
such that it smells like vomit.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:29.940
I probably don't have that gene

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.773
because I find the smell

01:00:30.773 --> 01:00:33.670
of microwaved popcorn pretty pleasant.

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:37.580
Some people hate the smell of cilantro,

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.530
some people ingest asparagus,

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.280
and when they urinate they
can smell the asparagus

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.680
in a very pungent way,

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.060
other people can't smell it at all.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.190
These are variants in genes that encode

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:53.890
for what are called olfactory receptors.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:58.630
Each olfactory sensory neuron
expresses one odorant gene,

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.270
one gene that codes for a receptor

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:03.420
that responds to a particular odor.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.840
If you don't have that gene

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.260
you will not respond to that odor.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.330
So, the reason why some
people find the smell

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.870
of microwave popcorn to be
very noxious, putrid in fact,

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.980
is because they have a
gene that allows them

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.263
to smell the kind of
putrid odor within that.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:23.530
Other people who lack that gene
just simply can't smell it,

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.420
so we are not all the same

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.360
with respect to our sensory experience.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.430
What one person finds delicious,

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:31.140
another person might find disgusting.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.970
I'll give a good example

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.550
which is that I absolutely despise

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:38.590
Gorgonzola and blue cheese,
absolutely despise it,

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.750
it smells and tastes

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.840
like dirty moldy socks to me.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.590
Some people love it, they crave it,

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:48.947
actually, some people get
a visceral response to it,

01:01:48.947 --> 01:01:51.740
and we will talk about how certain tastes

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:55.630
can actually evoke very
deep biological responses,

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.170
even hormonal responses

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:59.620
when we talk about taste in a few minutes.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.490
But there are these odors,

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.820
for instance in popcorn

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.820
it's the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline,

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.780
not proline but pyrroline,

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.750
that gives off to some people like me

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.870
a toasted smell as the
sugars in the kernels heat,

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:17.320
but the compound is also found

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.360
in things like white
bread and jasmine rice,

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.010
which don't have as pungent an odor,

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:26.820
but some people smell that
and it smells like cat urine.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.820
Now, there are scents like
musky scents and musty scents

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.450
that are secreted by animals like skunks

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:37.820
and other animals of the
so-called Mustelidae family.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.600
So, these would be ferrets and
other animals that can spray

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.440
in response to fear, or if they
just want to mark a territory

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.120
because they want to say that's mine.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.700
Dogs incidentally have scent
glands that they rub on things,

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.120
cats have them too.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.980
This musty odor, some people
find actually quite pleasant,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.390
some people find it to be very noxious

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.760
and that will depend of course
on the concentration, right?

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.440
I'll never forget the first time

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.130
Costello got sprayed by
a skunk and it was awful.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:09.510
I actually don't mind the
smell of skunk at a distance,

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.700
it's actually a little bit pleasant,

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.840
I admit it's a little bit pleasant to me.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.020
I don't think that makes me too weird

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.227
because if you ever read the book

01:03:15.227 --> 01:03:18.250
"All Quiet on the Western
Front" about World War I,

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.930
there's a description in
there about the smell of skunk

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.870
at a distance being mildly pleasant,

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:25.230
so the author of that book probably shared

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:30.020
a similar olfactory profile
to me, or I to them rather,

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.410
but some people find even the tiniest bit

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:36.410
of the smell of skunk or
musk to be noxious or awful.

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.550
Now, of course in high
concentrations, it's really awful.

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.720
And unfortunately, poor Costello,

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.410
he was like literally
red-eyed and just snorting,

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.480
and it was awful.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.190
There's a joke about
dogs that says that dogs

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:50.210
either get skunked one
time and never again

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.500
or 50 or a hundred times.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.850
Costello has been skunked no fewer,

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:54.730
I'm not making this up,

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:58.160
has been skunked no fewer than 103 times.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.500
And that's because if he sees something

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.390
or hears something in the
bushes, he just goes straight in,

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:03.960
he does not learn.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.690
But if you like this, that
musty scent or musky scent,

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:11.150
well that says something about
the genes that you express

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.500
in your olfactory neurons,

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.930
it is completely inherited.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:16.360
And if you don't like that scent,

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.450
if it's really noxious

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.190
or you have this response
to microwave popcorn,

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:21.220
well, that means you have
a different compliment,

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.770
a different constellation if you will

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:27.750
of genes that make up for
these olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.660
and the receptors that they express.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.290
Let's talk about taste.

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:33.900
Not whether or not you have
taste or you don't have taste,

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.060
there's no way for me to assess that,

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:39.510
but rather how we taste things,

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.440
meaning how we sense chemicals
in food and in drink.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.180
There are essentially five,

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.584
but scientists now believe
there may be six things

01:04:49.584 --> 01:04:53.890
that we taste alone or in combination,

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.460
they are sweet tastes,

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:00.420
salty tastes, bitter tastes,

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.800
sour tastes, and umami taste.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.910
Most of you probably
heard of umami by now,

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:09.690
it's U-M-A-M-I.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:14.060
Umami is actually the name
for a particular receptor

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.414
that you express on your tongue

01:05:15.414 --> 01:05:19.103
that detects savory tastes,

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.810
so it's the kind of
thing in braised meats.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:26.920
Sometimes people can even
get the activation of umami

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.393
by tomatoes or tomato sauces.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:32.770
What are each of these tastes

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:35.030
and taste receptors responsible for?

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:36.430
And then we'll talk about the sixth,

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.530
maybe you can guess what it is,

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.760
I don't know if you can guess it now.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.120
I couldn't guess it,
but of the five tastes

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.463
each one has a specific
utility or function.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:51.000
Each one has a particular
group of neurons in your mouth,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.310
in your tongue, believe it or not,

01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:55.880
that responds to particular chemicals

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.380
and particular chemical structures.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.450
It is a total myth, complete fiction,

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:03.120
that different parts of your tongue

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.062
harbor different taste receptors.

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.880
You know, that high
school textbook diagram

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.810
that you know sweet is
in one part of the tongue

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:11.400
and sour is in another,

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.570
and bitters in another, complete fiction,

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.150
just total fiction related
to very old studies

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.770
that were performed in a
very poorly controlled way,

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.960
no serious biologists

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.370
and certainly no one that works on tastes

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:25.280
would contend that that's the way

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.000
that the taste receptors are organized,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.460
they are completely
intermixed along your tongue.

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:32.610
If you have heightened
or decreased sensitivity

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:34.660
to one of those five things I mentioned;

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.660
sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.860
at one location in your tongue,

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:42.860
it likely reflects the
density of overall receptors

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:45.900
or something going on in your brain,

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.623
but not the differential
distribution of those receptors.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.030
So, the sweet receptors
are neurons that express

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:57.560
a receptor that respond to sugars,

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.930
in the same way that you
have cones, photoreceptors,

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:01.990
in your eye that respond to short,

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.780
medium, or long wavelength light,

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:07.560
meaning blueish, greenish,
or reddish light.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.962
You have a neuron, or neurons plural,

01:07:10.962 --> 01:07:15.920
in your tongue that respond to sugars.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.740
And then those neurons,
they don't say sweet,

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:21.210
they don't actually send
any sugar into the brain,

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.220
they send what we call a volley,

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.730
a barrage of action potentials
of electrical signals

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:26.900
off into the brain.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.550
It's an amazing system.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:30.400
So, all these receptors in your tongue

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.360
make up what are called the neurons

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.780
that give rise to a nerve,

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.510
a collection of wires, nerve bundles

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.840
of what's called the gustatory nerve,

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.660
it goes from the tongue

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.427
to the so-called nucleus
of the solitary tract.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.300
And some of you requested names,

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.210
I usually don't like to
include too many names

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:49.130
for sake of clarity,

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:51.280
but the gustatory nerve from the tongue

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.450
goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:56.650
and then to the thalamus
and to insular cortex.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:58.540
You don't have to remember
any of those names

01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.430
if you don't want to,

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:01.280
but if you want mechanism,
you want neural circuits,

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.750
that's the circuit, gustatory
nerve from the tongue,

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.600
nucleus of the solitary
tract in the brainstem,

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.130
then the thalamus, and
then insular cortex.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:10.620
And it is in insular cortex,

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.730
this regenerate cortex that we sort out

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:16.050
and make sense of and
perceive the various tastes.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.640
Now, it's amazing because
just taking a little bit

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.430
of sugar or something sour

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.550
like a little bit of lemon juice

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:24.230
and touching it to the tongue

01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:27.380
within 100 milliseconds, right?

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.810
Just 100 milliseconds,
far less than one second,

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:32.710
you can immediately distinguish

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:33.730
ah, that's sour,

01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:37.180
that sweet, that's bitter, that's umami,

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:41.660
and that's an assessment
that's made by the cortex.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.170
Now, what to these different
five receptors encode for?

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:47.950
Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:49.870
but what are they really looking for?

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:51.510
What are they sensing?

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:55.860
Well, sweet stuff signals the
presence of energy, of sugars.

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.080
And while we're all trying

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.230
or we're told that we
should eat less sugar

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.623
for a variety of reasons,

01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:05.100
the ability to sense whether or not a food

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.910
has rapid energy source

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.920
or could give rise to glucose is essential

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.490
so we have sweet receptors.

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:15.540
The salty receptors, these
neurons are trying to sense

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.120
whether or not there are electrolytes

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.810
in a given food or drink.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:22.350
Electrolytes are vitally important

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.660
for the function of our nervous system,

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.790
and for our entire body,

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:28.180
sodium is what allows neurons to fire.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.600
What allows them to be
electrically active.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.310
We also need potassium and magnesium,

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:35.470
those are the ions that allow
the neurons to be active.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:36.780
So the salty receptors,

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:38.640
the reason that they are there

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.550
is to make sure that
we are getting enough,

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:42.220
but not too much salt,

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.903
we don't want to ingest
things that are far too salty.

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.220
Bitter receptors are there

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.340
to make sure we don't ingest
things that are poisonous.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.210
How do I know this?

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.080
How can I say that?

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.040
Even though I was definitely not consulted

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.630
at the design phase, how can I say that?

01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:59.880
Well, the bitter receptors

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.810
create a what we call labeled line,

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.900
a unique trajectory to the neurons

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.200
of the brainstem that control the [gags],

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.433
the gag reflex.

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:11.500
If we taste something very bitter

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.560
it automatically triggers the gag reflex.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.830
Now, some people like bitter taste,

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:17.810
I actually liked the
taste of bitter coffee,

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:19.460
children generally like sweet tastes

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.790
more than bitter tastes,

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:22.680
but even babies if they
taste something bitter,

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.083
they'll just immediately spit it up,

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:26.060
it's like the gag reflex.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.900
Putrid smells will also
evoke the same neurons,

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.690
so some people are very sensitive,

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.620
they have a very sensitive

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.390
or low threshold vomit reflex,

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:39.782
you're going to and there was
somebody in my lab early on.

01:10:39.782 --> 01:10:41.240
And we never did this intentionally,
and we're just laughing

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240
'cause it was so dramatic.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.330
How we would have a discussion,

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:48.160
someone would say something
about something kind of gross,

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.110
appropriate for the workplace,
but nonetheless gross,

01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:51.420
we are biologists,

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.610
would say something and they
would say, "Stop, stop stop,

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:54.710
I'm going to throw up."

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:57.660
You know and some people
have a very low threshold

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.780
quick gag reflex.

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.960
Other people don't, other people
have a very stable stomach,

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.793
they don't, you know,

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:06.420
they rarely, if ever vomit.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.060
The umami receptor isn't sensing savory

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.490
because the body loves savory,

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.670
it's because savory is a signal

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.830
for the presence of amino acids.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.240
And we'll talk more about this,

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.030
but the presence of amino acids

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:23.790
in our gut and in our digestive system,

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:27.280
and the presence of
fatty acids is essential,

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.010
there is in fact, no essential
carbohydrate or sugar.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:33.610
Now, I'm not a huge
proponent of ketogenic diets

01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:36.780
nor am I against them, I
think it's highly individual,

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.830
you have to decide what's right for you,

01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:42.100
but everybody needs
amino acids to survive,

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.680
the brain needs them
and we need fatty acids,

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.930
especially to build a healthy
brain during development,

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:49.920
you need amino acids and fatty acids.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.330
And the sour receptor, why
would we have a sour receptor?

01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:56.130
So, that we could have those
really like sour candies?

01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:57.960
I think they've gotten more
and more sour over the years.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.030
I admit I don't eat candy much,

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.600
but I do have a particular weakness

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.600
for like a really good
really sour like gummy peach

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.830
or they if the gummy cherries are dipped

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.210
in whatever that sour powder,

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:13.030
so I was a kid who I admit it,

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:14.360
I liked the LIK-M-AID thing,

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.650
I'd like drink the powder.

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:18.600
Please don't do this, don't
give this garbage to your kids,

01:12:19.838 --> 01:12:21.720
but I liked it, it was tasty,

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.060
but sour receptors are not there

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.010
so that you can ingest
gummy sour gummy peaches

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.050
or something like that, that's
not why the system evolved,

01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.010
it's there and we know it's there

01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:38.050
to detect the presence of
spoiled or fermented food.

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:40.840
Fermented fruit has a sour element to it,

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.180
and fermented things while
certainly some fermented foods

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.210
like sauerkraut, and kimchi,
and things of that sort

01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:47.370
can be very healthy for us

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:49.350
and are very healthy in
reducing inflammation,

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.700
there's great data on that,

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:56.253
pro quality microbiome, et cetera.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.730
Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right?

01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:03.930
Alcohols are poisonous in
many forms to our system

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:08.240
and the sour receptor bearing neurons

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.580
communicate to an area of the brainstem

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:13.350
that evokes the pucker response,

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:16.600
closing of the eyes and
essentially shutting of the mouth,

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.080
and cringing away.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.300
I think cringe is like a thing now,

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.130
my niece, whenever I seem to
say something or do something

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:26.500
it's either an eye-roll, a
cringe, or both in combination.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.860
So the sour, the sweet,

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.400
the salty, the bitter,
and the umami system,

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.360
were not there so that we could
have this wonderful pallet

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.123
of foods that we enjoy so much,

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:40.660
they'll allow us to do that,
but they're there to make sure

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:41.870
that we bring in certain things

01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:44.910
to our system and that we
don't ingest other things.

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:47.710
Now, what's the sixth sense

01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:48.940
within the taste system?

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.810
Not sixth sense generally,
but within the taste system.

01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:54.480
What's this putative
possible sixth receptor?

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.230
I already kind of hinted at it

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:58.200
when I talked about fatty acids,

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.870
there are now data to support the idea

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.940
although there's still more
work that needs to be done

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.223
that we also have receptors
on our tongue that sense fat.

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:12.280
And that because fat is
so vital for the function

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.210
of our nervous system and
the other organs of our body

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:17.960
that we are sensing the
fat content in food,

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.270
maybe this is why I can only eat half,

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.610
but no less than half of
a jar of almond butter

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:25.260
or peanut butter in one sitting.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.770
I just can't, unless it's not salted,

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:28.800
in which case, it makes no sense to me.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.400
But it's remarkable how that texture,

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.510
and also the flavor,
but that texture of fat.

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:38.280
I love butter, I am guilty,

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.150
and Costello is definitely
guilty of eating pats of butter

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.010
from time to time, I
have no guilt about this.

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:44.160
People eat pats of cheese,

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.250
why shouldn't we eat a pat of butter?

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:47.340
If you think that's gross

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.140
then maybe I have a greater abundance

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.340
of the fat receptors in my tongue,

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:55.370
maybe I have a fat tongue than you do.

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:59.630
But nonetheless, the ability
to sense fat here in our mouth

01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:01.360
seems to be critical,

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.053
you can imagine why that is.

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:06.160
I want to talk about the tongue

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.940
and the mouth as an extension
of your digestive tract.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.070
I know that might not be
pleasant to think about,

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:13.140
but when you look at it

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.070
through the lens that
I'm about to provide,

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:16.650
it will completely
change the way you think

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.800
about the gut brain

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.010
and about all the stuff that you've heard

01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:22.530
in these recent years about
oh, we have this second brain,

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:23.700
it's all these neurons in our gut,

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.010
I've been chuckling through
these last few years

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:29.420
as people have gotten so
excited about the gut brain,

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.820
not because of their excitement,

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.280
I think that excitement is wonderful,

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.130
but we always knew that the nervous system

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:38.440
extended out of the
brain and into the body,

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.610
and people seem kind of overwhelmed

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:43.700
and surprised by the idea that
we have neurons in our gut

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.560
that can sense things like
sugars and fatty acids.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.270
And I think those are
beautiful discoveries,

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.103
don't get me wrong.

01:15:49.103 --> 01:15:51.570
Diego Bohorquez's lab
out of Duke University

01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:53.810
has done beautiful studies showing that

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:56.390
within the mucosal lining of our gut

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:58.530
we have neurons that sense fatty acids,

01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:00.900
sugars, and amino acids,

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.930
and that when we ingest something

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:05.510
that contains one or two
or three of those things,

01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:07.970
there's a signal sent via the vagus nerve

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:10.900
up into what's called the nodose ganglion,

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.110
N-O-D-O-S-E,

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:15.570
and then into the brain
where it secretes dopamine

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.360
which makes us want more of that thing,

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.900
it makes us more motivated to pursue

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.660
and eat more of that thing,

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.290
that's either fatty, or umami, savory,

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:27.950
or has a sweet taste,

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.700
any one or two or three
of those qualities,

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.550
independent of the taste.

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:35.280
Now, I think those are beautiful data,

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.057
but we know that this thing, the mouth.

01:16:38.057 --> 01:16:39.110
And for those of you listening

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:40.670
I've just got my couple
of fingers in my mouth,

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:43.420
that's why I sound like I've
got something in my mouth.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.670
This thing in the front of our face,

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:47.610
we use it for speaking,

01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:49.580
but it is the front of
our digestive tract.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.810
We are essentially a series of tubes

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:53.660
and that tube starts with your mouth

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.420
and heads down into your stomach.

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.130
And so, that you would sense

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:01.030
so much of the chemical constituents

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.750
of the stuff that you
might bring into your body

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.150
or that you might want
to expel and not swallow

01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:09.910
or not interact with by being
able to smell is it putrid?

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:11.400
Does it smell good?

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.360
Does it taste good?

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.193
Is this safe?

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:14.026
Is it salty?

01:17:14.026 --> 01:17:17.240
Is it so sour that it's fermented
and it's going to poison me?

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.730
Is it so bitter that it could poison me?

01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:22.120
Is it so savory that, mmm,

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.910
yes. I want more and more of this.

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:25.250
Well, then you'd want to trigger dopamine,

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:27.330
that's all starting in the mouth.

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:31.120
So, you have to understand
that you were equipped

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.680
with this amazing chemical
sensing apparatus,

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.740
we call your mouth and your tongue.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.420
And those little bumps on your tongue

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.960
that they call the papillae,

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.570
those are not your taste buds.

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:44.380
Surrounding those little papillae

01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:48.220
like little rivers are these
little dents and indentations.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.920
And what dents and
indentations do in a tissue

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.520
is they allow more surface area,

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.720
they allow you to pack more receptors.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.650
So, down in those grooves are
where all these little neurons

01:17:57.650 --> 01:18:00.650
and their little processes are

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:01.710
with these little receptors

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.670
for sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:05.007
and maybe fat as well.

01:18:05.007 --> 01:18:06.750
And so, it's this incredible device

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:08.050
that you've been equipped with,

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.550
that you can use to interact

01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:12.000
with various components
of the outside world

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.350
and decide whether or not you
want to bring them in or not.

01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:17.670
Just as you can lose
those olfactory neurons,

01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:19.660
if you happen to get hit on the head

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.080
or you have some other thing,

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.040
maybe it was an infection that caused loss

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.010
of those olfactory sensory neurons,

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:29.680
you can also lose taste
receptors in your mouth.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.870
If you've ever eaten
something that's too hot,

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:36.340
not spicy hot, but too hot,

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:40.040
you burn your tongue, you burn receptors.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.550
It takes about a week to
recover those receptors.

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:45.870
For some people it's a
little bit more quickly,

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.840
but if you burn your tongue badly

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.380
by ingesting a soup that's too hot

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.460
or a beverage that's too hot,

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.120
you will greatly reduce
your sense of taste

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.720
for essentially all tastes.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.320
And that's because those
neurons sit very shallow

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.950
beneath the tongue's surface,

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:04.280
and so that if you put
something too hot on,

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.060
you literally just burn
those neurons away.

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.410
Luckily those neurons also
can replenish themselves.

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:12.790
Those neurons are of the
peripheral nervous system,

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.780
and like all peripheral system neurons

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.550
they can replenish or regenerate.

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:20.140
So, if you burn your mouth
in about a week or so

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:23.060
hopefully sooner you'll
be able to taste again.

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.000
In fact, everybody's ability to taste

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.100
is highly subject to training.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.450
You can really enhance
your ability to taste

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:35.200
and taste the different component
parts of different foods

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.920
simply by paying attention to
what you're trying to taste,

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.370
this is an amazing aspect
of the taste system.

01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:44.160
I think more than any other system,

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.200
the taste system and perhaps
the smell system as well

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:52.200
can be trained so that you can
learn to pick out the tones,

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:55.970
if you will of different ice cream,

01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.560
or different beverages.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.670
I'm somebody who, you know,

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:00.800
I don't drink much alcohol,

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.460
I'll occasionally have
a drink or something,

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.070
but a while ago I got to
taste a bunch of different

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.860
white tequilas, these are
different kinds of tequilas

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.720
that are, they're not
brown, they're white.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.970
And I sort of assumed that
all tequila was disgusting,

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:16.840
that was my assumption before doing this.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.760
And then I tasted a
couple of white tequilas

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.530
and I realized oh, those
aren't aren't too bad.

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:22.120
I tasted a few more,

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.520
and then pretty soon I
could really start to detect

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.840
the nuance and the difference.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.060
Now, I haven't had a
tequilas in a long time,

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.530
now I sort of tend to not
drink at all these days,

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:33.300
but in a very short period
of time like a couple of days

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.840
I got very good at detecting
which things I liked

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.690
and I could start to pick out tones.

01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:39.190
So, I'm not a wine drinker,

01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:40.700
but for those of you that are,

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.820
you know, you hear about
oh, it has floral tones,

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.850
or berry tones, or chocolate tones.

01:20:44.850 --> 01:20:48.710
You know, some of that is
just kind of menu-based

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:51.290
and kind of marketing-based silliness

01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:52.970
designed to get you excited

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:54.240
about what you're about to ingest.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.720
But some of it is real,

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.410
and for people that are skilled

01:20:57.410 --> 01:21:01.130
in assessing wines or assessing foods.

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.150
I'm much more of an eater than a drinker,

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.040
you can really start to
develop a sensitive palate,

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.620
a nuanced palette through what
we call top-down mechanisms.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:13.030
This olfactory cortex
that takes these five,

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.900
maybe the sixth fat receptor too,

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.510
information and tries to make sense

01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:19.000
of what's out there in the world.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.410
And what its utility is,
is it good? Is it bad?

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:24.200
Do I want more of it or less than it?

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.780
That neural circuitry is
unlike other neural circuitry

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.720
in that it seems very amenable

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.290
to behavioral plasticity
for whatever reason,

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:35.610
and we could talk about
what those reasons might be.

01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:36.870
You know, it's interesting sometimes

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:41.230
to think about how your taste
literally, chemical taste,

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.880
is probably very different
than that of other people,

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.710
how a food tastes to you
is probably very different

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:47.930
than how it tastes to somebody else.

01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:50.240
The same probably cannot
be said of something

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.700
like vision or hearing,
unless you're somebody

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.750
who has perfect pitch or your
color vision is disrupted,

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:57.970
or you're a mantis shrimp,

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:00.160
chances are when we
look at the same object

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.060
two people are seeing more
or less the same object

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.400
or perceiving it in a very similar way.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.080
There are experiments that
essentially establish that.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.180
Now we, have taste receptors

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.060
and a lot of those tastes receptors,

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.160
their chemical structures are known,

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.940
they come with fancy names
like the T1R1 or the T1R2,

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.980
which were identified as the
sweet and umami receptors.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.140
So, what's interesting
is that this umami flavor

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.883
is the savory flavor rather

01:22:26.883 --> 01:22:30.400
that's sensed by umami
receptors is very close

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.500
to the receptor that detects sweet things.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.390
Similarly, bitter is sensed

01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:39.630
by a whole other set of receptors.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:42.800
Now, there's a fun naturally
occurring experiment

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.030
that will forever change the
way that you look at animals,

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:49.210
and the way certainly
that I think about dogs

01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:51.470
and Costello in particular.

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:55.390
Carnivorous large animals like tigers

01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:58.080
and some grizzly bears for instance,

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.070
we know that they have no
ability to detect sweet,

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:04.340
they don't actually have the receptors

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:06.790
for sweet on their tongue,

01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.430
but their concentration of umami receptors

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:12.100
of their ability to detect savory

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:16.880
is at least 5,000 times
that which it is in humans.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.553
In other words, if I eat
a little piece of steak,

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.923
or Costello eats a little piece of steak,

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:26.400
that steak probably tastes much,

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.030
much more savory than it does to me.

01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:35.050
So dogs, and tigers, and bears, et cetera,

01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:38.510
they're going to taste savory
things and smell savory things

01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:41.030
with a much higher degree of sensitivity,

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:42.640
but they can't taste sweet things.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.330
Other large animals, which
are mostly herbivores

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:48.250
like the panda bear for instance.

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:50.110
It's hard to believe that
thing is even a bear,

01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:51.520
I got nothing against pandas,

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.670
I just think that they
get a little bit too much

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.990
of the limelight frankly.

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:58.230
So, no vendetta against
Panda, save the pandas,

01:23:58.230 --> 01:23:59.480
I hope they replenish all the pandas,

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:04.020
but pandas in all their whatever

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:07.620
have no umami receptors,
they can't taste savory,

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:11.740
but they have greatly heightened
density of sweet receptors.

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.760
So, there they are eating
these whatever bamboos all day

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.390
or not bamboozle, but bamboos all day

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:22.000
and they can taste things
that are very sweet

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.660
with a much higher degree of intensity.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.740
And in general, animals
that are more gentle

01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:32.300
that are herbivores, excuse me.

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:35.010
Or animals that have the
propensity for aggression,

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:36.730
that's where you really see the divergence

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.060
of the umami receptor

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.700
because it's associated
with meat and amino acids.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:44.410
And where you see the enhancement
of the sweet receptors

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.110
for animals that eat a
lot of plants and fruits,

01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:49.340
and they probably taste
very different to them

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.040
than they do to you and me.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.070
And, so it's interesting to note

01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:57.200
that animals that eat meat,
that eat other organisms

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.250
can actually extract more
savory experience from that.

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:01.500
What does this mean for you?

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.320
All right, do you associate
yourself as a tiger,

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.870
or a grizzly bear, or a panda,
or a combination of both?

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:08.440
Most people are omnivores.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.060
However, you may find it
interesting that people

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.990
that for instance eat a
pure carnivore type diet

01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:19.330
or a keto diet where they
are ingesting a lot of meat,

01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:22.630
so therefore are sensing
a lot of umami flavors.

01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:25.420
And I realized not everyone
who's keto eats meat,

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:29.280
but those who do that will
develop a more sensitive palate

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.490
and likely there are some
data, although early data,

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:35.320
craving for umami-like foods.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.960
Whereas people that eat
a more plant-based diet

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.500
are likely developing a
heightened sensitivity

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.490
and desire for, and maybe even
dopamine response to sugars

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:49.100
and plant-based foods.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.210
Now, this is my partial
attempt to reconcile

01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:55.490
the kind of online battle
that seems to exist

01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:58.193
between plant-based versus animal-based,

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:02.110
purely plant-based or
purely animal-based diets.

01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:03.890
I think most people are omnivores,

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:05.183
but it's kind of interesting to think

01:26:05.183 --> 01:26:08.270
that the systems are plastic

01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:10.450
such that people might want more meat

01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:11.380
if they eat more meat,

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:12.820
people might want more plants

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:15.550
if they eat enough plants
for a long period of time.

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:18.330
And this might explain some
of the chasm that exists

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:19.800
between these two groups.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.050
Now, this is not to say
anything about the ethical

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:24.750
or the environmental
impacts of different things,

01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:25.870
I don't even want to get into that

01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:28.100
because the meat people say
that the plant-based diets

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.710
have as much a negative impact

01:26:29.710 --> 01:26:31.640
as the plant people say
that the meat based diets,

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.130
that's a totally different discussion.

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:36.750
What I'm talking about here is
food craving and food seeking

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:40.490
and one's ability to detect
these umami, savory flavors

01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:42.770
is going to be enhanced
by ingesting more meat

01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:45.510
and less activation of
the sweet receptors.

01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:47.410
So in other words, the more meat you eat

01:26:47.410 --> 01:26:50.880
the more you're going to become
like a tiger, so to speak.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:55.010
And the more that you avoid
these umami flavors and meats

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:57.370
and the more that you
would eat plant-based foods

01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:58.860
and in particular sweet foods,

01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:02.550
the more you will likely
suppress that umami system

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:06.530
and that you will have
a heightened desire for,

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:09.940
appetite for and sensing of sweet foods

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:11.980
or foods that contain sugars.

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.140
What I'm about to tell you
is going to seem crazy,

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.570
but is extremely interesting

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:21.110
with respect to taste and taste receptors.

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:24.100
Remember, even though we can enjoy food

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.420
and we can evolve our sense

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:29.130
of what's tasty or not tasty,
depending on life decisions,

01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:31.040
environmental changes, et cetera,

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.747
the taste system just
like the olfactory system

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.190
and the visual system

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:36.660
was laid down for the purpose

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.420
of moving towards things
that are good for us

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.410
and moving away from
things that are bad for us,

01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:44.263
that's the kind of core
function of the nervous system.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.793
Well, taste receptors are not
just expressed on the tongue,

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:54.200
they are expressed in other
cells and other tissues as well.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.100
Some of you may be able to imagine foods

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.470
that are so delicious to you

01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:01.610
that they make your entire body feel good.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:06.440
Or foods that are so
horrifically awful to think about

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.340
let alone taste, that they
create a whole body shuddering

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.730
or kind of repellent-type response

01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:15.810
where you just either cringe
or turn your face away

01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:17.680
even in the absence of that food.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.750
That's sort of how I feel about
pungent, Gorgonzola cheese.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:24.633
If you like Gorgonzola
cheese, I don't judge you,

01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:27.610
I just, that's an individual difference.

01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.620
I happen to love certain foods,

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.653
I do like savory foods very much.

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.530
I, when I think about them,

01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:37.020
they just they make me feel good.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.970
And I'm oftentimes not even associating

01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:41.290
with the taste of those foods,

01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:43.560
it feels almost like a visceral thing.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.750
Well, it turns out that
some of the taste receptors

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:47.450
extend beyond the tongue,

01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:49.140
that they actually can extend

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:52.110
into portions of the gut
and digestive system.

01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:53.993
And if that's not strange enough,

01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:57.320
turns out that some of the taste receptors

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.833
are actually expressed on
the ovaries and the testes.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.750
So, what that means is that the gonads,

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:08.150
the very cells, and tissues,
and organs in our body

01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:11.010
that make up the reproductive axis

01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:13.080
are expressing taste receptors.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.250
Okay, so how do we interpret this?

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.910
Does this mean that when you eat something

01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:19.210
that's very savory or
very sweet for instance,

01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:21.350
that it's triggering activation

01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:24.450
of the ovaries or of the testes?

01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:27.020
Well, it's possible.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.260
Now, how those molecules,

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.360
those chemical molecules
would actually get there

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.780
isn't clear, the digestive
track does not run directly

01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.860
to the testes or to the ovaries.

01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:40.060
But nonetheless, what this
means is that chemical sensing

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.937
of the very things that
we detect on our tongue

01:29:41.937 --> 01:29:45.800
and that we call taste in quotes in food

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.200
is also evoking

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.573
cellular responses within
the reproductive gonads.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.570
Now, whether or not this
underlies the positive association

01:29:57.570 --> 01:30:00.330
that we have with certain
foods isn't clear,

01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:04.630
but I'd be remiss if I
didn't point out the obvious,

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:09.630
which is that the relationship
between the sensual nature

01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:11.960
of particular foods

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.200
and sensuality generally
and the reproductive axis

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.150
is something that's been
covered in many movies,

01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:21.290
there are entire movies that are focused

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:23.720
on the relationship between for instance,

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.970
chocolate and love and
reproductive behaviors,

01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:30.960
or certain feasts of meat

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.360
and their wonderful tastes

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.670
and the kind of sensuality around feasts

01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:38.520
of different types of foods,

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.790
but in general, it's the
sweet and the savory,

01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:46.230
rarely is it the sour or the
bitter, the salty or the fat.

01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:49.290
And not surprisingly perhaps,

01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:51.603
it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs,

01:30:51.603 --> 01:30:54.580
the receptors that are
associated with the sweet

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:57.610
and with the umami, the savory flavors

01:30:57.610 --> 01:30:59.740
that are expressed not just on the tongue

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:02.090
and in portions of the digestive tract,

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:04.310
but on the gonads themselves.

01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:05.380
So, what does this mean?

01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:06.990
Does this mean that eating certain foods

01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:08.760
can stimulate the gonads?

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.660
Maybe, there's no data that immediately

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:14.690
support that right now, but
this is an emerging area.

01:31:14.690 --> 01:31:17.120
If you'd like to read more about this

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.760
there's a great review,

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.990
entitled Taste perception:
From the tongue to the testis,

01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:24.770
although they do also
talk about the ovaries.

01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:26.210
Why they didn't include that in the title

01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:29.730
is I think a reflection
of the bias of the author.

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:34.045
The author indeed not
incidentally is Feng Li,

01:31:34.045 --> 01:31:36.361
last name L-I.

01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:38.550
It's a very interesting paper published

01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:42.200
in Molecular Human Reproduction.

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.190
You can find it easily
online, it's downloadable,

01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:46.000
I'll also provide a link to it.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.650
I just think it's fascinating

01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:50.070
that these taste receptors are
expressed in other tissues.

01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:51.350
And I should mention
that they're expressed

01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:54.530
in tissues of other areas
of the body as well,

01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:56.820
including the respiratory system,

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:00.420
but the richest aggregation

01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.870
or concentration of these receptors

01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:04.130
for umami and sweet of
course is on the tongue,

01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:05.780
but also on the gonads.

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:07.180
And I think it does speak

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.690
to the possible bridge between

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.190
what we think of as a sensory

01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:14.510
or a sensual experience of food

01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:18.090
and the deeper kind of
visceral sense within the gut,

01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:20.090
and maybe even within the gonads as well

01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:22.640
of something that we find
extremely pleasurable,

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:26.320
or even appetitive that
we want to move toward it.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.850
We are actually going to
return to that general theme

01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:32.240
in the discussion about touch sensation.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.580
Some people for instance,

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:38.090
when they touch certain
surfaces like furs,

01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:41.410
or sheep skins, or velvet,

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:43.630
or soft, smooth surfaces

01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:46.270
it feels good elsewhere in their body,

01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:49.863
not just at the point of
contact with that surface.

01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:54.180
And similarly, if there's the...

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.013
How about this one?

01:32:55.013 --> 01:32:58.120
The screech of chalk on a
chalkboard, it's a sound,

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:00.770
but it has a very strong
visceral component,

01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:04.480
or sandpaper, like
fingernails on a chalkboard,

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.660
not the sound, but the feeling, right?

01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.520
Exactly, so our whole
nervous system is tuned

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.380
to either be drawn toward appetitive,

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.860
or repelled by aversive behaviors, right?

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.810
So there's this push-pull that exists,

01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:19.970
and what I'm referring to
in terms of these receptors

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:22.140
on the tongue that are also
expressed on the gonads

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.390
is yet another example of
what at least in this case

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:26.780
seems to be an appetitive thing,

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:29.540
a desire to move toward certain foods

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:30.860
and maybe even the experiences

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.430
that are associated with those foods.

01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:34.330
I want to talk about a particular aspect

01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:37.720
of food and a chemical reaction in cooking

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.340
called the Maillard reaction.

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:41.580
Some of you have probably
heard of the Maillard reaction,

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:45.580
it's spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.770
The D is silent, so don't
call it the Maillard reaction,

01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:51.070
and it's not the Maillard reaction,

01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:52.730
it is the Maillard reaction.

01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:55.020
And the Maillard reaction is a reaction

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:58.570
that for the aficionados is
a non-enzymatic browning.

01:33:58.570 --> 01:34:01.760
The other form of non-enzymatic
browning is caramelization,

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.893
although when you hear caramel, carmel,

01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:06.000
I think it's caramel.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
You think sweet, and indeed
caramelization is a sugar-sugar

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.660
chemical interaction that leads
to a kind of nicely toasted

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.680
not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.530
Whereas the Maillard reaction
is that really savory reaction

01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:25.410
that occurs when you have a
sugar amino acid reaction.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.010
Remember, we have neurons in our gut,

01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:29.370
but also neurons in our tongue

01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:32.610
and neurons deep in the brain
that are comparing the amount

01:34:32.610 --> 01:34:35.840
of sugar to savory.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.550
Okay, and the Maillard
reaction is very interesting

01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:40.000
for you chemists out there,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.470
this is going to be way too elementary.

01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:42.400
And for you non-chemists

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.990
it's probably going to be
a little bit of a reach,

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:47.320
but just bear with me, all
these chemicals that we sense

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.440
have a different structure,

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.990
it's like hydrogens, and oxygens,

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:51.380
and aldehyde groups, and all these things.

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.040
And basically the Maillard reaction

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.070
involves what's called a free aldehyde.

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:57.590
If you didn't like chemistry,
don't worry about it,

01:34:57.590 --> 01:35:01.090
it's basically got a group
there that kind of sits open

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:02.530
that allows it to interact

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:05.760
with other things and actually
through the use of heat

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.670
and the process that we call brazing,

01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:10.220
which I'll talk about in a moment

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.120
you create a what's called a ketone group.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.740
Now, most people now have heard of ketones

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.680
'cause they think about
the ketogenic diet,

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.650
but a ketone group is
actually a chemical compound

01:35:20.650 --> 01:35:21.980
that can be used for energy,

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.460
and that's why people say you
can use ketones for energy,

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:28.140
but if you've ever actually
encountered ketones,

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.701
if you for instance, get liquid ketones,

01:35:30.701 --> 01:35:32.880
a ketone ester, and you smell it,

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.130
what does it smell like?

01:35:34.130 --> 01:35:36.550
It smells a little bit like an alcohol,

01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:39.950
but it has a kind of savory taste,

01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:41.480
even when you smell it.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.190
Okay, there are other smells
that have these tastes too,

01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:46.240
but for the Maillard reaction

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.930
which could be created for instance

01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:49.270
like if you took a piece of meat,

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:50.440
or if you're not a meat eater

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.050
if you took tomatoes and
you cook them in a pan

01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:54.970
and you cooked it nice and
slow till it's simmered

01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:57.230
and almost started to brown
and burn a little bit.

01:35:57.230 --> 01:36:00.140
Usually if I do it burns,
I'm not a good cook

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:02.050
as Costello points out a lot,

01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:07.050
but it gets that like almost
tangy, very umami-like flavor.

01:36:07.810 --> 01:36:10.020
And sometimes it will
even stick to the pan,

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.227
if you scrape it off

01:36:11.227 --> 01:36:13.430
and actually you can
taste it in your mouth

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:14.640
as you're cooking it.

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:15.900
That's the Maillard reaction,

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.280
that's that free aldehyde group,

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.163
and that's the production
of a ketone group.

01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:25.320
When you smell ketones, it
smells very much like that.

01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.260
Okay, some people talk about the ketones

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:28.800
will produce like fruity breath.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.120
And that's true if people
are really far into ketosis,

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.610
their breath has a kind of fruity odor,

01:36:32.610 --> 01:36:34.330
that's a little bit of a different thing.

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.940
So, the relationship
between smell and taste

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:39.430
is a very, very close one.

01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:40.960
And this is why when people drink wine

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.490
they often will inhale and then sip,

01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:45.120
some of that is just kind of like pomp

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.350
and circumstance frankly,
they make a big deal of it,

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:51.103
but they can sense
things with their mouth.

01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:55.140
The combination of odor receptors

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.240
being activated in a particular way,

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.440
and taste receptors in
the mouth being activated

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.720
in a particular way,
triggers the activation

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.580
of multiple brain areas that
are associated with taste,

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.820
and circuitry within the body

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.150
that's associated with the behaviors

01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:11.980
that relate to that taste
like leaning toward it,

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:13.110
or leaning away from it

01:37:13.110 --> 01:37:15.970
depending on whether or not
it's appetitive or aversive.

01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:18.870
So the Maillard reaction is
a very interesting reaction

01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:21.900
involving this sugar amino acid thing,

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.150
but really it's what it's
doing is heating up food

01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:29.900
such that the amino
acids are more available

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.370
literally in their chemical form

01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:33.400
for detection by the neurons.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.690
This is a phenomenon that occurs

01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:37.870
in other domains of the taste system.

01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:40.430
For instance, a lot of what's happened

01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:42.910
with highly processed foods

01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:45.700
is that manufacturers have figured out

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.370
how to trigger more dopamine response

01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:52.390
by ingestion of these sugary
foods and created textures,

01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:55.760
and created essentially design
of foods for two purposes.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.950
I'm not out to completely
demonize processed food,

01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:00.750
I did that in a previous episode,

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:04.540
but processed foods are
really designed to take foods

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.740
that ordinarily would spoil,
that would have a shelf life

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:07.720
and extend their shelf life

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.740
to turn foods which are not
a commodity into a commodity.

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:13.920
Something could be stored and
used essentially as a tradable

01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:19.160
purchasable, sellable resource.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.530
In doing that they change,

01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:22.600
they've also decided to change the texture

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.770
so that you want to chew more of them.

01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:25.700
Like I have this thing

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.900
I don't know what it is for
those Triscuit crackers.

01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:30.160
I don't know why are those things so good?

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.330
It's probably the
texture, got those layers,

01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:33.830
they're just kind of perfectly salty.

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:34.840
I haven't had one in a long time,

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.820
so I bet if I had one now
it wouldn't taste as good

01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.040
as I'm imagining it.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.610
But those combinations of
texture, smell, and taste

01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:44.830
are what combine to activate
these different brain areas

01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:47.470
that make you really
want to desire something.

01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:49.130
And the people who make foods,

01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:50.910
processed foods in particular,

01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:53.630
are phenomenally good at figuring out

01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:56.070
what drives the dopamine
system and makes you want more

01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:58.760
of these things either
because of the way they taste

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.670
and/or because of the
way they trigger neurons

01:39:00.670 --> 01:39:02.500
in your gut that have
nothing to do with taste

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.650
that simply make you
desire more of the food.

01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:08.420
In other words, many of the
foods that are processed foods

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:10.390
make you desire more of them,

01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:13.300
it's impossible to eat
one chip kind of thing.

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.610
Not because they taste good,

01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:17.660
but because in your gut
they're activating the neurons

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660
that activate dopamine

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.910
which make you seek more of those foods

01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:23.870
independent of blood
sugar or anything else.

01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:26.730
So, you may actually be
eating more particular foods

01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:28.620
not because they taste good,

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.850
but because they feel good
on your tongue and mouth,

01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:34.830
and because the neurons in your gut

01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.180
which are totally independent
of conscious taste

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.730
are triggering the release of dopamine

01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:41.370
which is a molecule that
makes you seek more of,

01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:42.500
and do more of anything

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.010
that led to the ingestion of that food.

01:39:45.010 --> 01:39:47.320
There's a fun experiment that you can do,

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.320
which is to completely invert
your sense of sweet and sour,

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.980
there's actually a way to do this readily.

01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:56.860
When I was a post-doc,

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:59.010
I used to have a journal club at my house,

01:39:59.010 --> 01:40:01.900
people would come over in
the evening once a month,

01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:03.200
and we would read a paper,

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.170
typically the weirdest paper we could find

01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:08.147
and we would eat food and hang out,

01:40:08.147 --> 01:40:11.710
that's what nerds did and do for fun,

01:40:11.710 --> 01:40:12.920
so that's what we did.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.530
And one time someone brought
what's called miracle berry.

01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:20.030
Okay, so this isn't some
psychedelic plant medicine thing,

01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:22.430
miracle berry, you can purchase online,

01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:24.500
it's relatively inexpensive.

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.470
It actually causes a change

01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:30.110
in the configuration of taste receptors

01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:33.640
such that when you eat
something sour, it tastes sweet.

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.290
And so what's really wild
is you ingest miracle berry,

01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:39.410
and then you bite into a lemon,

01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:40.800
maybe even the lemon and peel

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.210
and it tastes as sweet as a peach.

01:40:43.210 --> 01:40:45.533
And this effect lasts several hours.

01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:48.500
Definitely, you know, check any warnings,

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.080
I don't know what sort of warnings these,

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.160
a miracle berry carries,

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.660
but I'm sure there's always
something, you can imagine.

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.640
There are a number of
papers on miracle berry

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.360
or miracle fruit it's called,

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.350
but it changes your perception of sour

01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:04.500
at a perceptual level,

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.070
but it does that by changing the activity

01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:09.590
of the receptors in the mouth and tongue.

01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:12.410
Now, this is important as a
principle and it's underscored

01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:14.580
by experiments that have
been done by for instance

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.910
Charles Zuker's lab at
Columbia University,

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:20.210
where they've essentially
genetically engineered animals

01:41:20.210 --> 01:41:23.340
such that the bitter receptor is swapped

01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:24.450
with the sweet receptor,

01:41:24.450 --> 01:41:26.720
or the sweet receptor is swapped
with the bitter receptor.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.060
And what they show is
that the actual food,

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.400
the experience on the tongue

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.040
drives different pathways in the brain.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.730
Here's what they did,
they essentially took mice

01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:39.370
and swapped out the sweet receptor

01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:40.670
and put in a bitter receptor.

01:41:40.670 --> 01:41:42.080
And then what they found is that

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.610
whereas normally mice
would actively seek out

01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:48.270
and even work for sugar water, sucrose,

01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:49.540
they really like that.

01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:52.310
If they replace the sweet
receptor with the bitter receptor,

01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.960
the mice would avoid sugar water.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.170
And the reverse was also true,

01:41:55.170 --> 01:41:58.250
that mice would drink a
bitter solution avidly,

01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:59.580
they liked a bitter solution

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.060
if they swapped out the bitter
receptor for sweet receptor.

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:05.010
What this means is that
our entire experience

01:42:05.010 --> 01:42:06.380
of what we taste is dependent

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:09.490
on how we experience that
taste the level of the tongue.

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:12.620
And so, you're hopefully not
going to do genetic engineering

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.840
of your taste receptors,

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.190
but if you'd like to do
this sort of experiment

01:42:16.190 --> 01:42:18.800
you actually can do it very
easily using miracle fruit,

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.720
the instructions of how
much to ingest, et cetera,

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.926
any safety concerns are
usually on the package

01:42:23.926 --> 01:42:26.150
and should be easy to find.

01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:28.290
And there's a lot of science
to support how this works,

01:42:28.290 --> 01:42:31.290
it's kind of a fun
experiment that anyone can do

01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:33.280
and will completely change your perception

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.490
of any food that you're
accustomed to eating.

01:42:35.490 --> 01:42:38.800
In fact, you can figure out how much sweet

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.620
or the sense of sweetness

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:43.020
is contributing to your
experience of a food,

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.000
even if you don't think
of it as a sweet food

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.280
through this miracle fruit experiment.

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.320
You could take miracle fruit,

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:51.240
you could eat a slice of
pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza,

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.810
which perhaps normally to you
would taste just like pizza,

01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:56.990
and you'll notice it
tastes very different.

01:42:56.990 --> 01:43:01.270
What you are detecting is
how much the sense of sweet

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:04.590
was contributing to
that particular flavor.

01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:07.910
Now, I'd like to return to pheromones.

01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:09.130
As I mentioned earlier,

01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:12.620
true pheromonal effects are
well-established in animals.

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.120
And one of the most
remarkable pheromone effects

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.100
that's ever been described

01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:18.330
is one that actually I've
mentioned before on this podcast,

01:43:18.330 --> 01:43:20.070
but I'll mention again just briefly,

01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:21.630
which is the Coolidge effect.

01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:23.600
The Coolidge effect is the effect

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:26.890
of a male of a given species,

01:43:26.890 --> 01:43:31.447
in most cases, it tended to be
a rodent or a rooster mating.

01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:35.960
And at some point reaching exhaustion

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.020
or the inability to mate again

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:41.360
because they just simply
couldn't for whatever reason.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.360
The Coolidge effect establishes
that if you swap out the hen

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:50.210
with a new hen, or the female
rat or mouse with a new one

01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:53.860
then the rat or the rooster

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:56.400
spontaneously regains
their ability to mate,

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.520
somehow their vigor is returned,

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.140
the refractory period after
mating that normally occurs

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:05.600
is abolished and they can mate again.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.950
It turns out that the Coolidge effect

01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:09.060
runs in the opposite direction too.

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:11.600
I did not know this, but I
recently learned of a study,

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.330
it was actually done in
hamsters, not in in mice,

01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:17.580
but it turns out that females also will,

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.990
female rodents will mate to exhaustion.

01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:21.010
And at some port...

01:44:21.010 --> 01:44:22.220
At some point, excuse me,

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.130
they will refuse to mate any longer

01:44:24.130 --> 01:44:26.220
unless you swap in a new male.

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.610
And then because mating in rodents

01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:30.320
involves the female being receptive,

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.900
there are certain number of behaviors

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:34.880
that mean that tell you that she's willing

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.633
and wanting to mate,
so-called lordosis reflex.

01:44:39.970 --> 01:44:42.170
Then if there's a new male,

01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:46.340
she will spontaneously
regain the lordosis reflex

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:47.370
and the desire to mate.

01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:49.550
And how do you know this?

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:51.380
How do we know it's a pheromonal effect?

01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:55.010
Well, this recovery of the
desire and ability to mate

01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:58.280
both in males and in females

01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.610
can be evoked completely by the odor

01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:03.600
of a new male or female,

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.040
it doesn't even have
to be the presentation

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.210
of the actual animal.

01:45:06.210 --> 01:45:07.043
And that's how you know

01:45:07.043 --> 01:45:08.510
that it's not some visual interaction

01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:09.800
or some other interaction,

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.040
it's a pheromonal interaction.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.160
Now, as I mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.640
in humans have been debated
for a long period of time.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.760
We are thought to have a vestigial,

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.970
meaning a kind of shrunken down

01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:27.210
miniature accessory olfactory
bulb called Jacobson's organ,

01:45:27.210 --> 01:45:29.600
or the vomeronasal organ.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.800
Some people don't believe
that Jacobson's organ exists,

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.220
some people do, there is
anatomical evidence for it

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:37.040
in some cadavers.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.090
It sits not very high up in the brain

01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:42.840
or where your olfactory bulb is,

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:45.430
but it's actually in the nasal passages,

01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:46.720
so there's like little dents

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.480
as you go up through your nasal passages,

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.790
and there is evidence of
something that's vomeronasal-like.

01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:54.590
Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ,

01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:57.260
they call it Jacobson's organ
if it's present in humans,

01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:01.770
kind of tucked into some of the
divots in the nasal passage.

01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:06.710
Even if that organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't there

01:46:06.710 --> 01:46:07.950
or is not responsible

01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:10.860
for the chemical signaling
between individuals,

01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.420
there is chemical signaling
between human beings.

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:16.760
As I mentioned earlier,
the effect of tears

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.803
in suppressing the areas of the brain

01:46:18.803 --> 01:46:21.830
that are involved in sexual desire

01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:25.650
and testosterone of males,
that's a concrete result,

01:46:25.650 --> 01:46:28.560
that's a very good result
published by an excellent group

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.300
with no pre-existing bias going in,

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.200
that's just what they found.

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.310
There is also evidence

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.970
both for and against

01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:40.460
chemical signaling between females

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.990
in terms of synchronization
of menstrual cycles.

01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:46.850
Now, the original paper on
this was published in the 1970s

01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:50.080
by McClintock, and it essentially said

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.580
that when women live together
in group housing, dormitories,

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:57.040
and similar that their menstrual
cycles were synchronized

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.930
and that was due to what was hypothesized

01:46:58.930 --> 01:47:00.630
to be pheromonal effects.

01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:01.463
Over the years,

01:47:01.463 --> 01:47:04.870
that study has been
challenged many, many times.

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:07.810
The more recent data point to the idea

01:47:07.810 --> 01:47:11.030
that there is chemical-chemical
signaling between women

01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:14.450
in ways that impact the
timing of the menstrual cycle,

01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:17.040
but that depending on whether or not

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:20.010
some of the women are
in the ovulation phase,

01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:21.590
the ovulatory phase of that cycle

01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:23.470
or whether or not they are
in the follicular phase,

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:26.120
the phase when the follicle is maturing

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:30.453
before the egg actually obviates.

01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:35.590
So two separate phases of
the 28 day menstrual cycle

01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:39.930
will either lengthen or
shorten the menstrual cycle

01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:42.030
of the person that smells those women.

01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:43.650
Translated into English what that means

01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:46.270
is that it is very likely it seems

01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:47.990
that something, maybe pheromones,

01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:49.340
but maybe some other chemical

01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:52.190
that is independent of
pheromones is being conveyed

01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:55.870
between women that are housed together

01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:57.520
or spend a lot of time together

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.010
to shift their menstrual cycle,

01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:02.160
but it doesn't necessarily
mean that they synchronize.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.010
So for instance, if one woman
is in the follicular phase

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.900
of the menstrual cycle,

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.660
it might shorten or delay ovulation.

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:14.860
Excuse me, it might accelerate
ovulation in another woman,

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:17.050
whereas if somebody is
in the ovulatory phase

01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:21.120
of their cycle, it might
lengthen the menstrual cycle

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.710
out so that they, the woman
who smells that person's scent

01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:27.410
or who smells her sweat,

01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:29.080
we still don't know the
origin of the chemical

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.600
would ovulate later.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:31.950
So, all of this is to say

01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:34.020
is that chemical-chemical
signaling is happening

01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.600
from females to males
through tears, we know that.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.040
Is that a pheromonal effect?

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.120
Well, by the strict
definition of a pheromone,

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.190
a molecule that's released
from one individual

01:48:42.190 --> 01:48:44.960
that impacts the biology
of another individual, yes.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:48.410
But in terms of identifying
what the pheromone is in tears,

01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:49.720
that's still unknown,

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.170
it's not clear what the
chemical compound is.

01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:53.960
So, we're reluctant as scientists

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.580
to call it a true pheromonal effect.

01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:58.000
The menstrual cycle
and the synchronization

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.150
of the menstrual cycle
effect seems to hold up

01:49:00.150 --> 01:49:01.060
under some conditions.

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:02.150
But in some cases,

01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:05.930
there's a kind of clash of
menstrual cycles that's created

01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:09.140
by chemicals that are emitted

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.690
from one female to another.

01:49:11.690 --> 01:49:14.460
So, there are many
examples of this in humans,

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.150
for instance, people can recognize

01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:22.090
the t-shirt of their mate.

01:49:22.090 --> 01:49:22.990
If you give...

01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:24.430
This experiment has been done many times,

01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:25.790
I know it's been challenged
a number of times,

01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:29.600
but the data are pretty good
by now that if you offer,

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.350
you take a collection of women

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:35.140
who are in stable
relationships with somebody,

01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:37.730
you offer them the smell of
a hundred different shirts

01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:39.380
and they can very readily pick out

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:41.350
their significant others scent.

01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:44.010
Okay, that's pure olfaction,
that's not pheromonal,

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:47.330
but nonetheless is a remarkable
degree of discrimination,

01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:49.400
olfactory discrimination.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.160
You can dilute their partner's scent

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.270
down to the point where they themselves

01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:57.210
can't consciously detect the difference

01:49:57.210 --> 01:49:59.250
between the sweat or the t-shirt

01:49:59.250 --> 01:50:01.300
of a hundred different t-shirts or so,

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.000
they might say, "I don't
really smell the difference,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.690
but I think it's this one.

01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:07.510
Yeah, this one belongs to the
person that I've been with."

01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:09.160
And they are much greater than chance

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.860
at detecting the t-shirt

01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:12.950
or identifying the t-shirt correctly.

01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:14.500
So, there's no question really

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.860
that there is chemical-chemical
signaling between humans,

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:19.040
the question is whether or not

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.240
it's truly pheromonal in basis.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.510
Now, you'll notice that a
lot of the examples I gave

01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:28.510
aside from the one of tears
is women detecting the scents

01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:31.200
of men or of other women.

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:33.750
And it turns out that there
are a number of papers,

01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:35.810
the best one I think

01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:39.120
that I could find is published
in Physiology and Behavior

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.490
in 2009, it's a review

01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:43.820
entitled Sex Differences and
Reproductive Hormone Influences

01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:45.750
on Human Odor Perception

01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:48.650
by Doty, D-O-T-Y, and Cameron.

01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:50.070
I encourage you to check out this review

01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:51.640
it's available free as a download,

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.150
we'll provide a link to it,

01:50:53.150 --> 01:50:55.120
you can get the full PDF if you want.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.120
But it does seem that women
are better at detecting

01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:03.860
odors in these odor
discrimination tasks than are men.

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.370
And yes, that it does vary

01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:08.760
according to where they are
in their menstrual cycle.

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.890
And yes, they also looked at people

01:51:10.890 --> 01:51:12.033
who had received gonadectomy,

01:51:12.033 --> 01:51:13.750
they had their ovaries removed,

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.210
a number of different important controls.

01:51:16.210 --> 01:51:17.950
None of this surprises me,

01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:19.470
none of this should surprise you,

01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:22.260
it's very clear that hormones
have a profound effect

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.880
on enlarge number of systems

01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.700
in our biology and that smell, and taste,

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:29.630
and the ability to sense the
chemical states of others,

01:51:29.630 --> 01:51:31.250
either consciously or subconsciously

01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:32.570
have a profound influence

01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:34.530
on whether or not we might
want to spend time with them,

01:51:34.530 --> 01:51:35.500
whether or not this is somebody

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:36.900
that we're pair bonded with,

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.270
whether or not this is somebody

01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:42.460
that we just met and don't
trust yet, things of this sort.

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:46.240
And given what's at stake in
terms of reproductive biology,

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.730
not just offspring, but
given the possibility

01:51:49.730 --> 01:51:51.703
of transmission of diseases, et cetera,

01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:55.793
you know, the risks of
childbirth, et cetera.

01:51:57.290 --> 01:52:00.530
It makes so much sense
that much of our biology

01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:03.410
is wired toward detecting
and sensing whether or not

01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:06.410
things and people are things
that we should approach

01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:09.560
or avoid, whether or not reproduction

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.510
with that person is the
appropriate response

01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:13.750
or suppression of the
reproductive response

01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:15.450
is the appropriate response, right?

01:52:15.450 --> 01:52:17.470
As in that's the case with the tears.

01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:20.020
So, I think these are fascinating studies,

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.940
it's an area that still
needs a lot of work,

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:25.407
but there are some really
wonderful papers on this.

01:52:25.407 --> 01:52:27.230
And the one that I
mentioned a few minutes ago,

01:52:27.230 --> 01:52:29.300
Sex Differences and
Reproductive Hormone Influences

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.950
on Human Odor Perception

01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:34.730
is one of the better
reviews that are out there.

01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:37.070
There are also a number of other reviews

01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:39.530
for instance that talk
about pheromone effects

01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:43.100
and their impact on mood,
and sexual responses,

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:43.933
and things of that sort,

01:52:43.933 --> 01:52:45.490
and we will also provide
some links to those.

01:52:45.490 --> 01:52:46.980
A lot of this is still speculative,

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.463
but I want to say I know
I said it three times,

01:52:48.463 --> 01:52:50.210
what I really want to underscore

01:52:50.210 --> 01:52:51.530
because it is vitally important,

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:52.990
and people seem to get a little triggered

01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:54.473
by the notion of pheromones.

01:52:56.170 --> 01:52:58.830
Just because we haven't identified

01:52:58.830 --> 01:53:00.930
the actual chemical compound

01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:05.240
that's acting as a pheromone
or putative pheromone

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.540
does not mean that
chemical-chemical signaling

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:10.890
between individuals doesn't
exist, clearly it does.

01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:13.790
Actually, you and every other human

01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:15.870
from the time you're born
until the time you die

01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:18.840
are actively seeking out

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.150
and sensing and evaluating

01:53:22.150 --> 01:53:24.463
the chemicals that come
from other individuals.

01:53:24.463 --> 01:53:27.610
There's a really nice study that was done

01:53:27.610 --> 01:53:29.760
by the Weizmann Institute, a group there,

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:31.290
I think it was also Noam Sobel's group,

01:53:31.290 --> 01:53:33.250
but another group as well as I recall

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:35.510
looking at human-human interactions

01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:37.510
when they meet for the first time.

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:40.980
It's a remarkable study
because what they found

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:44.420
was people would reach
out and shake hands.

01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:45.700
It's is a typical response,

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.120
you know pre-pandemic, people would meet,

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.220
they'd reach out and
they would shake hands.

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:54.320
And what they observed
was almost every time

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.050
within just a few seconds
of having shaken hands

01:53:58.050 --> 01:53:59.460
with this new individual,

01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:03.080
people will touch their
eyes almost without fail.

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.640
Occasionally, they would
touch their eyebrow,

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:06.410
occasionally someone
would touch their hair.

01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:09.800
We always associate that with
people having some sort of...

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:12.300
Or us having some sort of
self-conscious response

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:14.517
like oh, we want to make
sure shirt tucked in

01:54:14.517 --> 01:54:16.570
and all prim and proper, whatever it is,

01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:18.440
or looking right, is there
something you're like teeth?

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:19.440
This kind of thing,

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:21.260
but actually people are doing that

01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:24.640
even if the person they
just met left the room.

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:25.640
So, someone's sitting there,

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:27.620
someone comes in, they shake hands,

01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:31.090
and the person inevitably
subconsciously touches their eyes.

01:54:31.090 --> 01:54:34.210
They are taking chemicals
from the skin contact

01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:37.300
and they are placing it on a
mucosal membrane of some sort,

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.400
typically not up to their
nose or in their mouth,

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.870
typically on their eyes.

01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:42.270
Now, animals do this all the time,

01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:44.630
there's a phenomenon in
animals called bunting.

01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:47.020
If you have a overeager dog

01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:49.330
that when you meet them
or you see them again

01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:50.440
after you've been away for the day

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.610
they'll rub their head against you, right?

01:54:52.610 --> 01:54:54.610
Cats will do this too,
it's called bunting,

01:54:54.610 --> 01:54:56.320
they're rubbing their scent glands on you,

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.780
they're marking you.

01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:58.790
And believe it or not,

01:54:58.790 --> 01:55:01.390
you're marking other people
when you shake their hand,

01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:03.880
and they are then taking your mark

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:07.180
and rubbing it on
themselves subconsciously.

01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.970
So, we all do these kinds of behaviors,

01:55:08.970 --> 01:55:10.140
and now that you're aware of it

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.850
you can watch for it in your environment,

01:55:11.850 --> 01:55:13.920
you can pay attention to people.

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:15.180
Some of this has probably changed

01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:17.500
in light of the events of 2020, et cetera,

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:20.520
but nonetheless, we are evaluating

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.650
the molecules on people's breath,

01:55:22.650 --> 01:55:25.150
we are evaluating the
molecules on people's skin

01:55:25.150 --> 01:55:28.560
by actively rubbing it on ourselves.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.490
And we are actively involved

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:32.790
in sensing not just
their facial expressions,

01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:34.830
the size of their pupils,
and things like that,

01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:36.780
but the chemicals that they are emitting,

01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.060
their hormone status, how they smell.

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.520
We're detecting the pheromones possibly,

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.740
but certainly the odors in their breath.

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:47.300
You might say, "Well, I
don't actually go around

01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:48.530
sniffing people's breath.

01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:50.240
I don't, you know, unless if it's bad,"

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:51.270
in which case it's aversive,

01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:53.610
but breath is communicating
a lot of signals.

01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:56.350
And this handshake eye rub experiment

01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:59.620
shows that we are actively
going through behaviors

01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:02.140
reflexively to wipe ourselves

01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:04.740
or smear ourselves with
other people's chemicals.

01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:07.580
Now, that might seem odd
or even gross to you,

01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:09.470
but I think it's beautiful,

01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:11.090
I think that it illustrates

01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:13.090
the extent to which we as human beings

01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:15.840
are in some ways among the other animals

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.180
in our subconscious, sometimes conscious,

01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.120
but certainly subconscious

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:23.020
tendency to try and evaluate
our chemical environment

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.200
through what we inhale through our nose,

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.450
what we ingest through our mouth,

01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:31.490
and what we actively take
off other people's skin

01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:34.520
and rub on ourselves to evaluate it

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.960
and what we should do about it,

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.170
and perhaps that person as well.

01:56:38.170 --> 01:56:41.000
So today, we talked a
lot about olfaction taste

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.360
and chemical sensing between individuals.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.430
I'd like to think that you now know a lot

01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:47.370
about how your smell system works

01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:51.490
and why inhaling is a really
good thing to do in general

01:56:51.490 --> 01:56:54.060
for waking up your brain,
and for cognitive function,

01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:55.910
and for enhancing your sense of smell.

01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:58.310
We talked about how to
enhance your sense of taste,

01:56:58.310 --> 01:57:00.140
and we talked about chemical signaling

01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:02.500
between individuals as
a way of communicating

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.820
some important aspects about biology.

01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:07.410
People are shaping each
other's biology all the time

01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:09.470
by way of these chemicals
that are being traded

01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:11.060
from one body to the next

01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:15.010
through air, and skin to
skin contact, and tears.

01:57:15.010 --> 01:57:16.290

And we are also very active on Instagram,

01:57:45.807 --> 01:57:49.080
@hubermanlab on Instagram is where I post

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.460
yes, clips from the podcast,

01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:53.490
but also additional new
and original content,

01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:55.170
and you have the opportunity
to put your questions

01:57:55.170 --> 01:57:57.410
in the comment section
below those posts as well.

01:57:57.410 --> 01:58:00.370
I do read all the comments on YouTube,

01:58:00.370 --> 01:58:03.580
on Apple, and also on Instagram.

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.840
We have a website hubermanlab.com

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.340
where all the podcasts are housed

01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.690
with links to YouTube, Apple, and Spotify

01:58:10.690 --> 01:58:12.400
as well as downloadable links,

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.370
everything's zero cost of course.

01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:16.230
And there, you can also find any links

01:58:16.230 --> 01:58:18.523
to additional resources
that we might post.

01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:21.360
As well, please check out our sponsors

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:23.860
that we mentioned at the
beginning of each podcast episode,

01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:25.060
those sponsors are the way

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:28.260
that we are able to bring zero
cost to consumer information

01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:30.480
about all these topics to you each week.

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:35.480
And we also have a Patreon,
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.150
and there you can support us

01:58:37.150 --> 01:58:39.030
at any level that you like.

01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:40.750
Today, we didn't really
talk about supplements,

01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:43.140
but previous episodes
and in future episodes

01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:45.080
we'll talk about supplements
and things that you can take

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:48.200
to modify your biology and
nervous system if you like.

01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.810
We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:53.090
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency

01:58:53.090 --> 01:58:54.540
with respect to the amounts

01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:56.710
of given compounds that
are in their supplements,

01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:59.410
and the quality and
purity of those compounds.

01:58:59.410 --> 01:59:04.410
If you go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.520
you can see all the
supplements that I take

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.890
and get 20% off any of those supplements

01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:13.030
as well as any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes,

01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:16.030
you just go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:18.230
And if you enter their
website through that portal

01:59:18.230 --> 01:59:21.170
you get 20% off any of
their things at checkout.

01:59:21.170 --> 01:59:22.160
Last but not least,

01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.180
I want to thank you for
your time and attention,

01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:27.000
and your willingness to
embrace new concepts and terms,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.010
and to learn about science and biology,

01:59:29.010 --> 01:59:31.097
and protocols that
hopefully can benefit you

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:32.700
and the people that you know,

01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:35.515
and of course thank you for
your interest in science.

01:59:35.515 --> 01:59:38.098
