00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.280
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.963
for everyday life.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.210
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.900
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.970
Today I have the pleasure of introducing

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.220
Dr. Matthew Walker as our guest
on the Huberman Lab podcast.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.170
Dr. Walker is a professor of
neuroscience and psychology

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.700
at the University of California, Berkeley.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.490
There, his laboratory studies sleep.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.490
They study why we sleep,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.050
what occurs during sleep, such
as dreams and why we dream,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.870
learning during sleep,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.330
as well as the consequences
of getting insufficient

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.180
or poor quality sleep on waking states.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.910
Dr. Walker is also the author of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.340
the international best
selling book "Why We Sleep".

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.350
Our discussion today is an
absolutely fascinating one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.460
for anyone that's interested in sleep,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.950
learning, or human
performance of any kind.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.480
Dr. Walker teaches us how
to get better at sleeping.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.870
He also discusses naps,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.260
whether or not we should
or should not nap,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.810
whether or not we can
compensate for lost sleep,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.210
and if so how to best do that.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.160
We discuss behavioral protocols

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.850
and interactions with light,
temperature, supplementation,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.250
food, exercise, sex, all the
variables that can impact

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.900
this incredible state of mind
and body that we call sleep.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.320
During my scientific career,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.150
I've read many papers about sleep

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.660
and attended many seminars about sleep

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.360
yet my discussion with Dr. Walker today

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.730
revealed to me more about
sleep, sleep science

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.610
and how to get better at sleeping

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.750
than all of those papers
and seminars combined.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm also delighted to share

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.070
that Dr. Walker has started a podcast.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.610
That podcast entitled
"The Matt Walker Podcast",

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.870
releases its first episode this month

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.000
and is going to teach all about sleep,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.800
and how to get better at sleeping.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.290
So be sure to check out
the Matt Walker podcast

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.780
on Apple, Spotify or wherever
you listen to podcasts.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.780
Before we begin,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.260
I'd like to mention that this podcast

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.140
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.965
It is however part of my desire and effort

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.290
to bring zero cost of consumer information

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.430
about science and science related tools

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.110
to the general public.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.290
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.220
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.530
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.400
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.010
that are of the absolutely
highest quality.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.020
The company was founded by

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.140
two all American swimmers from Stanford

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.480
and everything about the
design of their glasses

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.460
is with performance in mind.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.360
I've spent my career
studying the visual system

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.040
and how it works and I can
tell you that ROKA glasses

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.510
take into account the
science of the visual system

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.240
such that whether or
not you're wearing them

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.770
on a very bright day,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.760
or you walk into a shadowed
area or there's cloud cover,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.570
you can still see everything
with perfect clarity.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.180
That also reflects the fact that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.600
the lenses that they use

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.320
are of the absolute
highest optical quality.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.550
The other terrific thing about

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.590
ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.410
is that they're designed to
be worn in all conditions.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.860
You can use them while
running, while cycling,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.700
even if you get sweaty,
they won't slip off.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.390
And they look great.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.440
One problem I have with a lot of so called

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.860
performance eyeglasses
and sunglasses out there

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.030
is that they look crazy.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030
They make people look like cyborgs.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.900
ROKA glasses have a terrific aesthetic,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.800
you can wear them to dinner,
you can wear them at work,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.810
and you can wear them in all
sorts of sports activities.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.320
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.310
you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.810

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.170
to save 20% off your first order.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.260
That's ROKA roka.com

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.800
and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.314
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:39.790
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.580
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.260
to help you better understand your body

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.240
and then reach your health goals.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.820
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.270
for the simple reason

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.200
that many of the factors that impact

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.060
your immediate and long term health

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.810
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.570
And nowadays, with the
advent of DNA tests,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.900
you can also get insight
into your immediate

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.990
and long term health by way
of understanding your DNA.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.630
One issue with many DNA
and blood tests, however,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.230
is that you get the numbers back

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.370
about metabolic factors,
hormones, genes, et cetera,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.460
but there's no directive

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.510
as to what to do with that information.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.870
With InsideTracker, they have
a very easy to use dashboard,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.500
and that dashboard not only
gives you your numbers,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.810
but it gives you simple directives

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.960
related to nutrition, supplementation,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.210
exercise and other lifestyle factors

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.480
that allow you to move those
numbers into the ranges

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.060
that are right for you
and your health goals.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.540
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.710
you can go to insidetracker.com/Huberman

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.180
and if you do that, you'll get 25% off

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.780
any of InsideTracker's plans,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.460
just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.730
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Belcampo,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.330
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.000
that raises organic grass fed

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.730
and finished certified humane meats.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.120
I don't eat a lot of meat,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.800
I eat meat about once a day,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.030
but when I do, I make sure
that it's high quality

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.800
and both humanely and sustainably raised.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.290
Conventionally raised animals
are confined to feedlots

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.550
and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.970
but Belcampo's animals
graze on open pastures

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.220
and seasonal grasses,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.980
resulting in meat that's
higher in nutrients

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.300
and healthy fats.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.380
Now, I've talked many times
before on this podcast

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.376
about how getting sufficient
levels of omega threes

00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:23.610
is very important for metabolic
health, hormone health,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.880
mood, essentially all
aspects of one's health.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.300
Belcampo meats have high
levels of omega threes,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.620
because of the grasses they feed on.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.500
The way Belcampo raises its animals

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.040
isn't just better for our health,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.710
it also has a positive
impact on the environment.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.750
They practice regenerative agriculture,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.960
which means that their
meat is climate positive

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.230
and carbon negative,
meaning it's good for you,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.420
and it's good for the environment.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.720
You can order Belcampo's
sustainably raised meats

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.440
to be delivered to you
using my code Huberman

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.380
by going to belcampo.com/Huberman

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.740
and if you do that, you'll
get 20% off your first order.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.560
I'm a big fan of their keto meatballs

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.440
I also really liked
their boneless rib eyes,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.730
I eat those pretty much once a day.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.020
Again, that's Huberman for the code.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.770
And it's belcampo.com/huberman
for 20% off your order.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.910
And now my discussion
with Dr. Matt Walker.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.360
Great to finally meet you in person.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.400
- Wonderful to connect.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.940
I mean, it's been too long,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.300
but I suspect it would
have been a shorter time

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.957
before we'd met lest the
pandemic, thank you for coming up.

00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:26.590
- No, thank you, yeah,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.030
I'm delighted that we're finally
sitting down face to face.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.570
I've been tracking your work
both in the internet sphere,

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.720
and I read your book and loved it.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.890
And also from the perspective of science,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.390
you actually came to
Stanford couple of years ago

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.187
and gave a lecture for BrainMind.

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:45.270
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.417
- And there, of course,
you talked about sleep

00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:51.049
and its utility and its challenges

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:54.840
and how to conquer it, so to speak.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.963
Let's start off very basic, what is sleep?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.080
- Sleep is probably the
single most effective thing

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.500
you can do to reset your
brain and body health.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.720
So that's a functional
answer in terms of, you know,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.950
what is sleep in terms of its benefits.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.890
Sleep as a process though,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.710
is an incredibly complex
physiological ballet.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.530
And if you were to recognize

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.330
or see what happens to your brain

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.860
and your body at night, during sleep,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.940
you would be blown away.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.750
And the paradox is that most of us,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.750
and I would think this too, you know,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.440
if I wasn't a sleep scientist,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.380
we go to bed, we lose consciousness
for seven to nine hours,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.220
and then we sort of
wake up in the morning,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.570
and we generally feel better.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.930
And in some ways that denies

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.260
the physiological and
biological beauty of sleep.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.940
So upstairs in your brain,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.447
when you're going through these
different stages of sleep,

00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:55.160
the changes in brainwave activity

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.080
are far more dramatic
than those that we see

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.007
when we're awake.

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:01.970
And we can speak about deep
sleep and what happens there,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.950
REM sleep is a fascinating time,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.960
which is another stage of sleep,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.300
often called dream sleep,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.530
which is rapid eye movement sleep,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.650
that stage of sleep
some parts of your brain

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.650
are up to 30%, more active
than when you're awake.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.280
So again, it's kind of violating this idea

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.580
that our mind is dormant.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.510
And our body is just simply
quiescent and resting.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.840
So I would happy to just
sort of double click

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.810
on either one of those,

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.640
and also what changes in the body as well.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.700
But it is an intense

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.867
evolutionary adaptive benefit and system.

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:38.230
That said, though,

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.230
I would almost push back
against an evolved system

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.450
when we think about the question
of sleep and what sleep is.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.340
Our assumption has always
been that we evolved to sleep.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.710
And I've actually questioned that

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.640
and I have no way to get in a time capsule

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.870
and go back and prove this,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.400
but what if we started off sleeping,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.800
and it was from sleep,
that wakefulness emerged?

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.070
Why do we assume that
it's the other way around?

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.700
And I think there's probably

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.610
some really good evidence

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.020
that sleep may have been the proto state,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.170
that it was the basic
fundamental living state.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.540
And when we became awake, as it were,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.683
we always had to return to sleep.

00:09:26.683 --> 00:09:28.350
You know, in some ways, at that point,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.940
sleep was the price that
we paid for wakefulness.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.110
And that's another way of
describing what sleep is.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.203
But again, I think it sort of denies

00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:39.450
that the active state of sleep,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.446
it's not a passive state of sleep either.

00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:44.220
And then finally, you can say

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.170
what is sleep across different species?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.940
And in us human beings,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.260
and in all mammalian species
and avian species as well,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.570
sleep is broadly separated
into these two main types.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.440
And we've got non rapid eye
movement sleep on the one hand,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.580
and then we've got rapid eye
movement sleep on the other.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.960
And we can speak about how they unfold

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.010
across a night and their architecture

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.060
because it's not just
intellectually interesting

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.630
from the perspective of what sleep is,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.250
it's also practically
impactful for our daily lives.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.130
And I'd love to sort of
go down that route too.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.697
But you navigate, you tell me I can.

00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:20.610
- No, no, let's definitely
go down that route.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.300
So you mentioned how active the brain is,

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.530
during certain phases of sleep.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.800
When I was coming up in science,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.800
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.210
was referred to as paradoxical sleep,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.310
is that still a good
way to think about it?

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.190
Paradoxical because
the brain is so active,

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.840
and yet we are essentially
paralyzed, correct?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.520
- Yeah, it really is a paradox.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.570
And where that came from

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.130
was simply the brainwave recordings,

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.480
that if all I'm measuring about you,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.120
is your brainwave activity,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.010
it's very difficult for me

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.730
sitting outside of the
sleep laboratory room

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.894
to figure out, are you awake,

00:10:56.894 --> 00:10:58.510
or are you in REM sleep?

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.690
Because those two
patterns of brain activity

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.900
are so close to one another,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.540
you can't discriminate between them.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.200
Yet, the paradox is
that when you are awake,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.630
I go in there and you're
sort of sitting up,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.780
you're clearly conscious and awake.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.280
But yet, when you go into REM sleep,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.337
you are completely paralyzed.

00:11:18.337 --> 00:11:23.240
And that's one of the I think
that's part of the paradox.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.580
But the paradox really just comes down to

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.040
two dramatically different
conscious states.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.400
Yet, brain activity is dramatically

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.230
more similar than different.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.820
And the way I can figure out

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.950
which of the two you are in

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.090
is by measuring two other signals,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.910
the activity from your eyes

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.470
and the activity from your muscles.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.090
So when we're awake,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.690
we will occasionally have these blinks,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.680
and we'll have sort of seek heads.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.780
But during REM sleep,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.530
you have these really bizarre,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.800
horizontal shuttling eye
movements that occur.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.370
And that's where the name comes from

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.870
rapid eye movements.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.450
- Are they always horizontal?

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.607
- Mostly, they are horizontal.
- That's interesting.

00:12:01.607 --> 00:12:04.980
- And that's one of the ways
that we can differentiate them

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.940
from other waking eye movement activity,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.030
'cause it's not always like

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.890
it can be sometimes horizontal,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.973
but can also have diagonal and
also vertical in that plane.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.500
But then the muscle activity
is the real dead giveaway,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.560
just before you enter REM sleep,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.610
your brainstem, which
is where the dynamics of

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.350
non REM and REM are essentially played out

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.020
and then expressed upstairs in the cortex

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.190
and downstairs in the body,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.430
when we go into REM sleep,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.570
and just a few seconds
before that happens,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.010
the brainstem sends a signal

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.020
all the way down the spinal cord.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.770
And it communicates with what are called

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.010
the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.630
which control the
voluntary skeletal muscles.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.670
And it's a signal of paralysis.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.580
And when you go into dream sleep,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.500
you are locked into a
physical incarceration

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.280
of your own body.
- Amazing.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.340
- You know, why would Mother
Nature do such a thing?

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.300
And it's in some ways very simple.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.620
The brain paralyzes the body

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.220
so that the mind can dream safely.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.820
Because think about how quickly

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.970
we would have all been
popped out of the gene pool.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.840
You know, if I think I'm, you know,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.650
one of the best skydivers
who can just simply fly,

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.210
and I've had some times
those dreams, too, you know,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.020
and I get up on my apartment
window, and I leap out.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.000
- You're done.
- You're done, you know.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.540
So that's one of the sort of

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.110
that's part of the paradox of REM sleep,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.330
both it's brain activity similarity,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.820
despite the behavioral
state being so different

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.750
and this bizarre lockdown
of the sort of brain

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.110
of the body itself.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.420
Now, of course, the involuntary muscles

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.600
thankfully aren't paralyzed.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.480
So you keep breathing,
your heart keeps beating.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.660
- Is this why men have
erections during REM sleep,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.027
and women have vaginal
lubrication during sleep?

00:13:58.027 --> 00:13:59.430
- That's one of the reasons

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.030
part of the other reason though there

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.480
is because of the autonomic activity.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.984
So there is a nervous,

00:14:05.984 --> 00:14:07.162
a part of our nervous system

00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:08.120
called the autonomic nervous system,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.690
and it controls many of
the automatic behaviors.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.940
And some of those are aspects

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.963
of our reproductive facilities.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.830
During REM sleep, what we later discovered

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.140
is that you go through these bizarre

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.560
what we call autonomic
storms, which sounds dramatic,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.010
but it actually is when you measure them.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.350
That you'll go through periods

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.290
where your heart rate,
decelerates and drops

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.130
and your blood pressure goes down

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.070
and then utterly randomly,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.740
your heart rate accelerates dramatically,

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.800
and what we call the
fight or flight branch

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.060
of the autonomic nervous system

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.060
or the sympathetic nervous system,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.170
badly named 'cause it's
anything but sympathetic,

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.493
it's very aggravating,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.440
that all of a sudden fires up

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.100
and then it shuts down again.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.290
And it's not in any regular way.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.560
And it's when you get
those autonomic storms,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.060
you get very activated from
a physiologic perspective

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.680
that you can have these erections

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.740
and you have vaginal discharge et cetera.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.960
- But you're totally paralyzed?

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.770
- But you are still paralyzed.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.253
There are only two voluntary muscle groups

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.310
that are speared from
the paralysis, bizarre.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.660
One, your extra ocular muscles,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.820
because if they were paralyzed,

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.790
you wouldn't be able to
have rapid eye movements.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.730
And the other that we later discovered

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.313
was the inner ear muscle.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.210
And we've got no good understanding

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.450
as to why those two muscles groups

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.200
are speared from the paralysis.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.800
It may have something
to do with cranial nerve

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.080
but I don't think it's that,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.240
I think it's perhaps something
more sensory related.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.430
Some people have argued

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.530
that the reason the eyeballs
are speared from the paralysis

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.240
is because if your eyeballs are left

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.590
for long periods of time, inactive,

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.890
you may get things such
as oxygen sort of issues

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.950
in the aqueous or vitreous humor.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.200
And so the eyeballs have to keep draining.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.120
- The drainage systems of the anterior eye

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.170
are made to require movement.
- Exactly.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.080
- People with glaucoma
have deficits in drainage

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.590
through the anterior chamber,
but there I'm speculating.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.783
I'm also speculating, when I ask this,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.570
I would imagine that
there are states in waking

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.530
that also resemble slow wave sleep,

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.180
or rather that there are states

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.060
that slow wave sleep also
resembles waking states.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.130
You've beautifully
illustrated how REM sleep

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.280
can mimic some of the
more active brain states

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.230
that we achieve in waking.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.000
What sort of waking state
that I might have experienced

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.440
or experience on a daily basis

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.780
might look similar to slow wave sleep,

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.640
non REM sleep, if any?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.770
- It's a genius way of thinking about it

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.000
turns the tables I love it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We almost never see anything
like the true ultra slow waves

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.560
of deep non REM sleep.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.736
So we spoke about these
two stages non REM and REM.

00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:03.060
Non REM is further subdivided
into four separate stages,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.560
stages, one through four,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.620
increasing in their depth of sleep.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.240
So stages three and four
that's what we typically call

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.460
deep non REM sleep.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.181
Stages one and two light non REM.

00:17:12.181 --> 00:17:13.180
- So maybe take me
through the arc of a night

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.730
just so that.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.279
So I put my head down,

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:18.720
well, for you, what time do
you normally go to sleep?

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.570
- So I'm usually sort of
around about 10:30pm guy.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.090
And usually I'll naturally wake up

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.860
sort of a little bit before 7:00,

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.003
sometimes before 6:45 or 7:00,

00:17:30.003 --> 00:17:34.080
I have an alarm set for 7:04am.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080
- You heard it here, folks

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.560
Matt Walker does use an alarm clock.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.037
- I rarely, rarely I'm usually sort of.

00:17:40.037 --> 00:17:41.010
- He doesn't recommend
it, but he does use it.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.620
- Yeah, I usually.
- You're human after all.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.590
- Oh, I am so human.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.670
And I've had my sleep issues

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.970
and I'd love to speak about that too.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.970
But it's only just, you know,
in the event that, you know,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.820
'cause I like to keep regularity too.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.940
You've got to keep those
two things in balance.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.210
And 7:04 just because, you
know, why not be idiosyncratic.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.130
I don't know why we always set things

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.030
on these hot numbers.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.595
So yep so when you.

00:18:07.595 --> 00:18:08.800
- So you go to sleep around 10:30,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.200
so using you as an example,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.310
because I imagine a number of people

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.173
go to sleep at different times.

00:18:14.173 --> 00:18:15.580
But 10:30 is about when I
go to sleep, 11 is for me.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.880
But so you go to sleep at 10:30,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.030
so for that first, let's
say three hours of sleep,

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.460
what does the architecture
of that sleep look like

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.370
as compared to the last three hours

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.120
of your sleep before morning?

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.539
- Yeah, so I should note
that that sort of, you know,

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:34.337
10:30 to 7:00 that's just
based on my chronotype

00:18:34.337 --> 00:18:37.520
and my preferential it's
different for different people.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.050
I'm not suggesting that
that's the perfect sweet spot

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.610
for humanity's sleep.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.342
It's just my natural sweet spot.

00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:45.490
- But I imagine most
people probably go to sleep

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.203
somewhere between 10pm and midnight.

00:18:50.384 --> 00:18:52.254
- It's somewhere between 9 and midnight.

00:18:52.254 --> 00:18:53.480
- And most probably wake
up between 5am and 7am

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.230
or 5:30 and 7:30.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.560
- Yeah, yeah at least in

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.950
if you look at sort of
first world nations,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.783
that's a typical sleep profile.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.150
So when I first fall asleep,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.970
I'll go into the light
stages of non REM sleep

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.270
stages one and two of non REM.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.150
And then I'll start to descend down

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.630
into the deeper stages of non REM sleep.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.450
So after about maybe 20 minutes,

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.620
I'm starting to head down
into stage three non REM

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.870
and then into stage four non REM sleep.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.840
And as I'm starting to fall asleep,

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.273
as I've cast off from the usually with me,

00:19:29.264 --> 00:19:30.097
murky waters of wakefulness,

00:19:30.097 --> 00:19:33.120
and I'm in the shallows of
sleep stages one and two,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.810
my heart rate starts to drop a little bit.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.010
And then my brainwave pattern
activity starts to slow down.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.400
Normally when I'm awake,
it's going up and down,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.203
maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.950
As I'm going into light, non REM sleep,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.180
it will slow down to maybe 15, 20

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.860
and then really starts to slow down

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.240
down to about sort of 10
or eight cycles per second,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.133
eight cycle waves per second.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.390
Then as I'm starting to move into

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.720
stages three and four, non REM sleep,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.740
several remarkable things happen.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.433
All of a sudden, my heart rate
really does start to drop.

00:20:13.284 --> 00:20:15.370
Oh, and I'll come back to temperature,

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.620
I'm going to write temperature down

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.810
'cause I always forget these things.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.840
Now I'm solidly in the
foothills of middle age.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.840
So as I'm starting to go
into those deeper stages

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.023
of non REM sleep, all of a sudden,

00:20:28.023 --> 00:20:30.610
hundreds of thousands
of cells in my cortex

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.890
all decide to fire together

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.990
and then they all go silent together.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.400
And it's this remarkable
physiological coordination

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.850
of the likes that we just don't see

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.240
at during any other brain state.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.672
- That's really interesting,

00:20:46.672 --> 00:20:48.190
other than recordings
from the brains of animals

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.460
and a little bit from humans,

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.410
I don't think I've ever
seen the entire cortex

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.140
or even entire regions of
cortex light up like that.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.180
- Yeah, it's stunning.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.490
It's almost like this
beautiful sort of mantra chant,

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.500
or this sort of, you
know, it's a slow inhale

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.050
and then a meditative
exhale, inhale, exhale.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.290
And these waves are just
enormous in their size.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.420
- And the body is capable
of movement at this time,

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.270
there is no paralysis.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.590
- There is no paralysis,
but for the most part,

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.430
muscle tone has also
dropped significantly.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.220
- Interesting.
- At that point.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.790
And then you will,

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.800
or I will then stay there

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.190
for about another 20 or 30 minutes.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.530
So now I'm maybe 60, or 70 minutes

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.560
into my first sleep cycle.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.490
And then I'll start to rise back up,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.930
back up into stage two non REM sleep.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.560
And then after about 80 or so minutes,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.670
I'll pop up, and I'll have
a short REM sleep period,

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.970
and then back down, I go
again, down into non REM,

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.200
up into REM.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.110
And you do that reliably, repeatedly,

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:53.200
and I will be doing that, and
I do do that every 90 minutes.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.920
At least that's the
average for most adults,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.210
it's different in different species.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.150
What changes to your question

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.520
is the ratio of non REM to REM
within that 90 minute cycle

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.420
as you move across the night.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.830
And what I mean by this is,

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.600
in the first half of the night,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.230
the majority of those 90 minute cycles

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.880
are comprised of a lot
of deep non REM sleep,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.260
that's when I get my stage three and four

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.980
of deep non REM sleep.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.900
Once I push through to the
second half of the night,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.550
now that seesaw balance changes.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.750
And instead, the majority
of those 90 minute cycles

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.200
are comprised either of this lighter form

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.760
of non REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.470
and much more and increasingly more

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.993
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.290
And the implication that

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.550
I was sort of speaking
about pragmatically is,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.810
let's say that I have to,

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.208
and I usually never do early
morning flights or red eyes,

00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.800
just because I'm a mess if that happens,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.560
I'm not suggesting other people shouldn't.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.180
- I'm suggesting people not not do that.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.460
Every time I've taken a
red eye or I've done that

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.520
two or three days later,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.240
I get some sort of general
feeling of malaise,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.840
my brain doesn't work as well,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.560
I think red eyes should be abolished.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.924
For the pilots too I mean, and for the.

00:23:07.924 --> 00:23:09.735
- And we can speak about
those, there's data.

00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:10.568
- And for the emergency room, I mean,

00:23:10.568 --> 00:23:12.920
long shifts have been
shown to lead to, you know,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.170
physician induced errors that
lead to a lot of fatalities.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.750
I mean, there are a lot of
reasons why staying up too long,

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.830
or being up at the wrong times,

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.210
if you're not adapted
to it is just terrible.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.530
- You have the data and all
of those cases, you know,

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.810
particularly physicians too

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.920
there was some recent data
looking at suicidality.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.440
And the rates of suicide
in training physicians

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.490
are, you know, far, far above the norm.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.740
And I don't suspect that, you know,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.190
the schedules are helping them

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.530
I suspect that sleep is a missing part

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.680
of that explanatory equation, but.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.670
- I teach medical students
and they they're phenomenal,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.950
but yeah, they're under
extremely challenged conditions.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.053
- We shouldn't put them
under those conditions.

00:23:54.053 --> 00:23:56.520
- [Andrew] No, it's not optimizing
performance, I have one.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.353
- But sorry, I was sorry.

00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:58.610
- No, no, this is important.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.870
These it's an important digression.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.140
I have one question,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.700
which is you're saying
that as across the night,

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.730
a greater percentage of
these 90 minute cycles

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.600
are going to be occupied by REM sleep

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.653
as you progress through the night.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.200
I'm aware that, based
on work that you've done

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.250
and from your public
education efforts and others

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:25.080
that we have so called circadian forces,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.540
and we have other forces that are driving

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.490
when we sleep and when we
want to sleep, etcetera.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.260
Without going into the details of those,

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.704
I've a simple question,

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:33.560
the experiment is the following.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.510
Let's say, God forbid,

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.940
you are prevented from going
to sleep at your normal time

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.970
and you stay up for the
four hours or five hours

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.400
that normally you would be in
predominantly slow wave sleep.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.500
- If let's say you finally
get to lie down at 3am

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.840
a time when normally your
sleep would be occupied

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.163
mostly by rapid eye movement sleep,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.540
will you experience a greater percentage

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.850
of rapid eye movement sleep

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.630
because of these so
called circadian forces,

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.770
meaning that's what's
appropriate for that time?

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.090
Or will your system need to start

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.250
at the beginning of the race that were,

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.680
as I'm referring to it,
that we're calling sleep?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.250
And for if that's not clear to anybody,

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.120
basically, what I'm asking is,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.670
if you are forced to skip

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.640
the slow wave sleep part of the night,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.740
will your system leap into
rapid eye movement sleep?

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.430
Or does it have to start at the beginning

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.860
and get slow wave sleep first?

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.870
In other words, does one sleep state

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.490
drive the entry to the next sleep state?

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.630
- Great question, so there
is some degree of reciprocity

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.780
between the sleep states I should note

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.450
that when we drive one of those up,

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.920
we often but not always
see a change in the other.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.560
There are some pharmacologies
that have shown

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.340
an independence to that.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.640
And we've also played around
with things like temperature,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.800
and sometimes you can, you know,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.353
nudge one and not seem to
upset or perturb the other.

00:25:58.353 --> 00:26:02.500
But to your, I think, lovely point,

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.870
the answer is, it's a mix,

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.620
but it's mostly the latter.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:11.620
Meaning you will mostly go
into your REM sleep phases,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.960
and be significantly
deficient in your deep sleep.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.680
So just because I start
my sleep cycle at 3am,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.830
rather than at 10:30pm,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.420
it doesn't mean that my brain just says,

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.770
well, I've got a program,

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.170
and I'm just going to run the program,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.520
and the way the program runs

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.020
is that we always start with

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.840
a first couple of hours of deep sleep.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.680
So we're just going to begin
act number one, scene one,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.900
it doesn't do that.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.220
Now, I will get some
deep sleep to begin with

00:26:42.452 --> 00:26:45.140
and part of that is just
because of how sleep works.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.470
Based on how long I've been awake,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.940
longer I'm awake,

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.910
there is a significantly
greater pressure for deep sleep.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.000
But we actually use exactly
what you just described

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.750
as an experimental technique

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.090
to selectively deprive people

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.580
of one of those stages
of sleep or the other.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.090
So we will do first half
of the night deprivation,

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.230
and then let you sleep the second half.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.150
So that means that you will
be mostly deep sleep deprived,

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.873
and you will still get
mostly all of your REM sleep.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.370
And then we switch it,

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.640
so you only get your first four hours,

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.320
which means you will mostly
get deep non REM sleep,

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.590
but you will get almost no REM sleep.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.130
So in both of those groups,

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.140
they've both had four hours of sleep.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.450
So the difference between them

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.520
in terms of an experimental outcome

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.270
is not the sleep time

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.810
because they both slept
for the same amount.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.390
It's the contribution of
those different stages.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.820
Now, we actually have more elegant methods

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.840
for sort of selectively going in there

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.490
and scooping out
different stages of sleep.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.500
But that's the way we
used to do it old school

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.790
was just using this timing difference.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.790
- And who suffers more?

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.010
Those that lack the early phase,

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.990
and were those that lack the
later phase of the night sleep?

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.390
In other words,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.570
if I have to sleep only four
hours for whatever reason,

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.860
am I better off getting the
early part of the night's sleep

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.490
or the second half of the night sleep?

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.170
- Depends on what the outcome measure is.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.830
- So that gets right to the differences

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.577
between slow wave sleep and REM.

00:28:11.577 --> 00:28:14.650
- Right.
- I was probably misinformed.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.960
But my understanding a
very crude understanding

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.640
I should say before.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.520
- I very much doubt I'll
contrary with someone like you.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.460
- Which is that's very nice of you.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.640
The first part of the night

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.430
the slow wave sleep is
restorative to the musculature

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.970
to motor learning, and
that the dream content

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.460
tends to be less emotional.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.630
The second half of the night,

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.010
being more emotional dreams

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.880
and sort of the unpairing
of the emotional load

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.000
of our previous day and other experiences.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.833
So in other words,

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:43.810
if I were to deprive
myself, excuse me of REM,

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.620
I would be hyper emotional,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.830
not maybe not as settled

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.070
with the kind of experiences of my life.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.790
Whereas if I deprive
myself of slow wave sleep,

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.310
I would feel a more physical malaise.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.240
Is that correct?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.370
Or is that far too simple?

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:57.500
And if it is too simple,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.720
please tell me where I'm wrong?

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.060
- No, I think much of that is correct.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.078
And it's sort of that plus.

00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:07.940
So for example, during deep non REM sleep,

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.080
that's where we get this.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.180
It's almost a form of natural
blood pressure medication.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.130
And so when I take that
away from you, the next day,

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.710
we're usually going to
see autonomic dysfunction,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.790
we're usually going to see abnormalities

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.670
in heart rate blood pressure.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.070
We also know that during
deep non REM sleep,

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.010
that there is a certain
control of specific hormones.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.830
For example, we know that
the insulin regulation

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.845
of sort of metabolism,

00:29:31.845 --> 00:29:34.180
meaning how will you look

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.260
from a regulated blood sugar perspective

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.260
versus dysregulated, pre
diabetic look of profile.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.470
That's where deep sleep seems to matter

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.607
if we selectively deprive
you of that we can see.

00:29:46.607 --> 00:29:48.680
- Growth hormone.
- Growth hormone

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.650
is different actually.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.510
So that's a beautiful demonstration

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.150
where growth hormone seems to
be more REM sleep dependent.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.618
And that's why we can come
on to the effects of alcohol

00:29:58.618 --> 00:30:00.140
and there's some really impressive

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.090
frightening data on alcohol

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.830
and it's disruption of sleep.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.720
But then we also know testosterone,

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.700
peak levels of testosterone
happen during REM sleep.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.704
- So the second half of
the night, essentially.

00:30:13.704 --> 00:30:14.537
- Which is the second half of the night.

00:30:14.537 --> 00:30:16.997
So it really just means that the,

00:30:16.997 --> 00:30:21.997
your profile of mental
and physical dysfunction

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.530
will be different under
both of those conditions.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.940
Which one would you prefer?

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.480
I would prefer neither of them.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.260
And it really depends on what
you're trying to optimize for.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.170
So it's just so complicated,

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.360
sleep is just so pluripotent, you know,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.010
it's so physiologically systemic,

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.830
that it's almost impossible

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.060
not to undergo one of those two things,

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.410
just deep sleep deprivation,

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.300
or just REM sleep deprivation,

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.740
and not show a profile

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.954
that you would really prefer to avoid.

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:59.620
And that's the reason from
an evolutionary standpoint,

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.080
that we've preserved
those stages of sleep.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.230
I mean, sleep is just
so idiotic, you know,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.020
from an evolutionary perspective.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.610
- Or maybe waking is idiotic.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.260
- Or waking is, you know, well, yeah.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.200
- Based on your previous idea.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.710
- Who've you been talking to?

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.380
I think that comment
is very specific to me.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.780
Yeah, I am normally always
an idiot when working.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.780
But I think this idea
that sleep, you know,

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.580
is so profoundly detrimental to us,

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.760
if you were to take it
at face value, you know,

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.260
you're not finding a mate,
you're not reproducing,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.590
you're not foraging for food,

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.200
you're not caring for you're young

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.320
and worst of all, you're
vulnerable to predation,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.100
on any one of those grounds

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.050
sleep probably should have
been selected against.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.080
But it wasn't sleep has fought
its way through heroically

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.080
every step along the evolutionary path.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.080
And therefore, every sleep
stage has also survived

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.260
as best we can tell.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.240
What that means is that
those are non negotiable.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.960
If mother nature had found a way

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.220
to even just sort of, you know,

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.672
thin slice some of that sleep from us,

00:32:09.672 --> 00:32:12.920
there would have been vast,
I'm sure evolutionary benefits,

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.950
but looks as though she hasn't.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.900
And I'm usually in favor of her wisdom

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.390
after 3.6 million years, so.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.520
- Yeah, it's incredible.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.790
I want to introduce a
another Gedankenexperiment,

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.980
other thought experiment.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.700
So in this arc of the night,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.740
slow wave sleep predominates
early in the night,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.510
and then REM sleep.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.980
There's a scenario that many people

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.730
including myself experience
on a regular basis.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.430
Which is they go to
sleep, sleeping just fine,

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.780
three, four hours into it, they wake up.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.300
They wake up, for whatever
reason, maybe there was a noise,

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.450
maybe the temperature isn't right,

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.100
we will certainly talk about
sleep hygiene, etcetera.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.500
They get up, they go to the restroom,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.240
they might flip on the
lights, they might not,

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.690
they'll get back in bed

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.530
hopefully they're not
picking up their phone

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.840
and starting to browse
and wake up the brain

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.960
through various mechanisms

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.450
light and cognitive stimulation, etcetera.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.730
They go back to sleep, let's
say after about 10, 15 minutes,

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.017
they're able to fall back asleep.

00:33:11.017 --> 00:33:13.333
And then they sleep till
their more typical wake time.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.580
How detrimental is that wake up episode

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:22.580
or event in terms of
longevity, learning, et cetera?

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.830
I would love to sleep the entire
night through every night,

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.810
but most nights I don't.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.050
And yet, I feel pretty
good throughout the day,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.680
some days better than others.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.913
So if you were to kind of
evaluate that waking episode,

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.460
and compare it to sleeping
the whole night through,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.570
what are your your thoughts on that?

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.810
- So I think if you're waking up

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.220
sort of frequently, as you're describing,

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.350
I would probably get your estate in order

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.870
because my guess is within the next year,

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.130
you're going to be you're
going to be done for,

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.580
no I'm kidding you.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.850
Absolutely kidding you.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.740
It is perfectly natural and normal,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.580
particularly as we progress
with age, you know,

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.280
children tend to have typically
more continuous sleep.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.400
Now it's not that they aren't waking up

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.060
for brief periods of time they are

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.840
and in fact, we all do.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.590
When we come out the other
end of our sleep cycle

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.180
at the end of our REM sleep
period of the 90 minute cycle,

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.810
almost everybody wakes up

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.870
and we make a postural
movement, we turn over

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.567
because we've been paralyzed for so long

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:30.900
and the body will also like to shift

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.657
it's weight or position.

00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:33.656
- Do we ever look around?

00:34:33.656 --> 00:34:34.655
Ever open our eyes and look around?

00:34:34.655 --> 00:34:36.610
- You, sometimes people
will open their eyes,

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.210
but usually it's only for
a brief period of time

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.963
and they usually never commit
those awakenings to memory.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.080
Your situation and it's
my situation as well,

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.700
I usually now at this stage of life,

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.030
I don't sleep through the night.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.983
I'll usually have a bathroom
break and then I'll come back.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.700
That's perfectly normal.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.640
We tend to forget that in sleep science,

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.810
we think of sleep efficiency

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.600
so of the total amount of
time that you're in bed,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.370
how much of that percent
time is spent asleep?

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:15.370
And we usually look to
numbers that are above 85%,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.230
or more as a healthy sleep efficiency.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.880
So if you're to think about

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.560
me going to bed and I spend, you know,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.560
let's say, eight and a quarter,

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.130
eight and a half hours of time in bed,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.490
with a normal, healthy sleep efficiency,

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.580
I still may be only sleeping a total

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.330
of seven and a half hours,

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.680
or seven and three quarter hours.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.170
Meaning that I'm going
to be awake in total,

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.730
not in one long about,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.030
but I'm going to be awake
for upwards of 30 minutes,

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.490
net some time.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.010
Sometimes that can be after
a 10 minute, you know,

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:56.960
dalliance after having
gone to the bathroom,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.010
and I'm just gradually
drifting back off again.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.500
Other times, it will just
be for a couple of minutes.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.720
And most of those you don't commit.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.550
So I think we need to stop,

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.440
we don't need to get too
worried about, you know,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.000
periods of time awake,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.660
just because we're not
sleeping throughout the night.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.720
I would love to do that, too.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.307
And I remember when that used to happen,

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:18.618
and it still happens occasionally.

00:36:18.618 --> 00:36:20.315
- Every once in a while, it
feels great when it does happen.

00:36:20.315 --> 00:36:21.148
- And it's a lovely thing.

00:36:21.148 --> 00:36:22.270
- It's a surprise right?

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.121
Like oh my goodness I slept
through the whole night.

00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:25.860
- It is now a surprise,
yeah it is a surprise.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.700
But for the most part,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.100
I think we can be more relaxed about that

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.060
where we have to be a bit
more attentive, though,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.270
is if you're spending
long periods of time,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.980
not being able to get back to sleep.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.330
And usually we define that by saying,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.930
if it's been 20, 25 minutes,

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.510
normally, that's the time
when we would really say okay,

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.100
let's explore this, what's going on?

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.960
Let's see what's happening.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.730
The other thing is if it's
happening very frequently,

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.680
so even if you're, you know,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.650
not awake for 25 minutes stretches,

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.640
but you're finding yourself waking up

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.241
and being consciously
aware that you've woken up

00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:07.190
for maybe six, seven or eight
times throughout the night

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.920
and your sleep is very
what we call fragmented

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.200
the great science of sleep
in the past five or 10 years

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.840
has been yes, quantity is important,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.150
but quality is just as important.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.810
And you can't have one without the other

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.700
in terms of a good
beneficial next day outcome.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.260
You can't just get four hours of sleep,

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.710
but brilliant quality of
sleep and be unimpaired.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.400
Nor can you get eight hours of sleep,

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.820
but have very poor quality of sleep

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.660
and be unimpaired the next day.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.710
So that's why I just
sort of want to asterisk,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.970
this idea of let's not get too worried

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.360
about waking up and
having some time awake,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.020
that's perfectly normal and natural.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.890
But if it's happening very
frequently throughout the night,

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.350
or those periods of time,

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.720
or long stretches of time,
upwards of 25 minutes,

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.612
then let's look into it.

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:04.440
- Well, I can assure you
just helped a lot of people

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.610
feel better about this waking up episode

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.820
that I and many other people experience.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.750
- I hope so 'cause I think
it's really important

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.113
that we, you know,

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.030
I think I've been desperately
guilty of perhaps, you know,

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.420
early on being too
puritanical about, you know,

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.130
sleep and I've retrospected,

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.800
and I've tried to explore why
this was the case, you know,

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.343
it was almost sleep or
else, dot, dot, dot.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.670
And at the time when I was
starting to write the book,

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.590
which was back in 2016, you know,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.150
sleep was still a neglected stepsister

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.280
in the health conversation of today.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.318
And I could see all of the,

00:38:46.318 --> 00:38:47.151
- That has certainly changed.

00:38:47.151 --> 00:38:47.984
- And it's changing, you know,

00:38:47.984 --> 00:38:49.170
and not because it's my efforts,

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.480
but because of all of my colleagues.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.840
- I would say, well,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.930
it's great that you give attribution

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.497
to the other people involved.

00:38:56.497 --> 00:38:58.080
And of course, it's a big field.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.430
But I think you've done a
great service by cueing people

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.410
to the importance of this state,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.780
not just for avoiding
troublesome outcomes,

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.250
but also for optimizing
their waking state.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.110
It's really, you know,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.230
I view sleep as this
period that feels good,

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.550
but we're not aware of how it feels

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.810
when we're in it necessarily.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.180
It has tremendous benefits
when you're doing it well,

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.620
so to speak,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.170
and it has tremendous
deficits when we're not.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:28.500
And I think it was an
important thing for you to do

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.950
to cue people to this issue.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.810
And I would say mission accomplished,

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.820
that people are aware
of the need for sleep.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.560
I think that knowing that waking up

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.720
in the middle of the night is normal,

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.894
provided it's not too frequent is great

00:39:41.894 --> 00:39:43.870
and will also help people

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.310
who may have been overly
concerned about that.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.090
I do want to use this as an opportunity

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.430
to raise something about the
so called Uberman schedule

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:55.963
not to be confused with
the Huberman schedule.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.353
Fortunately, no one
has confused those yet.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.060
Some years ago, there
was a discussion about

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.000
the so called Uberman schedule,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.610
meaning the Superman schedule.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.360
So that's Huberman without an H,

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.960
which I have nothing to do with.

00:40:11.704 --> 00:40:13.680
If you read your Nietzsche
this will have a subtext.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.210
But regardless, the Uberman
schedule, as I understand

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.330
is one in which the person elects to sleep

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:25.490
in 90 minute, bouts spread
throughout the day and night,

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.910
in an attempt to get more productivity

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.800
and or reduce their overall sleep need.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.530
There was a paper published recently

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.050
that explored whether or not
this is good or bad for us.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.550
Maybe you just give us the
take home message on that.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.710
- Yes, so these Uberman like schedules

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.280
and there's lots of
different forms of that,

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.260
they tried to essentially
pie chart the 24 hour period,

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:54.140
into short bouts of sleep
with some shorter or no, well,

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.730
slightly longer periods of wakefulness,

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:58.118
then short bouts of
sleep then wakefulness.

00:40:58.118 --> 00:41:01.850
You know, you're, I sort
of made it, I think a quip,

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.150
it's almost like you're
sleeping like a baby, you know,

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.660
'cause that's the way
that babies will sleep.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.940
- In 90 minute naps.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.770
- That they will have, you
know, these brief naps,

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.945
then they're awake, then they're asleep

00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:11.103
then they're awake.

00:41:11.103 --> 00:41:13.160
And to the chagrin of
parents across the night,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.610
it's basically the same,
they're awake, they're asleep,

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.820
they're awake, they're asleep.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.010
And that's more the schedule

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:23.325
that these types of
protocols have suggested.

00:41:23.325 --> 00:41:26.800
And there was a really
great comprehensive review

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.680
that found not only that they
weren't necessarily helpful,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.310
but they were actually
really quite detrimental.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.930
And on almost every performance metric,

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.640
whether it be task performance,

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.380
whether it be physiological
outcome measures,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.863
whether it even be the
quality of the sleep

00:41:42.863 --> 00:41:43.950
that they were having,

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:45.860
when they were trying to get it,

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.565
all of those were in a downward direction.

00:41:48.565 --> 00:41:51.310
And it's not surprising
if you look at your

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.360
the way that your
physiology is programmed,

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.470
if you look at the way your
circadian rhythm is programmed,

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:59.000
none of that screams to us

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.863
that we should be sleeping in that way.

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:04.430
- Well, I'm chuckling because

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.263
we always hear sleep like a baby.

00:42:05.263 --> 00:42:06.510
This is how babies sleep.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.660
And I would say don't sleep like a baby,

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.910
sleep like an adult be an adult,
get your solid eight hours.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.010
- It's Billy Crystal's
line, he was, you know,

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.300
a long standing suffering insomniac,

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.250
he says I sleep like a baby,
I'm awake every 20 minutes.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.620
You know, and I think

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.560
this is another one of
those demonstrations

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.300
that when you fight
biology, you normally lose.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.890
And the way you know you've lost

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.610
is disease, sickness and impairment.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.130
And I think if you sleep,

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.630
in accordance with the
natural biological edict

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.310
that we've all been given,

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.200
life tends to be both
have a higher quality

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.050
and a longer duration.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.413
- Yeah, I agree.

00:42:46.413 --> 00:42:48.970
Along those lines, as a vision scientists,

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:49.980
I've been very excited

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.477
by the work on these non image
forming cells in the eye,

00:42:53.477 --> 00:42:54.310
the so called melanopsin cells

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.450
that inform the brain about
circadian time of day.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:01.130
And I'm a big proponent of
people getting some sunlight,

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.470
ideally sunlight, but
other forms of bright light

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.920
in their eyes early in the day

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.810
and when they want to be awake.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:07.970
Essentially, during the phase

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.840
of their 24 hour circadian cycle

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.320
when temperature is rising,

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.333
and then starting to get
less light in their eyes

00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:17.400
as our temperature is going down

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.580
in terms of later in the
day and in the evening.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.390
Are there any adjustments
to that general theme

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.790
that you'd like to add?

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.950
Or is in any way?

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.390
- No, I think that's exactly
what we recommend right now.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.040
Which is try to get at
least 30 to 40 minutes

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.660
of exposure to some kind
of natural daylight.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.450
Now, there may be parts of the
world where, you know, it's.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.470
- You're from your from a
rather cloudy part of the world.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.397
- I am from Liverpool, England,

00:43:44.397 --> 00:43:47.840
and the Northwest of England is not known

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.670
for its beach resorts and fine weather.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:55.730
I remember I sort of, I
went back home for a trip

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.150
when I'd first been out in California,

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.183
and I thought, why is the sky so low?

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:06.980
Just you know, constantly
we joke that in the UK,

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.710
we usually have nine months of bad weather

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.510
and then three months of Winter.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:15.450
And then that's your entire
year in terms of climate.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.820
But to come to your point,
you're exactly right,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.040
try to get that daylight.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.520
Now it can be you know,
working next to a window

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.560
and you're getting that natural sunlight.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.920
But that natural sunlight is
even on a cloudy day in England

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.700
is usually far more potent

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.340
than anything that you'll
get from indoor lighting,

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.280
despite you thinking sort
of from a perception wise,

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.670
maybe the much closer than I would think.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.350
- Yeah, I've been I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.594
I've been a big proponent of

00:44:44.594 --> 00:44:46.480
there's a an app called
Light Meter, which will

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.993
it's a free app, I have
nothing to do with it

00:44:48.993 --> 00:44:49.826
that will allow you to

00:44:49.826 --> 00:44:52.715
get a pretty decent
measurement of the amount

00:44:52.715 --> 00:44:53.548
of light energy coming toward you.

00:44:53.548 --> 00:44:56.970
And if you hold it up to a cloudy morning,

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.320
where you don't think it's very bright out

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.370
kind of a dismal day,

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.890
you'll notice that
there'll be 1,000, 2,000,

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.470
even you know, 5,000 Lux,

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.430
Lux just being a measure
of brightness, of course.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.020
And then you can point
the same light meter

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.150
toward an indoor light
that seems very bright

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.320
and very intense and it'll say 500 Lux

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.050
and you realize that the
intensity as we gauge it,

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:19.590
perceptually is not really
what the system is receiving.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.900
So outdoor light is key.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.160
How do you get this natural stimulation?

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.050
Or I should just say light
stimulation early in the day,

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.550
what is your typical,

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:31.170
what does Matt Walker do to
get this light stimulation?

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.680
- I am no poster child,

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.340
but usually I will, if I'm working out

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.550
I usually work out most days.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.280
And I shopped around and I found a gym

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.250
that has huge amounts of window
exposure facing to the East.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:49.290
This is going to sound
so ridiculous you know,

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.350
Matt Walker chooses a gym on the basis.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.960
- I love it
- Of the solar impact

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.820
so he cannot you know
correct his circadian.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.010
- There are a lot of
criteria for selecting gyms,

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.620
this one is actually
grounded in physiology,

00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.760
and biology and so.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.419
- And selfishness about my own sleep.

00:46:02.419 --> 00:46:03.252
- No it's great.

00:46:03.252 --> 00:46:04.230
So you get the your exercise

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.350
and your light stimulation simultaneously?

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.017
- That's right, yep, yeah.

00:46:07.017 --> 00:46:08.920
- And so you're stacking
cues for wakefulness

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.753
early in the day.

00:46:09.753 --> 00:46:12.470
- Exactly, so both exercise and daylight

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.470
are wonderful cues for
circadian rhythm alignment,

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:19.330
and also circadian rhythm reset each day.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.060
And so I will use both exercise,

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.700
I mean, I'm neither a strong morning type

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.767
or a strong evening type.

00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:28.080
And my preference to exercise

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.150
is probably sometime in
the middle of the day,

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.477
probably somewhere around
1pm sorry, not 1am.

00:46:35.477 --> 00:46:39.530
But I'm usually working
out probably around

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:44.530
the sort of seven, sort of 45 8am time,

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.780
that's usually when I'll start my workout.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.570
And there I will start with cardio

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.380
spin bike facing a window.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.220
And luckily, for the most
part here in California,

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.690
there's usually sunlight coming through.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.180
But it doesn't matter to me

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.770
because just as you said,

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.090
even when it's a cloudy day

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.840
that Lux coming through of light,

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.040
the intensity is splendid.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.880
So I would prefer to favor my exercise

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.350
just because for efficiency too,

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.017
I want to get also working on the day,

00:47:15.017 --> 00:47:19.170
I'll try to match my exercise

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.120
more with my circadian light exposure

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.380
than I would probably if I'm going to

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.080
do I really want to crush a workout,

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.230
or do I want to just, you know,

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:30.150
make sure it's a good workout?

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.980
I would prefer to work out,
you know, at a different time.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.860
But I like that because of the daylight.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.230
And we can speak about
exercise timing at some point,

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.850
because there's a lot of
discussion around that,

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.493
when is the right time
to exercise during sleep.

00:47:41.493 --> 00:47:44.007
And we can sort of bust
some myths there too.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.761
So I think you're spot
on with the suggestion,

00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:50.860
get some morning daylight,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.780
try to get that exposure, usually
at least 30 to 40 minutes,

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.910
there was some great
work recently coming out

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.090
in the occupational health domain,

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:01.620
where they moved workers from offices

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.930
that were just facing walls and you know,

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:06.640
didn't have any exposure
to natural daylight.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.650
And then they did a time
period during that study

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:13.000
where they actually were in
front of a window and working.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.550
And they measured their
sleep and their sleep time

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.530
and their sleep efficiency
increased quite dramatically.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.760
I'm forgetting the numbers now

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.020
but I think the increase
in total sleep time

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.507
is well over 30 minutes.

00:48:24.507 --> 00:48:28.480
And the improvement in sleep
efficiency was five to 10%.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.360
You know, and if you're
batting an 80%, you know,

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.160
sleep efficiency average,

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.540
we're a bit concerned about that.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.757
But add 10% to that

00:48:36.757 --> 00:48:38.360
and now you're in you know,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.720
a great echelon of healthy sleepers.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.180
And all you did was just spend some time

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.450
working in front of windows.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:45.930
- That's great and probably

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.250
folks might want to consider

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.686
spending a little less
time with sunglasses

00:48:49.686 --> 00:48:50.519
provided they can do that safely,

00:48:50.519 --> 00:48:51.830
you know, driving, etcetera.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:53.670
You're not alone with
your exercise behavior

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:54.503
and facing East.

00:48:54.503 --> 00:48:57.800
So the one and only Tim
Ferriss told me recently

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.270
that his morning routine nowadays

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.280
consists of jumping rope while facing East

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.800
to get the sunlight
stimulation of the eyes.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.680
And as Matt and I both know,

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.250
it has to be of the eyes, right?

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.610
These portals are the only way

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.730
to convey to the rest
of the brain and body

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.223
about the time of day and wakefulness.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.823
Along the lines of wakefulness,

00:49:22.674 --> 00:49:24.510
I have a number of
questions about caffeine.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:28.160
The dreaded and beloved
caffeine, I love caffeine,

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.933
but I like it in relatively
restricted periods of time.

00:49:35.991 --> 00:49:38.840
So I'm a big fan of waking up

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.480
and even though I wake up very groggy,

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.485
allowing my natural wakefulness
signals to take hold,

00:49:43.485 --> 00:49:45.690
meaning I wake up very slowly,

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.557
but I don't drink caffeine right away.

00:49:47.557 --> 00:49:51.250
I sort of delay caffeine
by a little while,

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.580
usually 90 minutes to two hours.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.380
And that idea came to me

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.080
on the basis of my understanding

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.670
of how caffeine and the
adenosine receptor interact.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.588
I have a feeling you're going to pronounce

00:50:03.588 --> 00:50:04.421
adenosine differently than I do.

00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:06.203
- No, no, I will with that,
I will go with adenosine.

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:09.310
- I've tried to go with your
skeletal instead skeletal

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.345
and synapse and synapse.

00:50:11.345 --> 00:50:12.941
- Schedule and schedule.
- There we go.

00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:17.080
But to make it really simple for folks,

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.750
how does caffeine work to
make us feel more alert?

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:25.600
And does the timing in
which we ingest caffeine

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.860
play an important role

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.130
in whether or not it works
for us or against us?

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:33.010
So maybe we just start with
how does caffeine work?

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.610
Why is it that when I
drink mate or coffee,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.660
which are my preferred
sources of caffeine,

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.440
do I feel a mental and physical lift?

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.850
- Yeah so I'm going to suggest

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:46.963
counter to what most people
would think, drink coffee.

00:50:48.764 --> 00:50:50.302
- Or mate, is mate okay also?

00:50:50.302 --> 00:50:51.135
- [Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:51.135 --> 00:50:52.570
- Whatever form you enjoy.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.140
- We'll come on to sort
of why I suggest that

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.775
but when it comes to coffee,

00:50:57.775 --> 00:51:02.775
I would say the dose and
the timing makes the poison.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:06.760
So let's start with how caffeine works.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.510
Caffeine is in a class of drugs

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.143
that we call the psychoactive stimulants.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:15.580
So it works through a
variety of mechanisms,

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.410
one is a dopamine mechanism

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:22.860
dopamine we often think of
as a reward chemical or,

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.930
but dopamine is also very much

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.607
an alerting neurochemical, as well.

00:51:27.607 --> 00:51:30.490
And caffeine has some
role it seems to play

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:32.230
in increasing dopamine.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:35.020
But its principal mode
of action, we believe

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.000
in terms of making me more alert

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.760
and keeping me awake throughout the day

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.310
is on the effects of adenosine.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:43.970
And to explain what adenosine is

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.950
from the moment that you
and I woke up this morning,

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:51.100
this chemical adenosine has
been building up in our brain.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:52.840
And the longer that we're awake,

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.320
the more of that adenosine accumulates,

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.110
- Is it mask, may I ask,

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.230
is it accumulating in neurons in glia,

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.160
or in the blood vessels?

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.390
Where and is it also
accumulating in my body?

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:07.180
Where is this adenosine coming from?

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.310
And where is it accumulating?

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.783
- Yeah, so the adenosine
here that we're talking about

00:52:10.783 --> 00:52:12.650
that is creating the sleep pressure

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.020
is a central brain phenomenon.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:19.320
And it comes from the neurons
themselves combusting energy.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.050
And as they're combusting energy,

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.820
one of the offshoots of that

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.160
is this chemical adenosine.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.300
And so as we're awake throughout the day,

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.400
and our brain is
metabolically very active,

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.840
it's accumulating and
building up this adenosine.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.010
Now, the more adenosine that we have,

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.220
the sleepier that we will feel.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.710
So it really is like a sleep
pressure is what we call it.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.940
Now, it's not a mechanical
pressure, don't worry,

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.040
your head's not going to explode,

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.480
it's a chemical pressure.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.830
And it's this weight of sleepiness

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.510
that we feel gradually growing

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.620
as we get into the evening.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.250
- May I just interrupt
you again to just ask

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.060
do we know what the circuit
mechanism is for that?

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.690
I mean, not to go too
far down the rabbit hole,

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.316
but for the aficionados and for myself,

00:53:08.316 --> 00:53:11.370
we have brain mechanisms
like locus coeruleus

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.745
that are release things
that our brain areas

00:53:14.745 --> 00:53:16.479
locus coeruleus is just
being a brain area, of course

00:53:16.479 --> 00:53:20.270
that release things that
proactively create wakefulness.

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:21.980
So are those neurons shutting down

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.010
as a consequence of
having too much adenosine?

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:27.760
Or are there areas of the brain

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.240
that promote sleepiness
that are getting activated?

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.370
Because these, you can imagine

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:33.790
both things working in parallel,

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.200
one or the other would
accomplish the same endpoint?

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.310
- Yeah and it's both.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.075
And so there are two main
receptors for adenosine

00:53:41.075 --> 00:53:45.139
the A1 receptor and the A2 receptor.

00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:48.280
And they have different modes
of activating brain cells

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.830
or inactivating or decreasing
the likelihood of firing.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.710
And adenosine works in this
beautiful, elegant way,

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:59.700
where it will inhibit and shut down

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.520
the wake promoting areas of the brain

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.580
whilst also increasing
and dialing up the volume

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.290
on sleep activating,

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:09.841
sleep promoting range.

00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:10.878
- Biology is so beautiful.

00:54:10.878 --> 00:54:11.879
- [Matthew] Oh it's fantastic.

00:54:11.879 --> 00:54:12.712
- There's a push pull,

00:54:12.712 --> 00:54:13.560
I mean, and we could
have a larger discussion

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.760
at some point about that,

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.218
everything seeing dark
edges seeing light edges.

00:54:18.218 --> 00:54:21.860
Our ability to smell or
to sense pressure on this,

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.521
everything's a push pull in Biology.

00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:24.354
- Oh it's great, yeah, yep.

00:54:24.354 --> 00:54:28.270
- So this is another example
where as I am awake longer,

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.800
adenosine is released in the brain.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.330
And my wakefulness areas
are being actively shut down

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:35.670
by that adenosine

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:38.420
and my sleepiness brain
areas, so to speak,

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.780
are being promoted to be
more active, is that correct?

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.110
- That's right and it's a
very progressive process.

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:46.467
It's not like a step function, where

00:54:46.467 --> 00:54:49.050
and sometimes that happens occasionally,

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.700
but it's usually because you've
been sort of driving through

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.530
and as we'll come on to
have caffeine in the system,

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:56.440
and then all of a sudden
you just hit a wall

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.750
and it just, you know engulfs you

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:01.730
and you go from zero to
the one of sleepiness

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:03.200
within a short period of time.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.620
- What explains the fatigue
after a hard conversation?

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:07.850
The desire to go to sleep

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:11.203
or desire to go to sleep
during a hard conversation?

00:55:11.203 --> 00:55:13.102
- That's an interesting one.

00:55:13.102 --> 00:55:14.130
I think it's usually just based on

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.810
personality type interactions.

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:16.990
And for the most part.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.520
- Not that I've ever
experienced that before.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.780
- No people with you
don't, but with me, they.

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.959
- Oh no, no, I've
experienced the desired to

00:55:22.959 --> 00:55:26.550
some conversations, I'm
halfway through them

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:28.560
and I feel like I want to take a nap.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.533
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.520
- And I would love to look at you know,

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.670
people's sleep history.

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.840
We've sort of seen that
time and time again,

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.070
but and then it could be,
you know, with folks like me,

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.620
people just lose the will to live

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.670
within about five minutes
of speaking with me, so.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.622
- Not true, they hear
that sleep is important.

00:55:43.622 --> 00:55:44.455
[cross talking]

00:55:44.455 --> 00:55:45.801
- Unrelated.
- [Andrew] That's awesome.

00:55:45.801 --> 00:55:46.634
- And that's flattery, that's great.

00:55:46.634 --> 00:55:50.640
But so the way that then caffeine
comes into this equation,

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.090
as they're saying, it's usually
a kind of a linear process.

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.650
Or maybe it's probably
closer to an exponential

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:59.380
in terms of your subjective
feeling of sleepiness.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.640
And we haven't really been
able to measure that in humans,

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.670
because normally, we it's
hard to actually, you know,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.860
stick something into the
brain and be, you know,

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.430
sucking, siphoning off stuff
every couple of minutes,

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:12.050
as you could do in animal studies.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:13.850
And keep asking people
every couple of minutes,

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:15.480
how sleepy do you feel, how sleepy?

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:19.570
And track to see if there's
a linear rise in, you know,

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:21.500
adenosine, which then creates

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.670
an exponential rise in
subjective sleepiness

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.100
or what the dynamics are,

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.623
but I'm kind of nerding out.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.580
Caffeine comes into play here,

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.120
because caffeine comes into your system

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.410
and it latches on to those
welcome sights of adenosine

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.770
the adenosine receptors.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.910
But what it doesn't do is latch on to them

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.870
and activate them.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:46.630
Because if it was doing that,

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:48.890
then it would, you know, in lots of ways

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:51.680
it would dial up more sort of sleepiness.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.270
It does the opposite.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.320
The way that caffeine works is that

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.250
it comes in, competes
with quite sharp elbows

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:03.640
with adenosine competitively
forces them out of the way,

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.150
hijacks that receptor by latching onto it,

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.890
but then just essentially blocks it.

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:12.770
It doesn't inactivate the receptor,

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.290
it doesn't activate the receptor,

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:18.410
it functionally inactivates it

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.940
in the sense that it takes it
out of the game for adenosine.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.430
So it's like someone you
know, coming into a room,

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:27.540
and you're just about to
sit down on the chair,

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.279
and caffeine comes in and
just pulls out the chair.

00:57:30.279 --> 00:57:32.130
And you're like, well, now
I've got nowhere to sit.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.280
And caffeine just keeps
pulling out the chairs

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.140
from adenosine and adenosine even though

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.550
it's at the same
concentration in your brain,

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:42.580
your brain doesn't know

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:47.030
that you've been awake for,
you know, 10 hours, 16 hours

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:50.090
at that point when you've
downed a cup of coffee.

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:54.130
Because all of that
adenosine that's still there

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:57.180
can't communicate to the brain

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.640
that you've been awake
for 16 hours because.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.370
- But the adenosine is
still in brain circulation.

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:03.450
- Correct.
- So the real question is

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.910
what happens when caffeine is dislodged

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:07.310
from the adenosine receptor?

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:08.660
- Unfortunate things happen.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.750
And that's what we call
the caffeine crash.

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:13.440
Which is caffeine has a half life

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.087
and it's metabolized and.

00:58:15.087 --> 00:58:16.590
- Do you recall what the half life is?

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.530
- Yeah, the half life is somewhere between

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:20.440
five to six hours.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.830
And the quarter life therefore

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:24.240
is somewhere between 10 to 12 hours.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.130
It's variable, different people

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:29.870
have different durations of its action,

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:32.370
but for the average
adult five to six hours.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:35.820
That variation, we understand
it's down to a liver enzyme

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.330
or a set of liver enzymes

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:40.780
of the class that we call
the cytochrome P450 enzymes.

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.780
And there are I think last
I delved into the data,

00:58:45.923 --> 00:58:46.756
which is pretty recently,

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.880
there are two gene variants

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:52.350
that will dictate the enzymatic speed

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.070
with which the liver breaks down caffeine.

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:56.490
And that's why you can have some people

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:58.860
who are very sensitive to caffeine

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.570
and other people who say, you know,

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.780
it just doesn't affect me
really that much at all.

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.550
- These are the people
that have a double espresso

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:07.210
after a 9pm dinner and
can sleep just fine.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.950
- Well, and we'll come onto.

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:09.949
- Well at least subjectively

00:59:09.949 --> 00:59:11.030
they think they are sleeping.

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:12.770
- Subjectively, yeah,
and we should speak about

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:14.840
that assumptive danger too.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.360
So then the caffeine is in the system

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.160
and after some time period,

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.470
it will be inactive in the system.

00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:24.720
So let's say that, you know,

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.240
I've been awake for 12 hours now.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.890
And it's you know, 8pm

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:31.180
and I'm feeling a bit tired,

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.690
but I want to push through
and I want to keep working

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:35.020
for another couple of hours,

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.640
so I have a cup of coffee.

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.700
All of a sudden I was feeling tired,

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.820
but I don't feel like I've been
awake for 12 hours anymore.

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.930
Because with the caffeine in the system,

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:46.510
maybe only half of that adenosine

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:50.530
is being communicated through
the receptor to my brain.

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.110
100% of the adenosine is still there,

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:55.430
only half of it is allowed
to communicate to my brain.

00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.014
So now I think oh I haven't
been awake for 12 hours,

00:59:58.014 --> 01:00:00.390
I've just been awake for
six hours, I feel great.

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:02.050
Then after a few hours,

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:05.130
and the caffeine is starting
to come out of my system,

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:09.260
not only am I hit with the
same levels of adenosine

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.980
that I had before I'd
had the cup of coffee

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.330
several hours ago,

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:16.240
it's that plus, all of the adenosine

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.760
that's been building up during the time

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.750
that the caffeine has been in my system.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.700
- So sort of an avalanche of adenosine.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.571
- It is a tsunami wave, yeah
and that's the caffeine crash.

01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:26.853
- And it's interesting
because the caffeine crash

01:00:26.853 --> 01:00:31.420
at two o'clock in the afternoon
when you have work to do

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.350
is a terrible thing.

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:34.960
But what about the person,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.220
maybe this person is me in my 20s,

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.910
who says, I'm going to
drink caffeine all day long.

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:42.560
And then I want the crash.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.890
Because at nine or 10pm,
if I stop drinking caffeine

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.840
at say, 6pm, and I crash,

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.290
then I crash into a slumber,
a deep night of sleep.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.700
Is that sleep really as
deep as I think it is?

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.730
Because given the half life of caffeine

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.490
that you mentioned a few moments ago,

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.690
I have to imagine that

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.080
having some of that caffeine
circulating in my system

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.610
might disrupt the depth of sleep,

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:09.260
or somehow the architecture
of sleep in a way

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.945
that even if I get eight,

01:01:11.945 --> 01:01:13.490
or who knows even 10 hours of sleep,

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.980
it might not be as restorative
as I would like it to be.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.120
- Yeah, and that is the danger,

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120
just sort of that, you know,

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.250
those people that you described who say,

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.840
and I, a lot of them
will speak with me too

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.500
say, look, I can have
two espressos with dinner

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.900
and I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.270
Because usually those
are the two phenotypes

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:34.510
that we typically see
with too much caffeine.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:37.120
I just can't fall asleep
as easily as I want to,

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.540
or I fall asleep, but I
just can't stay asleep.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.220
And caffeine can do both of
those things quite potently.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.650
- How late in the day do you
think is assuming somebody,

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.100
translate this folks, if you
go to bed earlier or later,

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.750
you have to shift the hours accordingly.

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:52.400
But given somebody who typically

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.980
gets into bed around 10:00, 10:30,

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:57.513
and falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:02.690
When would you recommend
they halt caffeine intake?

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.670
And these are not strict prescriptives,

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.900
but I think people do benefit

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.480
from having some fairly clear guidelines

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.010
of what might work for them.

01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:15.080
Would you say cut off caffeine,
by what time of the day?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.110
- I would usually say

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.860
take your typical bedtime

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.760
and count back sort of somewhere
between 10 to eight hours

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.390
is probably getting a little bit close.

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:27.270
But take back sort of 10
hours or eight hours of time,

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.460
that's the time when you
should really stop, you know,

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.130
using caffeine is the suggestion.

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:34.830
And the reason is because for those people

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.490
who even just keep
drinking up until you know,

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.160
into the evening, you're right,

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.570
that they can fall asleep fine,

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:42.610
maybe they stay asleep,

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:46.680
but the depth of their deep
sleep is not as deep anymore.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.040
And so there are two consequences.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.460
The first is that for me,

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.200
and it can be up to by 30%,

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.730
and for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:59.480
I'd have to age you by
between 10 to 12 years,

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.450
or you can just do it
every night to yourself

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:03.600
with a couple of espressos.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.510
The second is that you then
wake up the next morning,

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:10.447
and you think, well, I didn't
have problems falling asleep

01:03:10.447 --> 01:03:13.400
and I didn't have problems staying asleep,

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.900
but I don't feel particularly
restored by my sleep.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.730
So now I'm reaching for
three or four cups of coffee

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.212
the next morning,

01:03:20.212 --> 01:03:21.620
rather than just two or
three cups of coffee.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.957
And so goes this dependency cycle,

01:03:23.957 --> 01:03:26.310
that you then need your uppers

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.050
to wake you up in the morning,

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:31.100
And then sometimes people will
use alcohol in the evening

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.360
to bring them down because
they're overly caffeinated

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.220
and alcohol, and we can
speak about that, too,

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.800
also has very deleterious
impacts on your sleep as well.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.040
So you're right that it's
not just the quantity

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.390
of your sleep, or even
difficulties falling

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.858
or staying asleep,

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.380
it can also be deep sleep.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.110
But here again, I think, you know,

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:53.230
I don't want to be frightening people.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.180
And I mentioned this before,

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.320
I think one of the real problems that I

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.050
or mistakes that I made,

01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:59.210
because I didn't you know,

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.280
I'd never had much public
exposure before the book.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:06.470
And I was so saddened by you know,

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.992
the disease and the suffering

01:04:08.992 --> 01:04:11.360
that I was seeing as a
consequence of a lack of sleep

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.690
in our society.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.050
And the fact that it wasn't really

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:15.910
being discussed very much.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.040
I sort of came out, you know,
a little bit headstrong,

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.950
more than a little bit headstrong.

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:25.950
And I think I was, you know,
perhaps too much gas pedal

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.320
and too little, you
know, break as it were.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.270
And I don't think that's the right way

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:38.150
to approach a health message
within the public sphere.

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.840
And I've become much softer

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.430
in how I think about these things.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:45.000
I have ideas about

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.600
what the ideal world looks like for sleep.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.290
But I also realize that none of us

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.730
live in this thing called the ideal world.

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.339
- We certainly don't.

01:04:53.339 --> 01:04:54.977
- So, you know, I want to
be really mindful of that,

01:04:54.977 --> 01:04:57.050
and I think I've done a really bad job

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.870
of being sort of too forthright,

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:01.317
particularly for people who
struggle with sleep, you know,

01:05:01.317 --> 01:05:03.220
early on, when I would offer

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.200
these sort of messages about sleep.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.670
I want to be, you know,

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.890
I want to be theoretical
when it comes to the science,

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.120
I want to be faithful to the science.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.600
But I also don't want to go out

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.460
and scare the living
daylights out of people,

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.080
particularly people who are
struggling with their sleep,

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.600
'cause it's probably only
going to make matters worse.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.550
So I've been beautifully schooled by

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:28.010
learning how to be a slightly
better public communicator.

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:30.410
I'm nowhere near of the
standing that you are,

01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:33.010
you are very elegant and
it's very intuitive to you.

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:34.850
I'm still with training wheels,

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.410
but I'm getting a little bit better.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.010
But I just want to say that

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:39.200
when I'm speaking about caffeine,

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.400
'cause it sounds as though I'm very

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.990
sort of overt about it.

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:46.630
But I will come back to
why I say drink coffee.

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.040
But I just want to make that point.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.550
- Yeah, well, I appreciate
you making that point.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.350
And I'm sure our listeners will too.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:56.610
I still will stand behind my statement,

01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:59.460
which is that what you've
done for the notion

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.930
that sleep is vital for
all aspects of health

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:06.200
and for performance, mental
and physical and wakefulness,

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.160
the message and the
packaging it was contained in

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.873
and is has been clearly
clearly net positive

01:06:12.873 --> 01:06:15.851
people needed to be cued to this.

01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:16.855
- Thank you.
- The I'll sleep

01:06:16.855 --> 01:06:18.370
when I'm dead mentality is one that I had,

01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:20.190
it's one that other people have.

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:22.350
People in a huge number
of vital communities,

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:25.900
not just your students, but also people

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.460
that this the messaging that you provided

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.340
and continue to provide

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.590
has positively impacted the
first responder community,

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.460
the medical community,

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.090
there're still steps that need to be taken

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.090
the military community,

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:40.230
and of course, the civilian community.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.430
And so I think these adjustments about

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.510
yeah, caffeine is okay,

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:45.480
just restricted to the
early part of the day,

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.110
if you can, most days,

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:48.640
I mean, I think the law of averages.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.420
It's like the light viewing behavior

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:54.000
I think it is critical to
view sunlight or natural,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.100
some other form of bright
light early in the day

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.270
but if you miss a day,

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:58.440
it's not that your whole system

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.718
is going to dissolve
into a puddle of tears.

01:07:00.718 --> 01:07:02.810
That'll happen on the
second or the third day,

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.440
no I'm kidding, you've
got a couple of days.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.090
Biology works in averages

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:09.680
except with respect to accident or injury.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.510
A car accident is a car accident, right?

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.240
You don't get to have three of those

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.990
before the brain damage occurs

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:16.950
if the accident's severe enough.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.140
But with sleep behavior,

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.400
these homeostatic type
behaviors, or with food,

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.270
one chocolate sundae, is it
going to kill you know? No.

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:25.250
Every night? Yeah.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.670
It's going to make you
demented and kill you early.

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:29.311
We know this.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.720
And so I think the middle ground

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.800
is often a hard place to achieve.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.810
So I think you've done a phenomenal job.

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:36.847
But I appreciate you raising these points.

01:07:36.847 --> 01:07:41.847
And I think it's clear that we all need to

01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:45.040
that we all can and should
do certain things better,

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.310
including being gentle with
ourselves from time to time

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:52.660
when we deviate from
these ideal circumstances.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.570
Along these lines, I do
want to talk about alcohol

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.070
because I think caffeine and alcohol

01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:00.120
represent the the kind of two
opposite ends of the spectrum.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.300
Clearly there are other stimulants.

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.540
There your Adderalls and
your high energy drinks

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.450
that people use.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:10.250
But alcohol and caffeine are
the most commonly consumed

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.800
stimulants and sedatives,

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.020
depressants as they're sometimes called.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:19.020
So what happens when somebody has a glass?

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.650
We always hear a glass or
two of wine in the evening

01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:27.650
or a cocktail after
dinner or before dinner,

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.870
how does that impact their sleep?

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.950
And then we'll be sure to circle back

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:36.000
in terms of what is
reasonable ranges of behavior

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
when it comes to avoiding alcohol

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.940
or if it's age appropriate,
et cetera, enjoying alcohol?

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.080
- Yeah, so alcohol,

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.030
if we're thinking about classes of drugs,

01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:50.230
they're in a class of drugs
that we call the sedatives.

01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:51.900
And I think one of the first problems

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.660
that people often mistake,

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.810
alcohol is often used as a sleep aid

01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:59.600
for people who are struggling with sleep

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.930
when things like over the
counter remedies, etcetera,

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.920
or herbal remedies have just
not worked out for them.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.580
And alcohol, unfortunately,
is anything but a sleep aid.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.460
The first reason that most people use it

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.770
is to try and help them fall asleep.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.740
- So and this process of

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.050
this event that we call falling asleep,

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.700
I have to imagine is a process.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.540
- It is a process.
- Like everything in biology,

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.870
and that that process
involves in some way,

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:26.990
as we talked about push
pull before turning off

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:29.620
thinking, planning, et cetera,

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:32.850
and turning on some sort
of relaxation mechanism.

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:34.220
I have to imagine that these two things

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.020
are knobs turning in opposite directions

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.220
that gives us this outcome
we call falling asleep.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.980
Alcohol, it seems is
helpful for some people

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:45.310
to turn off their thoughts
or their planning.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.400
Is that right?

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.560
- Yes, it is.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.208
And so I think, you know,

01:09:50.208 --> 01:09:51.041
if we look at the pattern
of brain activity,

01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:53.340
if I were to place you
inside an MRI scanner,

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.600
where we're looking at
the activity of your brain

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.200
and watch you drifting off,

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.200
some parts of your brain
will become less active.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.050
Other parts will become more active.

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:03.950
And this is the push pull model.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.990
It's inhibition excitation.

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.830
But alcohol is quite
different in that regard.

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:12.460
Alcohol is because it's a sedative,

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.660
what it's really doing

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.790
is trying to essentially
knock out your cortex.

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:20.070
It's sedating your cortex,

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.190
and sedation is not sleep.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.150
But when we have a couple
of drinks in the evening,

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:25.780
when we have a couple of nightcaps,

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.080
we mistake sedation for sleep

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.140
saying, well, I always when
I have a couple of whiskies

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.490
or a couple of cocktails,

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:35.260
it always helps me fall asleep faster.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.690
In truth, what's happening is that

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:38.940
you're losing consciousness quicker,

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.400
but you're not necessarily falling

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.110
naturalistically asleep any quicker.

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:46.370
So that's one of the first sort of things

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:47.790
just to keep in mind.

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:49.280
The second thing with alcohol

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.190
is that it fragments your sleep.

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:52.990
And we spoke about the
quality of your sleep

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:56.400
being just as important as the quantity.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.110
And alcohol through a
variety of mechanisms,

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:01.380
some of which are activation

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.190
of that autonomic nervous system,

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.690
that fight or flight branch
of the nervous system.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.180
Alcohol will actually have you waking up

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.260
many more times throughout the night.

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.390
So your sleep is far less continuous.

01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:16.040
Now, some of those awakenings

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.060
will be of conscious
recollection the next day,

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.710
you'll just remember waking up,

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.690
many of them won't be.

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:25.810
And so but yet, your
sleep will be littered

01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:28.750
with these sort of punctured awakenings

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.800
throughout the night.

01:11:30.937 --> 01:11:31.950
And again, when you wake
up the next morning,

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:35.250
you don't feel restored
by your sleep, you know,

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.120
fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.500
in this alcohol induced way,

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.540
is usually not good quality sleep,

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.403
but you feel great on the next day.

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.030
The third part of alcohol
in terms of an equation

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:52.070
is that it's quite potent
at blocking your REM sleep,

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:54.010
your rapid eye movement sleep.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.540
And REM sleep is critical

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.950
for a variety of cognitive functions.

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:59.830
Some aspects of learning and memory

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:00.980
it seems to be critical

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.230
for aspects of emotional
and mental health.

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:04.270
- You've described it before

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:06.870
as a sort of self generated therapy

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.300
that occurs while we sleep.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.280
- Yeah, it's overnight therapy, you know,

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.760
it's emotional first aid.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.600
- Certainly people that
don't get enough sleep

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.540
are very easy to derail emotionally.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.130
Not that one would want
to do that to people,

01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:22.840
but we all sort of fall apart emotionally.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.840
I always think of it as almost like

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.000
our skin sensitivity can be heightened.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.050
- Yes, absolutely.
- When we are sleep deprived.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.550
Our emotional sensitivity is such that

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:34.910
when we're sleep deprived,

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:39.330
such that it takes a much
finer grain of sandpaper

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:42.790
to create that kind of
friction, things bother us.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:44.451
- [Matthew] Threshold to trigger.

01:12:44.451 --> 01:12:47.290
- Even online comments bother
us when we're sleep deprived.

01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:49.310
and never when we're well rested.

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:51.160
- I would love to say
that I never look at them,

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.868
except I look at.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.030
- Well actually, here I.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.185
- [Matthew] Maybe every one of them.

01:12:55.185 --> 01:12:57.202
- Here I will editorialize

01:12:57.202 --> 01:12:58.865
because the notion of
not looking at comments

01:12:58.865 --> 01:13:02.830
is unreasonable to ask of any academic,

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.500
because academics we are all trained

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.790
to look at our teaching evaluations.

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:11.440
And just like with online
comments to ignore 20% of them,

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.360
no, I'm kidding.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.000
We look at them all in any event.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.270
So in terms of translating
this to behavior,

01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:19.410
I'm not, I don't
particularly enjoy alcohol,

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.450
I guess I might be
fortunate in that sense.

01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.460
But I also have never really experienced

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.950
the pleasure of drinking alcohol.

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:27.960
I sometimes like the taste of a drink,

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.470
but I never like the sensation.

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:32.410
So that's, I don't have a
lot of familiarity with this,

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:34.630
but many people do, and I understand that.

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:39.630
So let's say somebody enjoys
a glass of wine or two

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.320
with dinner and they eat dinner at 7pm.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.830
Is that likely to disrupt
their sleep at all?

01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:48.306
Let's just sort of,

01:13:48.306 --> 01:13:50.160
let's make this a series of gradations.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.660
- And the answer is yes.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.360
I think once they just looked
at a single glass of wine

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.970
in the evening with dinner,

01:13:57.970 --> 01:14:02.670
and I would be untruthful
if I didn't just simply say

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:04.530
it has an effect.

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:06.790
And we can measure that in terms of.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:07.790
- Less REM sleep.

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:08.960
- Less REM sleep

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.720
and one of the fascinating studies

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.090
I can't remember what dose I
think they got them close to

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:17.630
a standard illegal blood alcohol level,

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.080
so maybe they were a little bit tipsy.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.100
And yes, you see all of the
changes that we just described,

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.220
they sort of lose
consciousness more quickly,

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.600
they have fragmented sleep,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.020
and they have a significant
reduction in REM sleep.

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.190
But what was also interesting

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:33.390
because REM sleep, as
we spoke about before,

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:36.320
is a time when some hormonal systems

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.800
are essentially recharged and refreshed

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.660
growth hormone being one of them,

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.580
there was well over a 50% five zero drop

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.630
in their growth hormone release

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:49.720
during alcohol laced sleep at night.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.050
- And growth hormone is
so vital for metabolism

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:54.215
and repair of tissues.

01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:55.830
- Yeah, it's not just for kids.

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.278
- [Andrew] Keeping body fat low.

01:14:57.278 --> 01:14:58.610
- This is essential in adults.

01:14:58.610 --> 01:15:00.940
- It's essential, along those lines,

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.790
I just want to highlight the fact that

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:06.070
this information that you're sharing

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:08.500
that growth hormone is released

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.190
is strongly tethered to the presence of

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:14.540
healthy amounts of REM
sleep is interesting to me,

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.030
because I always thought the
growth hormone was released

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:18.490
in the early part of the night.

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.470
- Well, it is released
across both of those,

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:23.760
but across the different stages,

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.470
but what we also know is that
when you disrupt REM sleep,

01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:29.340
there are those growth
hormone consequences.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:32.110
So it's not an exclusive system

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:33.870
just like with testosterone,

01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:36.530
we can see changes
throughout non REM sleep,

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:39.640
but if you ask when are
the peak release rates

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.770
of testosterone, it's right
before we go into REM sleep,

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:44.380
and then during REM sleep.

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.550
- And of course,
testosterone being important,

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:48.336
both for males and females.

01:15:48.336 --> 01:15:49.662
- For men and women, yeah.

01:15:49.662 --> 01:15:51.520
- Right, for libido and
tissue repair and well being.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.920
Nobody, regardless of
chromosomal, hormonal,

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.410
or any other background

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.600
wants to have their normal levels

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.930
of testosterone reduced acutely,

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:01.970
that's just a bad

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:04.010
it equates to a terrible set

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:05.750
of psychological and physical symptoms.

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.140
- Yeah, and the mortality risk

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.190
that's associated with low testosterone

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:10.720
is non trivial.
- Prostate cancer.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.020
- Right, exactly, you know.

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:16.840
So coming back to just
the point on REM sleep

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.780
that you mentioned regarding
emotional instability,

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.338
and we see that that's one of the things

01:16:22.338 --> 01:16:23.650
one of the most reliable
signatures of just

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.760
insufficient sleep doesn't
have to be sleep deprivation.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.730
What we've discovered
over the past 20 years

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:30.680
here at The Sleep Center,

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.710
is that there is no major
psychiatric disorder

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:38.450
that we can find in which sleep is normal.

01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:40.270
And so I think that firstly told us

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.170
there is a very intimate association

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:45.723
between your emotional mental
health and your sleep health.

01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:49.990
But when it also comes to REM sleep,

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:52.630
I think what's fascinating is that

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:54.600
it's not just about your emotional health,

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.600
it's not just about your hormonal health

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.810
we've also been seeing other
aspects of you know, cognition.

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.980
But then there was a report,

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.870
I think it could have
been about two years ago,

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:10.483
out of Harvard, I think it
was Beth Clements group.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:13.440
They found that,

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.670
and they replicated it in two
different large populations.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.430
If you look at the contribution

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:22.340
of different sleep
stages to your lifespan,

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:27.340
REM sleep was the strongest
predictor of your longevity.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.550
And it was a linear relationship.

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:31.640
It wasn't it sort of one of these U shaped

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.170
or J shaped curves that we
often see with total sleep,

01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:38.050
and mortality risk, it really was linear.

01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:40.450
That the less and less REM
sleep that you were getting

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:43.720
the higher and higher
your probability of death.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.010
And then they did.

01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:48.000
- Was that death due to
natural causes or accident?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.950
'Cause I can imagine if you're
not getting enough REM sleep,

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:51.840
you're more likely to
drive off the freeway,

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.790
step off a cliff.

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:54.475
- I think it was all cause mortal.

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:55.410
- You just make bad
decisions about anything

01:17:55.410 --> 01:17:58.590
in love relationships, which
can also be life threatening.

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:00.210
- Yeah, I've tried to lean into that

01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:03.130
and claim that with those
bad relationship situations,

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:04.534
oh, I just didn't have
enough REM sleep last night.

01:18:04.534 --> 01:18:05.367
- Blame it on the sleep.

01:18:05.367 --> 01:18:06.280
- [Matthew] My darling you know.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.763
- The REM sleep difference.

01:18:07.763 --> 01:18:10.770
- And, but she's far wiser than I thought.

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:15.770
But, so they did this great
machine learning analysis

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.640
and I may get these numbers backwards.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.640
But I think for every 5%
reduction in REM sleep,

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:28.750
there was a 13% associated
increased risk of mortality.

01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:32.020
And I could have, I'll
have to go back and check.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.160
But to me, and in the
machine learning algorithm,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.080
what they ultimately spat out

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.170
was that of all of the sleep stages,

01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:42.240
REM sleep is the most predictive

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.870
of your longevity of your lifespan.

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:46.890
So we often, I hear people saying,

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.633
how can I get more deep sleep?

01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:50.440
Or they sometimes say

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.880
how can I get more dream sleep?

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.930
And my answer is a question.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.730
Why do you want to get more of that?

01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.980
And they'll say, well,
isn't that the good stuff?

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.716
And I'll say, well, actually
all stages have good sleep.

01:19:01.716 --> 01:19:02.680
- It's all the good stuff.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.230
Well, it's like the exercise question

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:05.950
and it took decades,

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:09.715
for people to understand
that moving around

01:19:09.715 --> 01:19:14.360
for about 150, probably 180 minutes a week

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.090
at doing endurance type work,
zone two cardio type work,

01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:20.590
it is correlated with living longer,

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.410
feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.

01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:24.250
There's really no way around it.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:29.250
I mean, you can ingest Metformin
until the cows come home,

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:31.170
you can take NMN,

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:34.540
all of which I think have
their place in certain contexts

01:19:35.394 --> 01:19:37.070
I'm a big fan of the work
surrounding all those protocols.

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.700
- Yeah likewise.
- But without getting

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:43.240
proper amounts of movement,
meaning sufficient numbers,

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.180
it doesn't matter how many
12 minute exercise regimes

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:50.000
you follow per week, you
need that threshold level.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.050
And it sounds like the
same is true of REM sleep

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.500
and total amount of sleep.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.210
There's just you pay the piper somehow.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.080
- Yeah, the return on investment
I mean, to flip the coin,

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.470
the return on investment
is astronomical, you know,

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:08.470
I think of sleep it is the
tide that moves, you know,

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.950
that raises all of those health boats.

01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:12.210
- And the most fundamental layer

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.040
of mental and physical health.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.510
Whenever people ask me, even
though I'm not a physician,

01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:18.719
they'll ask me, you know,

01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:19.552
what should I take or what should I do?

01:20:19.552 --> 01:20:22.040
The first question is
always, how's your sleep?

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.520
- Great, I love it.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.072
- Meaning how well do
you sleep every night

01:20:25.072 --> 01:20:26.080
and how long do you sleep?

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:26.913
And I always recommend your book,

01:20:26.913 --> 01:20:29.010
I always recommend your podcast, you know,

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:32.263
the podcasts you've been
a guest on, etcetera.

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:36.580
Who knows, maybe you'll even
release your own podcast

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.960
at some point soon and keep

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.580
because I do think people need
to hear from you more often.

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.901
One thing I don't want to
return to the notion of

01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:46.070
public health discourse too much.

01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:49.230
But I do want to say one
issue with books in general,

01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:51.830
is that they can be revised,

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:54.230
but it's more or less a
one and done kind of thing

01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.500
until the next book comes out.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.830
- Yeah, yeah
- One thing I like

01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:58.260
about the podcast format

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.400
is that updates can be provided regularly.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.430
Corrections and updates
as new data come out.

01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:07.090
And so that's a wonderful
aspect to this format.

01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:09.840
And hopefully the format
that you'll be embracing,

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.590
I think the world needs
to hear more from you

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:17.510
more often, about sleep, and
its various contours, not less.

01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:22.470
And so I do have a question
about drinking alcohol.

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.680
Not that we want to promote day drinking,

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:29.060
but let's say that the
one or two glasses of wine

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.400
or cocktail is consumed with lunch,

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.800
something that isn't
traditionally done nowadays,

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.650
or in a late afternoon
happy hour type cocktail.

01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:40.510
And then one is going to sleep
seven or eight hours later,

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:41.610
do you think that

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:44.760
that will improve or somehow mitigate

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.160
the effects of alcohol?

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.050
Or if you have a drink,

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.130
are you are you basically
screwed for the next 24 hours?

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:56.130
- No, I think there's going to
be a time window dependency.

01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:59.260
Now, I don't know of anyone
who has essentially done

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.440
what you and I would like,

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.770
which is the time separation
dose dependent curve,

01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:09.420
where okay, you drink
at 10am, then or 11, 12

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.253
one, two, three, four, five

01:22:10.253 --> 01:22:12.490
all the way up to you know, 10pm

01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:15.620
and estimate, what is the blast radius?

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.810
And is it linear?

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:18.320
Or is it nonlinear?

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.240
Is it such that only when you
drink in the last four hours?

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.640
Do you just hit this exponential
and it's bad, bad bad?

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.100
Or is there some other curve

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:31.410
that we could imagine there
will be many possibilities.

01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:34.640
But certainly what we know
is that the less alcohol

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.473
and the less

01:22:35.473 --> 01:22:38.020
and more specifically
the metabolic byproducts,

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:39.664
aldehydes and ketones,

01:22:39.664 --> 01:22:41.800
they're the sort of the nefarious players.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.027
- And not the ketones that
people are all excited about

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:45.666
the other ketones,

01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:46.590
[cross talking]

01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:47.980
the chemists know what we're referring to.

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.506
- But this is not about ketogenesis,

01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:50.552
please don't think that.

01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:51.991
- This is not about ketogenesis,

01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:53.292
there are ketone bodies,

01:22:53.292 --> 01:22:55.220
and that are released
after ingesting alcohol

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.791
that are not of the positive sort

01:22:57.791 --> 01:23:00.210
that a ketogenic diet might promote.

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:04.900
- Right, so I think in terms
of that alcohol profile,

01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.540
we certainly know that, you know,

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.250
as you're heading into the evening hours,

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:13.283
once again, timing and
dose make the poison.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.990
But I think it's also
important, once again,

01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:19.300
from that public message
standpoint, and thank you,

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.447
I think I am leaning into

01:23:21.447 --> 01:23:25.090
the sort of the podcast
consideration arena, at some point,

01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:28.750
but I don't want to be
puritanical here, you know,

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.620
I'm just a scientist,

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:33.130
and I'm not here to
tell anyone how to live.

01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.880
All I'm trying to do is empower people

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.700
with some of the scientific
literature regarding sleep.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.540
And then you can make
whatever informed choices

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.400
that you want.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.410
Now, unlike you, it turns
out, I'm not a big drinker.

01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:48.760
It's just because I've
never liked the taste.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.020
And I'm surprised that
they haven't taken away

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.193
my British passport because
I don't like lager or beer.

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:59.140
But I also want to say
that life is to be lived

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.650
to a certain degree, it's all
about checks and balances.

01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:05.420
So, you know, if I go out and you know,

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.240
I have an ice cream sundae,
I'm not big on those either,

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.140
but, you know, sure, I
know that my you know,

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.380
blood glucose is not going to be ideal

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:16.200
for another 12 hours maybe.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.710
That's just the price you pay

01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:20.860
for having some kind of relaxed, fun life.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.200
I don't want to look back on life

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.820
and think, gosh, you know, I
lived until I was, you know,

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:31.530
111 and it was utterly miserable you know.

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.360
- Right.
- So, but it's all about

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.550
some kind of a balance.

01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:39.550
And my job is not to tell
people a prescription for life,

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.588
it's just to offer some
scientific information.

01:24:42.588 --> 01:24:44.470
- No, I think you're doing
a terrific job of that.

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:47.140
People are I always say we
have all these neural circuits

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.490
and if it's working properly,

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:51.040
we all have a circuit that allows us

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.000
to skip over information
or as we wish, right,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.590
if the circuits between
your brain and your thumbs

01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:58.930
are working you can slide right along

01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:01.860
you can drop to the next
content however you like.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:06.277
I would like to ask
about marijuana and CBD.

01:25:06.277 --> 01:25:08.620
This is a discussion that
I think five years ago

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.550
would have ventured into
the realm of illegal

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:13.512
but now in many places not all

01:25:13.512 --> 01:25:16.370
medical marijuana is approved or is legal.

01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:20.610
And certainly it's in widespread use.

01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:22.210
Certainly not recommending people do it.

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:24.460
I have my own thoughts
about marijuana CBD.

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.510
I've been fortunate, I suppose

01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:29.430
that I don't particularly
like marijuana or CBD.

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:31.763
I don't even know if I've ever tried CBD.

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:37.750
First of all, does marijuana
disrupt the depth of sleep,

01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:40.200
the architecture of sleep?

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.090
And if so, as with alcohol and caffeine

01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:47.110
does when you ingest it

01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:49.380
or when it's in your bloodstream does,

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:50.780
relative to when you go to sleep,

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.310
does that play an important role?

01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:55.290
So does marijuana disrupt sleep?

01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:56.880
- Yeah, it does.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.410
And there's a pretty
good amount of data on

01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:03.730
so we can break sort of cannabis down into

01:26:03.730 --> 01:26:05.660
two of its key ingredients.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.510
We've got THC tetrahydrocannabinol,
and we've got CBD

01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:14.630
and CBD is sort of the less psychotic

01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.680
what we think of as the non
psychoactive components.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.160
In other words, when you
take CBD, you don't get high.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.190
If you take THC, you can get high.

01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:27.060
That's the psychoactive
part of the equation.

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.812
- Are both considered sedatives
in the technical sense?

01:26:29.812 --> 01:26:32.740
- No, they're not.

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:36.950
Neither of them have that class right now.

01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:41.950
THC can, seems to speed up the time

01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.320
with which you fall asleep.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.200
But again, if you look at the
electrical brainwave signature

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.600
of you're falling asleep
with and without that THC,

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.050
it's not going to be an ideal fit.

01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:56.510
So you could argue it's non natural,

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:58.970
but many people use THC for that fact,

01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:01.640
because they find it
difficult to fall asleep.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.070
And it can speed the onset

01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:05.490
of at least non consciousness,

01:27:05.490 --> 01:27:07.570
I guess is the best way of describing it.

01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:10.370
But there are problems with THC.

01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.910
And they are twofold.

01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:13.390
The first is that it too,

01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:16.960
but through different mechanisms
seems to block REM sleep.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.950
And that's why a lot of
people when they're using

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.794
will tell me look, you know,

01:27:20.794 --> 01:27:22.410
I definitely, I was dreaming.

01:27:22.410 --> 01:27:24.710
Or I don't remember, you
know many of my dreams.

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:28.140
And then when they stop using THC,

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:31.900
let's say I was having, you
know, just crazy, crazy dreams

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:35.390
and the reason is because
there is a rebound mechanism.

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:36.850
REM sleep is very clever.

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:39.120
And alcohol is the same way in this sense,

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.030
it's the same homeostatic mechanism.

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:42.160
Some people will tell me,

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.660
look, if I have a bit
of a wild Friday night

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.490
with some alcohol, you know,

01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:48.820
maybe I'll sleep late
into the next morning.

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:52.150
And I'll just have these
really intense dreams.

01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:54.730
So and I thought I wasn't
having any REM sleep,

01:27:54.730 --> 01:27:56.360
well, the way it works is that

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.090
it's during in the middle
of the night, really,

01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:01.938
when alcohol blocks your REM sleep.

01:28:01.938 --> 01:28:03.930
And your brain is smart

01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:06.930
it understands how much REM
sleep you should have had,

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.680
how much REM sleep you have not

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.700
because the alcohol
has been in the system.

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.810
And finally, in those early morning hours,

01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:14.716
when you're getting through
to sort of, you know,

01:28:14.716 --> 01:28:15.715
[cross talking]

01:28:15.715 --> 01:28:16.930
six, seven, 8:00am all of a sudden,

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:18.500
your brain not only goes back

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.270
to having the same amount
of REM it would have had,

01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:23.900
it does that plus it tries to get back

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.790
all of the REM sleep that it's lost.

01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:27.610
Does it get back all of the REM sleep?

01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:28.550
No, it doesn't.

01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:31.750
It never gets back all of
the REM sleep, but it tries.

01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:34.780
And so you have these really
intense periods of REM sleep.

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:37.950
Hence you have really
intense bizarre dreams.

01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:40.580
And that's what happens also with THC,

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.060
you build up this pressure for REM sleep,

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:45.793
this debt for REM sleep,

01:28:45.793 --> 01:28:47.691
will you ever pay it back?

01:28:47.691 --> 01:28:49.670
Doesn't seem as though you get back

01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:51.310
everything that you lost,

01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:52.850
but will you get back some of it?

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:55.280
Yes, the brain will start to devour more

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.074
because it's been starved
of REM sleep for so long.

01:28:59.074 --> 01:29:02.260
But one of the bigger problems with THC

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.870
that we worry about is
withdrawal dependency.

01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:09.190
So as you start to use THC for sleep,

01:29:09.190 --> 01:29:12.920
there can be a dependency tolerance.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.820
So you start to need more to
get the same sleep benefit.

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.330
And when you stop using,

01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:21.780
you usually get a very
severe rebound insomnia.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.340
And in fact, it's so potent

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:25.893
that it's typically part of the clinical

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:30.660
withdrawal profile from THC from cannabis.

01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:32.692
- And there's anxiety withdrawal.

01:29:32.692 --> 01:29:37.692
I you know, I don't ask anybody
to change their behavior,

01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:40.590
we just as you said, we
try and inform people

01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:41.650
about what the science says

01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:43.640
and let them make choices for themselves.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.590
People who are regular pot smokers,

01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:48.950
if you many of will insist
they're not addicted,

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:52.700
and maybe indeed they don't
actually follow the profile

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:54.470
of classical addiction, I don't know.

01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:56.240
I'm guessing some do, some don't.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.280
But if you ask them

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.450
well, what if I took away all
marijuana consumption for,

01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:04.520
I don't know, two weeks?

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.030
That thought scares many of them.

01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:09.100
And many of them will experience

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.120
intense anxiety without marijuana,

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.170
which speaks to perhaps not addiction,

01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:15.056
but a certain kind of dependency.

01:30:15.056 --> 01:30:18.030
And again, you know, I
know many pot smokers,

01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:19.930
some of whom have jobs

01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:22.860
that are quite high
performing and they manage.

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.440
- Here in Berkeley, I
don't know any of those.

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.890
- Yeah, none of those, right.

01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:28.530
What about CBD?

01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:30.070
I mean, we hear so much about CBD,

01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.240
I've been a little concerned
about the fact that

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.850
the analysis of a lot of
CBD supplements out there

01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:37.450
has confirmed that much
like with melatonin,

01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:40.364
the levels that are
reported on the labels,

01:30:40.364 --> 01:30:42.520
in no way shape, or form,

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.470
match the levels that
are actually contained

01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:45.590
in the various supplements.

01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:47.680
Sometimes the levels are much higher

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.660
than they're reported on the labels.

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:51.333
Other times, it's much lower.

01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:55.160
What does ingesting CBD do

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.320
to the architecture and quality of sleep?

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.010
- Right now, I don't
think we have enough data

01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:05.260
to make some kind of, you know,
meaningful sense out of it.

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.840
I think the picture that
is emerging, however,

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.770
is probably the following.

01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:13.880
Firstly, CBD does not
seem to be detrimental

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.270
in the same ways that THC is.

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.370
So we can start by saying

01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:22.360
does it create you know,
potential problems,

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.920
not of the nature necessarily
that we see with THC.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.880
But the devil is a
little bit in the details

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.300
from the data that we do have

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.853
and it comes on to your
valid point of purity.

01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:39.710
At low dose, CBD can seem
to be wake promoting.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.530
So in lower doses,

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:43.490
let see sort of five or 10 milligrams

01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:44.930
and trying to remember some of the studies

01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:46.690
off the top of my head,

01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:49.610
there it actually may enhance wakefulness

01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:52.010
and cause problems with sleep.

01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:54.650
It's only once you get
into the higher dose range,

01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:57.110
that there seem to have
been some, you know,

01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:59.920
increases sorry, increases in sleepiness,

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:03.850
or sort of sedation like, increases.

01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:08.460
And that's usually I think,
above about 25 milligrams,

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.600
as best I can recall from the data.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.870
And then when we look in animal models,

01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:17.930
you typically see the
same type of profile too.

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:20.210
So then the question becomes

01:32:20.210 --> 01:32:23.910
and now again, you just don't
know about, you know, purity.

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:26.950
It's very difficult,
although I think, and again,

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:28.590
I'm not a user,

01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:30.550
not necessarily because I you know,

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:31.560
have anything against it.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:34.623
It's just that's not, you know,
necessarily my cup of tea.

01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:38.090
There are some firms that are now doing

01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:41.190
third party independent laboratory tests.

01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:43.140
I don't know how gamed that is,

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:45.071
so I've got no sense of it.

01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:45.904
- I think some supplement companies

01:32:45.904 --> 01:32:47.710
are quite honest and accurate

01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:49.780
about the amounts of various substances

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:53.170
that are in their
products and some are not.

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.590
And I think there's just a huge range.

01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:58.870
I think the FDA is starting
to explore CBD there

01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:01.330
I certainly I saw some grant announcements

01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:03.270
to explore the function of CBD.

01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:05.980
Most of the work on CBD is
being done by the general public

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.720
adjusting it and seeing how they feel.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.190
I gave it to my dog who was

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:12.000
had some dementia related
sleep disturbances,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.780
and it actually created
a heightened wakefulness

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:16.635
it completely screwed up his sleep.

01:33:16.635 --> 01:33:17.634
- Okay, it sounds as
though it just wasn't.

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:18.632
- He's a bulldog.

01:33:18.632 --> 01:33:20.110
So if he's going to get access
to sleep, he's going to take it.

01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:22.214
- Okay.
- Really messed him up,

01:33:22.214 --> 01:33:24.483
took him took it away, he did better.

01:33:25.710 --> 01:33:28.315
But you know, that's a canine, so.

01:33:28.315 --> 01:33:29.440
- Right, and it could have been, you know,

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.910
sort of dose related too.

01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:32.930
- Or binders or other things
that are in there, sure.

01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:34.640
- Correct, yeah and we,

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.917
but right now, if we were to,

01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:38.350
and I'm not making the statement,

01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:40.040
I don't think anyone can
make the statement now.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.970
But if it ends up being that CBD

01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:45.718
is potentially beneficial for sleep,

01:33:45.718 --> 01:33:49.350
how can we reconcile that mechanistically?

01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:52.010
And I think there are, to me, at least,

01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:54.070
there are at least three
candidate mechanisms

01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:57.440
that I've been exploring
and thinking about.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.480
The first is that it's thermo regulatory.

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.560
And what we found in some animal models

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.480
is that CBD will create
a profile of hypothermia.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.090
In other words, it cools the body

01:34:09.090 --> 01:34:10.680
the core body temperature down.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.000
And that's something that
we know is good for sleep.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.120
The second is that it's an anxyolitic,

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.880
that it can reduce anxiety.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.440
And that data is actually quite strong,

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.300
even with some functional imaging work

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.650
that's been coming out recently

01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:25.640
showing that one epicenter of
emotion called the amygdala

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:30.270
deep within the brain is
quietened down with CBD.

01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:32.933
So I think that's at least a
second non mutually exclusive.

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:33.939
- That's great, that's conducive.

01:34:33.939 --> 01:34:35.060
- You know, possibility.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.380
I think the third is some recent data

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.930
that's come out that was suggesting

01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:44.000
that CBD can alter the
signaling of adenosine.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.410
So it doesn't necessarily mean

01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:48.360
that you produce more adenosine,

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.820
but what it can do is perhaps modulate

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.630
the sensitivity perhaps of the brain,

01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:57.280
so that the weight of that same adenosine

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.230
is weightier in its brain signal,

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:06.270
and therefore it creates this
stronger pressure for sleep.

01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:09.080
So I think these are all
tentative mechanisms.

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.730
I think any one of them is viable,

01:35:10.730 --> 01:35:13.350
I think all three are viable together.

01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:14.640
But right now I think,

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.080
does that sort of help think through

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.333
the tapestry of THC and CBD?

01:35:18.333 --> 01:35:21.700
- Yeah very much so and
actually, it's a perfect segue

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:26.700
from we've talked about
caffeine, alcohol, THC and CBD

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.970
as sort of, we framed them anyway,

01:35:30.970 --> 01:35:32.570
as things that done in moderation

01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:33.630
at the appropriate times,

01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:36.160
are probably okay for most people.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.190
Certainly not for everybody,

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.050
there will be differences in sensitivity.

01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:42.160
But that done at the incorrect times,

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.570
and certainly in the incorrect amounts

01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:48.160
will greatly disrupt this vital
stage of life we call sleep.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.570
CBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge

01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:52.600
to the topic I'd like to talk about next,

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.980
which is things that
promotes more healthy sleep,

01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:00.820
or somehow contribute to
enhancing the architecture

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.260
and quality of sleep.

01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:04.456
So I'd love to chat for a moment about

01:36:04.456 --> 01:36:06.740
the kind of grand,

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.410
the original I should say that

01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:11.890
not the granddaddy but the
OG of sleep supplementation,

01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:13.630
which is melatonin.

01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:16.000
The so called hormone of darkness

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.510
that's inhibited by light, etcetera.

01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:20.740
Frame for us, melatonin

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:23.610
in the context of its
naturally occurring form.

01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:25.870
And then I'd like to talk
about melatonin the supplement

01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:28.800
because in my experience,
anytime I say the word melatonin,

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.160
people think about the
supplement melatonin,

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.820
which in itself is an
interesting phenomenon

01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:38.090
that people are so cued to its role

01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:39.330
as something you take,

01:36:39.330 --> 01:36:40.790
we often forget that this is something

01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:42.260
that we make endogenously.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.130
I'd love for you to comment in particular

01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:47.410
on even though without
necessarily getting into

01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:50.180
its precise nanograms
per deciliter values,

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.670
what are the typical amounts of melatonin

01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:53.800
that we release each night?

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.411
And then I'd like to compare that

01:36:56.411 --> 01:36:58.150
to what is contained in
say a three milligram

01:36:58.150 --> 01:37:01.250
or six milligram tablet that
one might buy at the pharmacy.

01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:04.090
- Right, yeah.
- So I go to sleep at night,

01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:05.710
has melatonin already kicked in

01:37:05.710 --> 01:37:07.810
before I shut my eyes
and lay down my head?

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:10.550
- Usually, yes, if your system is working

01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:12.140
in the correct way,

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.460
as dusk is starting to happen,

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:17.340
so let's say that you look
at hunter gatherer tribes

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.660
who aren't touched by electricity,

01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:23.830
and so that's sort of the
puritanical state par excellence

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:27.513
when it comes to electric light influence.

01:37:27.513 --> 01:37:30.610
And usually, it's as dusk is approaching,

01:37:30.610 --> 01:37:33.760
that's when melatonin will start to rise.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.940
And so when you lose the brake pedal

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:39.563
of light coming through the eyes,

01:37:39.563 --> 01:37:42.890
that normally acts like a hard brake pedal

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.700
that stamps down and prevents the release

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:47.770
and production of melatonin.

01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:52.460
As that light brake pedal
starts to fade with dusk,

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:54.550
then we ease off the brake pedal

01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:58.380
and melatonin the spigot
of melatonin is opened up,

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.860
and melatonin starts getting released.

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:05.112
And usually we'll see this
rising peak of melatonin

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:09.970
sometime, usually an hour,
two hours later or around

01:38:09.970 --> 01:38:11.830
and it varies from different people

01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:14.930
around the time of sleep itself.

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:18.450
But it's already been on
the march for some hours

01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:22.650
before you actually hit sleep itself.

01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:25.090
- Interesting, and I was always taught

01:38:25.090 --> 01:38:26.420
and I'm assuming it's still true

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.980
that the only source of
melatonin in the brain and body

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:30.190
is the pineal gland.

01:38:30.190 --> 01:38:31.550
Is that still true?

01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:34.570
- Yeah, it seems to be
from best that we can tell

01:38:34.570 --> 01:38:39.570
the pineal gland sort of
meaning pea like sort of shape.

01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:42.730
It's actually I think usually
people say it's pea like,

01:38:42.730 --> 01:38:45.740
I think if you look at the
Latin derivative, it's more,

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:49.270
I think it's derived
from pine cone, not pea

01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:50.900
because in fact, if
you look at the pineal,

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.557
it is more pine cone shaped

01:38:52.557 --> 01:38:54.680
and so is aptly named.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.190
- Any human brain I've ever dissected

01:38:56.190 --> 01:38:57.470
or I confess I've dissected a lot

01:38:57.470 --> 01:39:00.027
'cause I teach neuroanatomy
and have for years.

01:39:00.027 --> 01:39:02.260
I love looking at the pineal

01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:04.300
it's the one structure in the brain

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:05.360
that's not on both sides.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.710
It's usually pretty easy to find.

01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:08.250
And it's a pretty good size.

01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:09.180
It looks like a,

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.865
it looks like a pea.

01:39:10.865 --> 01:39:11.698
And it's sitting right there.

01:39:11.698 --> 01:39:14.583
And it's remarkable that
it releases this hormone.

01:39:14.583 --> 01:39:18.603
Sort of probably our entire
lifespan is inhibited by light.

01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:22.380
So our pineal starts to release this

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.500
into the general circulation.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.100
I have to imagine we
have melatonin receptors

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:26.300
in the brain and body.

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:28.680
- It's correct, so yep, essentially,

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.410
your brain has a central
Master 24 hour clock

01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:34.930
called the super charismatic nucleus

01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:37.750
that keeps internal time.

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:41.880
Now it's not a precise clock
if left to its own devices,

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.530
nothing that a Swiss clock
maker would be proud of.

01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:47.639
It runs a little bit long and laggy.

01:39:47.639 --> 01:39:48.793
- It's like an American clock.

01:39:49.863 --> 01:39:51.100
There are a couple of good
American watches by the way,

01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.889
Hamilton's are very nice, but.

01:39:52.889 --> 01:39:53.881
- It's very much like a bug.

01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:54.714
- We're not famous for our timekeeping

01:39:54.714 --> 01:39:57.600
or our punctuality for that
matter, but the Swiss are.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.940
- It's very it's not quite Swiss, like

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:02.260
it's more Berkeley like,
which is very relaxed.

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:03.650
Oh you know what whatever.

01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:07.470
So in most adults, the
average adult, I should say,

01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:10.310
your biological clock normally
runs a little bit long,

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:15.140
it's about 24 hours and 30 minutes,

01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:17.240
I think was the last calculation.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.750
But the reason that we don't
keep drifting forward in time

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:22.770
and kind of running consistently,

01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.700
you know, more and later and later,

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:27.590
30 minutes by 30 minutes
by 30 minutes each day,

01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:30.060
is because your central brain clock

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.400
is regulated by external
things such as daylight

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.480
and temperature, as well
as food and activity.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:39.870
All of these are essentially
different fingers

01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:43.740
that come along and on the
wristwatch of the 24 hour clock

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.700
will pull the dial out
and reset it each day

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.510
to precisely 24 hours.

01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:53.510
And I make that point because
it knows 24 hour time,

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:57.700
but it needs to tell the rest
of the brain and the body,

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.550
the 24 hour time as well.

01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:02.580
And one of the ways that it does this

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.790
is by communicating a chemical signal

01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:10.400
of 24 hour nurse of light and day

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.060
using this hormone, melatonin.

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.920
And when it is at low levels,

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.470
or it's non existent,

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:19.130
it's communicating the
message it's daytime,

01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:23.360
and for us diurnal species,
it says it's time to be awake.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.990
Yet, at nighttime,

01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:27.620
when dusk approaches and the
break comes off melatonin

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.802
and we start to release it,

01:41:29.802 --> 01:41:31.940
then it signals to the rest
of the brain and the body,

01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:34.080
look, it's dusk and it's nighttime.

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.270
And for us diurnal species,
it's time to think about sleep.

01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:42.870
So melatonin essentially
tells the brain and the body

01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:44.350
when it's day and when it's night,

01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:46.300
and with that when it's time to sleep

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.760
when it's time to wake.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.170
And therefore, that's why melatonin helps

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:53.820
with the timing of the onset of sleep.

01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.210
But it doesn't really help

01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:56.940
with the generation of sleep itself.

01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.090
And this is why we'll come on to

01:41:58.090 --> 01:42:01.400
what those studies of
supplementation have taught us.

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.700
- So it tells the rest
of my brain and body,

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.050
it's time to go to sleep.

01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:07.930
It perhaps even aids with
the transition to sleep

01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:09.880
but it's not going to for instance,

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:12.230
ensure the overall structure of sleep

01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:14.750
or it's not the conductor

01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:17.080
that's guiding the sleep
orchestra so to speak

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.230
throughout the entire night.

01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:21.700
- Yeah, it's.
- It's more like the

01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.270
people that essentially
take you to your seat

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:25.080
and sit you down and
give you your program.

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.420
- Right, exactly yeah,
sort of the the fall,

01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:31.250
less sophisticated analogy
I have is, you know,

01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:33.410
melatonin is like the starting official

01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:35.690
at the 100 meter race in the Olympics.

01:42:35.690 --> 01:42:37.641
- That's a better analogy, yeah.

01:42:37.641 --> 01:42:40.230
- It calls all of the
sleep racers to the line

01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:42.320
and it begins the great sleep race.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.499
- Yeah, better analogy by the way.

01:42:44.499 --> 01:42:45.332
- [Matthew] It doesn't help
dissipate, no, no, no, no.

01:42:45.332 --> 01:42:46.570
- Coming from the sleep
researcher of all people.

01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:48.960
- But it doesn't participate
in the race itself.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.030
That's a whole different
set of brain chemicals

01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:53.253
and brain regions.

01:42:54.150 --> 01:42:56.290
Which then brings us on to

01:42:56.290 --> 01:43:00.080
perhaps the question of supplementation,

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.230
which is, is it helpful for my sleep?

01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:05.290
Will I sleep longer?

01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:07.450
Will I sleep better?

01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:11.875
And if I am, what dosage
should I be taking?

01:43:11.875 --> 01:43:15.430
Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults

01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:18.370
who are not older age suggests that

01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:22.080
melatonin is not really
particularly helpful as a sleep aid.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.470
I think there's a recent meta analysis

01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:26.170
that demonstrated when

01:43:27.125 --> 01:43:30.120
it looked at all of the
different sleep parameters,

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.610
melatonin, and a meta analysis

01:43:32.610 --> 01:43:34.360
for those not knowing what that is,

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.210
it's a scientific sort
of method that we use

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:38.847
where we gather all the individual studies

01:43:38.847 --> 01:43:40.440
and we put them in a big bucket

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.310
and we kind of do this kind of statistical

01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:43.660
fancy sleight of hand.

01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.320
And we try to come up with a big picture

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.520
of what all of those
individuals studies tell us.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.840
And what that meta
analysis told us is that

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.260
melatonin will only increase
total amount of sleep

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:56.290
by 3.9 minutes, on average.

01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:57.157
- Minutes?
- [Matthew] Minutes.

01:43:57.157 --> 01:43:58.450
- Not even percent.

01:43:58.450 --> 01:44:02.580
- And it will only increase
your sleep efficiency by 2.2%.

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.553
So it really.

01:44:05.553 --> 01:44:10.030
- This is as they say, in
certain parts of California,

01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:13.720
that's weak sauce, that's
a weak sauce effect.

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:14.790
- The sauce is not strong,

01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:16.930
the force is not strong in this one,

01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:21.050
when it comes to a tool
that in healthy people

01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:23.747
who are not of older age,

01:44:23.747 --> 01:44:26.480
it doesn't seem to be
especially beneficial.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:28.630
Now, you know, results can vary.

01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:29.960
Everyone is different, of course.

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.510
So we're talking about the average,

01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:33.400
the so called average human adult here.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.430
- Well, melatonin, in
defense of what you're saying

01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:38.110
and also I should mention,

01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:40.090
I have a colleague at
Stanford, Jamie Seitzer.

01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:40.923
- Oh, wonderful, genius.

01:44:40.923 --> 01:44:42.290
- Chuck Seitzer's lab at Harvard Med

01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:44.530
where he also trained
terrific sleep researcher

01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:45.890
and I asked him about melatonin

01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:48.240
and he essentially said the
same thing that you just said

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.360
which is very little if any evidence

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.590
that it can improve sleep

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:55.060
and yet it's probably the
most commonly consumed

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.630
so called sleep aid.

01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:58.170
- Hundreds of million dollars industry.

01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:01.010
- Yeah, so either massive placebo effect

01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:03.230
or it's operating through
some other mechanism

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:05.726
related to quelling anxiety perhaps?

01:45:05.726 --> 01:45:07.750
- Well, yeah, that's essentially
interesting, you know,

01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:09.739
there are some studies where

01:45:09.739 --> 01:45:11.010
you do see some, you know, effects.

01:45:11.010 --> 01:45:13.220
Now, again, when you do the
grand average of all studies,

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.880
it just doesn't seem to have an effect.

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.650
But let's assume that for some people,

01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:17.680
it does have an effect

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:20.500
let's not again be sort of
completely dismissive of that,

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.040
how could it have that effect?

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:22.990
One of the reasons

01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:26.070
that I've become a little
bit more bullish on melatonin

01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:27.990
from a sleep perspective

01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:31.480
and then melatonin more generally for a,

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.950
maybe you can speak about this too,

01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:37.390
as a counter measure

01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:39.893
when you're undergoing insufficient sleep.

01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:42.970
There are two different routes there.

01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:44.380
The first reason that I think

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.700
it could have a sleep
benefit for some people

01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.850
is not because it helps in
the generation of sleep,

01:45:48.850 --> 01:45:50.220
we know that it doesn't,

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:54.450
it's because it too seems to
drop core body temperature.

01:45:54.450 --> 01:45:55.780
- There it is, temperature again.

01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.160
I'm fascinated these days,

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.050
more and more by temperature,

01:45:59.050 --> 01:46:03.660
as maybe not just a
reflection of brain state

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.500
and wakefulness and in sleep,

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:08.580
but actually a lever
that is quite powerful.

01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.120
- I think it's both.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.590
- And with all the interest
in ice baths and hot showers

01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:12.600
and saunas and stuff,

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.060
something that we will
definitely touch on.

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:17.360
Temperature variation is so key.

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.230
So if melatonin is
dropping body temperature

01:46:20.230 --> 01:46:22.620
by a degree or so something
that you've said before

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.440
can help induce a sleepy state.

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.080
Maybe that's what's allowing
people to get in to sleep.

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.439
- I think that's one possibility.

01:46:29.439 --> 01:46:30.530
I don't think melatonin by itself

01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:33.210
will drop it by it sort
of, you know, a degree,

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:34.760
certainly not a degree Celsius.

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.280
And for order in us to fall asleep,

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.930
and then stay asleep across the night,

01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.070
we do need to drop our
core body temperature

01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:42.860
by about one degree Celsius,

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:46.000
or about two to three degrees Fahrenheit.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.500
And that's why it's always easier

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:50.200
to fall asleep in a room
that's too cold than too hot.

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:54.490
I think that that's one potential avenue

01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:58.120
that we are considering
thinking more deeply about

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.210
when it comes to melatonin.

01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:03.590
And then the other is
melatonin as an antioxidant.

01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:05.890
But let me table that for now.

01:47:05.890 --> 01:47:07.820
'Cause I'll just get us sidetracked.

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:11.580
That's what we know so far about melatonin

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:15.460
in terms of its supplementation
benefit or lack thereof.

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:17.720
Two final points that I shouldn't forget,

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.030
one is the only population
where we typically see

01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:23.630
some benefit, and it often is prescribed

01:47:23.630 --> 01:47:25.970
is in older adults, because as we.

01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:27.870
- Older meaning 60 and older?

01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:29.710
- Yeah, 60, 65 and older

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:31.150
because as we get older,

01:47:31.150 --> 01:47:32.990
you can typically have what's called

01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:35.140
calcification of the pineal gland.

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.800
Which means that that gland
that's releasing melatonin

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.662
doesn't work as well anymore.

01:47:39.662 --> 01:47:44.662
As a consequence, they tend to
have a flatter overall curve

01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:47.070
of melatonin release throughout the night.

01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:49.320
It's not this beautiful, lovely peak,

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.050
and this bullhorn message of its darkness,

01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:53.390
please get to sleep.

01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:55.940
That's why older adults can
have problems falling asleep

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.000
or staying asleep.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.400
It's not the only reason by
any stretch of the imagination.

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:01.570
But it's one of the reasons

01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:04.670
and it's why melatonin
supplementation in those cohorts,

01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:07.890
older adults, and especially
older adults with insomnia,

01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:09.720
people have thought about that

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:12.570
as maybe an appropriate use case.

01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:14.010
- Well, along those lines,

01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:17.597
if we were to compare dosages, I don't,

01:48:17.597 --> 01:48:19.310
do we know how much melatonin

01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:22.717
is typically released into
the bloodstream per night?

01:48:22.717 --> 01:48:26.480
And can we use that as a
kind of a rule of thumb

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.180
by which to compare the typical amount

01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:29.680
that someone would supplement?

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.035
Typically, the supplements
for melatonin that I see

01:48:32.035 --> 01:48:35.140
in the pharmacy and elsewhere online

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:38.250
range anywhere from one milligram to 12,

01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:40.410
or even 20 milligrams.

01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:45.040
My guess is that a normal
night's release of melatonin

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.880
typical for somebody
in their 20s, 30s, 40s

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.142
would be far lower than
that, am I correct or wrong?

01:48:51.142 --> 01:48:54.100
- Yeah, it's many magnitudes lower.

01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.520
And this is one of the problems
is that I see that too.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.590
I see, you know, typical
doses are, you know,

01:48:59.590 --> 01:49:01.460
five milligrams or 10 milligrams

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:04.360
and of course, you know, if
you're a supplement company,

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.770
you know, putting 10 milligrams
versus five milligrams,

01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:08.010
if that's what you're actually doing,

01:49:08.010 --> 01:49:09.960
which we'll speak about purity as well.

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:14.840
You know, it's kind of
like the super gulp size,

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.050
nobody wants to lower price,

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:19.170
they just want you to you know,

01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:20.980
we'll just give you
more for the same price.

01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:22.050
And that's how we'll compete.

01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:25.120
So it's been this escalating arms race

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.030
of melatonin concentration,

01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:29.820
and it really does not look meaningful

01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:33.040
for, you know, for sleep in any way.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.500
What we've actually found

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.650
is that the optimal doses

01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:38.760
for where you do get sleep benefits

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.167
in the populations that we've looked at,

01:49:41.167 --> 01:49:46.167
are somewhere between 0.1 and
0.3 milligrams of melatonin.

01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:50.680
In other words, the
typical doses are usually

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.480
10 times, 20 times maybe more

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.550
than what your body
would naturally expect.

01:49:56.550 --> 01:50:00.530
And this is what we call a
supra physiological dose.

01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:02.370
In other words, it's far above

01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:04.900
what is physiologically normal?

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.290
You know, and to put that in context,

01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:07.530
imagine I said to you,

01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:11.250
I want you to eat 20
times as much food today.

01:50:11.250 --> 01:50:13.620
- I thought you're going to
use testosterone as example.

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:14.903
You're going to take 300 times

01:50:14.903 --> 01:50:16.810
the normal amount of testosterone

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:20.460
we know that would have
tons of deleterious effects

01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:21.450
it would be terrible.

01:50:21.450 --> 01:50:22.710
And yet you can do this.

01:50:22.710 --> 01:50:24.270
One thing that I'm concerned about

01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:26.965
about these super physiological
levels of melatonin

01:50:26.965 --> 01:50:29.550
is that many years ago,
actually, here at Berkeley,

01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:30.480
when I was a graduate student,

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.390
we would inject animals

01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:36.800
which were seasonally breeding
animals with melatonin.

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:41.310
And the consequence of
that was that their gonads,

01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:43.700
either their testes or
ovaries would shrink,

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.700
many hundred fold or more.

01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:48.910
In other words, they would go from having

01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:51.450
nice healthy sized hamster testicles,

01:50:51.450 --> 01:50:54.360
what a hamster would consider
healthy size for a hamster

01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.470
and they would shrink to
the size of a grain of rice.

01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:59.360
So from like an almonds to a
grain size of a grain of rice.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:00.730
I had to see that only once

01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:02.370
for me to be very concerned about

01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:04.460
super physiological levels of melatonin.

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.790
And I realized that melatonin
does different things

01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:08.341
in different species.

01:51:08.341 --> 01:51:10.960
We are not hamsters, we
are not seasonal breeders

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.460
seasonally restricted breeders,

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.967
there might be more breeding
during certain seasons,

01:51:14.967 --> 01:51:15.800
I don't know those data.

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.230
But nonetheless, hormones are powerful.

01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:22.020
And sure there is an optimal,

01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:25.440
and sometimes we see that going

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.330
slightly above endogenous
levels for certain hormones

01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:30.500
not always, can have beneficial effects.

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:33.040
And sometimes it can
have detrimental effects.

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.840
I'm just concerned
about taking high levels

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.100
of a hormone that has effects
on the reproductive axis

01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:42.860
and that's one of the reasons
why I get very concerned

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:46.090
when I see people really
getting aggressive

01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:49.190
about melatonin supplementation

01:51:49.190 --> 01:51:53.310
taking 100, 10, 500,
sometimes even 10,000 times

01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:54.970
the amount that we would normally release.

01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:55.890
That's my concern,

01:51:55.890 --> 01:51:58.830
although it's not nested in
any one specific human study.

01:51:58.830 --> 01:52:00.914
I just don't like to see,

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:02.707
I certainly don't want to see other people

01:52:02.707 --> 01:52:06.220
and I don't want to
personally take a hormone

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:10.670
that's known to be androgen
suppressive at high levels.

01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:12.640
Why would I take that?

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.360
That's the question I ask myself.

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.360
- I think it's a very,
you know, good point.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.137
And if you look at some of
the evidence around, you know,

01:52:21.137 --> 01:52:24.840
melatonins lethality if you
want to go to that extreme,

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:27.560
for the most part, you
know, it's pretty safe.

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.690
- You mean, you can take a
lot of it before you die?

01:52:29.690 --> 01:52:30.970
- Right, exactly yeah.

01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:33.258
- But I don't know that
that's the criteria.

01:52:33.258 --> 01:52:34.100
- That should be your yardstick for,

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:36.956
because, you know, you
really need to think about

01:52:36.956 --> 01:52:38.555
your, you know, your health,

01:52:38.555 --> 01:52:40.300
not just whether this thing
is going to kill you or not

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:44.633
as the decision matrix
through which you pop a pill.

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.100
And it comes on to this
concern around melatonin

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.600
because there was a study,

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:53.320
I think it's one that you mentioned too

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:54.900
where they looked at over,

01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:57.520
I think it was at least
over 20 different brands

01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.700
of melatonin supplements.

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.950
And what they found is
that based on what it said,

01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:05.000
on the bottle versus what was
in the capsules themselves,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.490
it ranged from, I think it was 83% less

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:09.870
than what it said on the bottle

01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:14.310
to 478% more than what
it said on the bottle.

01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:18.870
Now, if that's a 10
milligram, you know, pill,

01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:23.870
and it's 478% more than 10 milligrams,

01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:26.330
and we're already at 10 milligrams

01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:28.790
at many tens of times more

01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:31.160
than is a physiological rather than

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:34.120
a supra physiological dose,

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:35.990
we do need to be a bit thoughtful.

01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:38.003
- Yeah, remember those hamsters folks.

01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:41.900
Well, and I do appreciate

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.250
the deep dive on melatonin

01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:46.330
because I think people need to understand

01:53:46.330 --> 01:53:48.610
that it's nuanced, it's
a matter of dosages,

01:53:48.610 --> 01:53:50.050
and timing, etcetera.

01:53:50.050 --> 01:53:51.220
And then it may have its place

01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.050
as you mentioned in older individuals.

01:53:53.050 --> 01:53:56.770
And I should mention
that I'm an avid consumer

01:53:56.770 --> 01:53:59.600
of supplements that I believe in for me

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:00.940
and I have been for a very long time.

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:04.370
So I'm by no means anti supplement.

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:07.220
Some supplements I refuse
to take or avoid taking

01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:12.068
others I quite avidly take
and along those lines,

01:54:12.068 --> 01:54:15.628
I personally and I don't know

01:54:15.628 --> 01:54:17.640
what your thoughts on this are.

01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.170
But there are a few things

01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:20.540
that I've personally found beneficial.

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.630
I love your thoughts on them.

01:54:21.630 --> 01:54:24.280
And I would love it if
you would tell me that

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.610
everything I'm about
to refer to is placebo,

01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:28.310
that would be fine.

01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:29.143
So that's what we do,

01:54:29.143 --> 01:54:29.976
we're scientists we argue

01:54:29.976 --> 01:54:34.540
and then we remain friends
in as it goes away.

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:38.350
So magnesium, there are
many forms of magnesium.

01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:40.110
Magnesium citrate is a as we know,

01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:41.880
is a terrific laxative.

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:45.640
Magnesium malate seems, at
least from a few studies

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.200
seems to relieve some of
delayed onset muscle soreness

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.000
doesn't seem to create a kind of sedation.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.150
Two forms of magnesium

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:53.440
that I'm aware of magnesium biglycinate

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.903
and magnesium threonate.

01:54:55.893 --> 01:55:00.490
We believe based on the
data can more actively cross

01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:01.580
the blood brain barrier.

01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:02.500
So you put in your gut,

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:03.910
but some of that needs
to go into your brain

01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:05.630
in order to have the sedative effect.

01:55:05.630 --> 01:55:08.170
What are your thoughts on
magnesium supplementation?

01:55:08.170 --> 01:55:10.610
Do you supplement with magnesium?

01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:14.580
And what studies would
you like to see done

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:16.220
if they haven't been done already.

01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:18.964
- So I don't supplement with magnesium.

01:55:18.964 --> 01:55:21.840
But I do think threonate is interesting

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:24.510
because of that higher capacity

01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:27.002
to cross the blood brain barrier

01:55:27.002 --> 01:55:28.560
and actually have a central
nervous system effect.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.200
And the reason that that interests me

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.910
is because the sleep is
by the brain of the brain,

01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:37.890
and also for the brain,
as well as for the body.

01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:40.870
We just don't have a
particularly good set of studies

01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:43.840
that have targeted exclusively threonate.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.140
We do have lots of studies

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:48.290
that have just looked at
magnesium in general for sleep.

01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:51.613
And overall, the data is uncompelling.

01:55:52.515 --> 01:55:54.323
- Interesting.
- And for a while,

01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:57.453
I was confused as to why,

01:55:58.355 --> 01:56:01.940
where did this come from this
kind of myth of magnesium?

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:04.380
So I started looking
back into the literature

01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:08.930
and I've best traced it at
least as far as I can tell,

01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:10.730
to early studies showing that

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:13.830
those who are deficient in magnesium

01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:15.830
also had sleep problems.

01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:17.950
They had other problems too, of course,

01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:21.260
but sleep problems were
one of that set of sequelae

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:24.300
that came from having lower magnesium.

01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:28.160
And when they supplemented with magnesium

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.810
and tried to restore those levels,

01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:32.370
some of those sleep problems dissipated.

01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:35.050
And then that seems to have gotten lost

01:56:35.050 --> 01:56:37.100
in sort of some game of sort of like

01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.500
whispers around the room

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.500
and it's become translated into

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.770
people who don't have sleep problems,

01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:45.410
who are healthy sleepers, and
who are healthy in general,

01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:47.960
and who have healthy
normal levels of magnesium,

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.650
if they take more magnesium,
they will sleep better.

01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:53.780
And the data really, there is not good.

01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:57.020
Once again, the only study that I've seen

01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:59.280
where magnesium did have some efficacy

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.920
was in a study with older adults,

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:03.050
I think they were 60 to 80 years old,

01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:05.120
it may have been exclusively women,

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:06.540
now I think about it

01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.420
and they also had insomnia.

01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:11.730
And in that population,
you did see some benefits.

01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:13.330
And my guess is that

01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:15.770
because it's an older community as well,

01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:18.480
they were probably deficient in magnesium.

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.550
So they fit the former category

01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:23.890
of simply when you're
deficient, and you restore,

01:57:23.890 --> 01:57:27.500
you can help sleep sort
of return to normal.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:30.277
But if you are not deficient
and you're healthy,

01:57:30.277 --> 01:57:31.500
and you're not old and
you don't have insomnia,

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:33.300
and you're supplementing

01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.730
thinking that it provides
sleep, right now,

01:57:35.730 --> 01:57:37.660
the data isn't supportive of that.

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:40.010
But I just don't think we
have enough threonate data

01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:41.180
to actually speak about that,

01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:43.740
because it could just be a
blood brain barrier issue

01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:45.540
so far with the other forms.

01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:47.090
- So maybe some additional studies

01:57:47.090 --> 01:57:49.280
looking specifically at
threonate or bi-glycinate

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.100
would be useful.
- I'd love to have.

01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:54.020
- Magnesium is involved in
so many cellular processes,

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:57.670
you can imagine that this
effect, if it truly exists is,

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:59.210
as we say, in science in the noise,

01:57:59.210 --> 01:58:02.380
meaning it's in the jitter of the data,

01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:03.960
but to isolate the real effect

01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.263
one needs to do some more refined studies.

01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:11.200
What are some things that
are of interest to you,

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.393
if not things that you happen to take?

01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:16.660
These are not things
that I personally take

01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:19.182
mostly because I just haven't
experimented with them.

01:58:19.182 --> 01:58:22.683
valerian root is one,

01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:26.603
tart cherry and kiwi fruit.

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:31.000
Tell me about Valerian root,
tart cherry and kiwi fruit.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.600
This is new to me.

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:34.340
I have certainly heard of them.

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:37.343
And tart cherry and Kiwi sounds delicious,

01:58:38.479 --> 01:58:43.479
but what's happening with
Valerian root tart cherry and kiwi

01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:45.890
and are we talking about
eating tart cherries and Kiwis

01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:48.382
and Valerian roots?
- Yes.

01:58:48.382 --> 01:58:49.215
- Or are talking about
taking them in pill form?

01:58:49.215 --> 01:58:50.540
- Usually it's supplements,

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:54.920
but it's also both for tart
cherries and for kiwis.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:58.130
It's the actual, you
know, fruit themselves.

01:58:58.130 --> 01:59:02.410
Valerian often touted as
a beneficial sleep aid

01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:04.980
and lots of people swear by it too.

01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:07.690
But the evidence is
actually quite against that.

01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:08.990
- Oh really?
- Not that it makes

01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.960
your sleep worse,

01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:13.400
but of at least the seven good studies

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:14.777
that I've been able to find,

01:59:14.777 --> 01:59:17.060
and typically these are of the nature

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:21.300
of what we call a randomized
placebo crossover design.

01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:23.670
And I won't bore people
with what that means

01:59:23.670 --> 01:59:25.117
it's sort of one of the.

01:59:25.117 --> 01:59:25.950
- Good studies, solid studies.

01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:28.541
- Yeah, it's one of the sort
of gold standard methods

01:59:28.541 --> 01:59:30.460
that we have when we're
looking at intervention studies

01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.293
such as drugs studies.

01:59:31.293 --> 01:59:33.890
Five of the seven found no benefits

01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:36.200
of Valerian root on sleep.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:40.740
Then two out of the seven, the
data was just insufficient.

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.130
I think it was a power issue

01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:44.864
where they just couldn't
make any strong conclusions.

01:59:44.864 --> 01:59:49.033
And then I think there
was the most recent study,

01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:56.360
I think looked at two
different doses of Valerian

01:59:56.557 --> 01:59:58.470
and I could have this wrong

01:59:58.470 --> 02:00:01.720
and they just failed to
find any effects once again,

02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:04.800
but the stunning part of
that paper, as I recall,

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.860
they had this big table

02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.440
with all of the different sleep
metrics that they looked at.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.850
And there were well
over 25 different things

02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:14.270
that they tried to see
if valerian impacted.

02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:16.330
And none of them were significant.

02:00:16.330 --> 02:00:19.310
Which stuns me because from
statistical probabilities,

02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:23.550
we know, if you just randomly
perform 25 statistical tests,

02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:25.250
chances are probabilistically,

02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:29.000
you'll just get one significant
result by random chance.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.573
And even with random chance on their side,

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:36.190
they still couldn't find
a benefit of Valerian, so.

02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:38.920
- So Valerian root might be
worse than nothing at all,

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:41.140
if there is, so to speak.

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.100
- I mean, again, placebo effect

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:44.640
we can think about that too.

02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.240
And I would say that if you feel as though

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:48.220
it's having a benefit for you,

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:51.410
and with all of the caveats
that we have with supplements,

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:54.530
things like melatonin purity,
concentration, et cetera,

02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:56.660
you know, maybe it's no harm no foul.

02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:59.050
But I'm not a you know, a medical doctor

02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:01.150
and I don't tell anyone about

02:01:01.150 --> 02:01:02.530
we have all of these disclaimers

02:01:02.530 --> 02:01:03.570
about not recommending such things.

02:01:03.570 --> 02:01:04.550
- And we'll include these,

02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:06.440
I mean, I always say, you
know, we're not physicians,

02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.420
we don't prescribe anything.

02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.060
We're scientists and professors
so we profess things.

02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:12.962
It's up to people to be
responsible for their own health.

02:01:12.962 --> 02:01:16.223
Not just to protect us
but to protect themselves.

02:01:17.501 --> 02:01:22.301
I do want to hear about
tart cherry and kiwi fruit.

02:01:22.301 --> 02:01:24.410
What's the story there?

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:25.243
- Strange, isn't it?

02:01:25.243 --> 02:01:30.190
I was, you know, I'm kind
of a hard nosed scientist,

02:01:30.190 --> 02:01:32.880
and when people you know,
some years ago started saying,

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.610
oh, tart cherries, it's
the thing or kiwi fruits,

02:01:35.610 --> 02:01:38.395
I was thinking, oh, my
goodness, the sounds a bit.

02:01:38.395 --> 02:01:39.290
- You've been in California
a little too long.

02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:42.260
- Yeah, I know, yeah, the
sun is softened me some.

02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:43.770
But I thought, look

02:01:43.770 --> 02:01:46.470
one of the things that we
have to do as scientists

02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:49.110
is be as open minded as possible.

02:01:49.110 --> 02:01:51.370
And I should not be so quick to dismiss.

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:53.170
So I went to the literature

02:01:53.170 --> 02:01:56.130
just started reading as
much as I could about it.

02:01:56.130 --> 02:01:58.480
And there were three really good

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:03.040
randomized placebo crossover
trials with tart cherries.

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.080
And what they found was that in one study,

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.090
it reduced the amount of time

02:02:09.090 --> 02:02:12.870
that you spent awake at
night by over an hour.

02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:14.570
And then the other two studies,

02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:17.720
one of them found that it
increased the amount of sleep

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.900
that you've got by 34 minutes.

02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:22.310
The other it increased the
amount of sleep that you got

02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:24.910
by 84 minutes.

02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:26.417
Which you know, these are,

02:02:26.417 --> 02:02:30.390
and what's striking is that
they were independent studies,

02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:33.050
I think, meaning that they
were from independent groups,

02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:36.130
and these were, you know,
some of these guys, you know,

02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:38.900
and girl, I know pretty
well, and they are really.

02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.440
- You know and trust their work.

02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.623
- Right, I really trust their work too.

02:02:41.623 --> 02:02:43.660
- Were they ingesting actual tart cherries

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:45.330
or they're drinking the
juice or in capsule form?

02:02:45.330 --> 02:02:46.290
- It was juice.

02:02:46.290 --> 02:02:49.550
So they in all three
studies, it was juice.

02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:51.310
Although you can I think as a supplement,

02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:52.590
you can buy it in a capsule,

02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:54.130
and we've got no idea whether that

02:02:54.130 --> 02:02:56.380
changes the benefit or not.

02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:57.740
What was also interesting in

02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:58.930
I think it was that last study

02:02:58.930 --> 02:03:02.370
where they got an increase
in sleep by 84 minutes,

02:03:02.370 --> 02:03:06.480
it also decreased a daytime
napping significantly.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.211
- That's one that I could
certainly make use of.

02:03:08.211 --> 02:03:09.994
I love my day time naps,

02:03:09.994 --> 02:03:11.530
but I'd love to skip them too.

02:03:11.530 --> 02:03:13.080
- Right and we can speak about naps

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:16.010
and sort of the upside
and downside of that.

02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:18.690
Which then made me think
well, if that's the case,

02:03:18.690 --> 02:03:21.720
may be the net net
benefit on sleep overall,

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:23.430
is no different.

02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:24.820
It's just that it decreases

02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:27.049
the amount of time that some people

02:03:27.049 --> 02:03:28.010
were taking to sleep during the day,

02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:29.650
and giving it back to the night.

02:03:29.650 --> 02:03:30.483
But that wasn't the case,

02:03:30.483 --> 02:03:33.568
'cause if you added the
total amount of sleep

02:03:33.568 --> 02:03:34.640
that they were getting
without tart cherries,

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:37.230
both naps and nightly sleep combined,

02:03:37.230 --> 02:03:39.400
still, when you took tart cherries,

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:42.200
you still got a net some benefit,

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.033
of total amount of sleep.

02:03:43.033 --> 02:03:45.526
So you know, so far,

02:03:45.526 --> 02:03:48.430
when it comes to supplements,

02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:51.900
and those types of studies,
they're good studies,

02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:53.450
and the data looks interesting.

02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:55.860
But as a drug itself, you know,

02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:57.630
if this was clinical drug, you know,

02:03:57.630 --> 02:04:00.500
three studies that are
somewhat small in nature

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.050
and have some positive benefit

02:04:02.050 --> 02:04:04.490
that's what we would call preliminary data

02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:09.111
of maybe a chin scratching
kind so keep this in context.

02:04:09.111 --> 02:04:10.140
- Yeah, and depending on
the margins for safety,

02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:11.013
one might think,

02:04:12.351 --> 02:04:14.108
well, given that it's a tart cherry

02:04:14.108 --> 02:04:15.160
as opposed to some pharmaceutical

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.210
you need a prescription for

02:04:16.210 --> 02:04:18.880
then, you know, some
people their threshold

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:21.110
to experiment with
supplements is quite low,

02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:23.140
some people their threshold is quite high.

02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.920
I feel like you know,
there are two categories,

02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:28.000
or at least two categories
of folks out there.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.017
People who hear oh, tart
cherry can improve sleep,

02:04:31.017 --> 02:04:32.710
and we'll run out and try it.

02:04:32.710 --> 02:04:35.190
And people who hear
well, that sounds crazy.

02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:36.263
Why would I do that?

02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:39.040
But of course, we have to remind people

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:41.870
that tart cherry isn't really
what we're talking about,

02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:43.680
presumably if this is a real effect,

02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:45.350
and sounds like it might be

02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:47.871
that there's a compound in tart cherries.

02:04:47.871 --> 02:04:49.180
- That's right.
- That if we were to call it,

02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:52.130
whatever, whatever five
alpha six, you know,

02:04:52.130 --> 02:04:55.610
some molecule, if we refer
to it by its technical name,

02:04:55.610 --> 02:04:56.820
then people would say,

02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:59.300
oh, that sounds like a very
interesting technical way

02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:00.133
to approaches sleep

02:05:00.133 --> 02:05:01.270
but doesn't sound very natural.

02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:04.149
So both groups are a little bit misguided

02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:05.900
in the sense that people who think that

02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:08.040
everything that comes from
naturally occurring foods,

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:09.860
plants, etcetera, things
that grow out of the ground,

02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:12.230
that that's all safe, that's not true.

02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:15.080
And people that think that pharmaceuticals

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:18.820
are the if it's not evidence
with the purified molecule,

02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:20.730
then something's not of utility.

02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:21.740
Well, that's certainly not true.

02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.630
somewhere in the middle,
I think lies the answer,

02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:25.370
which is, it sounds to me like

02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:29.740
tart cherry is at least an
intriguing potential sleep aid.

02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:31.680
Intriguing potential sleep aid

02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:33.650
and underscoring potential.

02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:35.360
I'm certainly intrigued by it

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.330
to the point where I
might experiment a bit,

02:05:37.330 --> 02:05:39.830
but I'm an experimenter for myself.

02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:42.183
Before I ask you about kiwi,

02:05:43.130 --> 02:05:44.890
I've had quite good results

02:05:44.890 --> 02:05:46.590
from taking something called apigenin,

02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:48.570
which is a derivative of chamomile.

02:05:48.570 --> 02:05:51.560
But in supplement form, I
think I take 50 milligrams

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:53.620
about 30 minutes before sleep.

02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:58.620
And I subjectively experience
a better night's sleep,

02:05:59.030 --> 02:06:00.503
so to speak.

02:06:00.503 --> 02:06:02.070
I don't measure I confess,
I don't measure my sleep.

02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:03.653
I'm not a sleep tracker guy.

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:08.140
But, you know, there are
a few papers out there

02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:09.860
they're not what we would call blue

02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:11.980
published in Blue Ribbon journals,

02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:13.960
but they have control groups,

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:15.450
and it looks somewhat interesting.

02:06:15.450 --> 02:06:18.120
And there when I say apigenin

02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:20.740
people get somewhat
intrigued oh this molecule.

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:24.380
Chamomile has long been
thought to be a sedative,

02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:26.290
a mild sedative, but a sedative?

02:06:26.290 --> 02:06:27.480
Do you drink chamomile tea?

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:28.830
Do you take apigenin?

02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:30.020
What are your thoughts on apigenin?

02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:31.440
- Yeah, I don't.

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:33.570
And I have looked into some of the data

02:06:33.570 --> 02:06:35.400
regarding sleep as well.

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.050
Right now from best I can tell

02:06:37.050 --> 02:06:39.170
it's mostly subjective data

02:06:39.170 --> 02:06:42.330
rather than objective hard
sort of sleep measures.

02:06:42.330 --> 02:06:44.953
And that's why right now I you know,

02:06:44.953 --> 02:06:49.660
it's sort of unclear not no
comment, but just unclear,

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:50.930
not dismissing it,

02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:53.300
because I think you and I both ascribe

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.270
to the idea of absence of evidence

02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:57.050
is not evidence of absence.

02:06:57.050 --> 02:07:00.363
So keep your mind open, at
least I tell that to myself.

02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:04.340
I think if you're finding a benefit,

02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:06.740
and you can do what I would think of

02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:08.540
if I was personally experimenting,

02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:11.310
which is both the positive and negative

02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:13.710
parts of the experiment, what
I mean by that is, you know,

02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:15.940
let's say that I now want to, you know,

02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:18.740
think about some kind of sleep supplement,

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:21.910
I will take some kind of
baseline set of recordings

02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:26.560
for a month, and I will
just gauge where I'm at,

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:28.280
sort of supplement free.

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:31.432
Then I'll go on for a month or two,

02:07:31.432 --> 02:07:32.437
whatever I'm thinking of taking,

02:07:32.437 --> 02:07:34.110
and I don't, you know, supplement.

02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:37.520
But let's say that I want to
and I experiment with that.

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:39.980
And I feel as though based on my metrics

02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:41.900
be them objective from my aura ring

02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:44.510
or be them subjective from
whatever I'm, you know,

02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:45.670
writing down in the morning,

02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:47.510
and both are important and valid,

02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:50.783
subjective and objective, we
like both in the sleep world.

02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:53.208
And I think,

02:07:53.208 --> 02:07:54.930
okay, look, it's clearly that it seems

02:07:54.930 --> 02:07:57.030
to have some kind of an effect.

02:07:57.030 --> 02:08:00.370
The key thing, however, is then
do the negative experiment,

02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:04.480
which is now come off it
for another month, and see,

02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.340
do things get worse.

02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:09.300
And if I can see that by directionality,

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.660
then I'm starting to think

02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:14.140
maybe I'm believing
this a little bit more.

02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:15.800
So that's the way I would sort of

02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:19.240
typically approach you know,
a supplementation regiment

02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:20.290
if I were to do it.

02:08:20.290 --> 02:08:23.070
And that's just me, that's just
the way my mind works, but.

02:08:23.070 --> 02:08:24.528
- No, that's great.

02:08:24.528 --> 02:08:26.280
I think it's very scientific and organized

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:28.260
in a way that allows you

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:29.640
and would allow other people

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:32.960
to make very informed
decisions for themselves.

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:33.793
I like that.

02:08:33.793 --> 02:08:37.780
I like to think in terms of manipulating

02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:39.720
any aspect of our biology,

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:43.940
that behavioral tools always
are the first line of entry,

02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:46.730
then nutrition, everyone
has to eat sooner or later,

02:08:46.730 --> 02:08:48.340
even if you're fasting,

02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:50.720
then perhaps supplementation,

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:52.300
then prescription drugs,

02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.370
and then perhaps brain machine interface,

02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:56.590
devices that you use to induce something.

02:08:56.590 --> 02:08:57.980
And those can be done in combination.

02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:01.310
But what concerns me is
when I hear people say,

02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:03.220
well, what should I take

02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:04.620
without thinking about their behavior,

02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:06.180
their light viewing behavior, etcetera.

02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.460
But of course, these
things work in combination.

02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.210
- And I think it's, you're right,

02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:12.350
that there's many when it comes to sleep,

02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:14.880
there are many low hanging fruits

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:18.750
that don't necessarily
require you to, you know,

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:21.220
put sort of exogenous molecules

02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:23.650
in other words things like
supplements into your body

02:09:23.650 --> 02:09:26.540
or, you know, use different types of drugs

02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:28.110
to help you get there.

02:09:28.110 --> 02:09:31.420
Now, when it comes to
prescription sleep aids,

02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:34.900
I think I've been again a
little bit too forthright.

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:38.167
We know in clinical practice
that there may be a time

02:09:38.167 --> 02:09:40.640
and a place for things
like sleeping pills,

02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:43.400
they are a short term solution

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.280
to certain forms of insomnia,

02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:49.710
but they are not recommended
for the long term.

02:09:49.710 --> 02:09:51.470
And we also know that there
are lots of other ways

02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:55.380
that you can get a sleep help

02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.070
or you can get a sleep curative profile

02:09:58.070 --> 02:10:00.770
from things like cognitive
behavioral therapy for insomnia,

02:10:00.770 --> 02:10:02.770
which is a non drug
approach, psychological.

02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:04.300
- And quite effective from
what I understand, good data.

02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:07.180
- Just as effective as
sleeping pills, great data

02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:08.730
more effective in the long term.

02:10:08.730 --> 02:10:10.550
There's a recent study published that

02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:11.930
after working with a therapist,

02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:15.530
some of the benefits lasted
almost a decade, you know,

02:10:15.530 --> 02:10:17.440
now, if you stop sleeping pills,

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.740
usually you have rebound insomnia,

02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:21.130
where your sleep goes back to being

02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:23.220
just as bad if not worse.

02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.430
And I think the same is true,

02:10:24.430 --> 02:10:25.840
when we think about supplementation,

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.580
there are so many things

02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:31.260
that are easy to implement
when it comes to sleep,

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:34.390
that don't require venturing
out into those waters.

02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:36.900
And again, we're not here to tell anyone

02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:38.470
about whether they should venture or not,

02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:40.080
that's completely your choice.

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.170
All I'm saying is that if
you want to think about

02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:45.090
optimizing your sleep,
there are a number of ways

02:10:45.090 --> 02:10:47.380
that you can do it that don't necessarily

02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:50.420
require you to swallow
anything or inject anything

02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:52.960
or you know, smoking or
anything, or free base.

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:56.310
- And of which the margins of
safety are quite quite wide.

02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:57.143
That's the other one.

02:10:57.143 --> 02:10:57.976
- Yes, right thank you.

02:10:57.976 --> 02:10:59.080
So speaking of low hanging fruit,

02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:01.130
I don't know how it hangs in reality,

02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:02.650
but what about kiwi?

02:11:02.650 --> 02:11:04.300
They're delicious to me anyway.

02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:06.040
- Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit

02:11:07.230 --> 02:11:09.450
named not shouldn't be mistaken

02:11:09.450 --> 02:11:13.440
for the flightless bird of New Zealand,

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:14.830
which is the native bird there.

02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:16.740
We're talking about the
kiwi the fruit here,

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:21.740
which those trees and shrubs
are mostly South East Asia.

02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:26.580
Kiwi fruits have been previously touted

02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:28.900
as potentially having a sleep benefit,

02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:32.309
which again got me curious
and I at first threw it out.

02:11:32.309 --> 02:11:35.260
To my knowledge, there's really only one

02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:38.310
published human study that's of any value.

02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:40.620
But what they did find was that

02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.280
it decreased the speed of time

02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:43.810
with which it took you to fall asleep.

02:11:43.810 --> 02:11:45.530
- These are you ingesting the whole kiwi.

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.459
So it's ingesting the whole kiwi.

02:11:47.459 --> 02:11:48.490
- With the skin, I eat the skin,

02:11:48.490 --> 02:11:49.880
people cringe when they see
me, or don't eat the skin?

02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.730
- Well, I think, no, no, no,

02:11:51.730 --> 02:11:53.750
I think the idea is some of the good stuff

02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:56.420
and I'll come on to this may
actually be in the skin itself.

02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.018
- Oh wonderful, thank you.

02:11:58.018 --> 02:12:00.060
You just helped me win a bet.

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:01.508
I'll give you your cut.

02:12:01.508 --> 02:12:02.450
- Okay, okay, yeah, you can pay me later.

02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:03.427
By the way this skin is use?

02:12:03.427 --> 02:12:04.323
No, no, no.

02:12:05.173 --> 02:12:06.006
He just told me to say that's how he wins,

02:12:06.006 --> 02:12:06.839
no, he did not.

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:10.040
So the skin seems to be part of this

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.190
potential sleep equation.

02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:16.216
And that study, you fell asleep faster

02:12:16.216 --> 02:12:19.040
and you stayed asleep for longer

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.610
and you spent less time
awake throughout the night.

02:12:21.610 --> 02:12:22.840
And I just thought,

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:24.360
well, you know, that's one study,

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:26.370
what can you really do with that?

02:12:26.370 --> 02:12:29.980
There was another study,
however, in an animal model,

02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:33.430
which is, you know, a
little bit more interesting.

02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:36.660
And once again, they found
a very similar phenotype

02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:39.180
that the rats, sorry they were mice,

02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:41.520
the mice fell asleep faster.

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.900
And they also spent longer time in sleep.

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:46.870
The sleep duration also increased.

02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:49.320
What was also interesting mechanistically

02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.130
and this is not the mechanism

02:12:51.130 --> 02:12:56.130
that I think ties together
tart cherries, kiwi fruit,

02:12:56.178 --> 02:12:58.760
and you know things like melatonin,

02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:02.290
because I think there could be
one common binding mechanism.

02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:03.840
What they found in the animal study

02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.380
is that they could block
those kiwifruit sleep benefits

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:11.420
using a GABA blocking agent.

02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:16.420
Now GABA which stands for
Gamma Amino Butyric Acid

02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:19.610
is one of the major
inhibitory neurotransmitters

02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:20.443
of the brain.

02:13:21.297 --> 02:13:22.295
It's kind of like the red.

02:13:22.295 --> 02:13:24.536
- So a naturally occurring
sedative, sort of?

02:13:24.536 --> 02:13:25.837
- Yeah, it's the kind of the red light

02:13:25.837 --> 02:13:27.410
on the traffic light signal, you know,

02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:29.139
others are green light.

02:13:29.139 --> 02:13:32.070
GABA is red light.

02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.850
So by playing around with
some sort of clever drugs

02:13:35.850 --> 02:13:37.380
to manipulate the system,

02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:40.240
they could prevent the
benefit of the kiwi fruit

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:43.380
by sort of buggering around
with the GABA receptor,

02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:48.250
meaning that perhaps part of
the kiwi fruit benefit on sleep

02:13:48.250 --> 02:13:51.450
was mediated by the brain's natural

02:13:52.997 --> 02:13:55.200
inhibitory neurotransmitter
system called the GABA system.

02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.033
- That's exciting.
- And I thought

02:13:56.033 --> 02:13:57.060
that that was kind of,

02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:58.560
that convinced me a little bit more

02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:02.150
that maybe there's
something here to read into.

02:14:02.150 --> 02:14:06.180
So to be determined,
again, here is the banner,

02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:08.540
but you know, tart
cherries and kiwi fruits

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:10.450
the data surprised me,

02:14:10.450 --> 02:14:15.450
because in part I was so
preoccupied with being you know,

02:14:16.802 --> 02:14:19.497
I don't know a bit pure-ish about

02:14:19.497 --> 02:14:21.850
and a bit snobby thinking come on,

02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:23.250
that's definitely not going to work,

02:14:23.250 --> 02:14:25.346
well the data certainly found out.

02:14:25.346 --> 02:14:26.350
[cross talking]

02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:27.349
- I look forward to a day

02:14:27.349 --> 02:14:28.340
when supplements are no
longer called supplements,

02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:29.260
because at the end of the day,

02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:30.990
whether or not something has an effect,

02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:32.330
whether or not it's a whole kiwi fruit

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:33.890
or a derivative of kiwi fruit

02:14:33.890 --> 02:14:35.540
will depend on the molecular compound.

02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:38.700
And as you mentioned,
this potential mechanism

02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:40.233
via the GABA system,

02:14:41.223 --> 02:14:44.450
we both as scientists get
excited about mechanism

02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:46.550
'cause when you can trace
a mechanism and a pathway

02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:49.290
it provides a rationale
a grounding for why

02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:51.950
kiwi of all things or
tart cherry of all things

02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:55.063
might help increase total sleep time.

02:14:56.490 --> 02:14:58.390
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

02:14:58.390 --> 02:15:01.700
or ask about tryptophan and serotonin.

02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:05.083
I can anecdotally say,
when I've taken tryptophan,

02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:10.370
the precursor to serotonin,
or serotonin itself,

02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:12.670
I have a horrendous night's sleep.

02:15:12.670 --> 02:15:14.690
I fall asleep very easily.

02:15:14.690 --> 02:15:19.560
And I experience
ridiculously vivid dreams.

02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.270
Neither pleasant nor unpleasant
is kind of a mishmash.

02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:23.490
And then I wake up

02:15:23.490 --> 02:15:27.020
and I experience several days of insomnia.

02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:29.610
That and I've done the positive control

02:15:29.610 --> 02:15:30.450
and the negative control

02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:32.855
and all the variations
there of to confirm that,

02:15:32.855 --> 02:15:37.797
at least for me supplementing
with serotonergic agents

02:15:37.797 --> 02:15:40.590
is a bad idea for me.

02:15:40.590 --> 02:15:44.720
And tryptophan is a
common sleep supplement

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.683
and sleep aid that's discussed.

02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:50.840
The normal architecture of sleep involves

02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:52.120
the release of serotonin,

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.080
but in a very timed and regulated way.

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:56.620
What are your thoughts
about serotonin in sleep?

02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:59.170
If you had to kind of
put that into a nutshell.

02:15:59.170 --> 02:16:03.450
And then why supplementing with serotonin

02:16:03.450 --> 02:16:06.020
and or its precursor, tryptophan

02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:08.683
might be a good or a
bad idea for somebody.

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.670
- I think one of the potential dangers

02:16:13.670 --> 02:16:18.260
is that based on what's
going on in your body,

02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:20.430
that can change the absorption

02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:24.200
of natural sort of tryptophan
and serotonin uptake

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:26.230
within the brain itself.

02:16:26.230 --> 02:16:28.520
So I'm always thoughtful

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:29.670
when you're playing around

02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:32.860
with that mother nature
dynamic as it were.

02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:35.860
The data as you described is
a little bit all over the map.

02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:37.770
Some people say that it knocks them out

02:16:37.770 --> 02:16:39.800
other people say just like you do,

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:42.330
it has a terrible impact on my sleep.

02:16:42.330 --> 02:16:46.480
And when I stop, it's pretty
bad for a couple of days,

02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:49.623
it seems to have this
lingering after effect.

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:54.600
I think what could be happening here is

02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:57.310
we need serotonin to
just as you described,

02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:59.580
to be modulated in very specific ways

02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:01.260
during the different stages of sleep.

02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:05.910
If you look at the firing
of the brain epicenters

02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:08.450
where serotonin is released,

02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:10.593
and there's a bunch of
them in the brainstem,

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:15.270
what you find, and the
release of serotonin too,

02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:18.230
when we're awake, it's usually
in high concentrations,

02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:21.930
as we start to drift off
to sleep, it lowers some,

02:17:21.930 --> 02:17:23.860
but not necessarily dramatically

02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:26.560
as we're going into non REM sleep.

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.780
But then when we go into REM sleep

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:32.320
serotonin is shut off.

02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:35.580
The other, one of the other
neuromodulators noradrenalin

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:37.400
also shut off.

02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:41.360
REM sleep is the only time
during the 24 hour period,

02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:43.990
where we see noradrenaline and serotonin

02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:46.840
or norepinephrine, completely shut down.

02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:49.670
When I say serotonin,
we're also talking 5-HTP,

02:17:49.670 --> 02:17:52.680
sorry, 5-HT, that's just
its chemical name here.

02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:56.827
So whether it was speaking
about serotonin or 5-HT

02:17:56.827 --> 02:17:57.831
is the same thing.

02:17:57.831 --> 02:17:58.664
Norepinephrine, noradrenaline,

02:17:58.664 --> 02:18:00.880
both of those need to be shut down

02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:03.220
for you to produce REM sleep.

02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.500
The other, one of the
other neuromodulators,

02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:09.723
that then ramps up to produce
REM sleep is acetylcholine.

02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:13.380
So these three neuromodulators

02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:17.910
have this incredible
reciprocal dance that they have

02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:19.753
for you to generate what is called

02:18:19.753 --> 02:18:22.410
a natural architecture of
sleep throughout the night.

02:18:22.410 --> 02:18:23.450
- It's the push pull again.

02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:25.220
- It's a push pull again, you know,

02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:27.780
it's you know, it's just and back.

02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:30.080
It's, you know, whatever
you want to think of.

02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:34.230
That's why I think if
you're trying to increase

02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:37.850
dramatically drive up your
serotonin levels at night,

02:18:37.850 --> 02:18:39.500
and that sustains throughout the night,

02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:41.410
when you're trying to get into REM sleep,

02:18:41.410 --> 02:18:43.640
you could be artificially
fragmenting REM sleep.

02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:44.730
Now, I don't know the data,

02:18:44.730 --> 02:18:47.348
I don't think anyone's
really got the data.

02:18:47.348 --> 02:18:48.233
- No, I haven been able to find it.

02:18:48.233 --> 02:18:49.303
- But that's why I would be,

02:18:50.171 --> 02:18:52.880
you know if you were to
say, Matt, two years time,

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:55.940
that's the data helped me
understand the potential mechanism

02:18:55.940 --> 02:18:57.530
or let's design some experiments,

02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:58.890
where would you go first?

02:18:58.890 --> 02:19:01.940
I would say let's look at
the disruption of REM sleep,

02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:04.550
non REM sleep, reciprocal regulation,

02:19:04.550 --> 02:19:07.930
because, you know, you need
serotonin to be, you know,

02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:11.231
up at one time down at another, so.

02:19:11.231 --> 02:19:13.510
- I agree with everything you said.

02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:16.410
And I'm personally never taking

02:19:16.410 --> 02:19:17.900
tryptophan or serotonin again,

02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:20.350
unless there's some
clinical reason for that

02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:21.920
that I would need to do that.

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:26.490
I want to ask about some
other pro sleep behaviors.

02:19:26.490 --> 02:19:30.310
But before I do that,
let's talk about naps.

02:19:30.310 --> 02:19:31.550
I love naps.

02:19:31.550 --> 02:19:34.770
I come from a long history of nappers.

02:19:34.770 --> 02:19:37.000
My dad always took a nap in the afternoon,

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.810
I take a 20 or 30 minute nap

02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:42.680
or I do a practice which I
took the liberty of coining

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:45.074
NSDR, non sleep deep rest,

02:19:45.074 --> 02:19:47.010
some sort of just passive laying out their

02:19:47.010 --> 02:19:48.180
feet up elevated.

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:50.630
Sometimes people do you
or I'll do yoga Nidra,

02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:53.154
I'll do hypnosis or
something of that sort,

02:19:53.154 --> 02:19:56.080
but 20 or 30 minutes of that

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:58.950
has been very beneficial
for me to get up from that

02:19:58.950 --> 02:20:03.150
nap or period of minimal
wakefulness, we'll call it

02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:04.990
and go about my day quite well,

02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:07.100
and also fall asleep just fine.

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:10.460
What are the data on naps?

02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:11.810
Do you nap?

02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:15.540
And what are your thoughts
about keeping naps short

02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:18.580
meaning 20 to 30 minutes
versus getting out

02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:20.600
past 90 minutes, two hours?

02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:25.090
So for you personally
naps, yay, nay or meh?

02:20:25.090 --> 02:20:27.420
- I don't nap.

02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:31.060
And I've just never
been a habitual napper.

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.540
- Is that because you don't feel sleepy

02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:34.470
in the afternoon, or because?

02:20:34.470 --> 02:20:35.734
- I typically don't feel sleepy?

02:20:35.734 --> 02:20:36.567
- So you're just hardier then.

02:20:36.567 --> 02:20:38.090
- I am, I wouldn't say hardier,

02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:43.090
I may be less capable of
falling asleep, my sleep drive.

02:20:45.689 --> 02:20:47.175
- But you're not dragging
through the afternoon?

02:20:47.175 --> 02:20:48.451
- No, no, I don't drag through out the.

02:20:48.451 --> 02:20:50.180
- So you don't nap because
you don't feel a need to nap?

02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:51.150
- That's right, yep.

02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:53.370
Now, it's not that I am immune

02:20:53.370 --> 02:20:56.560
to what we call the
postprandial dip in alertness.

02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:57.830
I definitely feel as though

02:20:57.830 --> 02:21:01.250
there can be this kind of afternoon lull,

02:21:01.250 --> 02:21:04.650
where, you know, I'm
not quite as on as I was

02:21:04.650 --> 02:21:06.160
at 11 o'clock in the morning.

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:07.940
And we know the physiology to that,

02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:10.763
which brings us back to whether
we were designed to nap.

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:15.180
So for naps, we've done
lots of different studies

02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.230
and other colleagues have
done these studies too.

02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:19.610
Naps can have some really great benefits,

02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:22.230
we found benefits for
cardiovascular health,

02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:23.760
blood pressure, for example,

02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:26.070
we found benefits for levels of cortisol,

02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:28.410
we found benefits for learning and memory,

02:21:28.410 --> 02:21:30.940
and also emotional regulation.

02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.490
- How long are the naps,
typically, in those studies?

02:21:33.490 --> 02:21:36.280
- Anywhere between 20
minutes to 90 minutes.

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:38.730
Sometimes we like to
use a 90 minute window

02:21:38.730 --> 02:21:42.060
so that the participant can
have a full cycle of sleep,

02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:44.600
and therefore they get
both non REM and REM sleep

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:45.740
within that time period.

02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:47.200
Then when we wake them up,

02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:48.890
we usually wait a period of time

02:21:48.890 --> 02:21:51.250
to get them past what
we call sleep inertia,

02:21:51.250 --> 02:21:53.110
which is that kind of window of grogginess

02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:55.810
where you say to you,
better half look, you know,

02:21:55.810 --> 02:21:57.400
darling, please don't

02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:59.100
speak to me for the first hour after I've.

02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:00.270
- Don't anything right now.

02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:02.040
- After the first hour
of waking up, you know,

02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:04.768
I'm not just, I'm just not
the best version of myself.

02:22:04.768 --> 02:22:06.780
So we wait for that time period,

02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:08.520
and then we do some testing.

02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:10.240
And we've done some
testing before and after,

02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.400
and we look at the change.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:13.557
And that's how we measure
what was the benefit of naps

02:22:13.557 --> 02:22:15.850
and the reason why we
sometimes do 90 minutes

02:22:15.850 --> 02:22:17.840
so that they get all of
those stages of sleep.

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:19.370
And then we correlate,

02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:22.230
how much benefit did you get from the nap,

02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:25.040
and how much of that
benefit was explained by

02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:27.700
what REM sleep you got,
what deep sleep you got,

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:29.130
what light sleep you got?

02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:30.910
So that's the only reason that we use that

02:22:30.910 --> 02:22:32.834
as an experimental tool.

02:22:32.834 --> 02:22:34.840
What we've also found is that

02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:37.810
naps of as little as 17 minutes

02:22:37.810 --> 02:22:41.820
can have some quite potent
effects on for example, learning.

02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.540
None of this is novel,

02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:47.050
NASA pioneered this back in the 1990s.

02:22:47.050 --> 02:22:48.430
And during the missions,

02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:51.300
they were experimenting with
naps for their astronauts.

02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:55.510
And what they found was that
naps of little as 26 minutes,

02:22:55.510 --> 02:23:00.510
improved mission performance by 34%,

02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:04.460
and improved daytime alertness by 50%.

02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:06.850
And it birthed what was then called

02:23:06.850 --> 02:23:08.810
the NASA nap culture

02:23:08.810 --> 02:23:12.530
throughout all terrestrial NASA staff

02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:13.730
during that time period.

02:23:13.730 --> 02:23:17.020
So it's long been known that
naps can have a benefit.

02:23:17.020 --> 02:23:19.290
Naps, however, can have
a double edged sword

02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:22.140
there is a dark side to naps.

02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:24.760
And it comes back to
our story of adenosine

02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:26.100
and sleep pressure.

02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:27.250
The longer we're awake,

02:23:27.250 --> 02:23:30.020
the more of that sleep pressure
adenosine that we build up.

02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:32.770
But what I didn't tell
you is that when we sleep,

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.480
the brain gets the chance

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:38.640
to essentially clear out that adenosine.

02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:41.570
And after about 16 hours of wakefulness,

02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:43.840
and then after about eight hours of sleep,

02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:46.520
eight hours of sleep seems to be able to

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:49.580
allow the brain to decrease
its adenosine levels

02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:50.900
back to normal.

02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:53.450
And so naturally, we
should start to wake up

02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:55.520
which also aligns with
your circadian rhythm.

02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:57.650
And those are two separate processes.

02:23:57.650 --> 02:24:00.710
But with about eight hours
of good quality sleep

02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:03.210
seven to nine hours for the average adult,

02:24:03.210 --> 02:24:06.210
we are free of all of that adenosine.

02:24:06.210 --> 02:24:09.010
We've evacuated it
essentially out of the brain,

02:24:09.010 --> 02:24:12.010
and we wake up naturally
feeling refreshed.

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:14.780
The reason that naps can
be potentially dangerous

02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:16.720
is that when you nap,

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:20.970
you are essentially opening the
valve on the pressure cooker

02:24:20.970 --> 02:24:22.600
of sleep pressure.

02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:27.540
And some of that sleepiness
is lost by way of the nap.

02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:30.109
So for some people and not all people

02:24:30.109 --> 02:24:32.340
and you're a great example of this.

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:34.940
Some people, however,
if they are struggling

02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:37.870
with sleep at night, and
they nap during the day,

02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:40.410
it makes their sleep problems even worse.

02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:41.820
So for people with insomnia,

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:44.880
we typically advise against napping.

02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.680
And the advice is if
you can nap regularly,

02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.130
and you don't struggle
with sleep at night,

02:24:50.130 --> 02:24:51.810
then naps are just fine.

02:24:51.810 --> 02:24:55.020
But if you do struggle with
sleep, stay away from naps.

02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:56.690
If you are going to nap,

02:24:56.690 --> 02:25:00.050
try to limit your naps,
try to cut them off a bit

02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:02.530
like sort of caffeine, maybe you know,

02:25:02.530 --> 02:25:06.150
eight to 12 hours maybe
not that you know far off

02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:09.810
maybe sort of seven to six
hours is a good rule of thumb.

02:25:09.810 --> 02:25:12.650
Try not to nap essentially
late in the afternoon.

02:25:12.650 --> 02:25:14.546
And if you do take a nap

02:25:14.546 --> 02:25:17.340
and you want to maintain your

02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:19.690
you don't want to have
that grogginess hangover

02:25:19.690 --> 02:25:21.410
that can happen after
a full night of sleep

02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:22.600
for the first hour,

02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:26.100
try to limit it to about 20, 25 minutes.

02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:27.640
And that way you don't go down

02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:30.030
into the very deepest stages of sleep,

02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:33.210
which if I wrench you
out of with an alarm,

02:25:33.210 --> 02:25:36.230
then you just kind of feel
you almost feel worse,

02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:37.940
for the first hour after the nap.

02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:40.130
- I've definitely experienced
that if I oversleep.

02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:43.130
Certainly if the sun
goes down during my nap

02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:45.060
and I wake up and light overall

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:47.090
lighting conditions have changed,

02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:50.850
I find it very hard to jolt
myself back into the evening.

02:25:50.850 --> 02:25:52.440
And it can screw me up.

02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:54.650
So I try and keep those naps pretty brief.

02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:55.833
And I should say,

02:25:55.833 --> 02:25:59.730
I'm very happy to hear you
mention individual differences

02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:01.480
and why some people might want to nap

02:26:02.627 --> 02:26:04.326
and other people might not want to nap,

02:26:04.326 --> 02:26:06.240
I have a colleague Liqun Luo

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:08.527
he'll be familiar to many neurobiologist.

02:26:08.527 --> 02:26:09.527
- Yeah of course.

02:26:09.527 --> 02:26:10.587
- Who's a absolutely
spectacular scientist,

02:26:10.587 --> 02:26:12.130
member of the National Academy,

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:14.540
Howard Hughes investigator just a phenom,

02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:16.100
and has a ton of energy.

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:18.550
But years ago, I learned

02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:21.080
that he always takes a
nap in the afternoon,

02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:23.366
so much so that when he travels

02:26:23.366 --> 02:26:24.450
to give seminars at other universities,

02:26:24.450 --> 02:26:27.297
he will tell his post lunch host

02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:31.520
whoever it is that he's
supposed to meet with,

02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:34.360
may I have your office
for 30 minutes of our,

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.203
sometimes 30 minute discussion
or 60 minute discussion,

02:26:38.203 --> 02:26:39.036
because I like to take a nap.

02:26:39.036 --> 02:26:39.869
And he does that

02:26:39.869 --> 02:26:40.890
and then gives us his,

02:26:41.758 --> 02:26:42.591
his talks are typically in the afternoon

02:26:42.591 --> 02:26:43.860
in academic culture.

02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:48.860
And he describes the
effect of the nap for him

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:50.240
this short naps in the afternoon

02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:52.210
being so profound for his productivity.

02:26:52.210 --> 02:26:54.267
That's actually what inspired me

02:26:54.267 --> 02:26:56.260
to start feeling okay
about my desire to nap.

02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:57.610
And so I think for me,

02:26:57.610 --> 02:27:00.850
that was great vindication for
those that might feel guilty

02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:02.170
about wanting a nap.

02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:04.863
But I take to heart your note about

02:27:04.863 --> 02:27:07.600
avoiding naps if you have trouble falling

02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:08.433
and staying asleep,

02:27:08.433 --> 02:27:10.430
'cause I think that I have family members

02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:13.390
who also if they nap, they're
a wreck, they can't sleep.

02:27:13.390 --> 02:27:14.970
- Yeah, I think it's just,

02:27:14.970 --> 02:27:17.830
we've often been very pro sleep

02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:19.340
with sort of the sleep community.

02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.200
So I think it's good to always point out

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:25.326
these potential dark sides of any aspect.

02:27:25.326 --> 02:27:26.810
But you're absolutely right,

02:27:26.810 --> 02:27:29.180
no one should feel guilty
about getting the sleep

02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:30.740
that they need.

02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:33.750
And I think that's been one
of the big problems in society

02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:36.950
society has stigmatized
sleep with these labels

02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:38.762
of being slothful or lazy.

02:27:38.762 --> 02:27:40.920
And we're almost embarrassed, you know,

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:43.980
to tell colleagues that we take a nap.

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:48.380
I think sleep is a write of human beings.

02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:51.990
And I therefore think that
sleep is a civil right

02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:53.700
of all human beings.

02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:56.350
And no one should make you feel unproud

02:27:56.350 --> 02:27:58.100
of getting the sleep that you need.

02:27:58.957 --> 02:28:00.063
- No, I love that.

02:28:00.063 --> 02:28:01.485
And I it's an important point.

02:28:01.485 --> 02:28:04.110
I also feel that one of the best ways

02:28:05.903 --> 02:28:08.540
to beat your competition in any
endeavor is to outlive them.

02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:12.400
So now that we know that
sleep can enhance longevity

02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:14.995
and lack of sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:14.995 --> 02:28:17.903
that's all the
justification I need anyway.

02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:22.140
Can somebody sleep too much?

02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:23.990
Is it possible to get too much sleep?

02:28:25.390 --> 02:28:27.440
- It's a very good question.

02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:30.710
And there are probably two
things to say about it,

02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:33.793
there is a condition
that we call hypersomnia.

02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:36.260
But that's a mixture of things,

02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:37.760
it's where people have either

02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.150
a very high sleep need,

02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:43.160
or they are very sleepy during the day.

02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:44.617
And they're typically falling asleep.

02:28:44.617 --> 02:28:46.620
And these can happen in a variety

02:28:47.513 --> 02:28:48.600
of different clinical contexts.

02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:51.050
One of the places where we've often seen

02:28:51.050 --> 02:28:56.050
hypersomnia believed to
manifest is in depression.

02:28:56.250 --> 02:28:58.620
But if you look at some of those studies,

02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:00.710
it turns out, it looks more as though

02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:04.610
those people are simply
reporting being in bed longer,

02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:08.040
but not necessarily sleeping longer.

02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:10.210
And that fits very well
with one of the profiles

02:29:10.210 --> 02:29:12.130
that we know of depression,

02:29:12.130 --> 02:29:13.380
which is anhedonia,

02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.750
you don't get pleasure from
normally pleasurable things.

02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:17.890
So you just don't want
to go out into the world,

02:29:17.890 --> 02:29:19.810
you don't want to interact
because you're depressed.

02:29:19.810 --> 02:29:20.750
So what do you do?

02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:21.920
You just stay in bed?

02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:24.334
- Blinds closed, watching
TV, on the phone.

02:29:24.334 --> 02:29:25.570
- [Matthew] Right, and that
just looks as though you know,

02:29:25.570 --> 02:29:26.780
- Felling miserable.
- When people say,

02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:28.270
what time did you go to bed?

02:29:28.270 --> 02:29:30.710
And what time did you get out of bed?

02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:32.970
The mistake made in that question is

02:29:32.970 --> 02:29:34.670
okay, that's how much time their sleeping

02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:35.970
when you should have said,

02:29:35.970 --> 02:29:37.197
what time did you fall asleep?

02:29:37.197 --> 02:29:39.040
And what time did you wake up?

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.270
And the answer could be very different.

02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:45.683
So that's hypersomnia
from a clinical context.

02:29:46.890 --> 02:29:49.330
Can you sleep too much though?

02:29:49.330 --> 02:29:52.400
One of the data points that
argues yes, that's possible

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:54.770
is when we look at all cause mortality.

02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:56.480
Certainly what you find is that

02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:59.090
using the sweet spot
of seven to nine hours,

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:01.630
when you start to draw below seven hours,

02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:03.570
there is a relationship, which suggests

02:30:03.570 --> 02:30:04.680
that the shorter your sleep,

02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.690
the shorter your life.

02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:08.800
Short sleep in that regard
predicts all cause mortality.

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:10.780
But it's again, not a linear relationship

02:30:10.780 --> 02:30:13.100
like the one that we've
seen with REM sleep.

02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:15.360
Once you get past nine hours,

02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:18.200
the mortality curve stops going down.

02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:20.670
And then once you get
further 10 or 11 hours,

02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:23.670
it hooks back up again,
it's almost like a J shape,

02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:26.290
tilted over a little bit and reversed.

02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:29.530
So there's this strange
hook, what's going on here?

02:30:29.530 --> 02:30:32.110
Right now, sleep science has at least

02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:35.350
two non mutually exclusive
explanations for this.

02:30:35.350 --> 02:30:38.600
The first is that if you look
at some of those populations,

02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:43.600
the idea is that the whatever
was causing them illness

02:30:43.710 --> 02:30:46.650
and took their lives was just too much

02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:47.980
for sleep to deal with.

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:50.370
However, we know that when we get sick,

02:30:50.370 --> 02:30:51.870
one of the things that we do immediately

02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:54.680
in this whole mechanism
and inflammatory mechanisms

02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.530
cytokine mediated, when we get sick,

02:30:57.530 --> 02:30:58.440
we want to sleep more.

02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:01.793
We just want to curl up in bed
and you know, sleep it off.

02:31:03.647 --> 02:31:04.740
So the argument there is that

02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:07.970
it's not that sleep was
killing people prematurely,

02:31:07.970 --> 02:31:10.950
it was that these people
were calling on this

02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:12.010
the help of sleep,

02:31:12.010 --> 02:31:13.730
they were calling on this thing called

02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:17.120
the Swiss Army Knife of
health, that is sleep.

02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:19.300
But whatever it is that they were facing

02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:23.660
was just too powerful
for sleep to overcome.

02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:25.980
So it artificially looks as though

02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:29.450
more sleep leads to a
higher risk of death,

02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:32.660
when sleep is actually
responding to the mortality risk,

02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:33.790
and it lost the battle.

02:31:33.790 --> 02:31:35.430
That's one argument.

02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:39.230
The second is that we
know that sleep quality

02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:41.670
and poor sleep efficiency

02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:45.260
is a very strong predictor
of all cause mortality.

02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:48.320
And when you look at
people who often report

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:49.760
sleeping longer amounts,

02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:51.310
10 or 11 hours,

02:31:51.310 --> 02:31:54.780
they typically report having
very poor quality sleep.

02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:57.280
So because their quality of sleep is poor,

02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:59.440
they just try to sleep longer

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:01.780
to try and get some of that back.

02:32:01.780 --> 02:32:05.330
So again, here now it's poor quality sleep

02:32:05.330 --> 02:32:08.720
masking as too much sleep

02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:11.350
leading to this artificial hook

02:32:11.350 --> 02:32:12.890
which looks like mortality.

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:14.390
That's the second explanation.

02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:17.090
A third which is more of a Gedanken,

02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:19.460
which is just the kind of
like a thought experiment

02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:21.600
and I have this mentality,

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:24.560
I don't know how many
other people share this.

02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:28.900
I actually think that could
be a thing as too much sleep.

02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:31.410
Physiologically, I think it's possible.

02:32:31.410 --> 02:32:32.570
But the reason I think that

02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:37.130
is because it's no different
than food, water or oxygen.

02:32:37.130 --> 02:32:38.700
Can you overeat?

02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:39.533
Yes, you can.

02:32:39.533 --> 02:32:41.043
Can you under eat?

02:32:41.043 --> 02:32:42.042
Of course.
- Or light.

02:32:42.042 --> 02:32:42.875
light in the early part of the day,

02:32:42.875 --> 02:32:43.708
throughout the day, wonderful.

02:32:43.708 --> 02:32:45.880
Light late in the day and
at night, detrimental.

02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:49.840
- Bi-directional, you know, for
water, can you over hydrate,

02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:52.630
hypernatremia it can lead, you know,

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:56.350
it happened in the 1990s and
2000, with the ecstasy craze,

02:32:56.350 --> 02:32:58.290
where governments were
saying you're dehydrating

02:32:58.290 --> 02:33:00.720
you're dancing all night,
please drink water.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:02.620
And they drunk too much water,

02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:06.140
their blood electrolytes went
you know, all over the place,

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:08.350
and they were having
cardiac arrests or stroke.

02:33:08.350 --> 02:33:09.183
- Yeah people were dying.

02:33:09.183 --> 02:33:12.060
- And they were dying because
of excessive hydration.

02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:15.010
Can you get too much oxygen, hypoxemia?

02:33:15.010 --> 02:33:17.060
And it can cause free radical damage,

02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:21.120
which can be profoundly
harmful and kill brain cells.

02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:23.020
Can you sleep too much?

02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:26.880
You know, which is the fifth
element of the life equation,

02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:30.190
you know, alongside you know, food, water,

02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:33.230
oxygen, you know, so forth.

02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:34.820
I should say I can't even count.

02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:36.223
Clearly I'm sleeping well.

02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:40.740
Yes, I think that could
be that possibility.

02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:44.480
Are most people in danger
of getting too much sleep?

02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:47.620
Or contrary, if you look at the data.

02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:50.020
So but I don't dismiss that idea.

02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:51.653
I think it's possible.

02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:55.000
- That's a very thorough and very nuanced,

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.370
and yet very clear answer.

02:33:56.370 --> 02:33:59.500
So I, it's so interesting to think that

02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:01.900
a lot of the data that's out there

02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:04.260
that talking about being in bed too long

02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:05.790
that it's just trying to compensate

02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:08.640
for the actual fragmentation of sleep.

02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:10.410
So what I'm coming away with

02:34:10.410 --> 02:34:12.220
is that there are many paths to this

02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:14.930
and both positive and things to avoid.

02:34:14.930 --> 02:34:17.640
But the idea is to get most nights,

02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:21.080
a similar amount, probably
seven to nine hours,

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:24.090
somewhere in there, of high quality sleep.

02:34:24.090 --> 02:34:26.699
That this notion of sleep
quality is going to become,

02:34:26.699 --> 02:34:30.700
I would hope, a phrase that
more people think about

02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:33.113
and learn about and
cultivate as a practice.

02:34:34.838 --> 02:34:36.530
I want to ask about a set of behaviors

02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:40.620
that I'm at least I'm aware
of at least one company

02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:43.080
is starting to track in their
sleep monitoring device,

02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:48.080
and that's orgasm, and sex
orgasm and masturbation

02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:53.163
topics that are, you know,
are somewhat sensitive.

02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:57.262
But from the perspective
of biology, right,

02:34:57.262 --> 02:34:59.840
none of us would be here were it not for

02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:01.420
sperm meets egg in some fashion,

02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:03.473
either in a dish or in vivo.

02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:09.380
But what are the data
as you know them to be

02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:12.610
or maybe your lab is even
doing this kind of work

02:35:12.610 --> 02:35:15.240
and exploration about the role

02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:18.930
that sex, orgasm, masturbation play

02:35:18.930 --> 02:35:22.530
in getting to sleep and staying
asleep and sleep quality?

02:35:22.530 --> 02:35:24.110
Certainly those behaviors

02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:25.800
and those physiological events

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:27.950
have been part of our
evolutionary history.

02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:30.410
What's the story there?

02:35:30.410 --> 02:35:33.690
What can we say about
this in terms of science

02:35:33.690 --> 02:35:36.980
and dare I say practice?

02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:40.040
- Yeah, I mean, it's almost
that caricature of you know,

02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:43.070
in the movies where, you
know, a couple makes love

02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:45.880
and then all of a sudden,
you just sort of hear snoring

02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:47.470
or, you know, that happens

02:35:47.470 --> 02:35:50.030
with the idea that it somewhat

02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:52.760
some neurogenic that it's sleep promoting.

02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:55.390
- Well, the post orgasmic
increase in prolactin.

02:35:55.390 --> 02:35:58.361
- Well, that's very, is interesting.

02:35:58.361 --> 02:35:59.600
- Is thought to be a set

02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:00.930
a naturally occurring sedative,

02:36:00.930 --> 02:36:03.160
that presumably has a function in.

02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.000
- And oxytocin has that also

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.340
that benefit where you see, you know,

02:36:07.340 --> 02:36:09.110
a dissipation of the
fight or flight branch

02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:10.622
of the nervous system,

02:36:10.622 --> 02:36:12.150
which has to happen
for you to fall asleep.

02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:15.370
That's why we often see, you
know, here at The Sleep Center,

02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:18.670
we'll see a phenomenon
called wired and tired

02:36:18.670 --> 02:36:22.640
where people say, look,
I am so desperately tired

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:25.110
I just I'm so so tired,

02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:27.770
but I can't fall asleep,
because I'm too wired.

02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:32.410
So your sleep drive, you're
desperately tired, it's there

02:36:32.410 --> 02:36:33.900
but because you're wired,

02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:36.060
because you've got too much
sympathetic activation,

02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.860
too much cortisol as well,

02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:39.090
you can't fall asleep.

02:36:39.090 --> 02:36:44.090
It's an impressive roadblock
to anything like good sleep.

02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:46.680
And it's one of the principal mechanisms

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:50.040
that we now believe stress
and physiological activation,

02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:53.920
that is the underlying cause
of many forms of insomnia.

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.350
But coming back to sex,

02:36:57.350 --> 02:37:00.230
the data is actually quite compelling,

02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:04.040
that both either subjectively
assessed sleep quality,

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:06.570
or objective amount of sleep,

02:37:06.570 --> 02:37:10.370
sex that has resulted in orgasm,

02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:12.500
and I think it's that latter part

02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:14.500
that typically needs to happen.

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:15.790
- I would imagine so.

02:37:15.790 --> 02:37:17.830
- That, you know, so between

02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:20.641
two mutually exclusive individuals,

02:37:20.641 --> 02:37:24.600
where both are, you know, beneficial

02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:26.718
in terms of receiving an orgasm.

02:37:26.718 --> 02:37:27.718
[cross talking]

02:37:27.718 --> 02:37:28.551
- Yeah, I would say any
discussion about sex,

02:37:28.551 --> 02:37:32.053
we were referring to
consensual, age appropriate,

02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:36.619
species appropriate, context appropriate.

02:37:36.619 --> 02:37:38.157
- Wow, I would never have even gone

02:37:38.157 --> 02:37:39.156
to the species appropriate.

02:37:39.156 --> 02:37:40.880
- I put species in there
because it's the internet,

02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:41.870
and people will come up
with all sorts of ideas.

02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:43.670
So I think that age appropriate,

02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:46.407
I think age appropriate,
consensual, context appropriate

02:37:46.407 --> 02:37:48.380
and species appropriate,
covers all the bases,

02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:51.050
but if I missed any, put
them in the comment section,

02:37:51.050 --> 02:37:51.883
and we'll be sure to take note.

02:37:51.883 --> 02:37:54.791
- Yeah, no, I think
that's really well said

02:37:54.791 --> 02:37:56.740
and important to say.

02:37:56.740 --> 02:38:00.820
So the data that is the
when you look at couples

02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:02.193
who have orgasm.

02:38:03.716 --> 02:38:06.790
We've also, however, found
benefits of masturbation,

02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:09.620
and it's not frequently spoken about.

02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:13.010
But what if you do some surveys,

02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:16.660
it turns out that people
will often use masturbation

02:38:16.660 --> 02:38:18.870
as a sleep tool, if they're
struggling with sleep.

02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:20.650
And I know, this sort of sounds almost

02:38:20.650 --> 02:38:23.320
like a strange conversation,
or it's a taboo conversation

02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:26.588
but I think we just need to be
very open about all of this.

02:38:26.588 --> 02:38:27.700
- I started off in science,

02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:30.380
one of the things I worked
on early in my career,

02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:31.650
not the very first topic

02:38:31.650 --> 02:38:35.890
was the topic of early
influences of hormones,

02:38:35.890 --> 02:38:38.740
estrogen and testosterone
on sexual development

02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:40.080
of the brain and body.

02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:43.630
And when you are weaned
in a laboratory like that,

02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:45.210
regardless of what era,

02:38:45.210 --> 02:38:49.470
you look at sex and its
behaviors, and its hormones,

02:38:49.470 --> 02:38:51.470
and its physiologies as a scientist,

02:38:51.470 --> 02:38:53.740
and so that's to be clear
what we're doing here,

02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:58.740
we're exploring these behaviors
from that perspective.

02:38:58.930 --> 02:39:00.830
I mean, one thing is for certain,

02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:03.550
everyone is here because
a sperm met an egg,

02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:06.100
either in a dish or in
vivo, as we said before,

02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:08.610
and at least in 2021,

02:39:08.610 --> 02:39:10.670
there's no way around that fact.

02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:14.610
And what preceded that is
typically this act we call sex

02:39:14.610 --> 02:39:18.480
and sometimes, hopefully, I like to think

02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:21.260
orgasm is associated with
that sexual activity.

02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:23.900
Masturbation is one dimension of that

02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:26.700
is something that I think it
can and should be discussed,

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:29.300
if in fact, there are data
that relate it to sleep.

02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:31.190
- Yeah, and both of those routes

02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:34.630
seem to lead to a sleep benefit.

02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:37.780
Now, I'm not saying that
it's all about the orgasm.

02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:40.750
I think as we spoke about with oxytocin,

02:39:40.750 --> 02:39:43.470
there is some degree of par bonding

02:39:43.470 --> 02:39:45.270
that if you have a partner,

02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:48.820
and you experience you know,
an intimate loving, you know,

02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:51.490
relationship that involves that,

02:39:51.490 --> 02:39:54.120
then you can have hormonal benefits

02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:56.170
that are sleep promoting,

02:39:56.170 --> 02:39:58.420
that may not necessarily be seen

02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:00.450
if you're just engaging you know,

02:40:00.450 --> 02:40:03.870
in the solo singular act of masturbation.

02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:06.307
So what we certainly know

02:40:06.307 --> 02:40:08.840
and I am not someone to take any advice on

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:12.180
when it comes to anything
relationship wise or sex wise.

02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:13.850
- That's a different
episode of the podcast.

02:40:13.850 --> 02:40:15.623
- Yeah, yeah certainly.

02:40:15.623 --> 02:40:16.550
And that's not a podcast series

02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:18.920
that I'm going to be
releasing anytime soon,

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:20.190
it's going to be mostly about sleep.

02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:21.540
Although I will touch on,

02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:23.900
I'll release a podcast on sleep and sex.

02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:27.070
But that's the data that we have so far.

02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:29.420
We also know that it
works both ways, though.

02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:32.620
And it's commonly the same way with sleep.

02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:35.990
You know, sleep and
exercise, sleep and diet.

02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:39.730
How you eat can affect how you sleep,

02:40:39.730 --> 02:40:41.740
how you sleep can affect how you eat.

02:40:41.740 --> 02:40:43.090
Same with exercise.

02:40:43.090 --> 02:40:43.923
And it turns out,

02:40:43.923 --> 02:40:47.210
it's the same way with
sexual behavior, too.

02:40:47.210 --> 02:40:48.710
So here, we're talking about

02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:51.420
whether sex can help with sleep.

02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:54.520
Can sleep help with your
relationship and sex?

02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:56.690
And the answer is, yes, it can.

02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:59.270
Firstly, we know and we've
spoken a little bit about this,

02:40:59.270 --> 02:41:00.870
that the reproductive hormones

02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:02.820
are under profound sleep regulation.

02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:05.030
- Both estrogen and
testosterone, I understand.

02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:06.381
- Estrogen, testosterone, as I said.

02:41:06.381 --> 02:41:07.810
- Cause we hear so often
about testosterone.

02:41:07.810 --> 02:41:10.650
But women who, or I should
say anyone who's interested

02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:12.550
in having higher levels of estrogen

02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:15.040
or normal healthy levels of estrogen

02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.160
I presume the data show for estrogen

02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:21.410
what the data also show,
similarly for testosterone.

02:41:21.410 --> 02:41:24.563
Which is if you get too little
or poor quality of sleep

02:41:24.563 --> 02:41:26.940
both sex steroid hormones,
as they're referred to

02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:28.670
testosterone and estrogen,

02:41:28.670 --> 02:41:30.270
which are present in
both males and females

02:41:30.270 --> 02:41:31.930
and every variation thereof,

02:41:31.930 --> 02:41:33.550
are going to be diminished below

02:41:34.479 --> 02:41:35.481
normal healthy levels, correct?

02:41:35.481 --> 02:41:38.310
- Yes, estrogen,
testosterone, FSH in women,

02:41:38.310 --> 02:41:41.821
a key hormone in the regulation for,

02:41:41.821 --> 02:41:44.980
key for conception, of course,

02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:46.880
all of these sex hormones

02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:50.060
seem to become significantly disrupted

02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:54.730
when sleep becomes of short
quantity, or poor quality.

02:41:54.730 --> 02:41:56.440
We also know that in women,

02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:58.930
sleep disruption can usually lead

02:41:58.930 --> 02:42:01.800
to menstrual cycle disruption.

02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:03.710
We know this, particularly from evidence

02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:04.960
in shift working women

02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:07.510
where they are nighttime shift workers,

02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:09.550
they struggle with sleep during the day,

02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:12.220
often menstruation is disrupted

02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:15.438
or even becomes impaired.

02:42:15.438 --> 02:42:17.270
But we also know it works this way,

02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:22.270
not just for sex hormones,
but for sex itself.

02:42:22.270 --> 02:42:26.990
For example, we found that
for every one hour of sleep,

02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:28.890
extra sleep that a woman gets

02:42:28.890 --> 02:42:32.370
her interest in becoming sexually
intimate with her partner

02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:35.843
increases by 14%, which is, you know,

02:42:35.843 --> 02:42:38.470
a non trivial amount.
- Substantial.

02:42:38.470 --> 02:42:41.630
- And then the final part
of I think this equation

02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:43.660
when it comes to sleep, and sex

02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:47.570
is your relationship itself.

02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:49.910
And there's some great
work here from UC Berkeley

02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:52.590
by Professor Serena Chen.

02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:55.820
And what she found was
that restless nights

02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:59.720
mean for far more brutal
fights in your relationship.

02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:01.810
And they did this.
- And vice versa.

02:43:01.810 --> 02:43:02.810
- A number of different elegant ways,

02:43:02.810 --> 02:43:04.270
and vice versa as well.

02:43:04.270 --> 02:43:06.348
- I mean, not that I've ever
had conflict in relationships.

02:43:06.348 --> 02:43:07.348
[cross talking]

02:43:07.348 --> 02:43:09.420
- You know, just this is data I've read,

02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:11.170
I've never experienced that at all.

02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:16.140
So, they found reliably
that sleep would predict

02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:19.700
higher likelihood of
relationship conflict.

02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:22.290
Secondly, if you got into that conflict,

02:43:22.290 --> 02:43:24.160
the chances of you resolving it

02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:27.050
were significantly lower when the parties

02:43:27.050 --> 02:43:28.920
had not been sleeping well.

02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:30.530
Part of the reason is because

02:43:30.530 --> 02:43:35.490
when you are not well slept,
your empathy goes down.

02:43:35.490 --> 02:43:37.790
So you're not, you're taking more of an

02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:40.550
abrasive stance with your partner,

02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:44.580
rather than a more agreeable
stance with your partner.

02:43:44.580 --> 02:43:49.580
So at almost every dimension
of a human loving relationship,

02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:53.150
sleep can have a dramatic impact.

02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:55.750
- I think these are really
important things to underscore,

02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:58.470
one of the most common questions I get,

02:43:58.470 --> 02:44:01.050
because there seems to
be community of people

02:44:01.050 --> 02:44:03.200
on the internet that
are obsessed with this.

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:04.430
I don't know who they are,

02:44:04.430 --> 02:44:05.520
because it's all,

02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:07.880
all this internet stuff
is shouting into a tunnel

02:44:08.811 --> 02:44:09.809
and getting comments back in written form.

02:44:09.809 --> 02:44:13.543
It's a very bizarre
conversation, so to speak.

02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:17.990
Is whether or not sexual behavior itself

02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:19.687
lowers or increases testosterone?

02:44:19.687 --> 02:44:21.513
And I went into the data,

02:44:22.650 --> 02:44:25.130
which spans many decades actually,

02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:26.620
both animal studies and human studies.

02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:28.670
And it seems just to underscore this

02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:30.230
as long as we're talking
about this subject

02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:34.670
that it does seem that sexual activity,

02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:37.727
sex between two people

02:44:37.727 --> 02:44:41.113
does seem to increase
testosterone in both.

02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:45.750
There is this question
about orgasm or no orgasm

02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:48.690
ejaculation, no ejaculation and indeed,

02:44:48.690 --> 02:44:51.840
there do seem to be some effects of

02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:54.410
restricting ejaculation in males

02:44:54.410 --> 02:44:57.130
as a form of further
increasing testosterone.

02:44:57.130 --> 02:45:00.300
So sex without ejaculation
further increasing testosterone.

02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:02.830
But the data are not clean.

02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:05.190
Presumably because organizing
these sorts of studies

02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:06.930
and getting truth in self reporting

02:45:06.930 --> 02:45:09.730
is probably hard to get from subjects.

02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:14.520
But everything sort of
points in the direction

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:19.460
that provided that the
relationship is a healthy one,

02:45:19.460 --> 02:45:21.618
it's consensual, it's age appropriate,

02:45:21.618 --> 02:45:22.840
context appropriate, species appropriate

02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:24.140
that sex between two individuals

02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:26.630
does seem to increase
the sex steroid hormones

02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:29.180
testosterone and estrogen
toward healthy ranges.

02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:30.720
And what I'm hearing now

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.580
this sort of Gestalt of the discussion

02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:33.610
we just had is that

02:45:33.610 --> 02:45:38.510
that too can promote
sleepiness, restful states,

02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:40.080
and quality sleep.

02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:43.010
And I think this is an
important conversation

02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:44.540
that just hasn't been held enough.

02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:47.330
I mean, sooner or later,
both in the US and elsewhere,

02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:48.750
we're going to have to acknowledge

02:45:48.750 --> 02:45:51.300
that we are biological
organisms of some sort,

02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:53.040
and that we have choice in life,

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:54.637
about all these things,

02:45:54.637 --> 02:45:57.670
from supplementation to
sex, or no sex, et cetera,

02:45:57.670 --> 02:46:02.100
but that they have profound
effects on our core biology.

02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:04.450
I mean, it's fascinating to me

02:46:04.450 --> 02:46:07.190
that the areas of the
hypothalamus, the preoptic area,

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.513
the super optic areas,

02:46:09.430 --> 02:46:10.640
those areas which the names

02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:11.840
might not mean anything to anybody,

02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:13.890
besides Matt and I sitting here,

02:46:13.890 --> 02:46:16.940
but those areas sit cheek
to jowl with each other

02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:20.660
in the hypothalamus and
control, sleep and sex.

02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:25.120
The trigger of orgasm,
the appetite for food,

02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:26.860
the appetite for water for electrolytes.

02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:31.380
I mean, the hypothalamus
is kind of a festival

02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:33.480
of neurons with different booths

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:35.610
for different primitive behaviors.

02:46:35.610 --> 02:46:36.820
- It's such a small, small
structure in the brain,

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:40.170
but it's the orchestrator of
a vast number of our behaviors

02:46:40.170 --> 02:46:43.750
disproportionate in terms
of its size versus effect.

02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:44.590
- Yeah, I don't think you can

02:46:44.590 --> 02:46:46.180
go to this hypothalamic festival

02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:48.970
without at least seeing all the booths

02:46:48.970 --> 02:46:50.033
whether or not you decide
to visit them or not.

02:46:51.526 --> 02:46:53.430
- I love that master analogy.

02:46:53.430 --> 02:46:58.430
- So I'm glad that we've
broached that conversation.

02:46:58.660 --> 02:47:01.770
And I hope people will think
that we've approached it

02:47:01.770 --> 02:47:03.550
with the appropriate level of sensitivity.

02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:05.980
It's an important one that
we're going to hear more about

02:47:05.980 --> 02:47:07.454
one way or the other.

02:47:07.454 --> 02:47:08.287
People are certainly thinking about this,

02:47:08.287 --> 02:47:10.490
if not engaging in
these sorts of behaviors

02:47:10.490 --> 02:47:11.830
or avoiding them.

02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:14.830
So the more we can understand
about the biology, the better.

02:47:16.075 --> 02:47:17.920
And so thank you for
bringing that topic up.

02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:20.983
Because for the record, Matt,
tabled it for discussion.

02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:24.240
- We were just like chatting outside

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:26.700
and I think we said
something about sort of sex,

02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:28.417
and I said we can go there.

02:47:28.417 --> 02:47:29.450
There is so much interesting data.

02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:34.450
- Absolutely, I want to touch
on just two remaining topics.

02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:39.957
One is are there any
unconventional sleep tips

02:47:39.957 --> 02:47:43.210
or things about sleep
that we've overlooked?

02:47:43.210 --> 02:47:46.100
If we've covered everything
great, but you know,

02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:47.740
we hear to keep the room cool.

02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:50.720
We hear because of this
temperature phenomenon,

02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:53.760
the light aspects, the
considerations about alcohol,

02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:57.477
CBD marijuana, cognitive behavioral,

02:47:57.477 --> 02:48:01.081
tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps.

02:48:01.081 --> 02:48:02.970
- Please don't put me on the hook

02:48:02.970 --> 02:48:04.460
for tart cherries and kiwis,

02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:05.660
I was just offering what
I know about the data.

02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:06.860
- And these are considerations

02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:09.710
and whether or not people
batch these things,

02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:10.910
I won't even list them off now,

02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:13.460
because they're too many
jokes that one could make.

02:48:14.974 --> 02:48:17.358
- And I have no affiliation
with any of these products.

02:48:17.358 --> 02:48:18.191
[cross talking]

02:48:18.191 --> 02:48:19.437
- Well, I'm going to take
out stock in a kiwi company.

02:48:19.437 --> 02:48:21.540
No I'm just kidding.

02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:25.190
But the question I have is about

02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:27.520
any unconventional or lesser known things,

02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:29.810
or maybe you do things
or you think about things

02:48:29.810 --> 02:48:32.860
just in a purely exploratory way,

02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:37.350
as a scientist of that, you
know, the what if kind of things

02:48:37.350 --> 02:48:40.810
that, yeah, what if it turns out that

02:48:40.810 --> 02:48:42.319
and I hear I just,

02:48:42.319 --> 02:48:44.590
I got a blank there for you to fill in.

02:48:44.590 --> 02:48:48.420
- I think, you know, beyond
the standard, you know,

02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:51.290
fair that I've dished out plenty of times

02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:54.280
of sleep hygiene of you know,
regularity, temperature,

02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:57.220
darkness, alcohol, caffeine,

02:48:57.220 --> 02:48:59.540
and we've spoken about all of those.

02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:02.373
What are some more
unconventional tips, I guess?

02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:05.950
The first one, which is unconventional

02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:07.900
along the lines of naps.

02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:09.920
If you've had a bad night of sleep,

02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:12.890
let's say that you're starting
to emerge with insomnia

02:49:12.890 --> 02:49:14.840
and you've had a bad night of sleep,

02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:17.570
the advice and I learned this
from my wonderful colleague,

02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:20.473
Michael Perlis, do nothing.

02:49:21.380 --> 02:49:24.690
What I mean by that is,
don't wake up any later,

02:49:24.690 --> 02:49:27.730
don't sleep in the following
day to try and make up for it,

02:49:27.730 --> 02:49:30.550
don't nap during the day,

02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:33.910
don't consume extra
caffeine to wake you up,

02:49:33.910 --> 02:49:35.610
to try to get you through the day,

02:49:35.610 --> 02:49:37.940
and don't go to bed any earlier

02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:40.820
to think that you're going to compensate.

02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:43.010
And I can explain all of those things.

02:49:43.010 --> 02:49:44.770
But if you wake up later,

02:49:44.770 --> 02:49:47.600
you're not going to be sleepy
until late in the evening,

02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:49.670
so you're going to go to
bed at your normal time

02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:51.520
and you won't be sleeping,
you'll think well,

02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.720
I just came off a bad night of sleep.

02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:55.540
And now I still,

02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:58.540
I can't even get to sleep
and it's my normal time.

02:49:58.540 --> 02:50:01.450
It's because you slept in
later than you would otherwise,

02:50:01.450 --> 02:50:04.730
and you reduce the window
of adenosine accumulation

02:50:04.730 --> 02:50:06.650
before your normal bedtime.

02:50:06.650 --> 02:50:07.800
So don't go,

02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:09.940
don't wake up any later.

02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:12.690
Don't use more caffeine for
the reasons that are obvious,

02:50:12.690 --> 02:50:14.700
because that's only going to
crank you and keep you awake

02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:16.320
the following night

02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:17.280
or decrease the probability

02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:19.513
of a good following
night of recovery sleep.

02:50:20.610 --> 02:50:23.400
Third, I mentioned don't take naps,

02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:25.960
because once again, that
will just take, you know,

02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:28.360
naps, particularly later in the afternoon,

02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:31.500
I almost liken them to
snacking before a main meal,

02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:33.730
it just takes your appetite off the edge

02:50:33.730 --> 02:50:36.450
of that main meal of
sleep, so don't do it.

02:50:36.450 --> 02:50:39.250
And then finally, don't
go to bed any earlier,

02:50:39.250 --> 02:50:43.010
resist and resist and go
to bed at your normal time.

02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:45.010
What I want to try and do is prevent you

02:50:45.010 --> 02:50:47.560
from thinking I had such
a bad night last night

02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:49.260
and I normally go to bed at 10:30,

02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:51.490
I'm just going to get
into bed at nine o'clock,

02:50:51.490 --> 02:50:53.630
because last night was just so bad.

02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:55.770
But that's not your natural bedtime,

02:50:55.770 --> 02:50:58.670
and it's not aligned with
your natural chronotype

02:50:58.670 --> 02:51:00.730
because presumably you kind of know

02:51:00.730 --> 02:51:01.610
something about that,

02:51:01.610 --> 02:51:02.940
our morning time, evening time,

02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:04.160
you're trying to sleep in harmony,

02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:07.110
which is usually how you
get best quality sleep.

02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:08.420
But you go to bed at nine,

02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:12.110
and my body is not ready
to sleep at nine o'clock.

02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:13.440
But I'm worried because I had

02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:14.960
a bad night of sleep last night

02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:15.890
so I get into bed,

02:51:15.890 --> 02:51:17.710
and now I'm tossing and turning

02:51:17.710 --> 02:51:19.090
for the first hour and a half

02:51:19.090 --> 02:51:21.160
because it's not my natural sleep window,

02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:23.260
but I just thought it was a good idea.

02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:25.500
And if I didn't know anything about sleep,

02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:27.770
I would think all of
these same things too.

02:51:27.770 --> 02:51:29.770
So I'm not finger wagging.

02:51:29.770 --> 02:51:31.950
But after if I have a bad night of sleep,

02:51:31.950 --> 02:51:33.410
and I am not immune,

02:51:33.410 --> 02:51:36.030
just because I know a
little bit about sleep

02:51:36.030 --> 02:51:38.880
doesn't mean I don't
have my bad nights, I do.

02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:39.790
Doesn't mean I haven't had

02:51:39.790 --> 02:51:42.620
bouts of insomnia in my life, I have.

02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:46.160
But after a bad night
of sleep, I do nothing.

02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:49.520
I don't do any of those four things.

02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:52.330
I think the second tip I would offer

02:51:52.330 --> 02:51:56.720
in terms of unconventional
is have a wind down routine.

02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:58.860
Many of us think of sleep

02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:01.770
as if it's like a light switch,

02:52:01.770 --> 02:52:03.250
that we just jump into bed,

02:52:03.250 --> 02:52:04.500
and when we turn the light out

02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:07.100
sleep should arrive in that same way.

02:52:07.100 --> 02:52:09.470
Just the binary you know
it's on or it's off.

02:52:09.470 --> 02:52:11.250
Sleep is a physiological process,

02:52:11.250 --> 02:52:13.970
it's much more like landing a plane,

02:52:13.970 --> 02:52:16.690
it takes time to gradually descend down

02:52:16.690 --> 02:52:17.910
onto the terra firma

02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:21.090
of what we call good solid sleep at night.

02:52:21.090 --> 02:52:23.290
Find out whatever works for you

02:52:23.290 --> 02:52:25.320
and it could be light stretching,

02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:30.260
I usually meditate for about
10 or 15 minutes before bed.

02:52:30.260 --> 02:52:32.640
Some people like reading,

02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:34.240
try not to watch television in bed

02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:35.661
that's usually advised against.

02:52:35.661 --> 02:52:36.956
- Something that doesn't emit
too much light to your eyes.

02:52:36.956 --> 02:52:38.920
- Too much light, too
activating, you know,

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:40.610
you can listen to relaxing podcasts,

02:52:40.610 --> 02:52:43.510
although we can speak about
technology in the bedroom too.

02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:47.330
But have some kind of a wind down routine.

02:52:47.330 --> 02:52:50.600
It's you know, it's almost like you know,

02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:53.280
you wouldn't race into your garage

02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:57.790
and come to a screeching
halt from 60 miles an hour,

02:52:57.790 --> 02:53:00.300
you typically down, shift your gears

02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:02.619
and you slow down as you
come into the garage,

02:53:02.619 --> 02:53:04.120
that's the same thing with with sleep too.

02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:05.160
So that's the second thing,

02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:07.100
have some kind of a wind down routine,

02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:08.160
find what works for you.

02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:11.180
Maybe it's taking a hot
bath or a warm shower,

02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:12.520
and then stick to it.

02:53:12.520 --> 02:53:14.300
Just we do this with kids all the time,

02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:16.240
we find out what their bedroom,

02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:18.690
sorry, their bedtime regiment is

02:53:18.690 --> 02:53:21.110
and then we just stick to it faithfully

02:53:21.110 --> 02:53:24.500
'cause we humans are the same way too.

02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:27.930
The third thing is a
myth, don't count sheep.

02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:29.450
There's a study done here at UC Berkeley,

02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:31.459
I didn't do this today, I wish I did,

02:53:31.459 --> 02:53:33.040
it's by my colleague,
Professor Allison Harvey.

02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:35.270
And they found that counting sheep

02:53:35.270 --> 02:53:37.520
actually made it harder to fall asleep.

02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:39.300
It made matters worse.

02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:42.380
As a conter sorry counter measure to that

02:53:42.380 --> 02:53:45.180
what they did find was
that taking yourself

02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:47.630
on some kind of a mental walk,

02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:50.440
so think about a nice walk
that you take in nature

02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:51.760
or a walk on the beach,

02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:54.108
or even a walk around
an urban environment.

02:53:54.108 --> 02:53:54.941
- Just visualizing that.

02:53:54.941 --> 02:53:59.040
- And visualizing that, that
seemed to be beneficial.

02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:02.320
The other thing about sort of that idea

02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:06.290
of shifting focus away
from your mind itself,

02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:09.723
get your mind off itself
is a good piece of advice.

02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:14.290
Catharsis, you can try to write down

02:54:14.290 --> 02:54:16.920
all of the concerns that you have,

02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:19.270
and do this not right before bed,

02:54:19.270 --> 02:54:22.020
but usually an hour or two before bed.

02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:24.730
Some people call it a worry journal.

02:54:24.730 --> 02:54:28.060
And to me, it's a little
bit like closing down

02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:30.653
all of the emotional tabs on my browser.

02:54:31.554 --> 02:54:33.217
Because if I shut the computer down

02:54:33.217 --> 02:54:35.630
and all of those tabs are still open,

02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:36.730
I'm going to come back in the morning,

02:54:36.730 --> 02:54:37.990
and the computer's red hot

02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:40.620
the fans going because
it didn't go to sleep,

02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:42.171
because it couldn't

02:54:42.171 --> 02:54:43.750
because there were too
many tabs active and open.

02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:45.610
I think it's the same
way with sleep as well,

02:54:45.610 --> 02:54:47.360
so try to think about doing that.

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:50.690
So just vomit out all of
your concerns on the page.

02:54:50.690 --> 02:54:52.570
- I like that, cause my 3am waking

02:54:52.570 --> 02:54:54.400
is often associated with me writing down

02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:57.131
the list of things that I
forgot to do that I need to do.

02:54:57.131 --> 02:55:00.753
And once I eventually wake
up from the later night,

02:55:00.753 --> 02:55:03.260
second half of the night's sleep,

02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:05.530
that stuff seems much more
tractable and reasonable,

02:55:05.530 --> 02:55:07.430
but it sure would be great

02:55:07.430 --> 02:55:09.530
to get that stuff out
of the way before sleep.

02:55:09.530 --> 02:55:11.090
- Well, there's also something that

02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:12.990
I don't think people
have spoken about a lot.

02:55:12.990 --> 02:55:15.010
And I'd like to research it,

02:55:15.010 --> 02:55:20.010
which is difficulty and
anxiety at night in the dark,

02:55:23.250 --> 02:55:27.423
is not the same difficulty and
anxiety in the light of day.

02:55:28.290 --> 02:55:31.440
And when we have those thoughts at night,

02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:34.020
it comes with a magnitude of rumination

02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:38.590
and catastrophization
that is disproportionate

02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:41.543
to that which you would
describe when you are awake.

02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:47.040
And I don't know what's
going on about the brain,

02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:49.590
and thought and emotion at the time,

02:55:49.590 --> 02:55:52.380
I've got a bunch of theories as to why,

02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:56.010
and that's why I like
the idea of closing up

02:55:56.010 --> 02:55:58.970
zipping up all of those
different components,

02:55:58.970 --> 02:56:02.160
just get them out on the page.

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:03.810
And it feel,

02:56:03.810 --> 02:56:06.440
and I at first thought this
just sounds like who its

02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:08.670
it sounds very Berkeley,
it's kind of Kumbaya,

02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:10.871
we all hold hands, and, you know,

02:56:10.871 --> 02:56:12.180
we all come at the end of the day.

02:56:12.180 --> 02:56:14.550
But then the data started coming out

02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:16.250
really good studies from good people.

02:56:16.250 --> 02:56:18.780
And they found that keeping
one of those journals

02:56:18.780 --> 02:56:20.810
decreased the time it
takes you to fall asleep

02:56:20.810 --> 02:56:23.270
by 50%, five, zero.

02:56:23.270 --> 02:56:24.880
- Amazing that's substantial.
- That's well on par

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:26.824
with any pharmaceutical agent.

02:56:26.824 --> 02:56:30.760
- I'm convinced that I've
long thought that the

02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:35.190
worries and concerns and
ideas I have at three, 4am

02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:37.430
I've learned to not
place any stock in them.

02:56:37.430 --> 02:56:40.860
Because something, I'm glad that you might

02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:43.040
decide to eventually look
at this in your laboratory

02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:46.460
because I feel like something
is melted away or altered.

02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:49.970
I suspect it's in the regulation

02:56:49.970 --> 02:56:51.910
of the autonomic nervous system,

02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:55.200
that it makes sense why
a concern at three, 4am

02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:59.580
ought to evoke more of a panic
sense than a concern sense.

02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:01.220
And certainly, that's my experience,

02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:03.090
although not, fortunate to not suffer

02:57:03.090 --> 02:57:04.530
from full blown panic attacks.

02:57:04.530 --> 02:57:06.930
But everything seems worse at three, 4am

02:57:06.930 --> 02:57:07.763
provided you're awake.

02:57:07.763 --> 02:57:09.850
- And we need to sort of look into that

02:57:09.850 --> 02:57:13.110
because, you know, if you
look at suicide rates,

02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:15.490
around the 24 hour clock face,

02:57:15.490 --> 02:57:17.520
disproportionately higher rates

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:21.130
in those middle sort of night hours.

02:57:21.130 --> 02:57:23.920
So now, I don't know if
that's causative or not,

02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:24.820
but something you know,

02:57:24.820 --> 02:57:26.260
it could just be that that's the time

02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:28.490
when we're mostly lonely,
and we're by ourselves.

02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:29.323
And that's the reason.

02:57:29.323 --> 02:57:31.340
So it's got nothing to do
with sleep or the night time,

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:32.173
I don't know.

02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:34.530
So that's the third thing,

02:57:34.530 --> 02:57:37.710
I think the fourth sort
of little tip I would give

02:57:37.710 --> 02:57:41.370
that's unconventional,
is remove all clock faces

02:57:41.370 --> 02:57:42.460
from your bedroom.

02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:43.440
- Including your phone.

02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:46.820
- Including your phone,
and resist checking it.

02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:49.880
Now I know and I can
speak about the phone too

02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:52.680
that genie of technology
is out the bottle.

02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:54.300
And it's not going back in anytime soon.

02:57:54.300 --> 02:57:57.290
So we've got to think a
scientist and sleep scientist,

02:57:57.290 --> 02:57:59.330
you know, as to what we do with you know,

02:57:59.330 --> 02:58:00.788
phones in the bedroom.

02:58:00.788 --> 02:58:03.220
- Years ago, I was a
counselor at a Summer camp

02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:04.860
I worked with at risk kids

02:58:04.860 --> 02:58:07.140
and there was a phrase
that comes to mind here,

02:58:07.140 --> 02:58:09.210
it's be a channel, not a dam.

02:58:09.210 --> 02:58:12.113
Because when you try and dam
certain kinds of behavior,

02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:15.400
physically dam certain kinds of behavior

02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:17.559
and not morally dam, that too,

02:58:17.559 --> 02:58:21.767
it just creeps over the edge,

02:58:21.767 --> 02:58:23.320
and you get a waterfall.

02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:25.340
So it has to be a channel.

02:58:25.340 --> 02:58:27.750
The phone and devices
have to be worked with

02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:28.890
and negotiated not eliminated.

02:58:28.890 --> 02:58:30.679
- That's right and you know,

02:58:30.679 --> 02:58:32.579
think about those mindfully too

02:58:32.579 --> 02:58:34.720
but clock faces, remove all of those,

02:58:34.720 --> 02:58:38.300
because if you are having,
you know, a tough night,

02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:40.630
knowing that it's 3:22 in the morning,

02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:43.180
or it's 4:48 in the morning,

02:58:43.180 --> 02:58:46.040
does not help you in the slightest.

02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:49.000
And it's only going to make
matters worse than better.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.610
So try to remove all clock faces.

02:58:51.610 --> 02:58:53.410
And I think that's one of those other tips

02:58:53.410 --> 02:58:55.300
that some people have found helpful.

02:58:55.300 --> 02:58:58.760
But those would be sort of
some slightly unconventional,

02:58:58.760 --> 02:59:00.940
I guess more than your stock fare of

02:59:00.940 --> 02:59:04.590
here are the five tips for
sleep hygiene tonight, so.

02:59:04.590 --> 02:59:06.560
- Those are terrific sleep tips,

02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:08.440
and several of which, if not all of which

02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:09.833
I'm going to incorporate.

02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:13.820
Matt, this has been an amazing, deep dive

02:59:13.820 --> 02:59:17.030
on sleep and it's positive
and negative regulators.

02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:18.500
- I hope it hasn't been too long.

02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:19.543
- No this has been great.

02:59:19.543 --> 02:59:22.520
- Please cut it down,
shorten it to, you know,

02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:24.870
the five minutes of meaningful
stuff that I offered.

02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:27.180
- Absolutely not, it is chock a block

02:59:27.180 --> 02:59:29.020
full of valuable takeaways.

02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:32.120
It's been tremendously fun for me

02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:35.610
to dissect out this
incredible aspect of our lives

02:59:35.610 --> 02:59:37.830
that we call sleep with a fellow scientist

02:59:37.830 --> 02:59:39.800
and a fellow public educator.

02:59:39.800 --> 02:59:42.380
I want to say several things.

02:59:42.380 --> 02:59:46.470
First of all, we should say
where people can find you

02:59:46.470 --> 02:59:48.710
although it shouldn't be
that difficult these days.

02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:51.290
You're a very present on the internet.

02:59:51.290 --> 02:59:53.480
- [Matthew] Unfortunately.
- For better or for worse.

02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:55.010
I think it's wonderful
that you're out there.

02:59:55.010 --> 02:59:58.327
Look, it's a public health
service that you're doing.

02:59:58.327 --> 03:00:01.280
No one requires you or any other scientist

03:00:01.280 --> 03:00:04.144
to get out and share this information.

03:00:04.144 --> 03:00:07.090
My sense of you knowing you a bit,

03:00:07.090 --> 03:00:08.670
and from following your work very closely

03:00:08.670 --> 03:00:10.340
both your scientific work in detail

03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:13.430
and your public facing educational work

03:00:13.430 --> 03:00:16.710
is that you very much
want the best for people.

03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:19.823
And it's an interesting thing
as a scientist or a clinician,

03:00:19.823 --> 03:00:22.970
to know that the

03:00:22.970 --> 03:00:24.710
that certain answers exist,

03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:25.840
that we don't have all the answers,

03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:27.300
but that there is a better path,

03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:29.050
there are better ways
and people can benefit

03:00:29.050 --> 03:00:30.490
in a myriad of ways.

03:00:30.490 --> 03:00:34.363
So, for that, because I know
that to be very genuine in you,

03:00:35.500 --> 03:00:36.710
you want the best for people

03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:39.270
and you're offering tremendous advice

03:00:39.270 --> 03:00:42.430
and considerations and people
can take it or leave it

03:00:42.430 --> 03:00:43.620
that's the way I view it.

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.940
I also want to thank you for
taking the time out of your day

03:00:45.940 --> 03:00:49.150
to sit with me here and
have this discussion.

03:00:49.150 --> 03:00:50.690
- Not at all, no at all, it's a privilege,

03:00:50.690 --> 03:00:53.320
it's a delight, you know, you and I,

03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:55.580
I think we're alike kind in lots of ways.

03:00:55.580 --> 03:00:59.660
And I take you as a shining example

03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:03.650
of how you can effectively
connect with the public.

03:01:03.650 --> 03:01:05.990
And I know that we've had
our conversations before

03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:08.840
we ever sat down to talk
together about, you know,

03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:12.230
how to think about
communicating with the public

03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:14.300
and the pros and cons of that.

03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:16.530
And I've just loved your opinions.

03:01:16.530 --> 03:01:18.540
I've been drinking it all in.

03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:21.493
And then I think the third
thing I'd like to say is,

03:01:22.583 --> 03:01:25.310
thank you for being such an
incredible sleep ambassador,

03:01:25.310 --> 03:01:27.750
the series that you've released on sleep,

03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:29.270
the way that you speak about sleep,

03:01:29.270 --> 03:01:33.080
the way that you moderate
and have championed sleep.

03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:34.770
It is remarkable.

03:01:34.770 --> 03:01:37.233
So thank you for just being you know,

03:01:38.184 --> 03:01:40.907
a brother in arms in that way.

03:01:40.907 --> 03:01:43.310
- But we are and thanks
for those those words.

03:01:43.310 --> 03:01:44.830
99% of what I discussed there

03:01:44.830 --> 03:01:47.600
was the work of you and your
colleagues in the sleep field.

03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:49.640
So proper acknowledgement, but thank you,

03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:52.300
where can people learn more about

03:01:52.300 --> 03:01:53.550
what you're doing currently?

03:01:53.550 --> 03:01:54.820
And what's coming next?

03:01:54.820 --> 03:01:56.030
You're on Twitter.

03:01:56.030 --> 03:02:00.480
- I am on Twitter I typically tweet.

03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:01.700
- As the sleep diplomat.

03:02:01.700 --> 03:02:03.960
- So, no it's just sleep diplomat

03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:06.163
- Sleep diplomat on Twitter.

03:02:06.163 --> 03:02:10.770
- Sleep diplomat on Twitter,
sleepdiplomat.com website,

03:02:10.770 --> 03:02:13.400
if you want to learn more about
the science that we do here,

03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:16.310
it's humansleepscience.com.

03:02:16.310 --> 03:02:18.933
It's the Center for Human Sleep Science.

03:02:20.140 --> 03:02:24.020
You can pick up a copy
of the book, if you want.

03:02:24.020 --> 03:02:25.640
It's called "Why We Sleep?"

03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:27.570
if you're curious about sleep,

03:02:27.570 --> 03:02:30.300
that's one path to take and it's my view.

03:02:30.300 --> 03:02:32.060
- Is there another might
someday in the future?

03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:33.740
- I think there may be, yeah.

03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:36.600
- Great, great, many,
many millions of people

03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:38.100
will be very happy to hear that.

03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:40.470
- I think it's starting to take hold.

03:02:40.470 --> 03:02:43.070
And then as we discussed,

03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:46.730
I am more than kicking around the idea

03:02:46.730 --> 03:02:49.750
of a short form podcast
rather than a long form,

03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:53.650
not long form, because I
don't have the mental capacity

03:02:53.650 --> 03:02:57.550
or the interviewing, just capability

03:02:57.550 --> 03:02:59.120
that someone like you has.

03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:01.420
So it will probably just
be monologue short form.

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:05.180
So if there is some interest,
I'll probably do that as well.

03:03:05.180 --> 03:03:07.330
So those are the ways
that people can find me.

03:03:07.330 --> 03:03:10.560
But overall, if you're
interested in sleep,

03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.240
just listen to Andrew.

03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:14.458
That's thing I can tell people.

03:03:14.458 --> 03:03:16.734
- All right, well now
we're bating back and forth

03:03:16.734 --> 03:03:19.690
the vector of action so to speak,

03:03:19.690 --> 03:03:22.310
but I do hope you'll start a podcast

03:03:22.310 --> 03:03:25.860
however brief or lengthy
these episodes turn out to be

03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:27.620
because I do believe that's a great venue

03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:29.500
to get information out into the world.

03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:33.400
And we don't just want to
hear more from Matt Walker,

03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:35.310
I speak for many people,

03:03:35.310 --> 03:03:38.710
we need to, the work you're
doing is both influential,

03:03:38.710 --> 03:03:41.740
but more importantly,
it is important work.

03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:44.930
It has the impact that's needed,

03:03:44.930 --> 03:03:46.530
especially in this day and age

03:03:46.530 --> 03:03:49.040
where science and medicine, public health,

03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:51.490
and the issues of the world, etcetera,

03:03:51.490 --> 03:03:52.400
are really converging.

03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:54.780
So I know I speak on behalf

03:03:54.780 --> 03:03:57.322
of a tremendous number of people,

03:03:57.322 --> 03:03:58.440
when I just say thank you
for doing the work you do

03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:00.684
and for being you.
- [Matthew] Thank you.

03:04:00.684 --> 03:04:01.517
- And thanks for being a good friend.

03:04:01.517 --> 03:04:03.899
- Likewise, too and by the way,

03:04:03.899 --> 03:04:04.930
I'm just going to note

03:04:04.930 --> 03:04:06.560
that it was nice that the two of us

03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:11.560
both got the Johnny Cash memo
about how to dress today.

03:04:12.340 --> 03:04:15.630
It seems as though we're both
kind of we got that same memo,

03:04:15.630 --> 03:04:18.130
which will mean nothing to
people who are listening,

03:04:18.130 --> 03:04:19.950
but if you're watching the video,

03:04:19.950 --> 03:04:21.420
you'll probably see what I mean.

03:04:21.420 --> 03:04:23.070
Andrew, thank you for taking this time.

03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:24.547
Thank you so much.

03:04:24.547 --> 03:04:25.380
- Thanks so much Matt.

03:04:25.380 --> 03:04:27.150
Thank you for joining me for my discussion

03:04:27.150 --> 03:04:29.080

03:05:08.650 --> 03:05:11.140
During this episode, and
in many previous episodes,

03:05:11.140 --> 03:05:12.670
we discuss supplements.

03:05:12.670 --> 03:05:14.300
One issue in the supplement industry

03:05:14.300 --> 03:05:16.670
is that many supplements don't contain

03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:18.400
what's listed on the bottle.

03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:20.200
We therefore have partnered with Thorne,

03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:23.210
that's T H O R N E, Thorne supplements,

03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:24.220
because Thorne supplements

03:05:24.220 --> 03:05:25.900
have the highest levels of stringency

03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:28.130
in terms of the purity of the ingredients,

03:05:28.130 --> 03:05:31.540
and precision with respect to
what's listed on the bottle

03:05:31.540 --> 03:05:34.440
is actually what's contained
in those supplement bottles.

03:05:34.440 --> 03:05:37.050
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take for sleep,

03:05:37.050 --> 03:05:42.050
and for other things, you can
go to thorne.com/u/huberman

03:05:42.690 --> 03:05:45.450
and there you'll see all
the supplements that I take

03:05:45.450 --> 03:05:47.750
and can get 20% off any
of those supplements

03:05:48.708 --> 03:05:50.328
as well as any other supplements

03:05:50.328 --> 03:05:51.161
that Thorne happens to make.

03:05:51.161 --> 03:05:55.690
That's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman.

03:05:56.810 --> 03:05:59.090
And last, but certainly not least,

03:05:59.090 --> 03:06:01.040
thank you for your interest in science.
