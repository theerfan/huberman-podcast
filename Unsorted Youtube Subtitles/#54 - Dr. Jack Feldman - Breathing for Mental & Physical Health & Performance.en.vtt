00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.910
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.973
for everyday life.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.270
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.660
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.670
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.270
Today, my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.280
Dr. Jack Feldman

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.540
is a distinguished
Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.320
at the University of
California, Los Angeles.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.400
He is known for his pioneering work

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.850
on the neuroscience of breathing.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.440
We are all familiar with breathing

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.940
and how essential breathing is to life.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.500
We require oxygen, and
it is only by breathing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.810
that we can bring oxygen to all the cells

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.440
of our brain and body.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.600
However, as the work from Dr. Feldman

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.470
and colleagues tells us,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.800
breathing is also fundamental
to organ health and function

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
at an enormous number of other levels.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.700
In fact, how we breathe,
including how often we breathe,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.160
the depth of our breathing and the ratio

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.600
of inhales to exhales actually
predicts how focused we are,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.670
how easily we get into sleep,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.960
how easily we can exit from sleep.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.180
Dr. Feldman gets credit for the discovery

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.640
of the two major brain
centers that control

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.370
the different patterns of breathing.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.130
Today, you'll learn
about those brain centers

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.870
and the patterns of
breathing they control,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.770
and how those different
patterns of breathing influence

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.760
all aspects of your
mental and physical life.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.930
What's especially wonderful
about Dr. Feldman and his work

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.027
is that it not only points
to the critical role

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:26.600
of respiration in disease,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.990
in health and in daily life,
but he's also a practitioner.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.670
He understands how to
leverage particular aspects

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.150
of the breathing process
in order to bias the brain

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.370
to be in particular states
that can benefit us all.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.510
Whether or not you are a person

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.150
who already practices breathwork,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.190
or whether or not you're somebody

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.190
who simply breathes to stay alive,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.080
by the end of today's discussion

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.440
you're going to understand
a tremendous amount

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.380
about how the breathing system works

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.620
and how you can leverage
that breathing system

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.670
toward particular goals in your life.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.060
Dr. Feldman shares with us

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.220
his own particular breathing
protocols that he uses,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.830
and he suggests different
avenues for exploring respiration

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.760
in ways that can allow you, for instance,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.400
to be more focused for work,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.090
to disengage from work
and high stress endeavors

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.420
to calm down quickly.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.820
And indeed, he explains
not only how to do that,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.210
but all the underlying science
in ways that will allow

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.660
you to customize your own
protocols for your needs.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.070
All the guests that we bring
on The Huberman Lab Podcast

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.850
are considered at the
very top of their fields.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.790
Today's guest, Dr. Feldman,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.410
is not only at the top of his
field, he founded the field.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.100
Prior to his coming into neuroscience

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.450
from the field of physics,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.930
there really wasn't much information

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.510
about how the brain controls breathing.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.140
There was a little bit of information,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.920
but we can really credit Dr. Feldman

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.550
and his laboratory for identifying

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.130
the particular brain areas

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.970
that control different
patterns of breathing

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.240
and how that information can
be leveraged towards health,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.100
high performance and
for combating disease.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.730
So, today's conversation you're going

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.450
to learn a tremendous amount

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.630
from the top researcher in this field.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.460
It's a really wonderful
and special opportunity

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.630
to be able to his knowledge with you,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.830
and I know that you're not
only going to enjoy it,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.230
but you are going to
learn a tremendous amount.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.650
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.360
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.230
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.970
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.980
about science and science related tools

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.230
to the general public.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.210
In keeping with that theme,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.010
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.280
Our first sponsor is Thesis.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.890
Thesis as a company that makes nootropics.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.220
Now, I've talked before on
the podcast and elsewhere

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.510
about the fact that I don't
really like the term nootropics,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.240
which means smart drugs,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.390
because smart means many different things

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.700
in many different contexts.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.530
You've got creativity, you've got focus,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.110
you've got task switching.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.740
So, the idea that there will
be one pill or one formula

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.510
that could make us smarter and better

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.600
at all those things at once,
just doesn't stand up to logic.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.110
In fact, different chemicals

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.010
and different brain systems underlie

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.140
our ability to be creative
or our ability to task switch

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.610
or to be focused.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.500
And that's the basis of Thesis.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.880
Thesis as a company that
makes targeted nootropics

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.920
for specific outcomes.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.840
In other words, specific
nootropics to get your brain

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.510
into states that are ideal

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.770
for what you're trying to accomplish.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.830
Thesis uses very high quality ingredients,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.950
many of which I've talked
about before on the podcast,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.500
such as DHA, Gingko biloba,
and phosphatidylserine.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.010
I talked about those in the ADHD podcast.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.960
Those are some of the ingredients

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.840
in their so-called Logic formula.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.700
There's a lot of research
showing that Gingko biloba

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.440
can be very helpful for
increasing levels of focus,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.560
and even for people with ADHD.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.970
However, I can't take it.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.890
When I take it, I get really bad headaches

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.280
and I know some people who do

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.080
and some people who don't get headaches

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.360
when they take Gingko biloba.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.270
This is a great example
of why nootropics need

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.490
to be personalized to the individual.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.620
Thesis gives you the ability

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.690
to try different blends
over the course of a month

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.100
and discover which
nootropic formulas work best

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.720
for your unique brain
chemistry and genetics,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.750
and which ones are best for
particular circumstances.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.700
So, they have a formulation for instance,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.260
which is Motivation.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.350
They have another formulation,
which has Clarity.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.937
They've got another
formulation, which is Logic.

00:04:56.937 --> 00:05:00.840
And each of these is
formulated specifically to you

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.770
and formulated to a specific
end point or goal state of mind

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.380
for your particular work.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.920
So as a consequence, the
formulations that you arrive at

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.840
will have a very high probability

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.030
of giving you the results that you want.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.040
In addition to that detailed
level of personalization,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.180
Thesis takes a step further
by offering free consultations

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.650
with a brain coach to help
you optimize your experience,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.200
and dial in your favorite
and best formulas.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.310
I've been using Thesis for
close to six months now,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.143
and I can confidently say

00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:31.090
that their nootropics have been
a total game changer for me.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.700
My favorite of the formulations
is their Motivation formula

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.190
that they've tailored to me.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.350
When I use that formula,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.850
I have very clear state of
mind, I have even energy,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.402
and I use that early in the
day until the early afternoon

00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:45.490
to get the bulk of my
most important work done.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.870
To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.050
you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.610
take a three minute quiz and Thesis

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.110
will send you four different formulas

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.670
to try in your first month.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.441

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.910
Today's episode is also brought

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.460
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.293
Athletic Greens

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.180
is an all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.580
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.100
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.780
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.660
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.270
is that it covers all of my vitamin,

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.950
mineral and probiotic foundational needs.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.760
There's now a wealth of data showing

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.790
that not only do we need
vitamins and minerals,

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.500
but we also need to have
a healthy gut microbiome.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.190
The gut microbiome is a
set of nerve connections

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.610
that link the microbiota,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.810
literally microbacteria
that live in our guts

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.450
and that are healthy for
us with our brain function.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.080
And our brain is also talking to our gut

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.210
in a bi-directional way.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.700
And that conversation
is vital for metabolism,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.070
for the endocrine system,

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.210
meaning the hormonal system

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.700
and for overall mood and cognition.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.590
There's just so much data
now pointing to the fact

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.700
that we need a healthy gut microbiome

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.430
and a healthy brain gut
axis as it's called.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.530
By taking Athletic Greens
once or twice a day,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.522
I can get the vitamins and minerals

00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:03.120
and the probiotics needed

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.220
for all those systems
to function optimally.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.640
And again, it tastes
great, it's great for me.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.847
In fact, if people ask me,

00:07:08.847 --> 00:07:10.730
"What's the one supplement
that I should take,"

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.200
and they can only take one supplement,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.240
I recommend Athletic Greens for
all the reasons I mentioned.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.530
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.150

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.870
which are these little
travel packs to make it easy

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.730
to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.530
or in the car or on the plane, et cetera,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.520
and a year supply of Vitamin D3+K2.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.990
There is also a wealth of evidence showing

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.790
that Vitamin D3 is vital
to our overall health,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.320
and K2 is important for
cardiovascular health

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.780
and other systems as well.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.410
Most of us are not getting
enough vitamin D3 or K2,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.400
even if we're getting some sunshine.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.650
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.180
you get the five free travel packs,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.980
a year supply of Vitamin D3+K2.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.210
Athleticgreens.com/huberman
is where you go

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.920
to claim that special offer.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.720
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.810
Headspace is a meditation
app that's supported

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.160
by 25 published studies and benefits

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.330
from over 600,000 five-star reviews.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.840
I've long been a believer in meditating.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.930
There is so much data
now pointing to the fact

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.160
that regular meditation leads
to reduced stress levels,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.900
heightened levels of focus,
better task switching,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.620
and cognitive ability.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.710
It just goes on and on.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.870
I mean, there are literally thousands

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.830
of peer reviewed studies now
in quality journals pointing

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.190
to the benefits of having a
regular meditation practice.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.320
The problem with meditation

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.100
is many people, including myself,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.620
have struggled with
sticking to that practice.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.669
With Headspace, it makes
it very easy to start

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.420
and continue a meditation protocol.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.180
The reason for that is
they have meditations

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.960
that are of different
lengths and different styles

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.800
so you don't get bored of meditation.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.540
And even if you just have five minutes,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.890
there are five minute meditations.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.920
If you've got 20 minutes,

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.753
which would be even better,

00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:48.020
there are 20 minute meditations.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.610
Ever since I started using Headspace,

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.390
I've been consistent about my meditation.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.300
I do meditation anywhere from
five to seven times a week

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.690
in my best weeks, and
sometimes that's drops to three

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.605
and then I find with Headspace,

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:01.030
I can quickly get back to
doing meditation every day

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.680
because of the huge variety

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.580
of great meditations that they have.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.700
If you want to try Headspace,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.470
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.303
And if you do that,

00:09:09.303 --> 00:09:10.720
you can get a free one month trial

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.830
with Headspace's full
library of meditations

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.120
for every situation.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.010
That's the best deal offered
by Headspace right now.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.520
So again, if you're interested,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.320
go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.570
One quick mention before we dive

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.720
into the conversation with Dr. Feldman.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.870
During today's episode,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.870
we discuss a lot of breathwork practices

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.080
and by the end of the episode,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.050
all those will be accessible to you.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.560
However, I'm aware that there are a number

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.438
of people out there that
want to go even further

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:36.430
into the science and
practical tools of breathwork.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.240
And for that reason, I want
to mention a resource to you.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.080
There is a cost associated
with this resource,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.937
but it's a terrific platform

00:09:41.937 --> 00:09:43.547
for learning about breathwork practices

00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:46.270
and for building a number
of different routines

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.190
that you can do, or that you could teach.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.810
It's called Our Breathwork Collective.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.030
I'm not associated with
the Breathwork Collective,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.410
but Dr. Feldman is an advisor to the group

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.180
and they offer daily live
guided breathing sessions

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.225
and an on-demand library

00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:02.720
that you can practice any time
free workshops on breathwork.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.920
And these are really developed
by experts in the field,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.580
including Dr. Feldman.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.760
So, as I mentioned, I'm not
on their advisory board,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.270
but I do know them and their work

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.020
and it is of the utmost quality.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.090
So anyone wanting to
learn or teach breathwork

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.150
could really benefit from
this course, I believe.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.030

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.970
to access the Our Breath Collective.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.890
And now for my conversation
with Dr. Jack Feldman.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.120
Thanks for joining me today.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.850
- It's a pleasure to be here, Andrew.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.410
- Yeah, it's been a long time coming.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.880
You're my go-to source for
all things respiration.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.080
I mean, I breathe on my own,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.610
but when I want to
understand how I breathe

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.210
and how the brain and breathing interact,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.670
you're the person I call.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.630
- Well, I'll do my best.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.750
As you know, there's a lot
that we don't understand,

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.110
which still keeps me employed and engaged,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.653
but we do know a lot.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.490
- Why don't we start off by just talking

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.350
about what's involved
in generating breath.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.030
And if you would, could
you comment on some

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.140
of the mechanisms for rhythmic breathing

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.593
versus non rhythmic breathing?

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.970
- Okay, so on the mechanical side,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.600
which is obvious to everyone,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.910
we want to have air flow in, inhale,

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.760
and we need to have air flow out

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.000
and the reason we need to do this

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.380
is because for body
metabolism, we need oxygen.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.165
And when oxygen is utilized through

00:11:36.165 --> 00:11:41.140
the aerobic metabolic process,
we produce carbon dioxide.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.330
And so, we have to get
rid of the carbon dioxide

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.420
that we produce in particular

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.985
because the carbon dioxide affects

00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:50.470
the acid base balance
of the blood, the pH,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.982
and all living cells are very sensitive

00:11:53.982 --> 00:11:55.640
to what the pH value is,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.120
so your body is very interested
in regulating that pH.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.530
So we have to have enough oxygen
for our normal metabolism,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.430
and we have to get rid of
the CO2 that we produce.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.170
So, how do we generate this air flow?

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.250
Well, the air comes into the lungs.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.840
We have to expand the lungs
and as the lungs expand,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.940
basically, it's like a balloon
that you would pull apart.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.263
The pressure inside that balloon drops

00:12:20.263 --> 00:12:22.220
and the air will flow into the balloon.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.220
So we expand, put pressure on
the lungs to pull it apart,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.820
that lowers the pressure in
the air sacks called alveoli

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.190
and air will flow in because
pressure outside the body

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.130
is higher than pressure inside the body

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.403
when you're doing this
expansion, when you're inhaling.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.690
What produces that?

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.820
Well, the principle
muscle is the diaphragm,

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.300
which is sitting inside the
body just below the lung,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.550
and when you want to inhale,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.090
you basically contract the
diaphragm and it pulls it down.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.720
And as it pulls it down,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.630
it's inserting pressure
forces on the lung,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.340
the lung wants to expand.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.170
At the same time, the rib cage
is going to rotate up and out,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.993
and therefore expanding the
cavity, the thoracic cavity.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.600
At the end of inspiration,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.120
under normal conditions
when you're aggressed,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.230
you just relax and it's
like pulling on a spring.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.610
You pull down a spring
and you let go and relax.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.840
So, you inhale and you exhale.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.840
Inhale, relax, and exhale.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.820
- So, the exhale is passive?

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.210
- At rest it's passive.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.497
We'll get into what happens
when you need to increase

00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:37.730
the amount of air you're bringing in

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.360
because your ventilation,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.217
your metabolism goes up
like during exercise.

00:13:43.217 --> 00:13:45.330
Now the muscles themselves,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.177
skeletal muscles don't do anything unless

00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:52.503
the nervous system tells
them to do something.

00:13:52.503 --> 00:13:53.717
And when the nervous system tells

00:13:53.717 --> 00:13:56.950
them to do something, they contract.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.700
So, there are specialized
neurons in the spinal cord,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.200
and then above the spinal cord,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.000
the region called the brainstem,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.160
which go to respiratory muscles,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.650
in particular for
inspiration in the diaphragm

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.980
and the external intercostal
muscles in the rib cage.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.470
And they contract.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.300
So, these respiratory muscles
these inspiratory muscles

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.700
become active and they become
active for a period of time,

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.370
then they become silent and
when they become silent,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.023
the muscles then relax back to
their original resting level.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.550
Where does that activity in these neurons

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.870
that innovate the muscle,
which are called motor neurons,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.850
where does that originate?

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.780
Well, this was a question
that's been bandied around

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.830
for thousands of years,

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.740
and when I was a beginning
assistant professor,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.550
it was fairly high priority for me

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.730
to try and figure that out,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.850
because I wanted to understand

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.950
where this rhythm of
breathing was coming from

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.300
and you couldn't know
where it was coming from

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.070
until you knew where it was coming from.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.680
And I didn't phrase that properly.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.910
You couldn't understand
how it was being done

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.800
until you know where to look.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.510
So, we did a lot of experiments,

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.700
which I can go into
detail and finally found,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.030
there was a region in the brainstem,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.000
that's once again this region
sort of above the spinal cord,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.300
which was critical for
generating this rhythm.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.330
It's called the pre-Botzinger complex.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.380
And we can talk about how that was named.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.940
This small site, which contains in humans,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.660
a few thousand neurons,

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.170
it's located on either
side and works in tandem

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.110
and every breath begins with neurons

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.560
in this region beginning to be active,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.530
and those neurons then connect ultimately

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.550
to these motor neurons
going to the diaphragm

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.310
and to the external
intercostals causing them

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.603
to be active and causing
this inspiratory effort.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.490
When the neurons in the
pre-Botzinger complex finish

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.690
their burst of activity,

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:14.210
then inspiration stops and then you begin

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.360
to exhale because of this passive recoil

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.330
of the lung and rib cage.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.740
- Could I just briefly
interrupt you to ask

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.097
a few quick questions
- Of course.

00:16:24.097 --> 00:16:29.097
- before we move forward in
this very informative answer.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.083
The two questions are,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.640
is there anything known
about the activation

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.410
of the diaphragm and
the intercostal muscles

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.530
between the ribs as it relates

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.250
to nose versus mouth breathing,

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.740
or are they activated
in the equivalent way,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.010
regardless of whether or not someone

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.805
is breathing through their nose or mouth?

00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:55.910
- I don't think we fully
have the answer to that.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.180
Clearly there are differences

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.125
between nasal and mouth breathing.

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:04.810
At rest the tendency is
to do nasal breathing

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.152
because the air flows that are necessary

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.735
for normal breathing as easily managed

00:17:11.735 --> 00:17:14.700
by passing through the nasal cavities.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.460
However, when your
ventilation needs to increase

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.400
like during exercise, you
need to move more air,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.917
you do that through your
mouth because the airways

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.800
are much larger then,

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.940
and therefore you can move much more air,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.660
but at the level of the
intercostals and the diaphragm,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.438
their contraction is not,

00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:37.850
is almost agnostic to whether or not

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.410
the nose and mouth are open.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.160
- Okay, so if I understand correctly,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.460
there's no reason to suspect
that there are particular,

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.356
perhaps even non
overlapping sets of neurons

00:17:47.356 --> 00:17:50.620
in pre-Botzinger area of the brainstem

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.033
that triggered nasal versus mouth inhales?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.204
- No, I would say that it's not

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.960
that the pre-Botzinger
complex is not concerned

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.780
and cannot influence that,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.417
but it does not appear as
if there's any modulation

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.790
of whether or not it's where
the air is coming from,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.640
whether it's coming through

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.820
your nasal passages or through your mouth.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.860
- Great. Thank you.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.910
And then the other question I have

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.340
is that these intercostal muscles

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.000
between the ribs then
move the ribs up and out

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.424
if I understand correctly,
and the diaphragm,

00:18:23.424 --> 00:18:26.720
are those skeletal or
as the Brits would say,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.230
skeletal muscles or smooth muscles?

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.330
What type of muscle are
we talking about here?

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.730
- As I said earlier, these are skeletal,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.160
I didn't say there was skeletal muscles,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.100
but they're muscles that need neural input

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.320
in order to move.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.710
You talked about smooth muscles.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.690
They are specialized muscles like we have

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.780
in the gut and in the heart,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.448
and these are muscles that are capable

00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:54.420
of actually contracting
and relaxing on their own.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.970
So, the heart beats,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.150
it doesn't need neural
input in order to beat.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.920
The neural inputs modulate the strength

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.080
of it and the frequency,
but they beat on their own.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.040
The skeletal muscles involved

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.470
in breathing need neural input.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.020
Now, there are smooth muscles

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.317
that have an influence on breathing,

00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:18.560
and these are muscles that
are lining the airways.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.260
And so, the airways have smooth muscle

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.670
and when they become activated,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.400
the smooth muscle can contract or relax,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.010
and when they contract inappropriately

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.790
is when you have problems
breathing like in asthma.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.930
Asthma is a condition

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.400
where you get inappropriate constriction

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.880
of the smooth muscles of the airways.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.355
- So, there's no reason
to think that in asthma

00:19:42.355 --> 00:19:45.500
that the pre-Botzinger or
these other neuronal centers

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.053
in the brain that activate breathing,

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:52.500
that they are involved or
causal for things like asthma?

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.270
- As of now, I would say the
preponderance of evidence

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.010
is that it's not involved,

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.720
but we've not really
fully investigated that.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.553
- Thank you.

00:20:00.553 --> 00:20:02.160
Sorry to break your flow,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.394
but I was terribly
interested in knowing answers

00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:08.438
to those questions and you
provided them, so thank you.

00:20:08.438 --> 00:20:11.770
- Now, remind me again, where I was in my-

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.270
- We were just landing in pre-Botzinger

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.266
and we will return to the naming

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:18.670
of pre-Botzinger because it's a wonderful

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.243
and important story really,

00:20:20.243 --> 00:20:22.560
that I think people should be aware of.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.180
But maybe you could march
us through the brain centers

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.430
that you've discovered
and others have worked

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.840
on as well that control breathing,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.260
pre-Botzinger as well

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.710
as related structures.
- Okay.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.480
So, when we discovered the pre-Botzinger,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.940
we thought that it was the primary source

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.770
of all rhythmic respiratory movements,

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.030
both inspiration and expiration.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:53.030
Their notion of a single
source is like day or night.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.873
It's like they're all coming,

00:20:54.873 --> 00:20:56.970
they all have the same origin

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.670
that the Earth rotates
and day follows night

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.910
and we thought that the
pre-Botzinger complex

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.371
would be inhalation, exhalation.

00:21:05.371 --> 00:21:08.476
And then in a series of experiments

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:12.630
we did in the early part of 2000,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.220
we discovered that there
seemed to be another region

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.470
which was dominant in
producing expiratory movements,

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.023
that is the exhalation.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.570
We had made a fundamental mistake

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.660
with the discovery of the pre-Botzinger,

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.160
not taking into account

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.517
that at rest expiratory muscle activity

00:21:37.517 --> 00:21:39.523
or exhalation is passive.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.100
So, if that's the case,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.770
a group of neurons that might
generate active expiration,

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.080
that is to contract
the expiratory muscles,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.240
like the abdominal muscles

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.860
or the internal intercostals
are just silent.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.957
We just thought it wasn't,

00:21:55.957 --> 00:21:58.520
the air was coming from one place,

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.870
but we got evidence that in fact,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.200
it may have been coming
from another place.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.920
And following up on these experiments,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.440
we discovered that there
was a second oscillator

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.770
and that oscillator is involved

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.920
in generating what we
call active expiration.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.800
That is this act of-
- If I go [exhales].

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.150
- Yeah [exhales], or when
you begin to exercise,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.270
you have to go [panting], and
actually move that air out.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.900
This group of cells,
which is silent at rest

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.170
suddenly becomes active
to drive those muscles,

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.993
and it appears that it's an
independent oscillator when-

00:22:35.993 --> 00:22:37.270
- Maybe you could just clarify

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.830
for people what an oscillator is.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:43.580
- Okay, an oscillator is
something that goes in a cycle.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.080
So, you can have a pendulum

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.220
as an oscillator going back and forth.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.700
The Earth is an oscillator
because it goes around

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.760
and it's day and night.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.680
- Some people's moods are oscillating.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.513
- Oscillating.

00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:56.270
And it depends how regular they are.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.140
You can have oscillators
that are highly regular

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.210
or that are in a watch,

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.260
or you can have those that
are sporadic or episodic.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.160
Breathing is one of those oscillators

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.770
that for life has to be
working continuously 24/7.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.370
It starts late in the third trimester

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.880
because it has to be
working when you're born,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.820
and basically works throughout
life and if it stops,

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.530
if there's no intervention
beyond a few minutes,

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.840
it will likely be fatal.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.510
- What is this second oscillator called?

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.510
- Well, we found that in a
region around the facial nucleus,

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.870
so we initially,

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.185
when this region was initially identified,

00:23:41.185 --> 00:23:45.440
we thought it was involved
in sensing carbon dioxide.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.020
It was what we call a
central chemo receptor.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.590
That is, we want to keep
carbon dioxide levels,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.970
particularly in the brain
at a relatively stable level

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.260
'cause the brain is
extraordinarily sensitive

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.220
to changes in pH.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.520
If there's a big shift in carbon dioxide

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.460
there'll be a big shift in brain pH,

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.500
and that'll throw your brain,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.860
if I can use the technical
term, out of whack.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.430
And so, you want to regulate that

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.780
and the way to regulate
something in the brain

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.830
is you have a sensor in the brain.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.877
And others basically identified

00:24:18.877 --> 00:24:21.230
that the ventral surface of the brainstem,

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.193
that is the part of the
brainstem that's on this side,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.950
was critical for that
and then we identified

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.950
a structure that was near
the trapezoid nucleus.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.300
It was not named in any of
these noranatomical atlases,

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.530
so we just picked the name out of the hat

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.570
and we called it the
retro trapezoid nucleus.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.410
- I should clarify for people.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.370
When Jack is saying trapezoid,

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.453
it doesn't mean the trapezoid muscles.

00:24:49.453 --> 00:24:52.970
Trapezoid refers to the
shape of this nucleus,

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.263
this cluster of neurons.

00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:58.780
Parafacial makes me think
that this general area

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.660
is involved in something
related to mouth or face.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.610
Is it an area rich with
neurons controlling other parts

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.990
of the face, eye blinks,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.950
nose twitches, lip curls, lip smacks?

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.380
- If you go back in an evolutionary sense

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.810
and a lot of things that
are hard to figure out

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.650
begin to make sense when you look

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.280
at the evolution of the nervous system.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.530
When control of facial muscles,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.360
going back to more primitive creatures

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.360
because they had to take things
in their mouth for eating,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.740
so we call that the
face sort of developed,

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.990
the eyes were there, the mouth is there,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.920
these nuclei, the modem that
contained the motor neurons,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.870
a lot of the control
systems for them developed

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.100
in the immediate vicinity.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.900
So, if you think about the face,

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.090
there's a lot of sudden
nuclei around there

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.510
that had various roles

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.840
at various different times in evolution.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.510
And at one point in evolution,

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.350
the facial muscles were
probably very important

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.470
in moving fluid in and out of the mouth

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.960
and moving air in and out of the mouth,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.610
and so part of these
many different sub nuclei

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.810
now seems to be in mammals to be involved

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.250
in the control of expiratory muscles.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.840
But we have to remember that mammals

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.240
are very special when
it comes to breathing,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.540
because we're the only
class of vertebrates

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.490
that have a diaphragm.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.520
If you look at amphibians and reptiles,

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.330
they don't have a diaphragm.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.490
And the way they breathe is
not by actively inspiring

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.550
and passively expiring.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.220
They breathe by actively
expiring and passively inspiring

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.620
because they don't have a
powerful inspiratory muscle.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.620
And somewhere along the line,
the diaphragm developed,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.403
and there are lots of theories
about how it developed.

00:26:58.403 --> 00:26:59.800
I don't think it's particularly clear.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.047
There was something that
you can find in alligators

00:27:04.047 --> 00:27:06.870
and lizards that could
have turned into a muscle

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.020
that was the diaphragm.

00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:12.330
The amazing thing about the diaphragm

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.010
is that it's mechanically
extremely efficient.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.710
And what do I mean by that?

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.950
Well, if you look at how oxygen gets

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.593
from outside the body
into the bloodstream,

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:29.790
the critical passage is across
the membrane in the lung.

00:27:30.087 --> 00:27:33.080
It's called the alveolar
capillary membrane.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.460
The alveolus is part of the lung

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.010
and the blood runs through capillaries,

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:42.640
which are the smallest tubes
in the circulatory system.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.500
And at that point,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.500
oxygen can go from the air
filled alveolus into the blood.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.910
- Which is amazing.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.950
I find that amazing,

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.690
even though it's just purely mechanical,

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.380
the idea we had these
little sacks in our lungs,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.590
we inhale and the air
goes in and literally

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.160
the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream-

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.510
- Passes into the bloodstream.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.960
But the rate of which
it passes will depend

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.666
on the characteristics of the membrane,

00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:12.067
what the distance is between the alveolus

00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.740
and the blood vessel, the capillary.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.040
But the key element is the surface area.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.850
The bigger the surface area,

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.350
the more oxygen that can pass through,

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.290
it's entirely a passive process.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.740
There's no magic about
making oxygen go in.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.070
Now, how do you get a pack,

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.000
a large surface area in a small chest?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.950
Well, you start out with one
tube, which is the trachea,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.880
the trachea expands.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.890
Now you have two tubes.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.380
Then you have four tubes
and it keeps branching.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.610
At some point, at the
end of those branches,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.100
you put a little sphere,
which is an alveolus,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.430
and that determines what the
surface area is going to be.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.670
Now, you then have a mechanical problem.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.370
You have the surface area,

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.590
you have to be able to pull it apart.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:08.290
So, imagine you have a little
square of elastic membrane,

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.060
it doesn't take a lot of
force to pull it apart,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.660
but now if you increase it by 50 times,

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.060
you need a lot more
force to pull it apart.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.910
So, amphibians who were breathing,

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.820
not by compressing the lungs

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.100
and then just passively expanding it

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.320
weren't able to generate a lot of force,

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.600
so they have relatively few branches.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.630
So, if you look at the surface area

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:36.630
that they pack in their lungs
relative to their body size,

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.620
it's not very impressive.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.350
Whereas when you get to mammals,

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.550
the amount of branching that you have

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.359
is you have four to 500,000,000 alveoli.

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:51.650
- If we were to take
those four to 5,000,000-

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.400
- 100,000,000, four to 500,000,000.

00:29:54.633 --> 00:29:58.210
- 100,000,000, excuse me,
and lay those out flat,

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.940
what sort of surface area
are we talking about?

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.030
- About 70 square meters,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.120
which is about a third the
size of a tennis court.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.953
- Wow.

00:30:05.953 --> 00:30:07.163
- So you have a membrane inside of you

00:30:07.163 --> 00:30:09.420
a third the size of a tennis court

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.670
that you actually have
to expand every breath.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.540
And you do that without
exerting much of a,

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.800
you don't feel it,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.020
and that's because you
have this amazing muscle,

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.020
the diaphragm, which
because of its positioning

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.350
just by moving two thirds of an inch down

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.460
is able to expand that membrane enough

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.447
to move air into the lungs.

00:30:31.447 --> 00:30:35.550
Now, the at rest,
- Wow.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.400
- the volume of air in your lungs

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.300
is about two and a half liters.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.380
Do we need to convert that to quartz?

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.213
- No.

00:30:43.213 --> 00:30:45.320
- Right, so about two and a half liters.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.090
When you take a breath,

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.770
you're taking another 500
milliliters or half a liter.

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.820
That's the size maybe of my fist.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.140
So, you're increasing the volume by 20%,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.090
but you're doing that by pulling

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.920
on this 70 square meter membrane.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.530
But that's enough to
bring enough fresh air

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.600
into the lung to mix in with
the air that's already there,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.720
that the oxygen levels in your bloodstream

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.604
goes from a partial pressure of oxygen,

00:31:17.604 --> 00:31:20.180
which is 40 millimeters of mercury

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.120
to 100 millimeters of mercury.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.610
So, that's a huge increase in oxygen

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.940
and that's enough to
sustain normal metabolism.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.940
So, we have this amazing
mechanical advantage

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.630
by having a diaphragm.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.580
- Do you think that our brains are larger

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.930
than that of other mammals in part,

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.230
because of the amount of oxygen

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.850
that we have been able
to bring into our system?

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.550
- I would say a key step in the ability

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.740
to develop a large brain
that has a continuous demand

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.570
for oxygen is the diaphragm.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.323
Without a diaphragm, you're an amphibian,

00:32:02.919 --> 00:32:07.220
and there's another solution
to increasing oxygen uptake

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.820
which is the way birds breathe,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.666
but birds have other limitations

00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:16.550
and they still can't get
brains as big as mammals have.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:21.550
So, the brain utilizes
maybe 20% of all the oxygen

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.311
that we intake and it
needs to continuously.

00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.970
The brain doesn't want to be neglected.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.830
So, this puts certain
demands on breathing system.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.470
In other words, you can't
shut it down for awhile,

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.060
which poses other issues.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.560
You're born, and you have to mature.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.240
You have the small body,
you have a small lung,

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.130
you have a very pliant rib cage,

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.230
and now you have to develop into an adult,

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.150
which has a stiffer rib cage.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.810
And so, there are changes happening

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.010
in your brain and your body,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.410
where the neural control of breathing

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.700
has to change on the fly.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.520
It's not like for things like vision

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.830
where you have the opportunity to sleep

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.900
and while you're sleeping,

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.550
the brain is capable of doing things

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.650
that are not easy to
doing during wakefulness,

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.123
like the construction crew
comes in during sleep.

00:33:14.056 --> 00:33:16.000
The change in breathing has been described

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.610
as trying to build an
airplane while it's flying.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:21.770
- Basically what Jack is saying

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.710
is that respiration
science is more complex

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.270
and hardworking than vision science,

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.467
which is a direct jab at me that some

00:33:29.467 --> 00:33:32.120
of you might've missed, but
I definitely did not miss,

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.040
and I appreciate that you
always take the opportunity

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.880
like a good New Yorker to give me a good,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.680
healthy intellectual jab.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.160
A question related to
diaphragmatic breathing

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.650
versus non diaphragmatic breathing

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.040
because the way you describe it,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.790
the diaphragm is always involved

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.810
but over the years whether it be

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.630
for yoga class or a breathwork thing,

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.640
or you hear online that we should

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.330
be breathing with our diaphragm,

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.320
that rather than lifting our rib cage

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.470
when we breathe [inhales] and our chest,

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.640
that it is "healthier" in air quotes

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.832
or better somehow to have the
belly expand when we inhale.

00:34:10.832 --> 00:34:13.240
I'm not aware of any particular studies

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.140
that have really examined

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:17.040
the direct health
benefits of diaphragmatic

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.160
versus non diaphragmatic breathing,

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.520
but if you don't mind
commenting on anything

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.720
you're aware of as it relates

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.420
to diaphragmatic versus non
diaphragmatic breathing,

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.400
whether or not people tend

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.250
to be diaphragmatic breathers
by default, et cetera,

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.090
that would be, I think
interesting to a number of people.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.220
- Well, I think by default,

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.350
we are obligate diaphragm breathers.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.780
There may be pathologies
where the diaphragm

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.370
is compromised and you
have to use other muscles,

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.513
and that's a challenge.

00:34:49.256 --> 00:34:53.089
Certainly at rest other
muscles can take over,

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.170
but if you need to
increase your ventilation,

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.190
the diaphragm is very important.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.380
It would be hard to increase
your ventilation otherwise.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.960
- Do you pay attention to whether or not

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.490
you are breathing in a manner

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:12.890
where your belly goes out
a little bit as you inhale,

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.160
because I can do it both ways, right?

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.470
I can inhale [inhales], bring my belly in,

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:21.290
or I can inhale [inhales], push
my diaphragm and belly out.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.260
Not the diaphragm out,

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.100
but and that's interesting, right?

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.890
Because it's a completely
different muscle set

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.300
for each version.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.300
- Well, in the context of
things like breath practice,

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.570
I'm a bit agnostic about the effects

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.643
of some of the different
patterns are breathing.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.830
Clearly, some are going to work
through different mechanisms,

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.680
and we can talk about that,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.550
but at a certain level for example,

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.770
whether it's primarily diaphragm

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:55.576
where you move your abdomen or
not, I am agnostic about it.

00:35:55.576 --> 00:36:00.380
I think that the changes
that breathing induces

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.590
in emotion and cognition,

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:06.960
I have different ideas
about what the influence is

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.260
and I don't see that primarily as how,

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.160
which particular muscles you're choosing,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.150
but that just could be my own prejudice.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.983
- Okay.

00:36:17.983 --> 00:36:22.750
We will return to that as a
general theme in a little bit.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.830
I want to ask you about sighing.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.830
One of the many great gifts
that you've given us over

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.500
the years is an
understanding of these things

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.890
that we call physiological sighs.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.640
Could you tell us about
physiological sighs?

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.410
What's known about them,

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.860
what your particular interest in them is

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.593
and what they're good for?

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:52.300
- A very interesting
and important question.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:57.293
So, everyone has a
sense of what a sigh is.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.647
We certainly, when we're emotional,

00:37:00.647 --> 00:37:04.151
in some ways we're stressed,
we're particularly happy,

00:37:04.151 --> 00:37:07.223
[inhales] we'll take a little sigh.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.640
It turns out that we're
sighing all the time.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.200
And when I would ask people

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.020
who are not particularly knowledgeable

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.830
that have read my papers
or James Nestor's book

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.442
or listened to your podcast,

00:37:23.442 --> 00:37:26.830
they're usually off by
two orders of magnitude

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.420
about how frequently we
sigh on the low side.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:35.420
In other words, they say
once an hour, 10 times a day.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.700
We sigh about every five minutes,

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.680
and I would encourage
anyone who finds that

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.390
to be a unbelievable fact,

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.410
is to lie down in a quiet room
and just breathe normally,

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.100
just relax, just let go,

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.840
and just pay attention to your breathing

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.060
and you'll find that
every couple of minutes,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.060
you're [inhales] taking a deep
breath and you can't stop it.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.690
It just happens.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.040
Now, why?

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.490
Well, we have to go
back to the lung again.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.680
The lung has these 500,000,000 alveoli,

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.400
and they're very tiny.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.000
They're 200 microns across.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.200
So, they're really, really tiny.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.090
And you can think of them as fluid filled.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.017
They're fluid lined.

00:38:25.017 --> 00:38:26.590
And the reason their fluid lined

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:31.590
has to do with the esoterica
of the mechanics of that.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.150
It makes it a little easier to stretch

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.670
them with this fluid line,
which is called surfactant.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.850
And surfactant is important
during development,

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.010
it is a determining factor in the,

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.920
when premature infants are born.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.710
If they have not do not
have lung surfactant

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:52.050
it makes it much more
challenging to take care of them

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.600
than after they have lung surfactant,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.900
which is sometime, if
I remember correctly,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.870
in the late second, early third
trimester, which it appears.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.840
In any case it's fluid line.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.130
Now, think of a balloon
that you would blow up,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.203
but now before you blow it up,
fill the balloon with water,

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:13.044
squeeze all the water out and now,

00:39:13.044 --> 00:39:15.290
when you squeeze all the water out

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.340
you notice the sides of the
balloon stick to each other.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.440
Why is that?

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.680
Well, that's because water

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.310
has what's called surface tension.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.980
And when you have two
surfaces of water together,

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.470
they actually tend to stick to each other.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.940
Now, when you try and
blow that balloon up,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.330
you know that it,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.660
or you'll notice if you've
ever done it before,

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.030
that the balloon is a
little harder to inflate

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.940
than if we're dry on the inside.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.773
Why is that?

00:39:41.773 --> 00:39:44.873
Because you have to overcome
that surface tension.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:50.790
Well, your alveoli have
a tendency to collapse.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.120
There's 500,000,000 in them.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.550
They're not collapsing
at a very high rate,

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.906
but it's a slow rate that's not trivial.

00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:02.290
And when an alveolus
collapses it no longer

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.460
can receive oxygen or
take carbon dioxide out.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.730
It's sort of taken out of the equation.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.850
Now, if you have 500,000,000
in them and you lose 10,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.510
no big deal, but if they keep collapsing,

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.020
you can lose a significant part

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.713
of the surface area of your lung.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.270
Now, a normal breath is not
enough to pop them open,

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.450
but if you take [inhales] a deep breath

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.147
it pops them open.
- Through nose or your mouth?

00:40:29.147 --> 00:40:29.980
- Doesn't matter.
- Okay.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.120
- Doesn't matter.
- Or-

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.390
- It just increased that lung volume

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.390
'cause you're just pulling on the lungs,

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.333
they'll pop open every
about every five minutes.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.590
And so, we're doing it every five minutes

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.790
in order to maintain
the health of our lung.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.630
In the early days of
mechanical ventilation,

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.790
which was used to treat polio victims

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.677
who had weakness of their
respiratory muscles,

00:40:55.677 --> 00:41:00.080
they'd be put in these big steel tubes

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.310
and the way that would work
is that the pressure outside

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.140
the body would drop.

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.590
That would put a expansion
pressure on the lungs, excuse me,

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.423
on the rib cage.

00:41:10.423 --> 00:41:13.940
The rib cage would expand and
then the lung would expand.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.060
And then the pressure
would go back to normal

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.391
and the lung and rib cage
would go back to normal.

00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:24.230
This was great for getting ventilation,

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.580
but there was a relatively
high mortality rate.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.790
It was a bit of a mystery.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.610
And one solution was to
just give bigger breaths.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.860
They'd give bigger breaths and
the mortality rate dropped,

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.660
and it wasn't until I
think it was the '50s

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.010
where they realized that they didn't

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.910
have to increase every breath to be big.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:45.830
What they needed to do

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.190
was every so often they
to have one big breath.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.140
So, you have a couple of
minutes of normal breaths,

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.610
and then one big breath just mimicking

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.460
the physiological sighs,

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.090
and then the mortality
rate dropped significantly.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:03.090
And if you see someone on a
ventilator in the hospital,

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.270
if you watch every couple
of minutes that you see

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.910
the membrane move up and down,

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.290
every couple of minutes
there'll be a super breath

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.640
and that pops it open.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.400
So, there are these mechanisms

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.850
for these physiological sighs.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.630
So, just like with the
collapse of the lungs,

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.380
where you need a big
pressure to pop it open,

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.017
it's the same thing with the alveola.

00:42:27.017 --> 00:42:28.750
You need a bigger pressure

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.970
and a normal breath is not enough.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.588
So, you have to take a big inhale.

00:42:32.588 --> 00:42:33.546
[Jack inhales]

00:42:33.546 --> 00:42:34.480
[Jack exhales]

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.420
And what nature has done

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.160
is instead of requiring
us to remember to do it,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.010
it does it automatically.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:43.440
And it does it about every five minutes.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.780
And one of the questions we asked

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.970
is how is this happening?

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.330
Why every five minutes?

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.450
What's doing it?

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:57.450
And we got into it through a back door.

00:42:57.971 --> 00:43:00.670
Typical of the way a lot
of science gets done.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:05.241
This is serendipitous event
where you run across a paper

00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:10.241
and something clicks and
you just, you follow it up.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.450
Sometimes you go down blind ends,

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.283
but this turned out to
be incredibly productive.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.700
One of the guys in my lab was
reading a paper about stress,

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.976
and during stress lots of
things happen in the body,

00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:26.520
one of which is that the hypothalamus,

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.430
which is very reactive to
body state releases peptides,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.160
which are specialized molecules,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.060
which then circulate
throughout the brain and body,

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.440
that particular effects usually

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.930
to help deal better with the stress.

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.500
And one class of the
peptides that are released

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.553
are called Bombesin related peptides.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.583
And he also realize because
he was a breathing guy,

00:43:51.583 --> 00:43:54.630
that when you're stressed you sigh more.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:58.087
So we said, "All right,
maybe they're related."

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.490
Bombesin is relatively cheap to buy.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.677
We said, Let's buy some Bombesin

00:44:03.677 --> 00:44:07.670
and throw it in the brainstem,
let's see what happens."

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:12.670
And one of the nice things
about some experiments

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.550
that we try to design is to fail quickly.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.630
So here we had the idea,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.636
we throw Bombesin in and
the Bombesin did nothin',

00:44:21.636 --> 00:44:25.200
nothing lost, maybe $50
to buy the Bombesin.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.470
But if it did something it
might be of some interest.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:32.010
So, one afternoon we did the
experiment and he comes to me,

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.910
he says, I won't quote
exactly what he said,

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.280
because that might need to be censored,

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.790
but he said, "Look at this."

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.460
And it was in a rat.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.200
Rats sigh about every two minutes.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.400
They're smaller than we are

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.640
and they need to sigh more often.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.640
Their sigh rate went from 20
to 30 per hour to 500 per hour

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.810
when you put Bombesin into
the pre-Botzinger complex.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.920
- [Andrew] Amazing.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.630
- And the way he did
that is he took a very,

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:07.630
very fine glass needle
and anesthetized a rat,

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.540
and inserted that needle directly

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.450
into the pre-Botzinger complex.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.040
So, it wasn't an internalized
delivery of the peptide.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.630
It was localized in the pre-Botzinger,

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.040
and the sigh rate went through the roof.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.856
- And I would add that that
was an important experiment

00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:26.060
to deliver the Bombesin
directly to that site

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.170
because one could have
concluded that the injection

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:30.470
of the Bombesin increased sighing

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.700
because it increased stress

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.010
rather than directly increased sighing.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.820
- Amongst hundreds of other
possible interpretations.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.067
So, the precision here is very important,

00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:43.180
and that goes back to what I
said at the very beginning,

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.430
knowing where this is happening allows

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:47.240
you to do the proper investigations.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.480
If we didn't know where
the inspiratory rhythm

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.710
was originating,

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.170
we've never could have
done this experiment.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:55.870
And so, then we did another experiment.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:46:00.870
We said, "Okay, what
happens if we take the cells

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.860
in the pre-Botzinger that are
responding to the peptides?

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.070
So, neurons will respond to a peptide

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.740
because they have specialized
receptors for that peptide.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.270
And not every neuron
expresses those receptors.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.300
In the pre-Botzinger complex,

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.550
it's probably a few
hundred out of thousands.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:25.420
So, we used the technique
we had used before,

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.730
and this is a technique developed

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.550
by Doug Laffey down in San Diego,

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:35.140
where you could take a peptide

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:39.456
and conjugate it with a
molecule called saporin.

00:46:39.456 --> 00:46:41.670
Saporin is a plant derived molecule,

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.103
which is a cousin to ricin.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.890
And many of your listeners
may have heard of ricin and-

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.347
- It's a ribosomal toxin.

00:46:49.347 --> 00:46:51.848
- It's very nasty.

00:46:51.848 --> 00:46:56.550
A single stab with an
umbrella will kill you,

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.310
which is something that
supposedly happened

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:02.380
to a Bulgarian diplomat
by a Russian operative

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.020
on a bridge in London.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.710
He got stabbed and the way ricin works

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.760
is it goes inside a cell,
crosses the cell membrane,

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.800
goes inside the cell, kills the cell,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.320
then it goes to the next
cell and then the next cell,

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.734
and then the next cell.

00:47:16.734 --> 00:47:21.610
It's extremely dangerous.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.070
In fact, it's virtually impossible

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.220
to work on in a lab in the United States.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.600
They won't let you touch it.
- Ricin?

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.440
- Ricin 'cause-

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.647
- We've worked with saporin many times.

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:35.080
- Saporin is safe because it
doesn't cross cell membranes.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.090
So, you got an injection of saporin,

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.840
it won't do anything because
it stays outside of cells.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.260
- Please, nobody do that,

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.080
even though it doesn't
cross cell membranes,

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.890
please, nobody inject saporin

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:49.170
whether or not you are a
operative or otherwise.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.420
- Thank you, Andrew,
for protecting me there.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.910
So, but what Doug Laffey figured out

00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:00.650
is that when a ligand binds the receptor,

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.240
that's when a molecule
binds to its receptor,

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.060
in many cases that receptor ligand complex

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.850
gets pulled inside the cell.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:13.620
So, it goes from the membrane
of the cell inside the cell.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.776
- Sort of like you can't
go to the dance alone,

00:48:14.776 --> 00:48:17.330
but if you're coupled
up, you get in the door.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:18.200
- That's right.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:23.110
So, what he figured out is he
put saporin to the peptide,

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.460
the peptide binds to its
receptor, it gets internalized

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.010
and then when it's inside the cell,

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.790
saporin does the same
thing that ricin does.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:33.070
It kills the cell,

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.950
but then it can't go into the next cell.

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.472
So, the only cells that get killed,

00:48:37.472 --> 00:48:40.360
or the more polite term ablated,

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.980
are cells that express that receptor.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.820
So, if you have a big
conglomeration of cells,

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.760
you have a few thousand and only 50

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.970
of them which express that receptor,

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.030
then you inject the saporin conjugated

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:58.143
to the ligand for the peptide,
and only those 50 cells die.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:03.720
So, we took Bombesin
conjugated the saporin,

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.770
inject in the pre-Botzinger
complex of rats,

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.910
and it took about a couple of days

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.880
for the saporin to actually ablate cells.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.150
And what happened is that

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.050
the mice started sighing
less and less, excuse me,

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:24.570
the rats started sighing less
and less and less and less,

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.680
and essentially stopped signing.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.610
- So, your student or postdoc, was it?

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:34.720
Murdered these cells,
and as a consequence,

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.548
the sighing goes away.
- Right.

00:49:36.548 --> 00:49:39.700
- What was the consequence
of eliminating sighing

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.700
on the internal state or
the behavior of the rats?

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.870
Did they, in other words,

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.520
if one can't sigh, generate
physiological sighs,

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.564
what is the consequence on state of mind?

00:49:54.564 --> 00:49:57.070
You would imagine that carbon dioxide

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:58.270
would build up more readily

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.670
or to higher levels in the bloodstream

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:04.310
and that the animals
would be more stressed.

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.323
That's a kind of logical
extension of the way we set it up.

00:50:07.323 --> 00:50:10.213
- It was less benign than that.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.770
When the animals got to the point

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.253
where they weren't sighing then,

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.280
and we did not determine this,

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.760
but the presumption was
that their lung function

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.890
significantly deteriorated,

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.890
and their whole health
deteriorated significantly

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.510
and we had to sacrifice them.

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:35.450
So, I can't tell you whether
they were stressed or not,

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:39.173
but their breathing got to
be significantly deteriorated

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.440
that we sacrificed them at that point.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.150
Now, we don't know whether
that is specifically related

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.220
to the fact they didn't sigh

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.920
or that there was secondary damage due

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.330
to the fact that some cells die,

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.060
so we never determined that.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.670
Now, after we did this study,

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.530
to be candid, it wasn't a high priority

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.760
for us to get this out
the door and publish it.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.253
So, it stayed on the shelf.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:13.400
And then I got a phone call
from a graduate student

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.080
at Stanford, Kevin Yackle,

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.620
who starts askin' me

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.360
all these interesting
questions about breathing,

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.530
and I'm happy to answer them

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:27.770
but at some point it concerned
me because he was working

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.979
for a renowned biochemist who worked

00:51:29.979 --> 00:51:34.979
on lung in drosophila, fruit flies,

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:36.270
Mark Krasnow.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.980
- Yeah, got my next door colleague.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.813
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:51:38.813 --> 00:51:41.830
- And I said, "Why are
you asking me this?"

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.630
And he said, "I was an
undergraduate at UCLA

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.270
and you gave a lecture
in my undergraduate class

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.600
and I was curious about
breathing ever since."

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.060
So, that's one of those
things which as a professor,

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.460
you love to hear that actually

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.700
it's something you really
affected the life of a student.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.010
- When you birthed the competitor,

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.610
but you had only yourself to blame.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.260
- No, I don't look at
that as a competitor.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:06.350
I think that there's enough
interesting things to go on.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.367
I know some of our
neuroscience colleagues say,

00:52:08.367 --> 00:52:11.170
"You can work in my lab, but
then when you leave my lab,

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.550
you've got to work on
something different."

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:14.300
- No one I ever trained
would've said that.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.133
It's open field.

00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:17.150
You want to work on
something, you hop in the mix.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.879
- And, but there are people like that,

00:52:19.879 --> 00:52:21.400
neuroscientists like that.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.233
I never felt that-

00:52:22.233 --> 00:52:23.660
- I hear that they're breathing apparati

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.639
are disrupted and that
causes a brain dysfunction

00:52:25.639 --> 00:52:28.320
that leads to the behavior
you just described.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.492
It's actually not true,

00:52:29.492 --> 00:52:31.620
but in terms of the-
- So-

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.620
- So, before we talk
about the beautiful story

00:52:37.595 --> 00:52:41.943
with Yackle and Krasnow and Feldman Lab,

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.230
I want to just make
sure that I understand.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.203
So, if physiological sighs don't happen,

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:54.320
basically breathing overall suffers?

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.259
- Well, that would go
back to the observations

00:52:56.259 --> 00:52:59.300
in polio victims and these iron lungs

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.300
where the principal deficit
was there was no hyperinflation

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:08.628
of the lungs and many of
them deteriorated and died.

00:53:08.628 --> 00:53:10.660
- And just to stay on this one more moment

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.083
before we moved to what
you were about to describe,

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.100
we hear often that people
will overdose on drugs

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.210
of various kinds because
they stopped breathing.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:25.120
So, barbiturates, alcohol
combined with barbiturates

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.241
is a common cause of death for drug users

00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:32.320
and contra-indications of drugs,
and these kinds of things.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.240
You hear all the time
about celebrities dying

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.530
because they combined
alcohol with barbiturates.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.200
Is there any evidence that the sighs

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.320
that occurred during
sleep or during states

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:46.320
of deep, deep relaxation and sedation

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:52.340
that sighs recover the brain?

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:55.530
Because you can imagine that
if the sighs don't happen

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:58.910
as a consequence of some drug
impacting these brain centers,

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:00.300
that that could be one cause

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.380
of basically asphyxiation and death.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.380
- If you look at the progression
of any mammal to death,

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.792
you find that their breathing slows down,

00:54:14.792 --> 00:54:19.792
a death due to natural causes,
their breathing slows down,

00:54:20.852 --> 00:54:24.010
it will stop, and then they'll gasp.

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:26.210
So, we have the phrase
dying gasp [inhales].

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.003
Super large breaths.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.603
They're often described as an
attempt to auto resuscitate,

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.640
that as you take that super deep breath

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.930
and that maybe it can
kickstart the engine again.

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:45.080
We do not know the degree
to such things as gasp

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:48.710
are really sighs that
are particularly large.

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:52.980
And so, if you suppress
the ability to gasp

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.240
in an individual who is
subject to an overdose,

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.010
then whereas they might been able

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.303
to re-arouse their breathing,

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.850
if that's prevented, they
don't get re-aroused.

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:09.023
So, that is certainly a possibility,

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.560
but this has not been investigated.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:17.440
I mean, one of the things
that I'm interested in

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.513
is in individuals who have diseases,

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.673
which will affect pre-Botzinger complex.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:32.450
And there's data in Parkinson's disease

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:34.120
and multiple system atrophy,

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.670
which is another form of neurodegeneration

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.193
where there's loss of
neurons in pre-Botzinger.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:46.437
And the question is, and
it also may happen in ALS,

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.220
sometimes referred to
as Lou Gehrig's disease,

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.103
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:57.913
These individuals often die during sleep.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:03.600
We have an idea that we have not been able

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.600
to get anyone to test is that
patients with Parkinson's,

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.010
patients with MLS typically breathe

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.510
normally during wakefulness.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.760
The disturbances that they have

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.990
in breathing is during sleep.

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:24.420
So, Parkinson's patients at
the end stages of the disease

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.060
often have significant disturbances
in their sleep pattern,

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.070
but not during wakefulness.

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:32.920
And we think that what could be happening

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.320
is that the proximate cause
of death is not heart failure,

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.060
is that they become apneic.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.413
They stop breathing and don't resuscitate.

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.850
And that resuscitation
may or may not be due

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.780
to an explicit suppression of sighs,

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.480
but to an overall suppression

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.840
of the whole apparatus of
the pre-Botzinger complex.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.223
- Got it. Thank you.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.430
So, Yackle calls you up.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:04.430
- So, he calls me up and
he's, great kid, super smart,

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:10.060
and he tells me about these
experiments that he's doing

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:14.330
where he's looking in a database to try

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:17.110
and find out what molecules are enriched

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.500
in regions of the brain that
are critical for breathing.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.730
So, we and others have mapped out

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:25.240
these regions in the brainstem,

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.610
and he was looking at
one of these databases

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.500
to see what's enriched.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.170
And I said, "That's great.

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.590
Will you be willing to sort
of share our work together?"

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:38.470
He says, "No, my advisor
doesn't want me to do that."

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:43.380
So I said, "Okay," but
Kevin's a great kid,

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:48.210
and I enjoy talking to
him and he's a smart guy,

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:53.210
and what I found in academia is that

00:57:55.768 --> 00:57:59.770
the smartest people only
want to hire people smarter

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:02.060
than them and have the preference

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.440
to interact with people smarter than them.

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.720
The faculty who are not
at the highest level

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.780
and at every institution,
there's a distribution.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.720
One's above the mean,
and those below the mean,

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.803
those whom below the mean
are very threatened by that.

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:23.700
And I saw Kevin as like a shining light,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.760
and I didn't care whether he
was going to out-compete me

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.860
because whatever he did was
going to help me in the field,

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:34.060
so I did whatever I can to
help him, to work with Kevin.

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.860
So, at one point I got invited

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.170
to give grand rounds in
neurology at Stanford.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:43.260
It turns out an undergraduate
student who had worked with me

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.160
was now head of the training program

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:49.050
for neurologists at
Stanford and he invited me.

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:52.040
And at the end of my visit,

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:56.440
I go to Mark Krasnow's
office, and Kevin is there,

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.280
and a post-doc punctually

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.980
who was also working
on a project was there.

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.050
And towards the end of the conversation,

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:10.163
Mark says to me,

00:59:13.107 --> 00:59:14.760
"We found this one molecule

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.880
which is highly concentrated

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.197
in an important region for breathing."

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.043
I said, "Oh, that's great.

00:59:21.043 --> 00:59:22.770
What is it?"

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.360
And he says, "I can't tell you

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.810
because we want to work on it."

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:30.240
So, I'm of course I'm disappointed,

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.886
but I realized that the ethic

00:59:33.886 --> 00:59:36.480
in some areas of science or the custom

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.140
in some areas of science

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:40.150
is that until you get a publication,

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:42.110
you'll be relatively restricted

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:43.298
in sharing the information.
- Mark and I

00:59:43.298 --> 00:59:44.131
are going to have a chat

00:59:44.131 --> 00:59:44.964
when I come back.
- Okay, all right.

00:59:44.964 --> 00:59:45.797
- Yeah.

00:59:45.797 --> 00:59:47.330
- Well, he may remember
the story differently,

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.723
but I said okay, and as
I'm walking out the door,

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.292
I remember these experiments I described

00:59:54.292 --> 00:59:55.860
to you about Bombesin,

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:59.240
and that was the only unusual
molecule we're working.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.500
So, the reason I'm rushing out the door

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.320
is I have a flight to catch.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.573
So, I stick my head in and I said,

01:00:06.807 --> 01:00:08.787
"Is this molecule related to Bombesin?"

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.180
And then I run off, I don't
even wait for them to reply.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.370
I can be up for it.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.980
Mark calls me and he says, "Bombesin?

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.220
The peptide we found
is related to Bombesin.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.170
What does it do?"

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.521
And I said, "I'm not telling."

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:26.116
[Andrew laughs]

01:00:26.116 --> 01:00:27.132
- Oh my.

01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:29.790
I'm so glad I wasn't involved
in this collaboration.

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:33.637
- No, no, but that was sort
of a tease 'cause I said,

01:00:33.637 --> 01:00:35.920
"Well, let's work together on this."

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.194
And then we worked together on this.

01:00:37.194 --> 01:00:39.694
- It was a prisoner's
dilemma at that point, yeah.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:46.420
So, Kevin Yackle is spectacular,
has his own lab at UCF,

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.100
and the work that I'm
familiar with from Kevin

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.500
is worth mentioning now, or
I'll ask you to mention it,

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.600
which is this reciprocal
relationship between brain state,

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.080
or we could even say
emotional state and breathing.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.000
And I'd love to get your thoughts
on how breathing interacts

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.890
with other things in the brain.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.020
You've beautifully described

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.593
how breathing controls
the lungs, the diaphragm,

01:01:10.593 --> 01:01:12.169
and the interactions between oxygen

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.690
and carbon dioxide and so forth.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:19.660
But as we know, when we get
stressed, our breathing changes.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.850
When we're happy and relaxed,
our breathing changes.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:25.790
But also if we change our breathing,

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.070
we, in some sense can
adjust our internal state.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:33.280
What is the relationship between
brain state and breathing?

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.380
And if you would,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.810
because I know you have a particular love

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:41.480
of one particular aspect of this,

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.730
what is the relationship
between brain rhythms,

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:47.530
oscillations if you will, and breathing?

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:51.160
- This is a topic which has
really intrigued me over

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.640
the past decade.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.760
I would say before that I was in my silo,

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.460
just interested about how the rhythm

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.090
of breathing is generated,

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.223
and didn't really pay much
attention to this other stuff.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:05.550
For some reason I got interested in it,

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.170
and I think it was triggered by an article

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:11.150
in "The New York Times" about mindfulness.

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:12.690
Now, believe it or not,

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.130
although I had lived in California

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.540
for 20 years at that time, I
never heard of mindfulness.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:21.050
It's staggering how isolated
you can be from the real world.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.680
And I Googled it and there

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.860
was a mindfulness institute at UCLA,

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.323
and they were giving
courses in meditation.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.810
So I said, "Oh, this is great

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:34.580
because I can now see whether or not

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.570
the breathing part of
meditation has anything

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:40.340
to do with the purported
effects of meditation."

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.110
So I signed up for the course,

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:46.140
and as I joked to you
before, I had two goals.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.640
One was to see whether or not
a breathing had an effect,

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.710
and the other was to levitate

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:54.054
because I grew up with
all these Kung Fu things

01:02:54.054 --> 01:02:55.960
and all the monks could levitate

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.723
when they meditated, so why not?

01:02:59.785 --> 01:03:01.430
We have a motto in the lab,

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:02.750
you can't do anything interesting

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.420
if you're afraid of failing,

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.030
and if I fail to levitate,
well, at least I tried.

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.100
And I should tell you now,
I still haven't done it yet,

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.513
but I haven't given up yet.
- Yet.

01:03:11.513 --> 01:03:12.823
- Yet. I haven't given up.

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.210
So, I took this course in mindfulness

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.170
and it became apparent to me

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.180
that the breathing part
was actually critical.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.296
It wasn't simply a distraction or a focus.

01:03:27.296 --> 01:03:32.070
They could have had you
move your index finger

01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:33.050
to the same effect.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:36.590
Really we believed that the
breathing part was involved.

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:41.590
Now, I'm not an unbiased
observer so the question is,

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.253
how can I demonstrate that?

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:48.670
I didn't feel competent to
do experiments in humans,

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:50.030
and I didn't feel I could design

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.280
the right experiments in humans,

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.350
but I felt maybe I can
study this in rodents.

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.990
So we got this idea that we're going

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:02.990
to teach rodents to meditate
and that's laughable,

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:08.370
but we said, but if we can,

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:11.193
then we can actually
study how this happens.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.870
So, believe it or not,

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.290
I was able to get a
sort of a startup grant,

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:21.270
an R21 from NCCIH,

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.980
that's the National
Complementary Medicine Institute.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.820
- A wonderful institute I should mention.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:32.820
Our government puts major
tax dollars toward studies

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:34.830
of things like meditation,

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:37.792
breathwork, supplements,
herbs, acupuncture.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:41.190
This is I think not well-known,

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:46.030
and it's an incredible thing
that our government does that,

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:49.510
and I think it deserves a nod
and more funding [chuckles].

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:50.990
- I totally agree with you.

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:54.240
I think that it's the kind
of thing that many of us,

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.570
including many scientists thinks

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:59.800
is to woo woo and unsubstantiated,

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.872
but we're learning more and more.

01:05:01.872 --> 01:05:03.970
We used to laugh at neuroimmunology,

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:05.490
that the nervous system
didn't have anything

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:09.034
to do with the immune
system and pain itself

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:11.420
can influence your immune system.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.750
I mean, there are all these things

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:15.360
that we're learning
that we use to dismiss,

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.920
and I think there's real
nuggets to be learned here.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.827
So, they went out on a limb

01:05:22.827 --> 01:05:25.760
and they funded this particular project.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.200
And now I'm going to leap
ahead because for three years

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.540
we threw stuff up against
the wall that didn't work.

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:37.540
And recently we had a major breakthrough.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.120
We found a protocol by which

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.173
we can get mice to breathe slowly,

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.703
awake mice to breathe slowly.

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:48.520
I won't tell you.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.900
- Normally they don't breathe slowly.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.733
- No, no.

01:05:50.733 --> 01:05:52.180
In other words, whatever
their normal breath is,

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:55.250
we could slow it down by a factor of 10

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.700
and they're fine doing that.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.270
So, we could do that for,

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:04.270
we did that 30 minutes a
day for four weeks, okay?

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.760
Like a breath practice.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.733
- Do they levitate?

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.710
- We haven't measured that yet [laughs].

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:12.490
I would say a priority,

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:14.497
we haven't seen them floating
to the top of that cage,

01:06:14.497 --> 01:06:15.830
but we haven't weighed them.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.540
Maybe they weigh less.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.720
Maybe levitation is graded.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.310
And so, maybe if you weigh less

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:25.280
it's sort of partial levitation.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.163
In any case,

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.850
we then tested them.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:34.590
And we had control animals, mice,

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:37.150
where we did everything the same,

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.640
except the manipulation we made

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.020
did not slow down their breathing.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.120
So, but they went through everything else.

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.430
We then put them through a
standard for air conditioning,

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.940
which we did with my
colleague, Michael Fanselow,

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:53.720
who's one of the real gurus of fear.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.720
And we measured a standard
test is to put mice

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:03.044
in a condition where they're concerned

01:07:03.044 --> 01:07:06.110
they'll receive a shock and their response

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:07.860
is that they freeze,

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.480
and the measure of how fearful they are

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.993
is how long they freeze.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:16.930
This is well validated and
it's way above my pay grade

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:21.453
to describe the validity of
the test, but it's very valid.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:26.850
The control mice had a freezing time,

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:30.680
which was just the same as
ordinary mice would have.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.513
The ones that went

01:07:31.513 --> 01:07:35.153
through our protocol
froze much, much less.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.100
According to Michael,

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:43.000
the degree to which they
showed less freezing

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.610
was as much as if there

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:47.350
was a major manipulation in the amygdala,

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:48.650
which is a part of the brain

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:51.060
that's important in fear processing.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.523
It's a staggering change.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.000
The problem we have now is
the grant ran out of money,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.190
the postdoc working on it left,

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:02.213
and now we have to try and
piece together everything,

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:06.070
but the data is spectacular.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.250
- Well, I think it's,

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.550
I'll just pause you for a moment there

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:09.800
because I think that the,

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.220
you're talking about a rodent study,

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.543
but I think the benefits
of doing rodent study

01:08:13.543 --> 01:08:16.291
is that you can get deep into mechanism

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:20.470
and for people that might think,

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:22.790
well, we've known that
meditation has these benefits,

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.379
why do you need to get
mechanistic science?

01:08:24.379 --> 01:08:27.210
I think that one thing that's important

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:30.120
for people to remember
is that first of all,

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.640
as many people as one might think

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.333
are meditating out there
or doing breathwork,

01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:37.360
a far, far, far, far greater number

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.950
of people are not, right?

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.797
I mean, the majority of
people don't take any time

01:08:41.797 --> 01:08:45.842
to do dedicated breathwork nor meditate.

01:08:45.842 --> 01:08:50.670
So, whatever can incentivize
people would be wonderful.

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:53.390
But the other thing is that
it's never really been clear

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.620
to me just how much meditation

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.750
is required for a real effect,
meaning a practical effect.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:01.870
People say 30 minutes a
day, 20 minutes a day,

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:04.445
once a week, twice a week,
same thing with breathwork.

01:09:04.445 --> 01:09:07.660
Finding minimum or effective thresholds

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.870
for changing neural circuitry

01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:13.780
is what I think is the holy
grail of all these practices.

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.190
And that's only going to be determined

01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:17.420
by the sorts of mechanistic
studies that you described.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.530
So, this is wonderful.

01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:21.450
I do hope the work gets
completed and we can talk

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:24.850
about ways that we can ensure
that that happens, but-

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:28.360
- But let me add one thing to
what you're saying, Andrew.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.750
One of the issues, I
think for a lot of people

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:34.440
is that there's a placebo effect.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.170
That is in humans, they
can respond to something

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:39.715
even though the mechanism has nothing

01:09:39.715 --> 01:09:43.480
to do with what the intervention is.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.560
And so, it's easy to say
that the meditative response

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.803
has a big component,
which is a placebo effect.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.450
My mice don't believe
in the placebo effect.

01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:58.270
And so, if we could show there's
a bonafide effect in mice,

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:01.220
it is convincing in ways that no matter

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.260
how many human experiments you did,

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.750
the control for the placebo effect

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:06.910
is extremely difficult in humans.

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:09.610
In mice, it's a non-issue.

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:12.090
So, I think that that in of itself

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:14.530
would be an enormous message to send.

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:17.513
- Excellent, and indeed, a better point.

01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:23.650
I think a 30 minute a day
meditation in these mice,

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.100
if I understand correctly, the meditation,

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.160
we don't know what they're
thinking about, but-

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.230
- Well, it's breath practice really.

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:30.407
- Right, so it's breath practice.

01:10:30.407 --> 01:10:32.840
So, because presumably
they're not thinking

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.970
about their third eye center,

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.300
lotus position,
levitation, whatever it is.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.190
They're not instructed as to what to do,

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:40.500
and if they were, they
probably wouldn't do it anyway.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.120
So, 30 minutes a day in which breathing

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.410
is deliberately slowed
or is slowed relative

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.150
to their normal patterns of breathing.

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:48.983
Got it.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.513
What was the frequency of
sighing during that 30 minutes?

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.300
Unclear?
- We don't know yet.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.620
- Oh.
- Well, no, we have the data.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.480
We just, we're analyzing that data.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.363
- To be determined, or to
be announced at some point.

01:11:01.363 --> 01:11:06.320
So, the fear centers
are altered in some way

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.930
that creates a shorter fear
response to a foot shock.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:12.530
- [Jack] Right.

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:13.750
- What are some other examples

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.100
that you are aware of from
work in your laboratory

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.140
or work in other
laboratories for that matter

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.839
about interactions between breathing

01:11:19.839 --> 01:11:22.460
and brain state or emotional state?

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.430
- So, this goes back to
our prior conversation.

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.103
I sort of went off on a tangent.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:34.370
I think we need to think
separately of the effect

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:39.277
of volitional changes
of breathing on emotion

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.400
versus the effect of
brain state on breathing.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.750
So, the effect of brain state on breathing

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:54.440
like when you're stressed is a affect,

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.043
presumably originating in higher centers

01:11:57.043 --> 01:12:00.223
if I can use that term
affecting breathing.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.720
It's the reciprocal is that
when you change breathing,

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.750
it affects your emotional state.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.867
I think of those two things as different

01:12:10.867 --> 01:12:13.130
and they're ultimately tied together.

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.570
So, there's a landmark
paper published in the '50s

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:20.520
where they stimulated
in the amygdala of cats,

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.490
and depending on where they stimulated,

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:25.360
they got profound changes in breathing.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.910
There's like every pattern of breathing

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.040
could possibly imagine,

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.540
they found the site in the amygdala,

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.330
which could produce that.

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:34.810
So, there's clearly a powerful
descending effect coming

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:38.130
from the amygdala which is a major site

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:41.150
for processing emotion,
fear, stress and whatnot

01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:43.180
that can affect breathing.

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.810
And clearly we have volitional
control over breathing.

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.700
So, we have profound effects there.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.100
Now, I should say about
emotional control of breathing,

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.293
I need to segue into talking
about locked-in syndrome.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.240
Locked-in syndrome is a devastating lesion

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.980
that happens in a part of the brainstem

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:07.980
where signals that controlled
muscles are transmitted.

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.640
So the fibers coming
from your motor cortex

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:16.570
go down to this part of the brainstem,

01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:19.250
which is called the ventral pons.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:24.223
And if there's a stroke there,
it can damage these pathways.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.100
What happens in individuals
who have locked-in syndrome

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.860
is they lose all volitional movement

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.380
except lateral movement of the eyes

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.450
and maybe the ability to blink.

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:39.710
The reason they're able to
still blink and move their eyes

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:44.710
is that those control centers
are rostal, closer to,

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.600
are not interrupted.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.483
In other words, the
interruption is below that.

01:13:51.679 --> 01:13:54.640
They continue to breathe
because the centers

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.390
for breathing don't require
that volitional command.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:01.380
In any case, they're below
that, so they're fine.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.490
So, these people continue to breathe.

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:08.490
Normal intelligence, but they can't move.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.067
There's a great book called

01:14:10.067 --> 01:14:11.540
"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:16.540
about a young man who this happens to,

01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:19.960
and he describes his life

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.340
and it's a real testament

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:25.210
to the human condition that he does this.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.450
It's a remarkable book, it's a short book.

01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:28.790
- Did he write the book by blinking?

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:29.690
Did they translate it?

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.583
- He did it by blinking to his caretaker.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.453
It's pretty amazing.

01:14:34.453 --> 01:14:37.180
And there was a movie
which I've never seen

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.398
with Javier Bardem as the protagonist,

01:14:40.398 --> 01:14:44.453
but the book I highly recommend
this to anyone to read.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.063
So, I had colleagues
studying an individual

01:14:47.063 --> 01:14:51.060
that had locked-in syndrome and they,

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.673
this patient breathed very robotically,

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.610
totally consistent, very regular.

01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:01.360
They gave the patient a low
oxygen mixture to breathe.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.880
Ventilation went up, a
CO2 mixture to breathe,

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.713
ventilation went up.

01:15:05.713 --> 01:15:08.480
So, all the regulatory apparatus
for breathing was there.

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:10.383
They asked the patient

01:15:10.383 --> 01:15:13.340
to hold his breath or to breathe
faster [blows raspberry].

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.010
Nothing happened.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.040
Just the patient recognized the command,

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.060
but couldn't change it.

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:19.893
Then all of a sudden,

01:15:19.893 --> 01:15:22.770
the patient's breathing
changed considerably,

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.230
and they said to their
patient, "What happened?"

01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:27.147
They said, "You told
a joke and I laughed."

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.835
And they went back and
whenever they told a joke

01:15:30.835 --> 01:15:33.260
that the patient found funny,

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.580
the patient's breathing pattern changed.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:39.030
And you know your breathing
pattern when you laugh

01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:42.320
is [inhales] you inhale,
you go ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.980
But it's also very distinctive.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.260
We have some neuroscience
colleagues who will go un-named,

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.360
who, if you heard them
laugh 50 yards away,

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.740
you know exactly who they are.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.174
- Yeah, well, I'll name him.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:55.340
Eric Kandel,
- For one.

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.860
- has an inspiratory laugh.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.630
He's famous for a [inhaling],

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:00.010
as opposed to a ha, ha.

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:01.710
- Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah.

01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:06.710
So, it's very stereotyped,
but it's maintained

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:10.180
and these people lose
volitional control of breathing.

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.710
So, there's an emotive component
controlling your breathing,

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:15.110
which has nothing to do

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:17.770
with your volitional control,

01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:19.740
and it goes down to a different pathway

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.440
because it's not disrupted
by this locked-in syndrome.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.423
If you look at motor control of the face,

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.180
we have the volitional
control of the face,

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.770
but we also have emotional
control of the face,

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:36.190
which most of us can't control.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:38.008
So, when we look at another person,

01:16:38.008 --> 01:16:41.570
we're able to read a lot about

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:43.850
what their emotional state is,

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:46.500
and that's a lot about
how primates communicate,

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.140
humans communicate and you have people

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.260
who are good deceivers.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.620
Probably used car salesman, poker players.

01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:58.440
Now poker players have tells,

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.320
but many of them now wear dark glasses

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.659
because a lot of the tells
you blink or whatnot.

01:17:03.659 --> 01:17:04.560
- Pupil sizes and stuff.
- Pupil size.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.560
Pupil size is a tell, which
is an autonomic function,

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.500
not a skeletal muscle function,

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.580
but we have all these skeletal muscles,

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:19.276
which we're controlling,
which give us away.

01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:23.260
I've tried to get my imaging friends

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.110
to image some of the great actors

01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:27.680
that we have in Los Angeles.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.630
- You mean brain imagers.

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:30.440
- Brain imagers, I'm sorry.
- Yeah. No, that's all right.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.340
- I mean, yeah, no, brain imagers.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:37.340
Because I think when I ask you to smile,

01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:41.245
I could tell that you're not happy

01:17:41.245 --> 01:17:43.760
that you're smiling because
I asked you to smile.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.593
I think that you're-
- I thought you were

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.540
about to crack a joke,

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.050
but we're old friends, so, yeah.

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:49.333
- No, I'm not...

01:17:51.025 --> 01:17:54.750
When you see a picture like
at a birthday or whatnot,

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:57.330
and say cheese, you could tell

01:17:57.330 --> 01:17:58.437
that at least half of the people

01:17:58.437 --> 01:18:01.190
are not happy to saying cheese,

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:05.073
whereas a great actor when they're able

01:18:05.073 --> 01:18:07.324
to dissemble and the fact that they're sad

01:18:07.324 --> 01:18:10.670
or they're happy, you believe
that they're not faking it.

01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:13.020
It's like, that's great acting.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.323
And I don't think everyone could do that.

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:18.120
I think that the individuals
who are able to do that

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.530
have some connection to the parts

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.032
of their motive control system

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.030
that the rest of us don't have.

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:27.920
Maybe they develop it through
training and maybe not,

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.490
but I think that this can be imaged

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:33.010
so I would like to get
one of these great actors

01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:36.177
in a imager and have them go through that

01:18:36.177 --> 01:18:38.290
and then get a normal person,

01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:40.147
and see whether or not
they can emulate that

01:18:40.147 --> 01:18:42.760
and I think you're going
to find big differences

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.880
in the way they control
this emotive thing.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.370
So, this emotive control
of the facial muscles,

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:50.060
I think is in large part,

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.460
similar to the emotive
control of breathing.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.840
So, there's that emotive control,

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.252
and there's that volitional
control and they're different.

01:18:58.252 --> 01:19:00.250
They're different.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:03.780
Now, you asked me about the Yackle stuff.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.710
The Yackle paper had to do with ascending,

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:10.470
that the effect of breathing on emotion.

01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:14.500
What Kevin found was that
there was a population

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:18.420
of neurons in the pre-Botzinger complex

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.290
that we're always looking at the things

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:23.490
that are projecting
ultimately on motor neurons.

01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:25.070
He found the population of cells

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:27.980
that projected to locus coeruleus.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.720
Locus coeruleus, excuse me,

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.290
is one of those places in the brain

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:34.680
that seems to go everywhere.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.670
- It's like a sprinkler system.

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.580
- Exactly, exactly.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.810
And influence mood, and you've
had podcasts about this.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.220
I mean, there's a lot of stuff
going on with the amygdala,

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.600
so, excuse me, the locus coeruleus.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.950
So you get into the locus coeruleus,

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.550
you can now spray information

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:52.120
out throughout the entire brain.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.797
He found specific cells that projected

01:19:55.797 --> 01:19:59.493
from pre-Botzinger to locus coeruleus,

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.503
and that these cells are
inspiratory modulated.

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:09.920
Now, it's been known for
a long time since the '60s

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:13.650
that if you look in the
locus coeruleus of cats

01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:14.880
when they're awake,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.793
you find many neurons that
have respiratory modulation.

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:20.344
No one paid much attention.

01:20:20.344 --> 01:20:22.530
Why bother?

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:23.960
Not why bother paying attention,

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.880
but why would the brain
bother to have these inputs?

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.920
So, what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwarz

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.373
in Liqun Luo's lab,

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.820
is they killed, ablated,

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.670
those cells going to locus coeruleus

01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:43.773
from pre-Botzinger and
the animals became calmer,

01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:47.680
and their EEG levels changed in ways

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.890
that are indicative
that they became calmer.

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:51.830
- And as I recall, they
didn't just become calmer,

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:55.530
but they weren't really
capable of high arousal states.

01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:57.003
They were kind of flat.

01:20:58.129 --> 01:21:02.625
- I don't think we really
pursued that in the paper.

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:07.625
And so, we'd have to ask
John Huguenard about that,

01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:09.560
but I-
- He's on the other side

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.280
of my lab so we'll ask him.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.993
But nonetheless,

01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:17.860
that beautifully illustrates

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.340
how there is a bi-directional
control, right?

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.370
Of emotion-
- Well, that's ascending.

01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:28.370
- Well, no, the two stories
of the locked-in syndrome,

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.060
plus the Yackle paper shows

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.307
that emotional states influence breathing

01:21:33.307 --> 01:21:35.633
and breathing influences emotional states,

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.950
which, but you mentioned inspiration,

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.700
which I always call inhalation,
but people will follow.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.533
No, that's fine.

01:21:42.533 --> 01:21:44.090
Those are interchangeable.

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:45.240
People can follow that.

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:48.710
There's some interesting
papers from Noam Sobel's group

01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:49.900
and from a number of other groups

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.440
that as we inhale or right
after we inhale [inhales],

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.590
the brain is actually
more alert and capable

01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.500
of storing information
than during exhales,

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.650
which I find incredible
but it also makes sense.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.946
I'm able to see things far
better when my eyes are open

01:22:03.946 --> 01:22:06.633
than when my eyelids are
closed, for that matter.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.463
- Maybe, right?

01:22:09.463 --> 01:22:13.393
I mean, I don't doubt,
Noam's work is great.

01:22:15.214 --> 01:22:18.940
Let me backtrack a bit
because I want people

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.920
to understand that when we're talking

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.440
about breathing affecting
emotional cognitive state,

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.743
it's not simply coming from pre-Botzinger.

01:22:28.885 --> 01:22:33.100
There are at least, well,
there are several other sites

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.240
and let me sort of describe,

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.940
I need to sort of go through that.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.010
One is olfaction.

01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:41.530
So, when you're breathing,
normal breathing,

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:44.020
you're inhaling and exhaling.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:48.200
This is creating signals
coming from the nasal mucosa

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.760
that is going back into
the olfactory bulb.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.040
That's respiratory modulating.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.630
And the olfactory bulb
has a profound influence

01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:00.910
and projections through
many parts of the brain.

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:05.110
So, there's a signal arising
from this rhythmic moving

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.360
of air in and out of the nose

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.153
that's going into the brain
that has contained in it

01:23:10.153 --> 01:23:12.390
a respiratory modulation.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:14.040
So, that signal is there.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.720
The brain doesn't have to be using it,

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.740
but when it's the discriminating
owner and whatnot,

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.050
that's riding on a oscillation,

01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:22.833
which is respiratory related.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.250
Another potential source
is the vagus nerve.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.640
The vagus nerve is a major nerve,

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:34.320
which is containing efferents
from all of the viscera.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.626
- Efferents just being-
- A signal.

01:23:35.626 --> 01:23:37.530
- Signals to.
- Yes.

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.140
Signals from the viscera.

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:42.360
It also has signals coming
from the brainstem down,

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.920
which are called efferents,

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.250
but it's getting major signals
from the lung, from the gut.

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:51.750
And this is going up into the brain stem.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:52.993
So, it's there.

01:23:54.679 --> 01:23:58.050
There are very powerful
receptors in the lung

01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:01.280
that are responding to the lung volume.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.332
The lungs stretch.

01:24:02.332 --> 01:24:03.727
- So, bareovers?

01:24:03.727 --> 01:24:04.737
Oh, sorry.

01:24:04.737 --> 01:24:06.680
We have a number of,
- They're pressure receptors.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.570
- Like the PA0 receptors of
this year's Nobel Prize, yeah.

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:11.403
- Yeah.

01:24:11.403 --> 01:24:14.490
So, they're responding to the expansion

01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:16.990
and relaxation in the lung.

01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:19.100
And so, if you record
from the vagus nerve,

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.070
you'll see that there's a huge
respiratory modulation due

01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:25.080
to the mechanical changes in the lung.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.610
Now, why that is of interest is that

01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:32.873
for some forms of refractory depression,

01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:36.700
electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.763
can provide tremendous relief.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.640
Why this is the case still
remains to be determined,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.160
but it's clear that
signals in the vagus nerve,

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.860
at least artificial
signals in the vagus nerve

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:52.740
can have a positive effect
on reducing depression.

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:55.010
So, it's not a leap to think

01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:57.250
that under normal circumstances,

01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:00.460
that that rhythm coming
in from the vagus nerve

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:03.283
is playing a role in normal processing.

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:07.090
Okay, let me continue.

01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:09.340
Carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.

01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.630
Now, under normal circumstances,

01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:14.640
your oxygen levels are fine.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.850
And unless you go to altitude,

01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:19.170
they don't really change very much,

01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:22.310
but your CO2 levels can change quite a bit

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:23.990
with even a relatively small change

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:25.980
in your overall breathing.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:27.853
That's going to change your pH level.

01:25:29.251 --> 01:25:32.430
I have a colleague, Alicia Maurette,

01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:35.010
who has working with patients

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:40.010
who are anxious and many
of them hyperventilate.

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.610
And as a result of that hyperventilation,

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:45.493
their carbon dioxide levels are low.

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:51.660
And she has developed
a therapeutic treatment

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.680
where she trains these people

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.674
to breathe slower and to restore

01:25:57.674 --> 01:26:01.220
their CO2 levels back to normal,

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:04.193
and she gets relief in their anxiety.

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:09.840
So, CO2 levels, which are not
going to affect brain function

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.693
on a breath by breath level,

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.850
although it does fluctuate
breath by breath,

01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:19.070
but it's sort of this continuous
background can change,

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:21.170
and if it's changed chronically,

01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:24.800
we know that highly elevated levels of CO2

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.804
can produce panic attacks.

01:26:27.804 --> 01:26:32.804
And we don't know the degree
to that gets exacerbated

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.440
by people who have a panic attack,

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.070
the agree to which
their ambient CO2 levels

01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:42.910
are affecting their degree of discomfort.

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:46.460
- What about people who
are, tend to be too calm,

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.178
meaning that they're feeling sleepy,

01:26:48.178 --> 01:26:53.040
they're under breathing as
opposed to over-breathing?

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.790
Is there any knowledge of what the status

01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.470
of CO2 is in their system?

01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:59.688
- I don't know which doesn't
mean there's no knowledge,

01:26:59.688 --> 01:27:04.688
but I'm unaware but
that's blissfully unaware.

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:07.630
I've not looked at that
literature, so I don't know.

01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:10.470
- And I have a feeling, I mean,
most people, or excuse me,

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:12.920
most of the scientific
literature around breathing

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.360
in humans that I'm aware of relates

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.780
to these stressed states because they're

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.350
a little bit easier to study in the lab,

01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:19.880
whereas people feeling under-stimulated

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.150
or exhausted all the time,

01:27:21.150 --> 01:27:23.450
it's a complicated thing to measure.

01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:25.230
I mean, you can do it, but it's not as-

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:27.050
- Well, CO2's easy to measure.

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:32.050
- But in terms of sort of the
measures for feeling fatigue,

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:33.530
they're somewhat indirect,

01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.950
whereas stress we can get a pulse rates

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.190
in HRV and things of that sort.

01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:39.708
- Well, I'd imagine that these devices

01:27:39.708 --> 01:27:42.630
that we're all wearing will
soon be able to measure,

01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:44.600
well, now they can measure oxygen levels,

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.860
oxygen saturation.
- Just amazing.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:51.850
- Yeah, but oxygen will pretty much stay

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:56.120
above 90% unless there's some pathology

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:56.953
or you go to altitude.

01:27:56.953 --> 01:28:01.953
But CO2 levels vary
quite a bit and in fact,

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.440
because they vary, your
body is so sensitive,

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.753
the control of breathing,

01:28:06.753 --> 01:28:09.180
like how much you breathe per minute

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:12.030
is determined in a very sensitive way

01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:14.120
by the CO2 level.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.240
So, even a small change in your CO2

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.420
will have a significant
effect on your ventilation.

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.280
So, this is another thing

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.970
that not only changes the ventilation,

01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:26.550
but affects your brain state.

01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:29.767
Now, another thing that
could affect breathing,

01:28:29.767 --> 01:28:31.550
or how breathing practice can affect

01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:36.400
your emotional state is
simply descending command

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.380
because breathing practice
involves volitional control

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.500
of your breathing,

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.060
and therefore there's a signal

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.210
that's originating somewhere
in your motor cortex.

01:28:46.210 --> 01:28:47.760
That is not, of course,

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.140
that's going to go down to pre-Botzinger,

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.680
but it's also going to send off
collaterals to other places.

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.336
Those collaterals could
obviously influence

01:28:55.336 --> 01:28:56.763
your emotional state.

01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:01.730
So, we have quite a few
different potential sources.

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:03.423
None of them that are exclusive.

01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:06.600
There's an interesting paper,

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.600
which shows that if you
block nasal breathing,

01:29:11.777 --> 01:29:13.880
you still don't see breathing

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.120
related oscillations in the brain.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:20.670
And this is where I think the mechanism

01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:23.207
is occurring is that these breathing

01:29:23.207 --> 01:29:25.423
related oscillations in the brain,

01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:28.840
they are playing a role
in signal processing.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.570
And maybe, should I talk a
little bit about the role

01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:34.210
that oscillations may be
playing in signal processing?

01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:35.860
- Definitely, but before you do,

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:39.940
I just want to ask you
a intermediate question.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:41.164
We've talked a lot about inhalation,

01:29:41.164 --> 01:29:43.603
inspiration and exhalation.

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:46.790
What about breath holds?

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:50.150
In apnea, for instance, people
are holding their breath,

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:53.830
whether or not it's
conscious or unconscious,

01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:55.100
they're holding their breath.

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.110
What's known about breath holds in terms

01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.920
of how it might interact with
brain state or oxygen CO2,

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.590
and I'm particularly
interested in how breath holds

01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:06.380
with lungs empty versus breath holds

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:08.520
with lungs full might differ

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.280
in terms of their impact on the brain.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.465
I'm not aware of any
studies on this looking

01:30:13.465 --> 01:30:14.960
at a mechanistic level,

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.510
but I find it really interesting

01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:18.430
and even if there are no studies,

01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:20.720
I'd love if you care to speculate.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.190
- Well, one of the breath practices

01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:26.010
that intrigued me is where
you basically hyperventilate

01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:28.480
for a minute and then hold your breath

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.520
for as long as you can.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.400
- Tummo style,
- Yeah, brief shots of air.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.790
- Wim Hof style or,

01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:33.750
we call it in the laboratory,

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:36.993
because frankly before
Tummo, and before Wim,

01:30:39.472 --> 01:30:43.030
it was referred to as
cyclic hyperventilation.

01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:45.470
So, it was basically [panting], right?

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:47.000
Followed by a breath
hold and that breath hold

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.858
could be done with lungs
full or lungs empty.

01:30:48.858 --> 01:30:49.691
- Right, yeah.

01:30:49.691 --> 01:30:52.980
So, I had a long talk with some colleagues

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.520
about what they might think
inline mechanisms are,

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.760
particularly for the breath hold.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.760
And I certainly envisioned that there's

01:31:05.035 --> 01:31:07.139
a component with respect to the presence

01:31:07.139 --> 01:31:11.060
or absence of that
rhythmicity in your cortex,

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.610
which is having effect.

01:31:12.610 --> 01:31:15.410
But the other thing with
the hyperventilation,

01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:16.810
hypoventilation or the apnea

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:23.410
is your CO2 levels are
going from low to high.

01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:24.810
- Anytime you're holding your breath.

01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.947
- Anytime you hold your breath, okay?

01:31:26.947 --> 01:31:29.600
And those are going to
have a profound influence.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.510
Now, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia

01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:38.070
because there's a lot of work going on

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:39.410
particularly with Gordon Mitchell

01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:40.350
at the University of Florida

01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:44.810
is doing some extraordinary
work on episodic hypoxia.

01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:46.230
So, in the '80s,

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:50.823
David Millhorn did some
really intriguing work.

01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:55.690
If I ask you to hold
your breath, excuse me.

01:31:55.690 --> 01:32:00.690
If I gave you a low oxygen
mixture for a couple of minutes,

01:32:01.053 --> 01:32:04.031
your breathing level would
go up 'cause you want to

01:32:04.031 --> 01:32:06.120
have more oxygen.
- You're starving for air.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:06.953
- [Andrew and Jack] Yeah.

01:32:06.953 --> 01:32:07.786
- No, you're starving for oxygen.

01:32:07.786 --> 01:32:08.833
- All right.
- Okay?

01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.620
And for a couple of minutes, you'd go up.

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:16.320
You can reach some steady state level.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.710
Not so hypoxic that you
can't reach an equilibrium.

01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:22.060
And then I give you room air again,

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.723
the ventilation quickly
relaxes back down to normal.

01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:31.010
If on the other hand, I gave
you three minutes of hypoxia,

01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:34.760
five minutes of normoxia,
three minutes of hypoxia,

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.140
five minutes of normoxia,
three minutes of hypoxia,

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.054
five minutes in normoxia-

01:32:38.054 --> 01:32:40.513
- Normoxia being normal air.
- Normal air.

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:43.260
Your ventilation goes up, down,

01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:45.180
up, down, up, down, up, down.

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:47.100
After the last episode,

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:50.840
your breathing comes down and
doesn't continue to come down,

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:55.403
but rises again and
stays up for hours, okay?

01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:58.750
This is well validated now.

01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.210
This was originally done in animals,

01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:01.670
but in humans all the time,

01:33:01.670 --> 01:33:04.580
it seems to have profound benefit

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:08.240
on motor function and cognitive function.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.350
- In what direction?

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.660
- Positive, positive.

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:15.950
I've often toyed with the
idea of getting an 8% oxygen,

01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:17.410
don't do this, listeners,

01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:21.200
getting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.410
when I'm writing a grant and
doing like in "Blue Velvet"

01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:28.220
and going through the episodic hypoxia

01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.400
to improve my cognitive functioning,

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.463
'cause certainly could use improvement

01:33:31.463 --> 01:33:32.840
when I'm writing grants.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.930
- But you could do this
without the low oxygen.

01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:38.090
I mean, you could do this
through breathwork, presumably?

01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:40.603
- It's hard to lower your oxygen enough.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.110
Okay?

01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:44.610
In the experimental studies,

01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:47.140
they typically use 8% oxygen.

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.240
It's hard to hold your breath long enough.

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.240
And there is another difference here,

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.380
that is what's happening
to your CO2 levels.

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.240
When you hold your breath,

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.380
your oxygen levels are dropping,

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.670
your CO2 levels are going up.

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:06.343
When you're doing episodic hypoxia,

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:10.110
your CO2 levels are going
to stay pretty normal

01:34:11.107 --> 01:34:12.053
because you're still breathing,

01:34:12.053 --> 01:34:13.830
it's just the oxygen levels are gone.

01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:16.590
- So, unlike normal conditions,
which you described before,

01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:20.004
where oxygen is relatively
constant and CO2

01:34:20.004 --> 01:34:22.560
is fluctuating depending
on emotional state

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.420
and activity and things of that sort,

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:29.040
in episodic hypoxia, CO2
is relatively constant,

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.960
but you're varying the oxygen level coming

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.330
into the system quite a bit.

01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:33.620
- I would say it's relatively,

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.761
I would say CO2 is relatively constant,

01:34:36.761 --> 01:34:40.380
but it's not going to go in a direction

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.770
which is going to be
significantly far from normal.

01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:45.800
Whereas when you're holding your breath,

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.137
you're going to become both hypoxic

01:34:47.137 --> 01:34:49.570
and hypercapnic at the same time.

01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:50.613
- We should explain to people what hypoxic

01:34:50.613 --> 01:34:52.279
and hypercapnic are because we

01:34:52.279 --> 01:34:53.270
haven't done it.
- Okay, hypoxic is just

01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:55.960
the technical term for
low levels of oxygen,

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.130
hyper, or you could
hypoxic, low, hyper is high.

01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:05.120
So, hyperoxia or hypocapnia,
low CO2 or hypercapnia,

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.527
your highest levels of CO2.

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:14.180
So, when you're, in episodic
hypoxia, if anything,

01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:18.420
you're going to become
hypocapnic, not hypercapnic.

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:20.870
And that could play an influence in this.

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:23.164
One example that I remember,

01:35:23.164 --> 01:35:27.180
and Gordon will have to forgive
me if I'm misquoting this,

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.180
is they had a patient who had a stroke

01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:35.303
and had weakness and ankle flection.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:41.230
That is, excuse me, ankle
extension, to extend the ankle.

01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:43.860
And so, they had the patient

01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.930
in a seat where they can
measure ankle extension,

01:35:46.930 --> 01:35:49.320
and then they measured it

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.860
and then they exposed the patient

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.330
to episodic hypoxia and
they measured again,

01:35:54.330 --> 01:35:58.253
the strength of the ankle
extension went way up.

01:35:59.110 --> 01:36:01.080
And so, Gordon is looking at this,

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.270
they're looking at this
now for spinal cord rehab.

01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:08.052
- And I imagine for all sorts
of neuromuscular performance,

01:36:08.052 --> 01:36:09.558
it could be beneficial.

01:36:09.558 --> 01:36:12.840
- Gordon is looking into
athletic performance.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.910
We have a project which
we haven't been able

01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:18.730
to push to the next level to do golf.

01:36:18.730 --> 01:36:20.560
So, I find-
- Why golf?

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.860
'Cause you love golf?

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.110
- Well, it's because it's
motor performance coordination.

01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:29.100
So, it's not simply
running as fast as you can.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.080
It's coordination, it's concentration,

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.050
it's a whole variety of things.

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:36.490
And so, the idea would be
to get a group of golfers

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:39.440
and give them the placebo control,

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.860
so they don't know whether
they're breathing a gas mixture,

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.600
which is just normal air
or a hypoxic gas mixture,

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.840
although they may be able to figure

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.433
it out based on their response.

01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:53.360
Do it under controlled
circumstances that do it into a net,

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.540
measure their length of their drives,

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.050
their dispersion and whatnot,

01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:58.620
and see what happens.

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:03.160
Look, if we could find that
this works for golfers,

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.460
forget about cognitive function.

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.460
We could sell this for
unbelievable amounts of money.

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.903
- That sounds like a terrible idea.

01:37:10.903 --> 01:37:13.240
[Jack laughs]

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.733
- By the way, I'm not serious
about selling it, but-

01:37:15.733 --> 01:37:16.617
- I know you're joking.

01:37:16.617 --> 01:37:18.300
I mean, maybe people should know

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:19.310
that you are joking about that.

01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:22.400
No, I think that anything
that can improve cognitive

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.340
and neuromuscular performance
is going to be of interest

01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:28.040
for a wide range of both pathologic states

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:30.260
like injury, TBI, et cetera.

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.700
I mean, one of the most frequent questions

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:35.471
I get is about recovery from concussion

01:37:35.471 --> 01:37:37.210
or traumatic brain injury.

01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:39.240
A lot of people think
sports, they think football,

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.070
they think rugby, they think hockey.

01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:44.570
But if you look at the statistics
on traumatic brain injury,

01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:46.850
most of it is construction workers,

01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:48.850
car crashes, bicycle accidents.

01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:51.740
I mean it, the sports
part of it is a tiny,

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:54.650
tiny minuscule fraction
of the total amount

01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:56.450
of traumatic brain injury out there.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.619
I think these protocols
tested in the context of golf

01:37:59.619 --> 01:38:02.330
would be very interesting
because of the constraints

01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:03.730
of the measures as you mentioned,

01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:05.890
and it could be exported
to a number of things.

01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:08.980
I want to just try and
imagine whether or not

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:13.980
there is any kind of breathing
pattern or breathwork,

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.800
just to be direct about it,

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.520
that even partially
mimics what you described

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.540
in terms of episodic hypoxia.

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:22.730
I've done a lot of Tummo,

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:25.130
Wim Hof cyclic hyperventilation
type breathing before.

01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:26.680
My lab studies this in humans,

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.040
and what we find is that

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.860
if people do cyclic hyperventilation,

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:32.880
so for about a minute, then exhale,

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.280
hold their breath for 15 to 60 seconds,

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.280
depending on what they can do,

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.000
and just keep repeating
that for about five minutes,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.400
it seems to me that it
at least partially mimics

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.630
the state that you're talking about

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:46.690
because afterwards people
report heightened levels

01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:51.690
of alertness, lower levels
of kind of triggering due

01:38:53.047 --> 01:38:54.550
to stressful events.

01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:56.050
They feel comfortable at a higher level

01:38:56.050 --> 01:38:57.681
of autonomic arousal, cognitive focus,

01:38:57.681 --> 01:39:00.533
a number of improvements
that are pretty impressive

01:39:00.533 --> 01:39:02.690
that any practitioner of Wim Hof or Tummo

01:39:02.690 --> 01:39:03.790
will be familiar with.

01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:09.200
Is that pattern of breathing even,

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.217
can we say that it maps
to what you're describing

01:39:11.217 --> 01:39:12.993
in some general sense?

01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:17.500
- Well, the expert in this
would be Gordon Mitchell.

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.365
I would say it moves in that direction,

01:39:20.365 --> 01:39:22.917
but it's not as extreme
because I don't think

01:39:22.917 --> 01:39:24.560
you can get down to the levels

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.909
of hypoxia that they do clinically.

01:39:28.909 --> 01:39:32.420
I know that our pals at Our
Breath Collective actually

01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:34.460
just bought a machine because you buy

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:35.810
a machine that does this.

01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:36.643
- [Andrew] I see.

01:39:36.643 --> 01:39:37.476
- And they bought it and they're going to

01:39:37.476 --> 01:39:39.680
do their own self testing
to see whether or not

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.010
this has any effect on
anything that they can measure.

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.800
Of course, you have to be concerned

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.340
about self-experimentation,

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:51.000
but I applaud their
curiosity and going after it.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.670
- Hyperbaric chambers.

01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:55.070
I hear a lot nowadays
about hyperbaric chambers.

01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:56.550
People are buying 'em and using 'em,

01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:59.009
and what are your thoughts
on hyperbaric chambers

01:39:59.009 --> 01:40:00.480
as it relates to any of the-

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.700
- Hyper or hypo?

01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.230
- Hyperbaric chambers.

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:04.420
- Oh, so you're not
talkin' about altitude?

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.530
- [Andrew] No.

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:08.380
- I don't really have much to say.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:12.380
I mean, your oxygen levels would
probably go up a little bit

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:14.340
and that could have a beneficial effect,

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:17.213
but that's way outside my area of comfort.

01:40:18.687 --> 01:40:21.450
- 2022 I think is going to
be the year of two things

01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:22.460
I keep hearing a lot about,

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:25.521
which is the deliberate
use of high salt intake

01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:29.120
for performance increasing
blood volume, et cetera,

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.650
and hyperbaric chambers
seem to be catching on much

01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:33.189
in the same way that ice baths were

01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:36.290
and saunas seemed to be
right now but anyway,

01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:39.510
a prediction we can
return to at some point.

01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:43.563
I want to ask you about
some of the studies

01:40:43.563 --> 01:40:46.580
that I've seen out there exploring

01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:50.240
how deliberately
restricting one's breathing

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:53.320
to nasal breathing can do
things like improve memory.

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.280
There's a couple of papers
in "Journal of Neuroscience,"

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.549
which is a respectable
journal in our field,

01:40:57.549 --> 01:40:59.540
one looking at olfactory memory.

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:01.829
So, that kind of made
sense because you can smell

01:41:01.829 --> 01:41:03.755
things better through
your nose than your mouth,

01:41:03.755 --> 01:41:08.045
unless you're some sort of elk
or something where they can,

01:41:08.045 --> 01:41:09.920
presumably they have some sense

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.610
of smell in their mouth as well.

01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:13.880
But humans generally
smell with their nose.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.310
That wasn't terribly surprising,

01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:17.510
but there was a companion
study that showed

01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:21.160
that the hippocampus, an area
involved in encoding memories

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.500
in one form or another was
more active if you will

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.650
and memory and recall was better

01:41:28.650 --> 01:41:31.070
when people learned information
while nasal breathing,

01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:32.330
as opposed to mouth breathing.

01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:36.520
Does that make sense from
any mechanistic perspective?

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.108
- Well, given that there's
a major pathway going

01:41:40.108 --> 01:41:43.000
from the olfactory system into the brain

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.680
and you cut that and not one

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.850
from any receptors in the mouth,

01:41:50.850 --> 01:41:53.090
the degree of respiratory modulation

01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:55.613
you're going to see
throughout the forebrain

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:59.780
is going to be less with mouth breathing

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.380
than nose breathing.

01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.273
So, it's certainly plausible.

01:42:13.092 --> 01:42:16.586
I think there are a lot of experiments

01:42:16.586 --> 01:42:19.170
that need to be done to distinguish

01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:23.490
between the two that
is the nasal component

01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:25.180
and the non nasal component

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:27.200
of these breathing related signals.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.880
But there's a tendency
sometimes when you have

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.630
a strong effect to be exclusive,

01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:36.440
and I think what's going
on here is that there

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.530
are many inputs that can have an effect.

01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:40.910
Now, whether they're parceled,

01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:43.007
that some effect this part of behavior

01:42:43.007 --> 01:42:45.430
and some effect that
part of behavior remains

01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.770
to be investigated.

01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:50.760
There's certainly a strong
olfactory component.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.250
My interest is trying to
follow the central component

01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:56.490
'cause we know that there's

01:42:56.490 --> 01:42:58.430
a strong central component in this.

01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:00.650
In fact, there's a
strong central projection

01:43:00.650 --> 01:43:02.780
to the olfactory bulb.

01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:05.380
So, regardless of whether or
not there's any air flowing

01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.750
in and out of the nose,

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:09.760
there's a respiratory input
into the olfactory bulb,

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.080
which combines with the
respiratory modulated signals

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.330
coming from the sensory receptors.

01:43:15.330 --> 01:43:16.320
- Interesting.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.275
And as long as we are poking
around, forgive the pun,

01:43:20.275 --> 01:43:25.275
the nose, what about one nostril
versus the other nostril?

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:28.740
I know it sounds a
little crazy to imagine,

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:31.383
but there have been
theories in yoga traditions

01:43:31.383 --> 01:43:34.350
and others that breathing
through one nostril

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:37.540
somehow activates certain brain centers,

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.618
maybe hemispherically one side
of the brain versus the other

01:43:39.618 --> 01:43:42.530
or that right nostril and
left nostril breathing

01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:45.569
might differ in terms of the levels

01:43:45.569 --> 01:43:48.130
of alertness or calmness they produce.

01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:50.280
I'm not aware of any
mechanistic data on that,

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.294
but if there's anything worthwhile

01:43:52.294 --> 01:43:56.100
about right nostril versus
left nostril breathing

01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.570
that you're aware of, I'd love to know.

01:43:57.570 --> 01:44:00.570
- Well, it certainly plausible.

01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:02.850
I don't know of any data demonstrating it,

01:44:02.850 --> 01:44:06.800
except the anecdotal reports of the,

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.870
as you know the brain
is highly lateralized

01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:12.365
and we have speech on one side

01:44:12.365 --> 01:44:16.540
and a dominant hand that's on one side.

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:20.321
And so, the notion that if you
have this huge signal coming

01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:23.580
from the olfactory system and it,

01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.030
to some degree is lateralized,

01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:26.640
is not perfectly symmetrical.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.030
That is one side is not
going evenly to both sides,

01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:32.510
then you can imagine that once

01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:37.510
the signal gets distributed
in a way that's not uniform,

01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:41.521
that the effectiveness or the response

01:44:41.521 --> 01:44:44.660
is going to be particular to the cortex

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.740
in which either the signal still remains

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.630
or the signal is removed from.

01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:51.463
- I see.

01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:56.890
What are some of the other
features of our brain and body,

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:59.780
be it blinking, or eye movements,

01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:03.840
or ability to encode sounds,

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.420
or any features of the
way that we function

01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:10.230
and move and perceive things

01:45:10.230 --> 01:45:15.120
that are coordinated with
breathing in some interesting way?

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.247
- Thank you for that question.

01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:19.833
Almost everything.

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.390
So, we have, for example,
on the autonomic side,

01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:26.900
we have respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:30.974
That is during expiration
the heart slows down.

01:45:30.974 --> 01:45:34.213
Your pupils oscillate with
the respiratory cycle.

01:45:35.170 --> 01:45:37.690
I don't know what the
functional basis for that is,

01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:40.080
but they do oscillate with
the respiratory cycle.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.990
- When we inhale our pupils constrict,

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:43.288
presumably 'cause you there's an increase

01:45:43.288 --> 01:45:45.410
in heart rate and sympathetic tone,

01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:46.870
I would think of constriction

01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:49.390
and I'm guessing as you
relax the pupil will get,

01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:50.423
and you exhale the pupil will get bigger-

01:45:50.423 --> 01:45:51.256
- I think you're right,

01:45:51.256 --> 01:45:54.110
but I always get the valance of that-

01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:55.900
- Yeah, well, it's counterintuitive

01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:58.493
because people wouldn't think
that when the pupils get,

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:00.793
I mean, it depends.

01:46:00.793 --> 01:46:03.500
I mean, well, you can get
very alert and aroused

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.102
in that for stress or for good reasons,

01:46:06.102 --> 01:46:08.220
and the peoples get wider,

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.810
but your visual field narrows
and then the opposite is true.

01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:12.621
Anyway, I guess the
idea is that the pupils

01:46:12.621 --> 01:46:15.520
are changing size and
therefore the aperture

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.800
of your visual window is changing

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.030
in coordination with breathing.

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.863
- Okay.

01:46:19.863 --> 01:46:24.603
Your fear response changes
with the respiratory cycle.

01:46:24.603 --> 01:46:26.590
- Can you tell us more about that?

01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:29.350
- Well, there's a paper by Solano,

01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:31.280
which I think showed rather clearly

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:34.307
that if you show individuals fearful faces

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.940
that their measured response
of fearfulness changes

01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:46.880
between inspiration and expiration.

01:46:48.117 --> 01:46:50.533
I don't know why, but it does.

01:46:51.504 --> 01:46:55.490
Your reaction time changes.

01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:58.160
So you talk about blinking.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.430
The reaction time changes

01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.847
between inspiration and expiration.

01:47:01.847 --> 01:47:06.070
If I ask you to punch something that time

01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:08.630
will change between
inspiration and expiration.

01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:10.540
In fact, I don't know the degree

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:12.727
to which martial artists exploit that.

01:47:12.727 --> 01:47:15.674
You watch the breathing
pattern and your opponent

01:47:15.674 --> 01:47:18.260
will actually move slower

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.030
during one cycle compared to the other.

01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:24.000
- Meaning as they're, in which direction?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.280
If they're exhaling,
they can punch faster?

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.670
- I have to say, I don't
keep a table of which

01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:31.453
is which direction things move in

01:47:31.453 --> 01:47:34.680
'cause I'm out of the
martial arts field now.

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.680
- My vague understanding
is that exhales on strikes

01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:44.120
is the more typical way to do that,

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:48.120
and so as people strike, they exhale.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.930
In many-
- As you exhale,

01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:53.403
but there are other components to striking

01:47:53.403 --> 01:47:56.570
because you want to stiffen your rib cage,

01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:58.770
you want to make a Valsalva maneuver.

01:47:58.770 --> 01:48:02.430
So that's both an
inspiration and expiration.

01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:03.640
It's at the same time.

01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.900
So, I don't know enough about,

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:09.930
when you say during expiration,

01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:11.980
I would assume that when
you make your strike,

01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.330
you're actually sort of
wanting to stiffen here,

01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:16.410
which is a Valsalva like maneuver.

01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:17.550
- And oftentimes they'll clench

01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:18.966
their fist at the last moment.

01:48:18.966 --> 01:48:22.060
Anyway, there's a whole
set of motor things

01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.560
that we can talk to some fighters.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.670
We know people who know fighters,
so what we can ask them.

01:48:27.670 --> 01:48:28.503
Interesting.

01:48:28.503 --> 01:48:31.823
What are some other things that
are modulated by breathing?

01:48:33.710 --> 01:48:37.640
- I think anything anyone looks at seems

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.263
to have a breathing component

01:48:39.263 --> 01:48:43.990
because it's all over your brain,

01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:47.110
and it's hard to imagine
it not being effective.

01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:52.110
Now, whether it's incidental
or just background

01:48:52.413 --> 01:48:53.690
and doesn't really have

01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:58.690
any behavioral advantage is possible.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.050
In other cases, it might
have a behavioral advantage.

01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:05.230
I mean, the big, this eye-opening thing

01:49:05.230 --> 01:49:08.350
for me probably a decade ago,

01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:10.079
was digging into literature

01:49:10.079 --> 01:49:15.079
and seeing how much of cortical activity

01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:17.500
and subcortical activity

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:20.550
had a respiratory
modulator component to it.

01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:24.780
And I think a lot of my colleagues
who were studying cortex

01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:29.780
are oblivious to this, and they find,

01:49:29.859 --> 01:49:32.130
I heard a talk the other day

01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:33.780
from a person who will go un-named,

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:36.720
who found a lot of things correlated

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:39.663
with a particular movement.

01:49:40.590 --> 01:49:43.410
And I think it all, when
I looked, I said, gee,

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.260
that's the list of things that
are respiratory modulated.

01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.400
And rather than it being correlated

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.540
to the movement they we're looking at,

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.960
I think the movement they were looking at

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.090
was modulated by breathing,
as was everything else.

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:58.300
So, there wasn't that the movement itself

01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:59.920
was driving that correlation.

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.480
It was that they were all
correlated to something else,

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.140
which is the breathing movement

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.404
and whether or not that
is behaviorally relevant,

01:50:07.404 --> 01:50:11.620
or behaviorally something you
can exploit, I don't know.

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:12.996
- I suspect you're right,

01:50:12.996 --> 01:50:17.996
that breathing is if not the
foundational driver of many,

01:50:18.755 --> 01:50:20.160
if not all of these things

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.480
that it's at least one of
the foundational drivers.

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:24.560
- It's in the background,
it's in the brain,

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.560
and oscillations play an
important part in brain function.

01:50:31.730 --> 01:50:35.800
And they vary in frequency
from maybe 100 hertz down to,

01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:42.780
well, we can get to circadian
and sort of monthly cycles,

01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:44.900
but breathing occupies

01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:49.220
a rather unusual place
in all that because...

01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:51.207
So, let me talk about what people think

01:50:51.207 --> 01:50:54.550
the oscillation's is doing,
particularly faster ones.

01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:59.550
They're important in coordinating
signals across neurons.

01:50:59.945 --> 01:51:03.500
Just like in a computer, a computer steps.

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.290
So, a computer knows when
information is coming

01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:08.200
from another part of a computer

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.930
so that it was originated
at a particular time.

01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:14.530
And so, that the screen
by step-by-step thing

01:51:14.530 --> 01:51:16.020
is important in computer control.

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:18.037
Now, the brain is not a digital device,

01:51:18.037 --> 01:51:20.010
and it's an analog device,

01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:24.880
but when I have a signal that's
coming in my ear and my eye,

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.447
which is Andrew Huberman speaking

01:51:26.447 --> 01:51:30.400
and I'm looking at his
face, I see that as a whole,

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.050
but the signal is coming into
different parts of my brain.

01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:34.800
How do I unify that?

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.205
Well, my neurons are
very sensitive to changes

01:51:38.205 --> 01:51:42.000
in signals arriving by
fractions of a millisecond.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.870
So, I know we're sure that those signals

01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:47.280
coming in represent the same signal.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.150
Well, if I have throughout my brain

01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:53.990
and isolation and the signals
ride on that oscillation,

01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:55.920
let's say the peak of the oscillation,

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:58.480
I can then have a much better handle

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.367
on the road of timing and say,

01:52:00.367 --> 01:52:03.060
"Those two signals came
in at the same time.

01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.410
They may relate to the
same object and ah ha,

01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:10.410
I see you as one unified
thing spouting talking."

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:13.083
And so, these oscillations come

01:52:13.083 --> 01:52:16.540
in many different frequency ranges

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:18.810
and are important in memory formation

01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:21.020
and all sorts of things.

01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:22.738
I don't think people pay
much attention to breathing

01:52:22.738 --> 01:52:27.106
because it's relatively slow to the range

01:52:27.106 --> 01:52:30.510
when you think about milliseconds,

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:33.937
but we have important
things that are thought

01:52:33.937 --> 01:52:36.520
to be important in cognitive function,

01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:39.450
which are a few cycles per second

01:52:39.450 --> 01:52:42.510
to 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second.

01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:46.660
Breathing in humans is
maybe .2 cycles per second,

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:47.700
every five seconds.

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:51.120
Although in rodents they're
up to four per second,

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.160
which is pretty fast.

01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:57.870
So, but breathing has one
thing which is special,

01:52:57.870 --> 01:53:00.470
that is you can readily change it.

01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:03.090
So, the degree to which the brain is using

01:53:03.090 --> 01:53:05.493
that slow signal for anything,

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:09.923
if that becomes part of its
normal signal processing,

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.790
you now change it.

01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:17.020
That signal processing has to change.

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:20.400
And as that signal processing changes,

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.350
acutely there's a change.

01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:26.440
So, you asked about breath practice,

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.130
how long do you have to do it?

01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:31.700
Well, a single breath
will change your state.

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:36.130
You're nervous, you take a deep breath

01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:38.510
and it seems to help relax,

01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:39.543
so-
- Or a sigh.

01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:43.600
- Call it what you will,
call it what you will.

01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:47.370
It seems to work.

01:53:47.370 --> 01:53:50.270
Now, it doesn't have a permanent change,

01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:51.990
but when I'm getting up to bat

01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:53.570
or getting up to the first tee or getting

01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:56.200
to give a big talk or
coming to do a podcast,

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:59.870
I get a little bit anxious, a deep breath,

01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:02.960
or a few deep breaths are
tremendously effective

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.140
in calming one down.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:10.140
And so, you can get a
transient disruption,

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.640
but on the other hand, let's
take something like depression.

01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:21.800
I think it's, you can envision depression

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.443
as activities sort of
going around in a circuit.

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.330
And because it's continuous
in the nervous system,

01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:31.163
as signals keep repeating,

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:35.870
they tend to get stronger
and they can get so strong,

01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:37.500
you can't break them.

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.620
So, you can imagine the depression

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.660
being something going on and on and on,

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:44.060
and you can't break it.

01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.770
And so, we have trouble

01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:47.900
when we get for certain
levels of depression,

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:50.310
I mean, all of us get
depressed at some point,

01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:53.640
but if it's not continuous,
it's not long lasting,

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.350
we're able to break it.

01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:58.450
But if it's long lasting and
very deep, we can't break it.

01:54:58.450 --> 01:55:00.810
So, the question is how do we break it?

01:55:00.810 --> 01:55:03.300
Well, there are extreme
measures to break it.

01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.420
We could do electroconvulsive shock.

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:08.090
We shock the whole brain.

01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:10.410
That's disrupting activity
in the whole brain.

01:55:10.410 --> 01:55:14.570
And when this circuit starts
to get back together again,

01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:15.710
it's been disruptive.

01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:17.590
And we know that the brain,

01:55:17.590 --> 01:55:20.520
when signals get disrupted a little bit,

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:23.160
we can weaken the
connections and weakening

01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.063
the connections of this then

01:55:24.063 --> 01:55:26.690
in this circuit involved in depression,

01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:29.431
we may get some relief and
electroconvulsive shock

01:55:29.431 --> 01:55:33.410
does work for relieving
many kinds of depression.

01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:34.663
That's pretty heroic.

01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:39.930
Focal deep brain stimulation
does the same thing,

01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:43.690
but more localized or
transcranial stimulation.

01:55:43.690 --> 01:55:45.490
You're disrupting a network.

01:55:45.490 --> 01:55:47.610
And while it's getting back together,

01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:49.883
it may weaken some of the connections.

01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:55.133
If breathing is playing
some role in this circuit,

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.800
and now, instead of doing
like a one second shock,

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.540
I do 30 minutes of disruption
by doing slow breathing

01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:07.163
or other breathing practice,

01:56:07.997 --> 01:56:12.160
those circuits begin to
break down a little bit,

01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.260
and I get some relief.

01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:16.700
And if I continue to do
it before the circuit

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:18.670
can then build back up again,

01:56:18.670 --> 01:56:20.750
I gradually can wear that circuit down.

01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:22.740
I sort of liken this,

01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:25.760
I tell people it's like
walking around on a dirt path.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.410
You build a rut, the rut gets so deep

01:56:28.410 --> 01:56:29.480
you can't get out of it.

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.340
And what breathing is
doing is sort of filling

01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:32.940
in the right rut bit by bit

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:35.750
to the point that you can
climb out of that rut.

01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:40.380
And that is because the breathing signal

01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:45.170
is playing some role in
the way the circuit works,

01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:47.060
and then when you disrupt that,

01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:49.720
the circuit gets a
little thrown off kilter,

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.420
and as you know when
circuits get thrown off,

01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.630
the nervous system tries to
adjust in some way or another,

01:56:57.630 --> 01:57:00.260
and it turns out at least for breathing

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:04.490
for some evolutionary reason,
or just by happenstance,

01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:06.793
it seems to improve
our emotional function,

01:57:06.793 --> 01:57:08.540
and our cognitive function.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:12.133
And we're very fortunate
that that's the case.

01:57:13.090 --> 01:57:17.050
- It's a terrific segue into
what I want to ask you next,

01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:20.440
and this is part of a set of questions

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.980
I want to make sure we
touch on before we wrap up,

01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:27.860
which is what do you do
with all this knowledge

01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:30.700
in terms of a breathing practice?

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.330
You mentioned that one breath can shift

01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:35.020
your brain state and that
itself can be powerful.

01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:37.260
I think that's absolutely true.

01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:40.130
You've also talked about 30
minute breathwork practices,

01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:41.600
which is 30 minutes of breathwork,

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.600
is a pretty serious commitment
I think, but it's doable.

01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:48.550
Certainly a zero cost,

01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:52.500
except for the time in most cases.

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.500
What do you see out there in
the landscape of breathwork

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.873
that's being done that you
like, and why do you like it?

01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:03.028
What do you think you,

01:58:03.028 --> 01:58:05.430
or what would you like to see more of

01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:09.083
in terms of exploration of
breathwork and what do you do?

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.160
- Well, I'm a relatively
new convert to breathwork.

01:58:16.503 --> 01:58:19.225
Through my own investigation of it,

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:22.330
I became convinced that it's real,

01:58:22.330 --> 01:58:27.330
and I'm basically a beginner
in terms of my own practice.

01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:32.030
And I like to keep things simple,

01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:35.030
and I think I've discussed this before.

01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:37.580
I liken it to someone who's a couch potato

01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.800
who was told they got
to begin to exercise.

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.100
You don't go out and run a marathon.

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.240
So, couch potato, you say,

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:47.020
okay, get up and walk for
five minutes and 10 minutes.

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:49.910
And then, okay, now you're
walking for a longer period.

01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:53.760
You'll begin to run, and
then you reach a point,

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.040
you say, well, gee, I'm
interested in this sport.

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.775
And there may be particular
kinds of practices

01:58:58.775 --> 01:59:01.363
that you can use that could be helpful

01:59:01.363 --> 01:59:04.880
in optimizing performance of that sport.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.420
I'm not there yet.

01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:09.160
I find I get tremendous benefit

01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.730
by relatively short periods

01:59:11.730 --> 01:59:15.900
between five and maybe 20 minutes

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:17.273
of doing box breathing.

01:59:18.250 --> 01:59:20.310
It's very simple to do.

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:24.890
I have a simple app, which
helps me keep the timing.

01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:26.010
- Do you recall which app it is?

01:59:26.010 --> 01:59:27.570
Is it the Apnea Trainer?

01:59:27.570 --> 01:59:28.403
Is that the one?

01:59:28.403 --> 01:59:30.183
- Well, I was using Calm for a long time,

01:59:30.183 --> 01:59:32.296
but I let my subscription lapse

01:59:32.296 --> 01:59:37.296
and I have another one whose
name I don't remember but it's,

01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:40.920
so it's very simple and it works for me.

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:45.300
I'm now trying this Tummo,
because I'm just curious

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.587
and exploring it because it may be acting

01:59:47.587 --> 01:59:49.057
for a different way and I want to see

01:59:49.057 --> 01:59:52.173
if I respond differently.

01:59:54.427 --> 01:59:57.300
So, I don't have a
particular point of view.

01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:59.400
Now, I have friends and colleagues

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:03.640
who are into particular
styles like Wim Hof.

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:05.801
And I think what he's doing is great

02:00:05.801 --> 02:00:08.750
and getting people who are interested.

02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:11.800
I think the notion is that I would like

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:16.520
to see more people exploring
this and to some degree,

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:19.050
as you point out, 30 minutes a day,

02:00:19.050 --> 02:00:24.050
some of the breath patterns
that some of these stars

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:29.100
like Wim Hof are a little
intimidating to newbies.

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.600
And so, I would like to
see something very simple,

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.290
that what I tell my friends is, look,

02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:34.710
just try it five or 10 minutes.

02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:37.170
See if you feel better,
do it for a few days.

02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:40.120
If you don't like it, stop
it, it doesn't cost anything.

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.900
And invariably, they
find that it's helpful.

02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:47.600
I will often interrupt my day

02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:52.800
to take five or 10 minutes.

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.790
Like, if I find that I'm lagging...

02:00:56.446 --> 02:00:59.050
I think there's some pretty good data

02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:03.610
that your performance
after lunch declines.

02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:06.290
And so, very often what
I'll do after lunch,

02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:08.477
which I didn't do today
is take five or 10 minutes

02:01:08.477 --> 02:01:10.276
and just sort of breath practice.

02:01:10.276 --> 02:01:13.440
- And lately, what does that
breath practice look like?

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.497
- It's just box breathing
for five to 10 minutes.

02:01:15.497 --> 02:01:17.860
- And the duration of
your inhales and holds

02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:19.750
and exhales and holds is set by the app?

02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:20.583
Is that right?

02:01:20.583 --> 02:01:22.970
- Well, I do five seconds.

02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:25.740
- So, five seconds
inhale, five second hold,

02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:27.580
five second, exhale, five second hold.

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:30.040
- Yeah, and sometimes I'll do doubles.

02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:35.040
I'll do 10 seconds just
because I get bored.

02:01:35.423 --> 02:01:39.677
It's just, I feel like doing
it and it's very helpful.

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.313
I mean...

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:45.876
Now, that's not the only thing I do

02:01:45.876 --> 02:01:49.660
with respect to trying to
maintain my sanity and my health.

02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:51.570
- No, I can imagine there'd
be a number of things,

02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:55.360
although, because you seem
very sane and very healthy,

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.927
I in fact, know that you
are both of those things.

02:01:57.927 --> 02:01:59.313
- Right, you suspect that I am.

02:01:59.313 --> 02:02:01.833
- I suspect that there's data.

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.140
Awhile back we had a conversation,
a casual conversation,

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.000
but you said something that
really stuck in my mind,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.370
which is that it might be

02:02:11.370 --> 02:02:14.763
that the specific pattern of breathwork

02:02:14.763 --> 02:02:18.390
that one does is not as important

02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:22.470
as experiencing transitions
between states based

02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:25.690
on deliberate breathwork or
something to that extent,

02:02:25.690 --> 02:02:28.830
which I interpreted to mean that if I were

02:02:28.830 --> 02:02:30.940
to do box breathing with five second in,

02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:32.960
five seconds hold, five second exhale,

02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:35.200
five second hold for a couple of days,

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.940
or maybe even a couple of
minutes and then switch

02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:39.660
to 10 seconds or then switch to Tummo,

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:42.030
that there's something powerful perhaps

02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:46.110
in the transitions and
realizing the relationship

02:02:46.110 --> 02:02:47.460
between different patterns of breathing

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.320
in those transitions,

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.042
much in the same way that you can get

02:02:50.042 --> 02:02:53.650
into one of these cars
at an amusement park

02:02:53.650 --> 02:02:56.130
that just goes at a constant
rate and then stops.

02:02:56.130 --> 02:02:58.683
Very different than
learning how to shift gears.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:00.500
I used to drive a manual.

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:02.650
I still can so I'm thinking
about a manual transmission,

02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:04.290
but even with an automatic transmission,

02:03:04.290 --> 02:03:07.250
you start to get a sense
of how the vehicle behaves

02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:08.850
under different conditions.

02:03:08.850 --> 02:03:11.310
And I thought that was a beautiful seed

02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:13.030
for a potential breathwork practice

02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:14.370
that at least to my awareness,

02:03:14.370 --> 02:03:16.060
nobody has really formalized,

02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:17.984
which is that you
introduce some variability

02:03:17.984 --> 02:03:20.810
within the practice that's somewhat random

02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:23.160
in order to be able to
sense the relationship

02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:25.360
between different speeds
and depths of inhales,

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.070
exhales and holds and so forth.

02:03:27.070 --> 02:03:29.060
And essentially, it's like
driving around the track,

02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:31.930
but with obstacles at different rates

02:03:31.930 --> 02:03:33.980
and breaking and restarting
and things of that sort,

02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.830
that's how you learn how to drive.

02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:39.790
What do you think about that
and if you like it enough,

02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:41.600
can we call it the Feldman protocol?

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:42.700
- Oh, please [laughs].

02:03:45.250 --> 02:03:48.450
I was asked in this BBC interview once why

02:03:48.450 --> 02:03:50.283
didn't I name it the Feldman complex,

02:03:50.283 --> 02:03:51.920
instead of pre-Botzinger complex?

02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:54.090
- You said I already
have a Feldman complex.

02:03:54.090 --> 02:03:56.390
- Well, it sounds like
a psychiatric disorder,

02:03:57.532 --> 02:04:02.532
but I think the primary effect
is this disruptive effect,

02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:05.843
which I described,

02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:11.820
but the particular responses
may clearly vary depending

02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:14.593
on what that disruption is.

02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:18.580
I don't know of any particular data,

02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:20.990
which are as in well
controlled experiments,

02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:24.202
which can actually work
through the different types

02:04:24.202 --> 02:04:27.510
of breathing patterns or
simply with a box pattern,

02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:29.830
just varying the durations.

02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:32.130
I mean, pranayama is sort of similar,

02:04:32.130 --> 02:04:34.160
but the amount of time you spend

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.860
going around the box is different.

02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:38.810
So, I don't really have
much to say about this.

02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:43.610
I mean, this is why we need
better controlled experiments

02:04:43.610 --> 02:04:47.430
in humans and I think
this is where being able

02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:50.220
to study in rodents where you can have

02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:53.937
a wide range of perturbations

02:04:55.593 --> 02:04:58.410
while you're doing more invasive studies

02:04:58.410 --> 02:05:01.670
to really get down as to
which regions are affected,

02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:04.680
how was the signal processing disrupted,

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:06.060
which is still a hypothesis,

02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:08.650
but how it's disrupted could tell us a lot

02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:12.310
about maybe there's a resonant point

02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:14.320
at which there's an optimal effect

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:17.200
when you take a particular
breathing practice.

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.664
And then when we talked about the fact

02:05:20.664 --> 02:05:23.060
that different breathing practices

02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:25.410
could be affecting the outcomes

02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:27.490
through different pathways.

02:05:27.490 --> 02:05:31.700
You have the olfactory pathway,
you have a central pathway,

02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:35.450
you have a vagal pathway, you
have a descending pathway,

02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:40.450
how different practices may change

02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:43.040
the summation of those things

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:46.430
because I think all those
things are probably involved,

02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:49.420
and we're just beginning
to scratch the surface.

02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:54.420
And I just hope that we can
get serious neuroscientists

02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:59.390
and psychologists to do
the right experiments

02:05:59.390 --> 02:06:00.720
to get at this because I think

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:05.150
there's a lot of value
to human health here.

02:06:05.150 --> 02:06:07.150
- I do too, and it's one
of the reasons my lab

02:06:07.150 --> 02:06:09.130
has shifted to these
sorts of things in humans.

02:06:09.130 --> 02:06:10.871
I'm delighted that you're continuing

02:06:10.871 --> 02:06:13.609
to do the hardcore
mechanistic work in mice

02:06:13.609 --> 02:06:17.442
and probably do work in
humans already as well,

02:06:17.442 --> 02:06:18.870
if you're not already.

02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:20.690
And there are other
groups, Epel Lab at UCF,

02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:23.258
and a number of, I'm starting
to see some papers out there

02:06:23.258 --> 02:06:25.560
about respiration in humans a little bit,

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:26.883
some more brain imaging.

02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:32.960
I can't help but ask about
a somewhat unrelated topic,

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:36.175
but it is important in
light of this conversation

02:06:36.175 --> 02:06:37.790
because you're here,

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:40.550
and one of the things that I really enjoy

02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:43.450
about conversations with you as it relates

02:06:43.450 --> 02:06:47.253
to health and neuroscience
and so forth is that,

02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:51.160
you're one of the few colleagues I have

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:56.160
who openly admits to
exploring supplementation.

02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:59.857
I'm a long time supplement fan.

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.800
I think there's power in compounds,

02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:09.370
both prescription, non-prescription,
natural, synthesized.

02:07:09.370 --> 02:07:11.530
I don't use these haphazardly,

02:07:11.530 --> 02:07:13.710
but I think there's
certainly power in them.

02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:15.880
And one of the places
where you and I converge

02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:18.280
is in terms of our interest
in the nervous system

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:22.910
and supplementation is
vis-a-vis magnesium.

02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:26.980
Now, I've talked endlessly on the podcast

02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:29.940
and elsewhere about
magnesium for sake of sleep,

02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:31.560
and improving transit transitions

02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.180
to sleep and so forth.

02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:37.710
But you have a somewhat
different interest in magnesium

02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:39.520
as it relates to cognitive function

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.920
and durability of cognitive function.

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.480
Would you mind just sharing
with us a little bit

02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:46.310
about what that interest
is, where it stems from,

02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:49.730
and because it's The Huberman Podcast,

02:07:49.730 --> 02:07:51.549
and we often talk about supplementation,

02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:54.760
what you do with that information.

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:55.804
- So, I need to disclose

02:07:55.804 --> 02:07:58.550
that I am a scientific advisor

02:07:58.550 --> 02:08:00.310
to a company called Neurocentria,

02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:04.393
which my graduate student,
Guosong Liu is CEO.

02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:09.160
So that said, I can give
you some background.

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:12.156
Guosong, although when he was
in my lab worked on breathing,

02:08:12.156 --> 02:08:15.720
had a deep interest in
learning and memory.

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:16.870
And when he left my lab,

02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:17.990
he went to work for it

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:22.990
with a renowned learning memory
guy at Stanford, Dick Chen.

02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:26.300
And when he finished there,

02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:29.400
he was hired by Susumu Tonegawa at MIT.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:31.220
- Who also knows a thing
or two about memory.

02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:32.053
I'm teasing.

02:08:32.053 --> 02:08:35.530
Susumu Tonegawa has a Nobel for
his work on immunoglobulins,

02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:38.580
but then is a world-class
memory researcher.

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:41.163
- Yeah, and more.

02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:43.565
- He's many things.

02:08:43.565 --> 02:08:48.565
- And Guosong had very
curious, very bright guy,

02:08:48.590 --> 02:08:52.029
and he was interested in how signals

02:08:52.029 --> 02:08:54.600
between neurons get strengthened,

02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.120
which is called long-term
potentiation or LTP.

02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:01.740
And one of the questions that arose

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:06.740
was if I have inputs to
a neuron and I get LTP,

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:13.740
is the LTP bigger if the signal is bigger

02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:16.090
or the noise is less?

02:09:16.090 --> 02:09:19.260
So, we can imagine that when
we're listening to something,

02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:21.200
if it's louder, we can hear it better.

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.480
Or if this less noise,
we can hear it better.

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:26.320
And he wanted to investigate this.

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:31.320
So I did this in tissue
culture of hippocampal neurons,

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.466
and what he found was that if he lowered

02:09:35.466 --> 02:09:38.863
the background activity
in all of the neurons,

02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:44.600
that the LTP he elicited got stronger,

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:47.560
and the way he did that was increasing

02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.660
the level of magnesium
in the bathing solution.

02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:54.970
This gets into some
esoteric electrophysiology,

02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:57.850
but basically there's a background level

02:09:57.850 --> 02:10:01.080
of noise in all neurons,

02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:04.920
and that part of it is
regulated by the degree

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:07.750
of magnesium in the extracellular bath.

02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:10.570
- And you mean electrical noise.

02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:12.925
- Electrical noise, I'm
sorry, electrical noise.

02:10:12.925 --> 02:10:17.925
And if you, in what's called
the physiological range,

02:10:18.450 --> 02:10:22.700
which is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar,

02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.280
which don't worry about the number.

02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:25.430
- I can't believe you
remember the millimolar

02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:26.370
of the magnesium.

02:10:26.370 --> 02:10:28.850
- Well, I'm always frightened that I get,

02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:31.060
I say micro or femto or something,

02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:33.510
I go off by several orders of magnitude,

02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:37.830
but so in that physiological range,

02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:40.800
there's a big difference
in the amount of noise

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.540
in a neuron between
0.8 and 1.2 millimolar.

02:10:44.530 --> 02:10:47.200
So, he played around with the magnesium,

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:50.720
and he found out that when
the magnesium was elevated,

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:52.690
it was more LTP.

02:10:52.690 --> 02:10:55.090
All right, that's an
observation in a tissue culture.

02:10:55.090 --> 02:10:56.170
- Right, and I should just mention

02:10:56.170 --> 02:10:58.570
that more LTP essentially translates

02:10:58.570 --> 02:11:00.220
to more neuro-plasticity,

02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:03.620
more rewiring of connections in essence.

02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:08.620
- So, he tested this
in mice and basically,

02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:11.473
he offered them a,

02:11:14.250 --> 02:11:15.240
he had control mice,

02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.970
which got a normal diet and one that had,

02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:18.800
one enriched in magnesium,

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:22.280
and the ones that lived
enriched with magnesium

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.458
had higher cognitive
function, lived longer,

02:11:25.458 --> 02:11:29.130
everything you'd want in some magic pill,

02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:31.150
those mice did that.

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:32.533
Excuse me, rats.

02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:38.980
The problem was that you
couldn't imagine taking this

02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:43.700
into humans because most magnesium salts

02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:47.790
don't passively get from the
gut into the bloodstream,

02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:49.040
into the brain.

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.710
They pass via what's called a transporter.

02:11:52.710 --> 02:11:54.910
Transporter is something in a membrane

02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:59.910
that grabs a magnesium molecule or atom,

02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:03.000
and pulls it into the other side.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.150
So if you're imagining you
have magnesium in your gut,

02:12:06.150 --> 02:12:08.050
you have transporters
that pull the magnesium

02:12:08.050 --> 02:12:10.300
in the gut into the bloodstream.

02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:13.826
Well, if you take a normal
magnesium supplement

02:12:13.826 --> 02:12:16.640
that you can buy at the pharmacy,

02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:19.400
it doesn't cross the gut very easily.

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:20.670
And if you would take enough

02:12:20.670 --> 02:12:23.730
of it to get it in your bloodstream,

02:12:23.730 --> 02:12:25.253
you start getting diarrhea.

02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:29.310
So it's not a good way to go.

02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:31.514
- Well, it is a good way to go.

02:12:31.514 --> 02:12:32.662
I couldn't help myself.

02:12:32.662 --> 02:12:35.053
- [laughs] Well said.

02:12:36.370 --> 02:12:40.243
So, he worked with this
brilliant chemist, Fay Mow,

02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:46.330
and Fay looked at a whole
range of magnesium compounds

02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:50.243
and he found that magnesium threonate

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:55.283
was much more effective in
crossing the gut blood barrier.

02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:59.730
Now, they didn't realize at the time,

02:12:59.730 --> 02:13:03.560
but threonate is a
metabolite of vitamin C,

02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.780
and there's lots of
threonate in your body.

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:09.370
So magnesium threonate
would appear to be safe

02:13:09.370 --> 02:13:12.351
and maybe part of the role

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:15.530
or now they believe it's part of the role

02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:18.433
of the threonate is that it supercharges

02:13:18.433 --> 02:13:21.040
the transporter to get the magnesium in.

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.250
And remember, you need
a transporter at the gut

02:13:25.290 --> 02:13:27.163
into the brain and into cells.

02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:33.470
So, they gave magnesium
threonate to mice who had,

02:13:34.630 --> 02:13:37.193
no, let me backtrack a bit.

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.300
They did a study in humans.

02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:45.300
They hired a company to do a
test that was a hands-off test.

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.810
It's one of these
companies that gets hired

02:13:47.810 --> 02:13:50.760
by the big pharma to
do their test for them,

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:55.680
and they got patients who were diagnosed

02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.640
as mild cognitive decline.

02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:00.230
These are people who
had cognitive disorder,

02:14:00.230 --> 02:14:02.540
which was age inappropriate.

02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:06.333
And the metric that they
use for a determining

02:14:06.333 --> 02:14:11.333
how far off they were
is Spearman's G factor,

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.680
which is a generalized
measure of intelligence

02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:19.083
that most psychologists except,

02:14:20.850 --> 02:14:25.850
and the biological age
of the subjects was,

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:31.277
I think 51 and the
cognitive age was 61 based

02:14:31.277 --> 02:14:32.850
on the Spearman's G's test.

02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:36.094
Oh, I should say the
Spearman G factor starts

02:14:36.094 --> 02:14:40.070
at a particular level in the population

02:14:40.070 --> 02:14:44.440
at age 20 and declines about 1% a year.

02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:48.663
So, sorry to say, we're
not 20 year olds anymore,

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:52.470
but when you get a number from that,

02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:54.660
you can put on the curve and see whether

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.120
it's about your age or not.

02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.457
These people were about
10 years older according

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:03.457
to that metric and long story
short after three months

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:09.630
this is a placebo controlled
double blind study.

02:15:09.630 --> 02:15:14.630
The people who were in the
placebo arm improved two years,

02:15:16.070 --> 02:15:19.493
which is common for human
studies 'cause a placebo effect.

02:15:20.392 --> 02:15:23.630
The people who got the compound

02:15:23.630 --> 02:15:27.080
improved eight years on average,

02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.000
and some improved more than eight years.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.597
They didn't do any further
diagnosis as to what caused

02:15:31.597 --> 02:15:34.140
the molecule to decline but it was pretty,

02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:36.150
it was extraordinarily impressive.

02:15:36.150 --> 02:15:37.462
- So, it moved their cognition closer

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:39.743
to their biological age?
- Biological age.

02:15:39.743 --> 02:15:41.282
Biological age.

02:15:41.282 --> 02:15:43.853
- Do you recall what the
doses of magnesium threonate-

02:15:43.853 --> 02:15:46.074
- It's in the paper and it's basically

02:15:46.074 --> 02:15:47.994
what they have in the compound,

02:15:47.994 --> 02:15:49.822
which is sold commercially.

02:15:49.822 --> 02:15:53.240
So, the compound which
is sold commercially

02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:58.240
is handled by a nutraceutical wholesaler

02:15:58.510 --> 02:16:00.360
who sells it to the retailers

02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:02.923
and they make whatever
formulation they want.

02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:09.670
But it's a dosage which is,

02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:12.560
my understanding is rarely tolerable.

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.493
I take half a dose.

02:16:15.450 --> 02:16:16.413
The reason I take half a dose

02:16:16.413 --> 02:16:20.880
is that I had my blood magnesium measured,

02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:25.840
and it was low normal for my age.

02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:28.650
I took half a dose, it became high normal,

02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:31.373
and I felt comfortable
staying in the normal range,

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:35.224
but a lot of people are taking

02:16:35.224 --> 02:16:40.224
the full dose and at my age,
I'm not looking to get smarter,

02:16:43.548 --> 02:16:46.350
I'm looking to decline more slowly.

02:16:46.350 --> 02:16:48.829
And it's hard for me to tell you whether

02:16:48.829 --> 02:16:50.670
or not it's effective or not.

02:16:50.670 --> 02:16:53.517
- Well, you remembered the
millimolar of the magnesium

02:16:53.517 --> 02:16:55.930
and the solution and on
the high and low end,

02:16:55.930 --> 02:16:58.816
so I would say it's not
a well controlled study

02:16:58.816 --> 02:17:03.816
and it's an N of one, but
it seems to be working.

02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:06.810
- When I've recommended it to my friends,

02:17:06.810 --> 02:17:10.510
academics who are not by nature skeptical,

02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:14.430
if not cynical, and I
insist that they try it,

02:17:14.430 --> 02:17:17.840
they usually don't report a major change

02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:19.190
in their cognitive function,

02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:20.807
although sometimes they do report,

02:17:20.807 --> 02:17:23.947
"Well, I feel a little
bit more alert than my,

02:17:23.947 --> 02:17:26.020
my physical movements are better,"

02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:28.819
but many of them report they sleep better.

02:17:28.819 --> 02:17:30.810
- And that makes sense.

02:17:30.810 --> 02:17:33.450
I think there's good
evidence that threonate

02:17:33.450 --> 02:17:35.431
can accelerate the transition

02:17:35.431 --> 02:17:37.325
into sleep and maybe even access

02:17:37.325 --> 02:17:41.901
to deeper modes of sleep for some people.

02:17:41.901 --> 02:17:43.720
For many people actually,

02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:46.330
a small percentage of
people who take threonate

02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:50.170
including one of our podcast staff here

02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:52.590
have stomach issues with it.

02:17:52.590 --> 02:17:53.423
They can't tolerate it.

02:17:53.423 --> 02:17:55.010
So, I would say just anecdotally,

02:17:55.010 --> 02:17:57.700
about 5% of people don't
tolerate threonate well.

02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.380
Stop taking it and then they're fine.

02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:02.110
It caused them diarrhea
or something of that sort,

02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:03.097
but most people tolerate it well

02:18:03.097 --> 02:18:06.540
and most people report that it
vastly improves their sleep.

02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:07.690
And again, that's anecdotally.

02:18:07.690 --> 02:18:10.720
There are a few studies and
there are more on the way,

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:13.050
but that's very interesting because I,

02:18:13.050 --> 02:18:15.410
until you and I had the
discussion about threonate,

02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:20.250
I wasn't aware of the
cognitive enhancing effects,

02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:22.850
but the story makes sense from
a mechanistic perspective.

02:18:22.850 --> 02:18:25.820
And it brings it around to a bigger

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:27.110
and more important statement,

02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:32.110
which is that I so appreciate
your attention to mechanism.

02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:35.190
I guess this stems from
your early training

02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:36.993
as a physicist and the
desire to get numbers

02:18:36.993 --> 02:18:40.893
and to really parse
things at a fine level.

02:18:42.090 --> 02:18:43.560
So, we've covered a lot today.

02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:45.320
I know there's much more
that we could cover.

02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:48.600
I'm going to insist on a
part two at some point,

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:51.350
but I really want to speak on behalf

02:18:51.350 --> 02:18:53.560
of a huge number of
people and just thank you,

02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:56.880
not just for your time and
energy and attention to detail

02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:59.490
and accuracy and clarity
around this topic today,

02:18:59.490 --> 02:19:02.530
but also what I should
have said at the beginning,

02:19:02.530 --> 02:19:05.400
which is that you really are a pioneer

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.660
in this field of studying respiration

02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:09.973
and the mechanisms underlying respiration

02:19:09.973 --> 02:19:13.598
with modern tools for
now for many decades,

02:19:13.598 --> 02:19:16.678
and the field of neuroscience was one

02:19:16.678 --> 02:19:20.410
that was perfectly
content to address issues

02:19:20.410 --> 02:19:24.860
like memory and vision and
sensation perception, et cetera.

02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:27.970
But the respiratory system
was largely overlooked

02:19:27.970 --> 02:19:31.680
for a long time and you've just
been steadily clipping away

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:34.090
and clipping away and
much cause of the events

02:19:34.090 --> 02:19:39.090
of related to COVID and
a number of other things,

02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:41.077
and this huge interest in breathwork

02:19:41.077 --> 02:19:43.490
and brain states and wellness,

02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:44.649
the field of respiration

02:19:44.649 --> 02:19:47.643
and interest in respiration
has just exploded.

02:19:49.450 --> 02:19:52.110
So, I really want to
extend a sincere thanks.

02:19:52.110 --> 02:19:54.000
It means a lot to me,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.190
and I know to the audience of this podcast

02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:59.120
as someone with your depth
and rigor in this area

02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:01.520
is both a scientist and a practitioner,

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:02.930
and that you would share this with us.

02:20:02.930 --> 02:20:03.850
So, thank you.

02:20:03.850 --> 02:20:05.470
- Well, I want to thank you.

02:20:05.470 --> 02:20:07.315
This is actually a great
opportunity for me.

02:20:07.315 --> 02:20:11.610
I've been isolated in
my silo for a long time,

02:20:11.610 --> 02:20:15.147
and it's been a wonderful
experience to communicate

02:20:15.147 --> 02:20:17.860
to people outside the silo
who have an interest in this.

02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:21.590
And I think that there's a
lot that remains to be done,

02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:24.930
and I enjoy speaking to people
who have interest in this.

02:20:24.930 --> 02:20:28.017
I find the interest to
be quite mind-boggling

02:20:28.017 --> 02:20:32.773
and it's quite wonderful
that people are willing to,

02:20:32.773 --> 02:20:37.773
and listen to things that can
be quite esoteric at times,

02:20:38.350 --> 02:20:41.580
but it gets down to deep
things about who we are

02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:43.220
and how we are going to live our lives.

02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:47.030
So, I appreciate the opportunity
and I would be delighted

02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:48.970
to come back at any time.

02:20:48.970 --> 02:20:49.803
- Wonderful.

02:20:49.803 --> 02:20:50.760
We will absolutely do it.

02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:51.860
Thanks again, Jack.

02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:53.350
- Bye now.

02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:54.772
- Thank you for joining
me for my conversation

02:20:54.772 --> 02:20:56.780
with Dr. Jack Feldman.

02:20:56.780 --> 02:20:58.570

02:20:58.570 --> 02:21:00.910

I teach neuroscience on
Instagram and Twitter.

02:21:36.810 --> 02:21:39.280
Some of that information
covers information covered

02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:40.200
on the podcast,

02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:42.530
some of that information
is unique information,

02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:45.310
and that includes science
and science-based tools

02:21:45.310 --> 02:21:47.060
that you can apply in everyday life.

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:48.410
During today's podcast,

02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:50.690
and on many previous podcast episodes,

02:21:50.690 --> 02:21:51.980
we talk about supplements.

02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:54.340
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.950
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.

02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:58.480
One of the key issues with supplements

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.560
if you're going to take
them is that they be

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:01.870
of the utmost quality.

02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:03.550
For that reason, The Huberman Lab Podcast

02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:06.650
has partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:09.090
Thorne Supplements are of
the very highest quality,

02:22:09.090 --> 02:22:11.030
both with respect to the quality

02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:12.370
of the ingredients themselves,

02:22:12.370 --> 02:22:14.700
and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients.

02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:15.533
Why do I say that?

02:22:15.533 --> 02:22:17.759
Well, many supplement companies
out there list amounts

02:22:17.759 --> 02:22:20.570
of particular substances on the bottle,

02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:21.650
and when they've been tested,

02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:25.060
they do not match up to what's
actually in those products.

02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:27.050
Thorne has the highest
levels of stringency

02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:30.070
for quality and the particular amounts

02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:31.970
that are in each product.

02:22:31.970 --> 02:22:33.500
They partnered with the Mayo Clinic

02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:34.570
and all the major sports teams,

02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:36.780
so there's tremendous
trust in Thorne products.

02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.150
That's why we partnered with them.

02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:40.130
If you're interested in seeing
the supplements that I take,

02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:43.990
you can go to thorne.com/
the letter U /huberman.

02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:46.190
You can see the supplements
that I take from Thorne.

02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:48.150
If you purchase any of
those supplements there,

02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:50.710
you can get 20% off and
if you navigate further

02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:53.010
into the Thorne site to see the huge array

02:22:53.010 --> 02:22:54.350
of other products that they make,

02:22:54.350 --> 02:22:57.310
if you go in through
thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:22:57.310 --> 02:22:58.950
you'll also get 20% off any

02:22:58.950 --> 02:23:00.670
of the products that Thorne makes.

02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:03.090
I also want to just mention one more time,

02:23:03.090 --> 02:23:04.640
the program that I
mentioned at the beginning

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.840
of the episode, which is
Our Breath Collective,

02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:08.320
the Our Breath Collective

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.140
has an advisory board that includes people

02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:11.490
like Dr. Jack Feldman,

02:23:11.490 --> 02:23:14.210
where you can learn detailed
breathwork protocols.

02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:16.218
If you're interested in
doing or teaching breathwork,

02:23:16.218 --> 02:23:18.180
I highly recommend checking it out.

02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:21.540
You can find it at
ourbreathcollective.com/huberman,

02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:24.400
and that will give you
$10 off your first month.

02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:25.671
So, I want to thank you
once again for joining me

02:23:25.671 --> 02:23:28.190
for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman,

02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:30.260
and last but certainly not least,

02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:31.835
thank you for your interest in science.

02:23:31.835 --> 02:23:34.502
