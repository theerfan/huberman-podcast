00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.930
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.720
where we discuss science

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.575
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:09.600
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.460
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.670
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.900
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.310
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.370
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.440
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.730
In keeping with that theme

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.700
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.458
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:37.170
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.900
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.600
to help you better understand your body

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.580
and reach your health goals.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.710
I've long been a fan of doing blood tests

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.000
and more recently as they've
been developed also DNA tests.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.220
And the reason for that is
that so many of the factors

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.780
that impact our immediate
and longterm health

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.070
and that inform our health choices

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.680
can only be analyzed by
way of blood or DNA tests.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.210
The great thing about InsideTracker

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.820
is they make getting the blood
and DNA test extremely easy.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.360
They'll come to your home if you like,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.350
or you can go to a place where you can

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.870
get your blood drawn and
your DNA swab taken there.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.600
As well once you get the information back

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.300
from InsideTracker, it's
very easy to understand

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.550
what to do with that information,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.383
how to interpret it.

00:01:21.383 --> 00:01:23.540
And that's really what
sets InsideTracker apart

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.830
I believe from other blood and DNA

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.160
testing tools and companies.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.690
Most sources and companies
will give you information back

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.370
about what your levels of hormones are,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.420
and metabolic factors, et cetera,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.240
but no clear directives about what to do

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.480
with that information to get those markers

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.510
in the ranges that you want

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.190
in order to optimize your health.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.050
InsideTracker makes that all very easy.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.280
It gives you directives about exercise,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.770
about nutrition,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.030
about various supplements you
may or may not want to take.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.350
And once again, only
through blood and DNA tests

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.420
can you access that information?

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.100

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.060
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.920
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.360
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.297
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012.

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:25.110
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.610
I started taking Athletic Greens

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.600
and I still take Athletic
Greens once or twice a day

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.760
because it covers all my
nutritional, vitamin, mineral

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.340
and probiotic basis.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.910
Of course, you can get
vitamins, and minerals,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.530
and probiotics from food,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.760
but many of us including
me find it hard to do that

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.240
on a consistent basis.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.040
Especially when I'm working a lot,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.680
when stress and sleep
aren't optimized, et cetera.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.630
With Athletic Greens

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.600
I make sure to get all the things I need

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.140
and then all the other
supplements I take or what I eat

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.600
I can consider additional insurance.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.990
The great thing about Athletic
Greens is it tastes great.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.240
I like to mix mine with water

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.490
and a little bit of lemon juice.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.340
I take it once early in the day

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.130
and then sometimes again in the afternoon.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.850
The fact that it includes probiotics

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.280
is really important to me.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.110
There are so many data
now pointing to the fact

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.730
that probiotics and gut brain health,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.350
and gut health generally are
very important for metabolism,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.430
for hormone output, for
neurotransmitter production,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.140
so many vital things
related to our health,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.240
Athletic Greens makes it easy to make sure

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.750
that I'm getting everything that I need

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.500
in the vitamin mineral
and probiotic department.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.930
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.260

plus a year supply of
vitamin D three K two.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.920
There's now a ton of data as well,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.330
pointing to the fact that
vitamin D three and K2

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.840
are important for a huge number
of health related factors,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.650
including hormones, metabolic factors,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.360
neuro-transmitters et cetera.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.140
So they have the year
supply of vitamin D three

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.160
completely free along with
your Athletic Greens offer,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.950
and you get the five free travel packs.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.060
So if you'd like to try that

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.680
you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.580
and claim this special offer.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.470
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.980
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.310
I started meditating many years ago,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.730
but I found it was
difficult to stay consistent

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.430
with my meditation practice.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.390
In fact when I would get
stressed or really busy

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.030
that's when I probably needed

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.410
the meditation practice the most.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.290
And that's when I tended to
drop the meditation practice

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.610
and run around doing other things.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.780
So it was really a kind of catch 22.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.440
I learned about Headspace a few years ago

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.290
on Jet Blue Flights when
they had them included

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.050
as an option of whether
or not to watch a movie,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.070
or a television show, or do meditation.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.160
I tried the meditation
and I really liked it.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.570
Very easy to follow along
with a Headspace meditation.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.150
The meditations that they
include on the Headspace app,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.130
are also backed by dozens of peer reviewed

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.890
quality independent studies.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.580
And of course there are now thousands

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.190
of peer reviewed quality studies

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.300
pointing to the fact that
a meditation practice

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.470
is beneficial for sake of improved sleep,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.560
for reducing stress,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.180
and a number of other health metrics,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.290
cardiovascular disease, risk, et cetera.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.950
The great thing about Headspace

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.690
is it's allowed me to
stay really consistent

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.950
with my meditation practice.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.230
They have meditations
of different duration

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.450
and different type, so
you never get bored.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.410
I actually look forward
to my meditation practice

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.000
and it continues to benefit me.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.660
In fact, since starting Headspace,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.700
I've been consistent with
meditation for much longer

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.530
than I ever had previously.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.810
If you want to try Headspace

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.180
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.490
and you'll get a free one month trial

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.800
with Headspace's full
library of meditations

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.160
for every situation.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
That's headspace.com/specialoffer

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.840
to get one month free trial,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.870
that's their best offer
out there right now.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.110
And then you can try their
full library of meditations

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.600
for every situation.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.620
Today, we're going to continue
our discussion about hormones

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.650
and we're going to focus
on how particular hormones

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.700
influence our energy levels
and our immune system.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.780
Now, last episode I mentioned at the end

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.020
that we were concluding
our month on hormones,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.092
but we decide to include
this additional episodes,

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.770
so this would be the fifth episode

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.070
in the sequence of
episodes about hormones.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.160
Because there are two hormones
which are vitally important

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.610
for a huge number of biological functions

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.260
that we will talk about today,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.050
but that are particularly
important for energy levels

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.270
and your immune system.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.770
This is something that
I get asked about a lot.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.940
So rather than skip to
the next general topic,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.950
today we're going to
talk about the hormones

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.743
cortisol and epinephrine
also called adrenaline.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.360
You do not have to have heard

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.980
the previous episodes on hormones

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.420
in order to understand
and digest the material

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.210
from today's podcast.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.830
If I mentioned anything
related to previous episodes,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.020
I promise to give a little
bit of quick background

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.860
to get everyone up to speed.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.730
Today, we're going to talk
about the biology of cortisol.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.080
We're going to talk about
the biology of epinephrine.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.420
As always we'll talk mechanism

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.510
and there are going to be a lot of tools.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.700
If you're somebody who
struggles with stress

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.980
and energy levels,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.680
and balancing stress and energy levels,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.480
today's episode is going
to be vital for you.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.310
If you're somebody who
has challenges with sleep

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.580
or you're somebody who has challenges

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.660
getting your energy level
up throughout the day,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.220
and getting your energy level
down when you want to sleep

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.160
today's episode is also for you.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.420
And we're going to talk
about the immune system

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.220
and how to enhance the
function of your immune system.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.160
We're also going to get
into some fun topics

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.910
related to learning and memory

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.180
and how you can leverage cortisol

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.200
and epinephrine in particular,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.710
in order to learn faster.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.490
we're going to talk about
so-called nootropics,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.290
smart drugs and how they work,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.280
because there's several of them

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.460
that tap into the epinephrine system

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.090
that aren't often discussed

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.750
and that you have access to.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.100
We're going to talk about how caffeine

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.640
can actually rewire your
brain for better or for worse.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.270
And we're going to talk about
the biology of comfort foods

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.180
and why they work so well,
and what they're doing.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.700
And in understanding that

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.020
you'll be able to better
understand your food choices

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.540
as they relate to short-term
and long-term energy.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.870
So we have a lot to cover,

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.310
everything will be timestamped.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.760
I want to just remind people
that we caption every episode

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.810
in English and in Spanish.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.690
The captions take a day or
two to pop up on YouTube.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.780
So if you're not seeing those

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.380
within the first couple of days,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.430
please be patient with us,

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.490
in order to get captions
that actually read

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.270
similarly to what I'm saying.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.060
we go through a captioning service,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.145
and so we have them done by experts

00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:15.930
and that takes a little
bit of additional time.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.570
Meanwhile if you have any questions

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.590
as the episode evolves
please write them down.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.180
Please put them in the comment section.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.740
Please subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.500
and let's get started talking about

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.100
how to increase your energy,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.390
and improve and increase your immunity

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.710
by leveraging the biology
of cortisol and adrenaline.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.210
Before we dive into the biology

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.160
of increasing energy
and your immune system,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.080
I want to cover three topics

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.700
that I promised I would
mention from previous episodes.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.040
The first one relates
to intermittent fasting.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.610
The second one relates to
why your stomach grumbles.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.200
I forgot to mention the
biology of that last time.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.510
And the third is a powerful
way to increase growth hormone,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.700
which is powerful for
increasing metabolism,

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.750
fat burning, and tissue repair, et cetera.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.650
That doesn't involve a sauna

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.230
or wrapping yourself in plastic bags

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.090
and going for a jog.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.930
So first intermittent fasting.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.140
Last episode I talked a
lot about growth hormone

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.290
and thyroid hormone,

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.360
and I mentioned things like
sauna and exercise, and sleep,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.870
and how they can increase
levels of growth hormone

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.840
within the healthy ranges.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.420
And why increasing growth
hormone can be very beneficial

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.840
because it can burn off body fat,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.050
it can improve muscle and
general tissue health,

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.430
cartilage, et cetera.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.430
And we tend to lose,

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.270
or our levels of growth
hormone are reduced as we age.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.337
Many people asked me,

00:09:36.337 --> 00:09:37.460
"well, what about fasting?"

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.490
Everyone's been promised on the internet

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.760
that intermittent fasting

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.070
leads to these big
increases in growth hormone.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.530
The reason I didn't mention it

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.780
is that I couldn't find a study

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.760
that actually pointed to
the underlying mechanism.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.520
I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.370
Lots of degrees behind people's names,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.250
sometimes biologists,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.060
sometimes entirely different
fields talking about this,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.080
but very few studies.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.720
And then I found what I
would consider the study.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.180
We will link to this study.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.970
Turns out that fasting does
increase growth hormone levels

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.750
and the way that it
does it is fascinating.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.490
I mentioned in a previous podcast

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.580
about hunger and timing of
meals and timing of hunger,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.100
that when you're hungry

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.300
you release a hormone in
your body called ghrelin,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.080
sometimes actually called ghrelin.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.710
Thanks for all of you
ghrelinisters, or ghrelinisters

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.980
that corrected my pronunciation,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.080
it's both ghrelin or
ghrelin, either one works.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.640
Ghrelin makes you hungry,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.270
when blood glucose,
your blood sugar is low,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.450
ghrelin is secreted and makes you hungry.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.260
And it turns out that ghrelin,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.000
this hunger hormone actually binds

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.770
to the receptor in the brain

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.110
that normally binds what's called

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.540
growth hormone releasing hormone.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.210
So believe it or not the hunger hormone

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.400
can act like growth
hormone releasing hormone

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.240
and thereby stimulate growth hormone.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.890
Now the levels of growth hormone

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.000
that fasting promotes
through this ghrelin system

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.050
are pretty substantial.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.230
It's about a doubling
of growth hormone levels

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.960
in the waking state.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.430
So we know that you can release
growth hormone in sleep,

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.140
intermittent fasting it turns out

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.030
can increase growth hormone

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:18.040
by binding ghrelin to the growth hormone,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.560
releasing hormone receptor

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.440
and it does it also during the daytime.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.380
So yes indeed fasting can
increase growth hormone,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.440
not to the super levels

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.280
that taking growth
hormone would increase it,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.610
or that a sauna could increase it,

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.570
but it does seem to
increase growth hormone.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.060
Later in today's episode

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.320
we're going to talk a lot about

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.700
different patterns of fasting and eating

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.580
that can control epinephrine.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.630
And so we will turn to
specifics about how long a fast.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.360
Do you need to fast for two
or three days, or 23 hours?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.720
Fortunately for people
like me who love to eat,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.970
that's not the case.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.070
So we'll talk specific fasting protocols

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.193
later in the episode.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.560
We also said, we're going
to talk about tummy grumble,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.520
when your stomach growls

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.840
it is not because of fluid
sifting around in there.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.840
A lot of people think,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.130
Oh, you know it's fluid sifting around.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.970
Turns out that your stomach

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.980
has smooth muscle that lines it sides

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.030
and when you eat something or you don't

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.210
every once in a while
your stomach cinches off

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.180
at the two ends like a bag

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.280
with a hose on either end,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.850
'cause that's essentially
what your digestive system is.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.070
And if there's nothing
in there what happens is

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.220
the muscles that line
the sides of your stomach

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.880
they kind of extend around the stomach

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.350
and these cables,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.350
those are always there and if
you have food in your stomach,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.990
what they do is they churn your stomach.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.960
They literally turn the
muscles of your stomach

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.280
like a tumbler to help break up the food

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.060
that presumably you
didn't chew well enough

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.660
'cause you were eating too fast.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.020
When you don't have any
food in your stomach

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.450
that churning continues.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.970
And that contraction of the muscle,

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.500
the turning, literally
turning over of your muscles

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.920
they don't flip over completely,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.110
but the turning over the muscles,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.940
that's what causes the stomach growling.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.240
If you don't want to be
the person in the meeting,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.480
or sitting there at a in a quiet theater

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.650
whose stomach is growling,

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.860
chew your food better.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.380
That's the simple solution.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.250
And last episode, I talked
a lot about how sauna,

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.910
controlled safe hyperthermia

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.460
can cause huge increases
in growth hormone release

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.700
anywhere from 300 to 500,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.470
even 1600% increases in
growth hormone release.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.830
Really staggeringly high increases.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.090
I pointed out that many people

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.750
don't have saunas in their
yard or in their homes,

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.880
and they would go through
some other measures

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.910
to increase safely their body heat.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.030
You know, creating a steam
room in their bathroom,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.150
or jogging with extra sweats
on this kind of thing.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.890
Many of you asked about hot baths,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.110
hot bags will increase growth hormone,

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.260
however the temperatures that you need

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.670
in order to increase growth hormone

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.840
are high enough that you
run the risk of burn.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.870
And so I really can't
make any recommendations

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.703
about hot bath,

00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:57.670
but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.620
you are going to get some
growth hormone release.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.810
However, the sauna has this advantage of

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.200
you being able to enter 175 degree,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.810
or 200 degree environment,

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.910
provided you're not pregnant,

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.890
you're not a young child, et cetera.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.350
You can do that safely.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.390
And getting big increases
in growth hormone.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.850
The hot bath will lead to

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.570
lesser increases in growth hormone.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.403
We're going to talk a lot about

00:14:17.403 --> 00:14:19.600
temperature regulation
in a future episode,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.990
but as always if you're ever going to

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.610
start playing with
hyperthermia or hypothermia,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.710
cold baths, ice baths,
hot showers, hot baths

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.690
that are beyond the kind of
norm of what's comfortable,

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.920
you have to be extremely careful

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.540
and please consult a doctor.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.720
I think it's fair to say

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.200
that most people would like to have

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.490
a lot of energy during the day,

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.560
if you work during the day.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.870
And they'd like their energy
to taper off at night.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.060
And I think it's fair to say

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.420
that most people don't enjoy being sick.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.733
Nobody wants to get sick.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.840
In other words, you want to have energy,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.860
and you want your immune
system to function well,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.940
to ward off infections of various kinds,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.140
bacterial infections, viral
infections, et cetera.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.330
And it turns out that the two hormones

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.350
that dominate those processes

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.030
of having enough energy and
having a healthy immune system

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.840
are cortisol and epinephrine.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.580
Epinephrine is the same
thing as adrenaline.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.650
In the body we tend to
call adrenaline adrenaline,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.980
and in the brain we tend to
call adrenaline epinephrine.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.030
And I'm sorry for that

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.390
I didn't create this naming system.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.670
And the story behind it is uninteresting

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.670
and not worth our time.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.580
I will use the words
adrenaline and epinephrine

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.770
interchangeably today.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.440
Cortisol is cortisol.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.840
And I just want to
cover a little bit about

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.860
what cortisol and epinephrine are?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.100
Where they are released
in the body and brain?

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.270
Because if you can understand that

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.893
you will understand better
how to control them.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.340
First of all, cortisol
is a steroid hormone

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.920
much like estrogen and testosterone

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.690
in that it is derived from cholesterol.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.100
Now that could be
cholesterol that you eat,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.090
it could be cholesterol
that's produced by the liver.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.360
As many of you probably know

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.810
the relationship between
dietary cholesterol,

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.440
the fats that you eat
and blood cholesterol,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.770
and liver cholesterol is
a very controversial one.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.680
It's a barbed wire topic.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.610
There are people that claim

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.950
that dietary cholesterol has zero impact

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.330
on circulating cholesterol
coming from the liver,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.340
and there are people who
argue the exact opposite,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.240
both with good data in hand I would say.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.760
There are some problems for the idea

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.450
that all your cholesterol levels

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.720
are determined by dietary intake.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.520
Namely, that anorexics

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.730
often have very high levels of cholesterol

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.710
that their liver produces,

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.150
even though they are eating very little

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.980
and sometimes not eating at all.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.390
So understand that cholesterol
is a precursor molecule,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.630
meaning it's the substrate
from which a lot of things

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.140
like testosterone and estrogen are made.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.490
Please also understand that cholesterol

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.720
can be made into estrogen,
or testosterone, or cortisol.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.830
And that cortisol is sort
of the competitive partner

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.350
to estrogen and testosterone.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.200
What this means is,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.800
no matter how much cholesterol
you're eating or you produce,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.730
whether or not it's low or it's high,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.210
if you are stressed
more of that cholesterol

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.110
is going to be devoted
toward creating cortisol,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.550
which is indeed a stress hormone.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.850
However, the word stress
shouldn't stress you out,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.270
because you need cortisol,

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.470
cortisol is vital.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.250
You don't want your cortisol
levels to be too low.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.500
It's very important for
immune system function,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.320
for memory, for not getting depressed.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.160
You just don't want your
cortisol levels to be too high

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.700
and you don't want them to be elevated

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.950
even to normal levels at
the wrong time of day.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.020
So we're going to talk how to control

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.863
the timing and level of your cortisol.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.320
Epinephrine or adrenaline has
also been demonized a bit.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.610
We think of it as the stress hormone,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.010
this thing that makes us
anxious, fight or flight.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.620
You know, we used to get chased by lions

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.710
and tigers, and bears, and now we don't.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.300
and it's this ancient
hangover, that's all wrong.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.250
The fact of the matter is the epinephrine

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.000
is your best friend when
it comes to your immunity,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.890
when it comes to protecting
you from infection.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.650
And we're going to talk about why,

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.070
and epinephrine adrenaline
is your best friend

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.800
when it comes to remembering things

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.510
and learning and
activating neuroplasticity.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.980
We're going to talk about that as well.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.280
Once again, it's a question
of how much and how long

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.080
and the specific timing of release

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.490
of cortisol and epinephrine,

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.620
as opposed to cortisol and
adrenaline being good or bad.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.300
They're terrific when they're regulated,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.450
they are terrible when
they're misregulated.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.940
And we will give you lots of
tools to regulate them better.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.663
Cortisol biology 101 in
less than two minutes.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.460
Your brain makes what we
call releasing hormones

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.470
and in this case, there's
corticotropin releasing hormone.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.220
CRH is made by neurons in your brain,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.140
it causes the pituitary,

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.860
this gland that sits about

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.660
an inch in front of the roof of your mouth

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.313
and the base of your
brain to release ACTH.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.010
ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.980
which sit above your
kidneys in your lower back

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.880
to release cortisol.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.440
A so-called stress hormone,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.730
but I would like you
to think about cortisol

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:30.200
not as a stress hormone
but as a hormone of energy.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.340
It produces a situation
in the brain and body

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.100
whereby you want to move,

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.130
and whereby you don't want to rest,

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.163
and whereby you don't want
to eat at least at first.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.253
Epinephrine or adrenaline
101 in less than two minutes.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.530
When you sense a stressor with your mind

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.700
or your body senses a stressor

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.650
from a wound or something of that sort.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.760
A signal is sent to neurons

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.180
that are in the middle of your body.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.960
They are called the
sympathetic chain ganglia.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.850
The name doesn't necessarily matter.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.830
They release Norepinephrine very quickly.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.260
It's almost like a sprinkler system

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.913
that just hoses your
body with epinephrine.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.800
That will increase heart rate,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.540
will increase breathing rate.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.940
In some cases it will
constrict your blood vessels,

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.460
it will also increase the
size of vessels and arteries

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.000
that are giving blood
flow to your vital organs.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.340
This is why your extremities
get cold when you're stressed

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.630
and your heart is beating faster.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.920
More of that energy is being
devoted toward your core.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.513
You also release adrenaline
from your adrenals,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.913
again riding on top of your kidneys.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.560
Those are second system

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.890
whereby your system gets flooded
with adrenaline in pulses.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.610
So you can get one pulse,
you can get 10 pulses.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.350
We'll talk about how to
regulate the number of pulses

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.210
and you release it from
an area of your brain

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.830
called locus coeruleus,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.410
and that creates alertness in your brain.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.930
If you want to learn more
about the stress response

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.270
and all the details of that,

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.450
including some protocols
of how to regulate stress

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.360
please see our episode about stress.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.400
I go into a lot of detail there.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.590
I will touch on some of
the same themes today,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.693
but I really want to cover
energy and the immune system.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.000
And if you're very much interested

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.940
in stress per say and stress regulation,

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.713
please see the episode on stress.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.210
Okay. So we have cortisol
and we have epinephrine,

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.430
and their net effect
is to increase energy.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.530
So first of all, I want to give you a tool

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:42.530
that will help you regulate cortisol

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.610
and can also help stave off

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.130
certain patterns of mental illness.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.400
Now of course it's not going to
cure mental illness on its own,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.390
but it can support healthy state of mind,

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.740
and can help reduce
unhealthy states of mind,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.300
including depression.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.010
So the first tool is to make sure

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.450
that your highest levels of cortisol

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.000
are first thing in the
morning when you wake up.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.440
One way or another every 24 hours

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.560
you will get an increase in cortisol.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.423
That is non-negotiable that
is written into your genome.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.470
That increasing cortisol
is there to wake you up

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.030
and to make you alert,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.070
it's to stimulate
movement from being sleep,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.940
presumably horizontal,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.030
to getting up and starting
to move about your day.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.500
And I've said it before,
but I will say it again

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.110
the best way to stimulate that

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.560
increase in cortisol
at the appropriate time

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.740
is that very soon after waking

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.340
within 30 minutes or so after waking,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.510
get outside view some sunlight,

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.680
even if it's overcast,

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.080
get outside view some
sunlight, no sunglasses.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.650
Never look at any light so bright

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:48.590
that it could damage your eyes,

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.100
but do that for two to 10 minutes.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.350
If it's very bright two minutes,

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.690
if it's not so bright 10 minutes.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.760
Do that, because in the
early part of the day

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.290
you have the opportunity to
time that cortisol release

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.780
to the early part of the day,

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.940
which will improve,

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.680
this has been backed by
peer reviewed studies,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.330
it will improve your focus,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.490
it will improve your energy levels,

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.500
and it will improve your
learning throughout the day.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.500
It will also prevent a late
shift in cortisol increase.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.280
And late shifted cortisol,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.180
meaning cortisol that increases
around 8:00 or 9:00 PM

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.800
is a signature feature of
many depressive disorders,

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.580
including major depression, anxiety.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.770
And that of course correlates

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.780
with things like insomnia, et cetera.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.830
So that's a key tool,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.620
and I don't know how many of
you are already doing that,

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.450
but it is vital to do.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.390
Now I mentioned sunlight
even on cloudy days

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.950
and there are specific reasons for that.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.050
So I want to just briefly cover the data

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.730
because in the episodes on sleep,

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.260
I talked about brightness of light

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.630
in regulating cortisol and sleep.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.920
And I talked about how to
measure lux, brightness,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.940
but I was not specific enough I realized

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.470
based on the questions that I've received

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.550
since that episode.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.190
So here's how it works,

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.140
going outside and getting some sunlight

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.210
requires that I also tell you how long

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.270
and under what conditions.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.470
I've said looking through
a window is not as good,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.900
it takes 50 times longer

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.050
to get as much light,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.240
Many, many questions have told me

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.670
that I'm not being specific enough.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.150
So I'm going to give you the data

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.830
and from the data you will understand

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.700
exactly how long you
need to do this each day.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.480
On a sunny day, so no cloud cover,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.970
provided that the sun is not yet overhead.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.650
It's somewhere low in the sky

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.940
could have just crossed the horizon,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.030
or if you wake up a little bit later

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.830
it could be somewhat low in the sky.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.740
Basically the intensity
of light, the brightness,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.000
is somewhere around 100,000 Lux.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.230
Lux is just a measurement of brightness.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.500
If you want to download
the app Light Meter,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.550
that is a free app that
will allow you to do that.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.370
You can hold your finger down
on the little button there

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.520
and you can move it around,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.330
and it will continuously
give you a Lux read out.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:03.380
It's not perfect, it's not
exact, but it's pretty good.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.300
and it is zero cost.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.300
I have no relationship to
Light Meter the company.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.780
On a cloudy day it's about 10,000 Lux.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.240
Okay. So tenfold reduction.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.850
But bright artificial light,

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.010
very bright artificial light

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.533
is somewhere around 1000 lux.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:26.403
And ordinary room light is
somewhere around 100-200 lux.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.960
And it has to do with how
much light scatter there is.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.470
So even if you have a very bright bulb

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.370
sitting right next to you,

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.740
that's not going to do the job.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.390
Your phone will not do the
job not early in the day

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.700
to get the cortisol released
at the appropriate time

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.410
you need to get outside.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.710
So let's just set a
couple general parameters.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.380
If it's bright outside and no cloud cover

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.750
that light can be indirect.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.060
You don't have to be staring into the sun,

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.380
please don't damage your eyes.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.280
We can't regenerate those neurons yet

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.090
and restore vision that's lost,

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.470
but if you have to blink,
that means it's too bright.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.860
It's fine to blink of course,
please do if you need to.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.483
Get outside for 10 minutes,

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.250
or five minutes should suffice,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.680
but 10 minutes is sure to suffice.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.280
If it's a cloudy day, dense overcast,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.370
you're probably going to
need about 30 minutes.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.180
If it's light cloud broken cloud cover

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.260
it's probably going to be somewhere
between 10 and 20 minutes.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.560
And if you can't get outside

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.060
or you're on an airplane
and it's bright overhead,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.560
artificial lights or ordinary room lights

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.290
it's going to take you
about six hours of light.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.800
And by time you reach the middle of your

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.790
sort of wakeful period, it's too late.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.040
You won't be able to shift your clock

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.380
and your cortisol will start
drifting later and later.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.180
This is why it's vital to get
this light on a regular basis,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.730
to get that cortisol
released early in the day.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.600
That sets you up for
optimal levels of energy,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.480
it sets you up for great sleep.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.790
But today's not really about sleep

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.010
it's more about energy that cortisol pulse

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.050
and the stress that you
might feel early in the day

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.730
from having a little bit extra energy.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.120
That is the energy that you want

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.930
in order to move about and
learn, and do various things.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.130
That is a healthy level of energy.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.170
So please try and get that sunlight.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.730
If it's within your protocols to do that,

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.190
and try and get sufficient sunlight

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.310
first thing in the morning,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.510
again within the first hour.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.820
That's the best way to make sure

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.310
that you time your cortisol appropriately.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.210
Now throughout the day

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.890
you're going to experience
different things.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.900
Most of you are not
spending your entire day

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.580
trying to optimize your health.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.440
Some of you might be,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.270
but most of you have jobs
and you have families,

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.560
and you have commitments.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.030
Life enters the picture
and provides you stressors,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.660
and those stressors, whatever
they may happen to be,

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.930
a difficult coworker,

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.230
some disappointment about something,

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.740
you didn't get the raise you expected,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.300
or you didn't get the
vacation that you expected.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.820
Those will cause increases
in cortisol and epinephrine.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.540
This is important to understand,

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.510
you don't have the luxury

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.190
of just having this morning cortisol

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.610
and then having a taper off.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.910
You want that major
cortisol early in the day

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.370
but then you can expect,

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.910
you should expect increases
in cortisol and adrenaline

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.990
throughout the day

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.220
based on events that
are unpleasant to you.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.440
So for me, the events that
are most unpleasant to me

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.430
are things like traffic,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.610
emails that ask me to fill out a form

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.150
for which I can't find the link.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.700
These kinds of things stress me out,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.880
I'm a human being.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.410
I don't lose my cool over them

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.010
but I can feel my level of alertness

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.380
and kind of frustration increased.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.470
The normal kind of things
that go with stress

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:27.603
tense up a little bit.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.090
The key is these blips in
cortisol and epinephrine

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.890
need to be brief.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.960
You can't have them so
often or lasting so long

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.410
that you are in a state of
chronic cortisol elevation

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.000
or chronic epinephrine elevation.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.560
This system of stress was designed

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.230
to increase your alertness and
mobilize you towards things,

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.040
get you frustrated,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.460
and provide the opportunity
to change behavior.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.620
That's what they were designed to do.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.580
So if you find yourself getting stressed

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.820
and staying stressed,

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.760
there are great tools that we
provide in the stress episode

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.440
that relate to things like
the double inhale exhale,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.010
the so-called physiological sigh.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.250
You can incorporate NSDR,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.140
in non sleep deep rest
protocol, et cetera.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.630
But understand that the energy

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.230
that you experienced during stress,

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.980
that sudden increase in
alertness and attention

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.950
that comes from seeing
something difficult.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.300
That is a healthy hormonal system

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.700
and neural system that's working.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.760
And the reason it works is that cortisol

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.520
when it's released into the bloodstream

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.950
it actually can bind to
receptors in the brain.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.700
It can bind receptors in the amygdala,

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.400
fear centers and threat detection centers,

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.390
but also areas of the
brain that are involved

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.390
in learning, and memory,
and neuroplasticity.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.590
And this is why I say
that neuroplasticity,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.930
the brain's ability to change itself

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.920
in response to experience

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.020
is first stimulated by attention and focus

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.070
and often a low-level state of agitation.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.360
So understand that,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.730
and you won't be quite so troubled about

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.090
the little stress increases

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.170
that you experience throughout the day.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.680
Now, there are ways to leverage stress,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.240
epinephrine and cortisol
in ways that serve you

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.060
and to do it in a deliberate way.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.340
There are also ways to do that

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.090
that increase your level
of stress threshold,

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.950
meaning they make it less likely

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.980
that epinephrine and
cortisol will be released.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.170
So I want to talk about the
science of those practices,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.470
'cause I get asked about
these practices a lot.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.250
Things like Wim Hof breathing

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.030
which is also called tummo breathing.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.370
Things like ice baths.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.150
Things like high intensity
interval training.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.903
All of those things have utility.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.850
The question is how you use them

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.130
and how often you use them.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.530
Those tools just like
stress from a life event

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.320
can either enhance your
immunity or deplete it.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.980
That's right those same practices

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.300
of ice baths, tummo breathing,

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.600
high intensity interval
training, or training of any kind

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.450
can deplete your immune
system or it can improve them.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.200
Excuse me, they can improve it,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.010
meaning they can improve
your immune system.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.240
The key is how often
you use them and when,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.900
and so I want to review that now

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.070
in light of the scientific literature,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.410
because in doing that
you can build practices

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.230
into your daily or maybe
every other day routine

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.880
that can really help buffer you

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.970
against unhealthy levels of
cortisol and epinephrine.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.610
Meaning cortisol increases
that are much too great,

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.350
or that lasts much too long.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.610
Epinephrine increases
that are much too great,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.360
or that last much too long.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.490
And of course we'll talk
about all the negatives

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.370
that go along with
having too much cortisol,

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.240
too much epinephrine for too long.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.690
But you hear about those a lot.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.790
You hear about Cushing syndrome,

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.310
you hear about abdominal fat accumulation.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.830
You hear about sleep disturbances.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.790
I want to arm you with the tools first

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.620
and then we can talk about the dark side,

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.530
and all the things that hopefully

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.210
you'll be able to avoid entirely,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.440
or that you can get yourself out of

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.440
once you have the tools in hand.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.340
Let's say somebody tells you
something very troubling,

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.570
or you look at your phone
and you see a text message

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.253
that's really upsetting to you.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.940
That will cause an immediate increase in

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.320
epinephrine adrenaline
in your brain and body.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.300
And chances are it's going to increase

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.900
your levels of cortisol as well.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.520
Let's say you get into an
ice bath or a cold shower,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.620
even if you love the cold,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.200
or if you hate the cold,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.010
that will cause an equivalent increase

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.330
in epinephrine and cortisol.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.590
We don't know the exact levels

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.700
but it's probably about the same.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.870
Let's say you go out for high
intensity interval training,

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.830
you decide you're going
to run some sprints,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.250
you do some repeats,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.410
or you're going to do some
weightlifting in the gym

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.680
and you love lifting weights in the gym.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.410
Maybe you like the power lifting thing,

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.920
or you decide that you
want to do some hot yoga,

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.603
or some thing that you
really enjoy, or you hate,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.890
you're going to increase your

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.640
epinephrine and cortisol levels.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.483
There's simply no way around this.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.850
Let's say you decide to sit down

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.900
and you're going to do
some deep breathing.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.760
We all hear about the
benefits of deep breathing.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.970
So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.810
You're going to get big increases

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.920
in epinephrine and cortisol.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.540
The data from multiple
studies support this.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.890
All of those are stressors in air quotes.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.380
Now there is a way that
you can cognitively reframe

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.213
what those are.

00:33:14.213 --> 00:33:15.720
You can tell yourself
I love high intensity

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.220
interval training, or
I love weight training.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.067
I personally love exercise.

00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:21.650
I'm not crazy about the cold,

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.870
I do some cold exposure
stuff now and again,

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.650
and we're going to talk a
lot about how to do that

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:29.010
in the optimal way in an upcoming episode.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.220
But you know, getting into the
cold doesn't feel good to me.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.220
I tell myself it's good for me

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.470
and I enjoy it at some point

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.570
usually when I'm getting out.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.060
All of those increase
epinephrine and guess what,

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.240
they increase your levels
of energy and alertness.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.100
So if you're somebody who struggles

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.730
with energy and alertness
it can be beneficial,

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.460
provided you get
clearance from your doctor

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.300
to have some sort of
protocol built into your day

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.330
where you deliberately increase
your levels of epinephrine

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.733
and your levels of cortisol.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.310
And I want to put the
emphasis on deliberately.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.730
So how would you do that?

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.140
Well, it's quite easy
to turn the shower cold

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:08.973
and get into that,

00:34:08.973 --> 00:34:10.150
that will wake you up.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.440
And it literally wakes you up

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.240
because of increases in epinephrine.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.640
You can do deep breathing of the sort

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.920
where you inhale and exhale
repeatedly 25 or 30 times,

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.900
maybe hold your breath for a few seconds

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.220
on an exhale and then repeat,

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.330
so-called Wim Hoff, or
tummo type breathing.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.570
Lots of adrenaline is
released into your system

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.403
when you do that.

00:34:28.403 --> 00:34:30.890
You will have more energy afterwards.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.750
So it's really important to understand

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.700
that the body doesn't distinguish

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.940
between a troubling text
message, ice, tummo breathing,

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.230
or high intensity interval training,

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.913
or any other kind of
exercise, it's all stress.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.410
Cognitively reframing
that and telling yourself

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.790
I like this, I enjoy it.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:51.090
Is not going to change
the way that that molecule

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.180
impacts your body and brain.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.750
I sort of chuckle because
people would love to tell you

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:57.857
that all you have to do is say,

00:34:57.857 --> 00:34:59.620
"Oh, this is good for me." No.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.130
What it does to tell yourself
that it's good for you

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.120
or that you enjoy it.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.390
Is that it liberates other molecules

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.700
like dopamine and serotonin

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.100
that help buffer the epinephrine response.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.460
Now, the way that it does that,

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.890
I've talked about in previous episode,

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.180
but I'll just mention

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.120
that dopamine is the
precursor to epinephrine.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.670
Epinephrine, adrenaline is
made from dopamine, okay?

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.540
Cortisol is made from cholesterol.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.970
Epinephrine is made from dopamine.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.450
And that's why if you tell yourself

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.220
you're enjoying something,

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.140
and because dopamine is so subjective

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.160
that you can in some ways,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.910
as long as you're not
completely lying to yourself,

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.110
you can get more epinephrine,

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.700
you get more mileage or more ability

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.370
to push through something.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.050
And you can sort of reframe it,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.850
but it's not really cognitive reframing.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.520
The cognitive part is the trigger,

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.010
but it's a chemical substance

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.340
that's actually occurring there.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.860
It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine,

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.460
A bigger amplitude epinephrine release,

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.170
and it gives you some sense of control.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.560
So here's a protocol that anyone can use.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.310
If you want to increase levels of energy,

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:10.550
if you suffer from low
energy during the daytime,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.400
or whenever it is that
you'd like to be alert.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.430
Pick a practice that you
can do fairly consistently,

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:17.700
maybe every day,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.310
but maybe every third
day or every fourth day,

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.790
maybe it's an ice bath or a cold bath.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.290
Maybe it's a cold shower.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.030
Maybe it's the cyclic inhale exhale,

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.410
breathing protocol I described,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.750
if that wasn't clear and
people always ask for a demo,

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.470
I'm not going to do the
whole thing right now,

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.430
but I'm willing to do
a few rounds of this,

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.830
or a few cycles I should say.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:37.773
So it's inhale.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.950
I would do that more deeply, more like.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.920
You do that 25, 30 times repeatedly

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.510
you will start to feel warm.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.860
People in the yoga community,

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.000
they say you're generating heat.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.450
You're not generating
heat, releasing adrenaline.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.940
Inhale and exhale, inhale
exhale 25 or 30 times,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.640
you will feel agitated and stressed.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.300
That's because you're releasing
adrenaline in your body

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.460
and that's because you're releasing

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.433
norepinephrine in your brain,

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.840
and you'll be more alert.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.270
Then you can follow that
25 or 30 breath cycles

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.623
with an exhale hold,

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.870
and hold your breath for 15 to 30 seconds.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.900
Always, always, always
do this on dry land.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.930
Never while driving,
operating heavy machinery,

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.030
all the standard safety protocols.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.510
Never near water please,

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.160
people have passed out and died doing this

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.720
with breath holds in water.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.710
There are several deaths
associated with it,

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.080
on land it's probably safer,
clear with your doctor,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.287
but 25, 30 breaths exhale hold,

00:37:34.287 --> 00:37:36.800
25, 30 breasts again exhale hold,

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.020
25 30 breasts again exhale hold.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.670
And then if you like you
can do an inhale and hold

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.343
if that's within your margins of safety.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.990
So if all these protocols,

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.770
all these activities are just equivalent,

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.360
they're just stress.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.040
Then how do we make them good for us?

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.960
How do we actually benefit from them?

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.010
Now, of course the cold itself

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.040
can have some health promoting effects.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.340
It can increase brown fat
thermogenesis and metabolism,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.610
high intensity interval training,

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.610
or other forms of exercise

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.210
of course has cardiovascular effects

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.690
that can be good for us

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.370
as does weight training, et cetera.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.120
But what we're talking about here

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.620
are ways to increase energy
and to teach our brain and body

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.120
to teach ourselves how to
regulate the stress response.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.500
So in addition to the benefits
of the actual practices

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.970
what we're talking about
is building a system

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.310
so that when you experience

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.750
increases in epinephrine and
cortisol from life events

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.540
you're able to better buffer those.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.360
And we are also talking about

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.170
ways that you can increase energy overall.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.130
'Cause that's what today's
episode is all about,

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.150
energy and the immune system.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.740
And indeed, we will talk about

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.120
how you can actually
leverage specific protocols

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.900
to increase your immune system on demand.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.870
There's great scientific data

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.380
to support that one can do that.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.670
So there's a biological
mechanism that's very important

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.220
if you want to do those things,

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.000
increase energy and your
immune system on demand.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.690
Learn to buffer stress
on demand in real time.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:12.210
And it means taking these protocols,

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.010
these practices whether
or not it's cold water,

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.330
or ice bath, or exercise, or any of those

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.610
and making one small but
very powerful adjustment

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.060
in how you perform them.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.800
But in order to make that adjustment,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.720
I can't just tell you the adjustment.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.210
I have to tell you the mechanism

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:31.760
so that you know if you're
doing it correctly or not.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.060
This is really a case where

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.820
if you can understand a
little bit of mechanism,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:40.820
you will be far better off
than just adopting protocols.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:46.180
So if you take away nothing
else from this episode

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.530
except what I'm about to tell you

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.050
please take away the
information I'm about to tell

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.890
Cortisol as I mentioned is
released from the adrenals

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.710
and it can bind to receptors.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:01.090
It can have action, both in
the body and in the brain.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:02.660
In fact, it can bind to the so-called

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.730
threat detection center in the brain,

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.980
or one of them which is the amygdala,

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.380
also called the fear center.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.940
It can do that because cortisol

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.730
can cross the blood brain barrier.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.830
It can be released in the body and cross

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.140
this biological barrier.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.550
It's like a fence that keeps
things out of the brain

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.723
but cortisol has passing
rights, it can go through.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.860
Epinephrine cannot,

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.670
epinephrine is polarized,

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.680
the shape of it is such that

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.530
it can't make it through
the blood brain barrier.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.130
That's one of the reasons
why it's released both

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.940
from the adrenals in your body

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.040
and released from this brainstem area,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.773
the locus coeruleus in your brain.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.520
That's a powerful thing,
because what it means is that

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.880
the body can enter states
of readiness and alertness

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.970
while the mind remains calm.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.850
That is biologically possible,

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.893
it's not just a psychological trick.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.120
And there are ways that one can do that.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.560
So I'm presuming at this point

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.080
that you're getting your morning light

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.440
to time your cortisol increase.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.020
I'm presuming that you want more energy

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.530
or that you want to
increase your immune system,

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.880
its function and its ability

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.860
to combat infections of various kinds.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.550
And what I'm suggesting is that

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:23.550
you pick from the pallet of
exercises that are out there,

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.010
or tools that are out there
to increase epinephrine.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.930
There are a lot of ways to do that.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.200
You can do that as I
mentioned through cold water,

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.240
through exercise.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.480
You can even do that

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.823
by having confrontations
with other people.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.400
At a biological level, it is identical.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.960
So if you like to go online

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.020
and place the kind of comments

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.210
or read the kinds of things,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.870
or look at the kinds of
things that agitate you,

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.290
you can if you like look
at that as an opportunity,

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.560
I'm not suggesting you do that,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.830
I'd like to see people
taking care of themselves

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.190
and each other in much less
destructive ways frankly.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:01.190
But the prerequisite here
is getting an increase

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.350
in adrenaline released from the body.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.910
Now the simplest way to
describe how to do that

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:09.670
would be in the context of cold water

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.950
or a breathing protocol,

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.910
because then I don't have to deal with the

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.930
unknown life circumstances
that get you triggered,

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.870
or I could say what gets me triggered

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.110
but I'm not going to.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.700
So let's presume cold water.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.360
So let's say you decide you're
going to take a cold shower.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.220
You get into the cold shower
and if it's cold enough,

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.130
that will be stressful,

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.390
you will experience an
increase in epinephrine,

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.590
it will increase your alertness.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.060
Now you're using this as a practice,

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.420
as a tool to build you
could call it resilience,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.610
but the ability to stay calm in the mind

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:42.780
while being stressed in the body,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.070
epinephrine is in the body.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.650
And you do that by subjectively
trying to calm yourself.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.110
Now you can do that by telling
yourself it's good for you

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.270
by emphasizing your exhales.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.920
Anything that you can
do to try and stay calm

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.910
despite the fact that
you are in a heightened

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.540
state of alertness.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.680
You do this with exercise,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.960
you can do this with music.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.580
Pretty much anything that will give you

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.470
a really heightened state of alertness

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.070
offers you the opportunity to
try and stay calm in the mind.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.550
What you're trying to do
at a mechanistic level

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.260
is to have adrenaline
released from the adrenals,

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.160
but not have adrenaline,
epinephrine released

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.580
from the brain stem to the same degree.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.160
So you're not just trying to buffer this,

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.440
you're not trying to say,
"Oh, this is good for me,

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.960
this is good for me, I'm
going to grind this out."

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.660
You're not trying to grind it out,

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.930
you're trying to move through this calmly

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.490
while maintaining alertness.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.830
You're not trying to zone out necessarily,

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.370
although maybe that helps.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.870
You're not trying to distract yourself,

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.910
what you're trying to do is

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:43.360
shift cognitively your
relationship to the somatic,

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.640
to the body stress response.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.077
Now I'm sure some of you
out there are shouting,

00:43:47.077 --> 00:43:49.890
"Yeah, that's exactly like
whatever, whatever, whatever."

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.723
I agree.

00:43:50.723 --> 00:43:53.680
This is in many ways a self-directed

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.940
kind of stress inoculation,

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.110
but we're not talking about
this as stress inoculation.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.870
We're talking about this as a way

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.230
to increase energy and focus.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.750
And the reason is that epinephrine

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.090
when released in the body

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.190
has a profound effect
on the immune system.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.250
And when released in the
brain has a profound effect

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.220
on the ability to learn
and remember information

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.400
and to be alert.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.070
And so we're talking about
splitting the location,

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.700
separating the location from which

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.170
you have epinephrine, adrenaline released.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.220
Okay. So let's say you
are doing this practice

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.320
simply to wake up,

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.760
okay, cold shower will do that,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.023
exercise will do that.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.210
The ability to stay calm in mind

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.780
while having heightened
levels of adrenaline

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.890
and presumably cortisol
as well in the body.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.510
But the cortisol is going
to circulate everywhere.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.200
We'll talk a little bit about
cortisol more in a moment.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.760
You could do that through some
self soothing calming way,

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.100
that's going to be highly individual.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.070
You can do it by telling
yourself you enjoy it, et cetera.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.500
But what you need to understand

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.890
is that in the immediate
period following that practice

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.530
your system, your entire
brain and body are different.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:10.180
Your body is actually
primed to resist infection,

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.300
when you have high levels
of epinephrine in it

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.840
for short periods of time.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.960
So the scientific study that explored how

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.570
increasing adrenaline in the body

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.730
can improve immune resistance is grounded

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.000
in a well-known phenomenon

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.420
that increases in stress

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.340
actually protect you against infection

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.090
in the short term.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.800
So I want to look at
the classic data first,

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.950
describe what was done.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.140
And then I want to talk
about the more recent study

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.210
which is immediately actionable.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.100
There are classic set of
studies that are really based

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.560
mainly on the work of
somebody named Bruce McEwen,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.790
who was at the Rockefeller
University in New York.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.670
Bruce passed away a few years ago,

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:53.440
but he had many decades
of incredibly impactful

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.393
work under his belt when he did.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.230
The work that I'm going to talk about next

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.330
has been done in humans

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:02.780
and has been done in animals,

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.600
and has really explored
how inducing stress

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.730
can enhance the function
of the immune system

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:09.670
in the short term.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.110
And when, I mean short term,

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:14.440
I mean about one to four days.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.470
I'm not going to go through
all the details of the study,

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:20.490
but essentially what they were
doing was exposing subjects

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.960
to some sort of infection,

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.770
either bacterial or viral infection,

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.170
and inducing stress.

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.410
It sounds like a double whammy, right?

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.410
You'd think that maybe getting
a little electric foot shock,

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.110
or cold water exposure,

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.780
or something to increase
your levels of stress

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.810
and adrenaline would just make

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.450
the effects of the infection worse,

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.100
but no, quite the opposite.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.070
Brief bouts of stress,

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.680
which now you should be thinking about

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.260
in terms of cortisol
and epinephrine release

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.923
we're actually able to increase
immune system function.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.170
Now that shouldn't surprise you

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.540
if you understand a little bit

00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:00.770
about how epinephrine works
in the body and in the brain.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.290
It essentially is the signal

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.870
by which the nervous system
can inform immune organs,

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.740
things like the spleen and other organs

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.930
that make killer cells of various kinds,

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.670
B cells and T cells,

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.530
to go in combat infections,

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.360
bacteria, and viruses.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.050
How else would your immune system know

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:19.420
that there was an infection?

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.080
Your immune system can
recognize foreign invaders

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.330
but the nervous system
provides the signal,

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.450
the sort of alarm signal that
liberates the killer cells,

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.100
that tells them there's a problem

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.150
and to go seek out the
problem so to speak.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.810
So the duration here is really important

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.820
because if stress stayed
too high for too long,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.820
then yes indeed stress can
hinder the immune response.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.360
But for a period of
about one to four days,

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.140
it actually can protect you

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.320
by way of increasing the immune response.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.010
Now, I can say with certainty

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.440
that that effect is
governed by epinephrine,

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.830
adrenaline released from the adrenals

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.290
and not from the brain,

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.430
because they actually explored

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.270
whether or not the effect exists

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.800
in the presence of what's
called an adrenalectomy,

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.300
or removing the adrenals.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.880
So I should just say, without the adrenals

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.810
you don't get the effect.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:15.830
So we know that that effect

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.770
comes from adrenaline in the body.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.840
What does that mean for you?

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.090
That means if you want to increase

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:22.890
your immune system in the short term

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.110
you want to increase your
epinephrine in the short-term.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.350
That's why short bouts
of very intense exercise

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.460
probably no more than an hour per day,

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.930
provided you're doing
everything else right,

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.140
sleeping and nutrition, et cetera,

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.850
maybe even shorter bouts
of intense exercise

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.210
or exposure to cold water,

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.720
or that cyclical breathing
that I talked about before,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.770
because they increase epinephrine

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.160
they will bolster the immune system.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.010
And we all hear these reports
every once in a while,

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.420
it seems to be the thing that

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.280
every once in a while there'll
be an article about how

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.030
coffee can improve your immune system,

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.863
or something like that.

00:48:57.863 --> 00:49:00.060
Indeed caffeine can increase epinephrine

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.090
and dopamine to some extent,

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:04.870
but most people are
drinking it chronically.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:09.130
So its effects are probably
due to increases in epinephrine

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.550
and probably whether or
not something like coffee

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.350
or other forms of caffeine can improve

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.850
or degrade your immune system

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.560
will probably depend on whether or not

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.630
you're using it in a way

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.950
that it increases your
adrenaline as a spike,

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.400
that happens rarely,

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.000
you know, once every two or three months,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.430
let's say you have an infection coming on,

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.050
yes, indeed.

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.230
What these data probably mean

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.980
is that drinking some hot caffeinated tea

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.480
or some hot coffee even

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.540
provided you don't get dehydrated from it

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.160
because you're also drinking some water

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.380
can probably improve your
immune system function,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.980
by way of increasing adrenaline release.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.840
But so can the breathing,
so can cold exposure,

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.980
so can exercise.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.680
The mechanism here is what's key,

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.560
and I keep saying that

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.900
because what it means is that

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.630
you don't actually have to
know the specific protocol.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.780
I'm not trying to say, do
this particular protocol.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.170
You have to figure out,

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:00.590
and it should be easy to figure out

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.220
what short term adrenaline
increasing behavior

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.950
you're willing to do on a
regular basis every day,

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.380
or two or three times a week.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.440
Now you could say, well, I'm not sick.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.450
Should I be doing these things often?

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.610
I would say, two or three
times a week at a minimum

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.190
if your goal is to keep
your immune system tuned up

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.000
and you are in the presence of a lot of

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.010
children for instance,

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.130
which carry a lot of bugs,

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:26.990
because their immune
system isn't developed,

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:30.210
or you work in a healthcare setting,

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:33.760
or you're simply somebody
who's prone to get sick.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.620
I can just say anecdotally,

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.730
I guess someone now calls this anecdata

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.080
which I don't like that phrase,

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.520
because it's sort of...

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.190
I don't want anecdotal data to ever be

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.633
misunderstood as anything
but anecdotal data.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.410
Anecdotally, I can say that I've had

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:52.580
instances where I've felt
a throat tickle coming on

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.050
or some sinus infection,

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.242
I will do the cyclic breathing
that I described before.

00:50:57.242 --> 00:50:58.777
25, 30 breasts exhale hold,

00:50:58.777 --> 00:51:01.507
25 30 breasts exhale hold,
25, 30 breaths exhale hold,

00:51:01.507 --> 00:51:02.900
and then big inhale hold.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.690
And most times I didn't
get full blown sick,

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.750
but I also take other
precautionary measures

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.990
to get sleep, et cetera.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.120
So whether or not it was causal,

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.620
or whether or not it's just
correlated I don't know.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.470
However, there's a human study

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.820
that I definitely want
to point out to you,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.250
because it was published more recently

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.190
than the McEwen work.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.580
It was published in the Proceedings

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.420
of the National Academy
of Sciences for the USA,

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.410
because there are Proceedings

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.620
of the National Academy of Sciences

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.470
for many other countries as well.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.457
The title of the paper is

00:51:31.457 --> 00:51:34.290
"Voluntary activation of the
sympathetic nervous system."

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.730
That's the system that causes
fight or flight AKA stress,

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.577
and causes release of adrenaline.

00:51:39.577 --> 00:51:43.680
"And attenuation of the innate
immune response in humans."

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:48.240
This is Kox et al. PNAS,

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.890
Proceedings to the National
Academy of sciences, 2014.

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.940
And they incorporate the
ever famous Wim Hof breathing

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.260
Wim Hof breathing is much
like the breathing protocol

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.200
that I've described several
times now in this podcast.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.260
It's also called tummo breathing.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.270
Other people from other
cultures and communities

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:06.330
have called it other things.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.480
The naming really isn't important.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.070
Although I do think Wim is a pioneer

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:11.820
in trying to bring these practices

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.580
to the general public more broadly

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.513
and was involved in this study.

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.540
The study was done in the Netherlands.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.810
It was communicated by
Dr. Tamas Horvath at Yale,

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:24.240
I mentioned all that.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.750
Horvath is a terrific scientist,

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:29.400
I'm familiar with his
work over many years.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.450
Here's what they did.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.590
They injected people with E. coli

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.270
and they had groups that either

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:42.320
did the sorts of breathing
I've been describing

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.040
that increase adrenaline release.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.030
Although I should say,

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.600
I don't think you need that breathing

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.660
to get adrenaline release.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.990
You could do it with cold exposure,

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:51.860
you could do it with other things,

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.810
high intensity interval training as well.

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:56.030
And what they found was that

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.180
the response to the E.
coli was quite different

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.730
in the people that had a protocol,

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.630
in this case breathing
to increase adrenaline.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:09.580
So this is a remarkable study

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.080
because what they found was
that the fever, the vomiting,

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.970
the all the negative effects of E. coli,

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.340
many of them and some cases all of them

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.670
were greatly attenuated

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.800
by way of engaging the adrenaline system.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.080
In this case using breathing.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.650
They looked at inflammatory cytokines,

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.740
things like IL-6,

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.440
which I've mentioned many
times on this podcast.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.860
This are classic inflammatory
cytokine were reduced.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.770
Things like IL-10

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:37.370
which are anti-inflammatory
were increased.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:40.320
There were some inflammatory
cytokines that were increased.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.363
What's the point here?

00:53:42.363 --> 00:53:45.190
The point is you can
control your immune system,

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:49.110
by finding a way that you
can increase adrenaline.

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.620
And this runs counter
to what we always hear,

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.780
which is don't get too
stressed or you will get sick.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.560
Learn to control adrenaline,
turn it on and turn it off.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.080
Learn to control cortisol,

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.710
turn it on with light in the morning,

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.790
try and turn it off

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:05.690
and then when it spikes
because of life events

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:06.883
learn to turn it off.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.880
Learning to turn on and off
adrenaline, AKA epinephrine,

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.610
and learning to turn on and off cortisol

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.110
affords you the ability to
turn on energy and focus

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.333
in your immune system.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.620
That's the most important
point from today's podcast

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.620
and understanding that it doesn't matter

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.020
what protocol you use.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.160
Maybe it's a cup of coffee

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.990
and running up a hill five or six times,

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:33.690
that will improve your
immune system function

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.250
if you get adrenaline in your system.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.340
You can use an ice bath,

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.330
you can use a cold bath,

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.480
it really doesn't matter.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.490
You get into an argument,

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:42.870
but I'm not suggesting you do that,

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.510
it really doesn't matter.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.910
What's important is that
you're able to then shut off

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:48.020
that response.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.740
And there are ways to do
that we will talk about,

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.680
but I want to talk about
some of the other benefits

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.680
of epinephrine and cortisol

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.560
that occur because of
their actions on the brain.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.140
Because these are many
and they are powerful,

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.610
and they relate to energy,
but also the ability to learn.

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.150
If I haven't already convinced you

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:06.810
that seeing light early in the day

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.290
is good for timing your cortisol.

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:11.550
I should also mention that another hormone

00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:15.310
that I discussed last episode
which is thyroid hormone

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.610
and is critical for setting
your level of metabolism

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:23.610
is controlled in part by
these circadian mechanisms

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:26.253
and cortisol itself.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.400
The short takeaway on this

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.390
is that if you get your cortisol
release early in the day

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.510
it will increase your
energy throughout the day,

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:39.630
it will also time your
thyroid release properly.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.810
So there's yet another reason

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.540
why you would want to
get that light exposure

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.373
early in the day.

00:55:45.373 --> 00:55:48.020
For me that's a non-negotiable practice.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.880
If I'm on a plane, I'll try
and get it any way I can.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.740
I'm not shining
flashlights in my eyes yet,

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.540
but I really try hard to
get that light exposure

00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:01.460
from sunlight early in
the day without fail.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.760
And the thyroid increase
has to do with the fact that

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.320
your circadian clock itself
is regulated by cortisol

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.640
and the circadian clock times the release

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.970
of thyroid hormone.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:14.770
I don't want to go too
far off in that direction,

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:16.763
but there are a number of studies,

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:19.770
Kalsbeek et al.

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:21.523
Kalsbeek et al. 2012.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.330
If you want to look it up
on PubMed is a great one,

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:29.950
that describes how cortisol secretion

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.260
begins to rise during sleep

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.610
and peaks shortly after
waking or immediately before.

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.610
And that times a set of
neurons in the circadian clock

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.170
that then trigger the release of the

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.940
releasing and stimulating
hormones for thyroid.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.770
So a really important mechanism,

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:53.230
and thyroid will also tend
to correlate with energy

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:54.480
but mostly metabolism.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.470
Very important to have thyroid in check.

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:58.420
Now let's talk about
epinephrine and cortisol,

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.823
and learning and memory.

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.760
Everyone has a story
about being so stressed

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.780
they couldn't remember something.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.880
You know, sit down to an exam.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.460
I actually had this happen
once sat down to an exam

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.380
and just blanked, just blanked.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.000
It only happened once, I
don't know what happened.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.370
I don't think it was sleep deprivation

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.490
but I just completely blanked.

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:20.040
And it was very hard for me

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.070
to pull myself out of that ditch.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:25.240
I did manage to do it, but
it was a scary experience.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.350
So I think most people think about stress

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:29.370
and an inability to perform.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:34.000
However, most of the time
increases in epinephrine

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.020
provided they are not through the roof

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.120
lead to improved performance.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.570
Now this has been shown over
and over again on memory tests,

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:47.570
on learning new information,
on physical performance.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.280
That when blood levels
of epinephrine are low

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:52.943
you don't perform very well.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.750
When blood levels of
epinephrine are very high

00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:00.273
up to about 1500 to 1700 pg/mL.

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.640
If anyone's out there, who's
actually measuring this stuff

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.640
but I doubt you are,

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:07.620
performance goes way up.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.220
Performance gets better when you are alert

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.120
and when you're a little bit stressed.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:16.330
Absolutely shown again,
and again, and again.

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:19.750
If you get too stressed,
it's the mental side,

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:22.040
it's the epinephrine in the
brain that causes people

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.620
to either focus on their
somatic response too much.

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:25.780
Like they feel like they're sweating,

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.620
and they're focused on
their bodily response,

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.370
they're not focused on what
it is they're trying to do,

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:32.520
or say, or perform, et cetera, or learn.

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.170
But epinephrine is a nootropic,

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:39.530
it is a smart drug that
we all make internally,

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:42.080
and cortisol is as well.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.540
Now here's the twist

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.290
that does not mean that
you want epinephrine

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.683
high during the exam necessarily.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.610
Memory and learning and
performance are actually favored,

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:02.220
they are enhanced by epinephrine increases

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:04.830
immediately after learning.

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:07.020
And that's something
that's rarely discussed,

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.810
the timing is vital.

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:10.270
So if you learn some information,

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:11.810
you have a conversation

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:15.090
you're trying to learn a new
language, a new motor skill.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.070
Whatever it is that
you're trying to learn,

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:22.530
the increase in epinephrine
that occurs just afterward

00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:25.550
is what's going to
consolidate the information.

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:27.750
It's going to ensure
that the proper circuits

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:29.970
and mechanisms in the
brain for neuroplasticity

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.880
are engaged during sleep later that night

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.600
or the next night which is
when the real rewiring occurs.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.410
And You might say, "That's
crazy, why would that happen?"

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:39.080
Well, we have to remember,

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.990
none of these mechanisms evolved

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:44.300
for us to do what we want and
learn what we want necessarily

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.980
although they will allow us to do that.

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.180
We've experienced this before,

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:53.120
we might have gotten up,
gone outside get in our car,

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.020
drive to work or to somebody's house

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.540
you're not thinking about much at all,

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.200
and then all of a sudden you
see an accident on the road.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.570
Your alertness is primed

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.750
if it happens to be a
particularly gory accident,

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:08.120
there's going to be a lot of
sensory information there.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.800
All of a sudden the
adrenaline, epinephrine

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.230
is released into your brain and body.

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.160
Guess what?

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.810
Not only will you not forget that event,

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:18.660
but you will remember everything
that led up to that event

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.020
which has an adaptive function,

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.820
because your brain and body's

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.330
primary concern is safety, right?

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.350
This is the neuro-biological explanation

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:30.880
for Maslow's hierarchy
of needs is safety first.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.930
And so you have heightened
awareness and alertness

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.540
for everything that preceded

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.060
that spike in adrenaline and cortisol.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.270
So the way to think about this is

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.170
if you need to learn something better,

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.560
if you're taking Adderall,

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560
or you're taking a lot
of coffee beforehand

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.520
you're actually driving the
process in the wrong direction.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.050
You're increasing epinephrine
for learning sure,

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.020
but past a certain point

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.890
you're actually degrading
learning and performance.

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.530
The time to do that is toward the end

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.460
or immediately after the learning,

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.780
because this mechanism
is not simply devoted to

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.970
negative events like a
car crash or a trauma,

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:11.510
it works to make sure that the hippocampus

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:13.190
that encodes memories

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:17.450
as part of the memory and
coding mechanisms is primed.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:20.660
That it's told what you just
experienced is important,

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.550
you're going to need
that information later.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.350
And so I've talked many times before about

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.840
using non sleep deep rest NSDR,

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.440
or ensuring good night's
sleep after learning.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.260
But what we're also talking about

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.950
is as the learning event tapers
off, as you're exiting that,

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:39.820
to make sure that your epinephrine levels

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.810
are not tapering off as well.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:45.230
And this may be one of the
reasons why the 90 minute cycle,

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.610
the so-called ultradian
cycle for learning works,

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:48.570
because it takes a few minutes

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.460
to get into rhythm of learning.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.810
You can maintain that
alertness for about 90 minutes,

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.610
it's no coincidence that
these podcasts are typically

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:58.890
about 90 minutes long.

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:02.410
And as you exit that 90 minutes

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:05.120
you're going to start to feel fatigued.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.500
You're not going to be able to continue

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.960
to secrete epinephrine at the same level.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.220
So I'm not telling you that
at the end of this podcast

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.100
you should give yourself a foot shock,

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.810
or that you should jump into an ice bath.

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:15.643
Although I will say,

01:02:15.643 --> 01:02:17.460
if you were to increase your epinephrine

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.690
at the end of this episode

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:21.060
by breathing or by way of cold shower,

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.180
I'm willing to bet based on
numerous published studies

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.210
that the memory for the
information would be enhanced.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:31.900
Because of this retroactive effect

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.380
of epinephrine and cortisol.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.070
Put simply you can remember things better

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.060
if you increase your alertness,

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.630
AKA your level of epinephrine
and cortisol after,

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:46.090
immediately after something
that you want to learn.

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:48.860
So I'm reminded by people here
at the Huberman Lab Podcast

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.490
that the optimal strategy
therefore would be

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.690
a 90 minute session of focus or learning

01:02:55.690 --> 01:03:00.690
then immediately after cold
shower or tummo type breathing,

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.970
or ice bath or something of that sort,

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.070
maybe a hard run,

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:07.160
or hit training if you can't
get access to the other things.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.270
And then shower up and
do a non sleep deep rest,

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:12.390
and then get a good night's sleep.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.410
Those would be the optimal tools

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:18.730
and the organization of
tools for enhanced learning.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.400
And of course you could use caffeine

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.680
to prime the whole process
by drinking the caffeine

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.440
towards the tail of the learning episode,

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.930
which is counter-intuitive at least to me.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:30.610
I should mention since
many of you use caffeine

01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:31.443
and I use caffeine.

01:03:31.443 --> 01:03:32.460
I do drink coffee,

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.600
I love mushroom coffee.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.600
I love mate.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.763
I drink caffeine and various forms.

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:41.330
There was a study that came out recently

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:44.350
that is relevant to our
discussion about energy

01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:47.180
and alertness, and learning.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:51.450
And the study came out
just recently March 2021,

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.470
it's Maglhaes et al.

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:54.553
So MAGALHAES.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.450
And it was published
in molecular psychiatry

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.610
which is a fine journal,
a peer review journal.

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.667
And the title pretty much gives it away,

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:09.160
"Habitual coffee drinkers
display a distinct pattern

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.850
of brain functional conductivity."

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:15.050
Chronically drinking coffee
changes brain conductivity.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.860
And it does it in a number of ways

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.410
but the key takeaways from this study,

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.860
as it relates to sort
of what the circuits do

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.250
as opposed to me just listing
off a bunch of brain circuits,

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:28.270
which is kind of meaningless
in this conversation

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:33.270
is that people who drank
coffee habitually every day

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.360
had changes in their brain circuitry,

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.107
such that there was a shift
or a bias toward anxiety

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:43.710
even when they don't ingest caffeine.

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:44.760
So a lot of times we think,

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.380
Oh caffeine increases
your levels of anxiety.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:50.620
And indeed it appears it does
if you use it chronically,

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.880
but not just to caffeine,

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.150
it doesn't just raise
your baseline of anxiety

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.930
because of what circulating
in your bloodstream.

01:04:57.930 --> 01:04:59.620
It actually increases connectivity

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.850
between the brain areas
that relate to anxiety.

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.400
Now that could be a good
thing or a bad thing

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.580
depending on how you look at it.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.240
For people that have are
prone to chronic panic attacks

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.310
or anxiety attacks that's
not going to be good.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:14.900
Some people might use
caffeine in healthy ways.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.650
I believe I do in order to

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.400
just increase overall levels of alertness.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.750
Although now not only am
I going to start delaying

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.600
my caffeine intake till
two hours after I wake up

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.150
for reasons I've talked
about in previous episodes,

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.240
but I'm also going to start drinking it

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.640
later in learning and focus sessions

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.510
as a way to enhance plasticity

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:37.620
around those learning and
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.520
So interesting study, it's free online.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.210
You can access the full paper online,

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.980
we will put a link as well.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.020
I want to mention this
issue of nootropics,

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.100
so-called smart drugs.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:50.380
Which is not a topic
that I particularly enjoy

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.500
because I don't like the name.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.940
I don't like the idea of a nootropic,

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.290
because what is a smart drug?

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:56.890
Well, there's different kinds of smart,

01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.030
there's creativity,
there's task switching,

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.890
their strategy building,
their strategy implementation.

01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:05.630
And most of the nootropics
that are out there

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:07.470
just cocktails of a
bunch of different things

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:09.590
that aren't tailored to
the individual at all.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:12.380
They all seem to have some caffeine,

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.640
or some culinary trick
stimulation, et cetera.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.120
But there's an important way to frame this

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.990
in light of today's conversation.

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:19.910
Nootropics generally
fall into two categories,

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:24.890
one category are nootropics
that increase blood glucose.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:26.967
So these are compounds that people take

01:06:26.967 --> 01:06:27.970
they increased blood glucose

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:29.530
and increasing in blood glucose

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:32.100
will improve performance,

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.650
and can enhance learning
in some situations.

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:36.060
I'm not suggesting
people take these things,

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.040
but here's just a list of a few of those.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.030
Some of them are legal,

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:40.270
some of them are gray market,

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.523
some of them are illegal.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.423
piracetam, oxiracetam,

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.610
aniracetam, all the Tams, okay.

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:52.080
Elevate blood glucose
that's how they work.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.090
The neural effects that you
hear are secondary or tertiary

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:57.320
to the fact that they just
increased blood glucose.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.550
We know that because if you
block the blood glucose effect

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.700
you block the nootropic effect, okay.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.700
Others include, and definitely
don't take these please,

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.760
amphetamine, cocaine.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.430
Those will increase
learning in the short term

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.130
in particular dosages,

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.030
but because they increase blood glucose.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:18.440
And then of course, things
like painful stimuli

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.190
or stress will improve learning

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.900
by way of increasing blood glucose.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:26.450
Now stress and epinephrine
that's associated with it

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.360
not only improve performance
during the learning about,

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.500
but as I mentioned before

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.710
having epinephrine come up afterward

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:36.760
will increase the retention
of that information

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.090
in the longterm.

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:41.240
And then of course,
there's a whole category of

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.270
nootropics that don't
impact blood glucose,

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:47.570
that work by increasing the
cholinergic system activity.

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:50.260
And these are things
like choline, lecithin,

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.970
Physostigmine, it's a prescription drug,

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:55.120
phosphodiesterase.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.530
So there're ways to increase energy

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:00.040
that don't require
increase in blood glucose,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.500
and this is a vitally important.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.840
The reason we're talking
about epinephrine and cortisol

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.200
for increasing energy and
immune system function

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.240
is because they are largely
independent of blood glucose.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.430
Of course, they interact with that system,

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:17.070
but we heard so much growing
up you need to eat for energy,

01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:19.680
but the energy that
we're talking about today

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.180
is actually a much more powerful one

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.500
than the one that you derive from food,

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.080
We could call it neural energy.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.320
It's neurotransmitters
that create alertness,

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.590
and focus, and the willingness
and the ability to move.

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.170
And the willingness and
ability for immune system

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.590
to move in response to intruders.

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:39.710
So I think we all too often
think about food as energy

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.660
which is great because it is,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.930
but there are other sources
of energy that are neural

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.900
and they relate to these hormone systems,

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.050
cortisol and epinephrine.

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:51.750
And that's why we're focused on today.

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.100
So up until now we've been talking about

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.090
increasing energy and
increasing the immune system

01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:59.670
by way of cortisol and epinephrine,

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:02.540
but I'd be totally
remiss if I didn't cover

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:07.390
how cortisol and epinephrine
if chronically elevated,

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.140
or if elevated too high

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.670
can have a lot of detrimental effects.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.620
These are the things
we normally hear about.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:17.050
I'm going to describe some of those things

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:20.790
but I'm also going to talk
about ways to ameliorate them.

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:23.750
Ways that you can adjust
the cortisol levels,

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:24.750
even if you're stressed.

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.630
Ways that you can adjust
epinephrine levels

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.920
even if you're stressed

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.313
so that they have less
of a negative impact.

01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:33.600
I don't have to list off all the ways

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.560
that stress is terrible and
chronic stress is terrible

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.840
I think you know.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.610
Insomnia, your immune system
over time will get battered

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:44.680
and you won't be able to fight
infection off as well, right?

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.730
You don't want to be
stressed for too long.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.760
You can start laying down the sort of

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.833
classic pattern of
cortisol induced body fat.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:57.670
In fact, there's a whole
literature related to comfort foods

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:00.780
and why we want to consume comfort foods

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.260
under conditions of chronic stress.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.890
And it's quite interesting actually,

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:05.840
because it reveals something

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.580
about the biology of chronic stress

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.780
that's informative for how to prevent it,

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:15.100
or to down regulate chronic
stress once it's occurred.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.630
So let's talk for a
second about comfort foods

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.400
and the work that I'm going to refer to

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.270
is work that was done by a
very impressive scientist

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:24.470
by the name of Mary Dallman.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.840
Her work goes back decades.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.530
She was at University of
California San Francisco,

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.870
and she asked this question

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:33.650
that on the face of it
seems kind of obvious,

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:35.960
but for which there was no mechanism known

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.860
until Mary and her lab
personnel came along.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:40.693
And the question was,

01:10:40.693 --> 01:10:44.610
why do we seek high-fat
and or high sugar foods

01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:46.780
when we are stressed for awhile?

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.480
Why would that be?

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.450
And the reason is that the
so-called glucocorticoids

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.940
of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.180
It's caused as we've mentioned before,

01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.600
by releasing hormones from the brain,

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.250
and ACTH from the pituitary, et cetera.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:07.010
But normally high levels
of glucocorticoid shut off

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:10.550
the releasing hormones in the
brain and in the pituitary,

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.740
they shut down in a so-called
negative feedback loop.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.750
So just like if testosterone
or estrogen get too high

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:22.080
that's read out or that
is seen so to speak

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.010
by neurons in the pituitary and brain

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:27.150
and then we shut down our production of

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:31.420
estrogen and testosterone.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.050
If cortisol levels get too high,

01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.900
if there's too much cortisol

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.400
floating around in our bloodstream,

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.760
there's a negative feedback loop,

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.750
and the brain and pituitary
shutdown, CRH and ACTH

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.730
which would otherwise
stimulate more cortisol,

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:44.520
so cortisol levels go down.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.360
So it's a beautiful
negative feedback loop.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.090
Chronic stress however,

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:53.160
stress that lasts more
than four to seven days

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.720
and there's a way to think about

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.848
what chronic stress really
is in an actionable way,

01:11:57.848 --> 01:12:01.290
'causes changes in the feedback loop

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:06.290
between the adrenals and
the brain and the pituitary.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.640
Such that now the brain and the pituitary

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.360
respond to high levels of
glucocorticoids cortisol

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.790
by releasing more of them.

01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:15.280
It becomes a positive feedback loop

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.220
and that's bad

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.830
it actually gets right down
to levels of gene regulation

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:21.670
and transcription and translation.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.810
And so you really don't
want chronic stress,

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:26.430
because it's a cascade of

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:28.470
stress equals more stress
equals more stress.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.730
So this is why it's very important

01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:32.540
to learn to turn off the stress response.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.940
You don't want it elevated for too long.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.540
So there's one study that
Dallman and her colleagues did

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.360
where they stimulate chronic stress

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.093
by increasing corticosteroids, cortisol.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.940
And they found that subjects

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:48.830
would increase their
consumption of sugar and fat.

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:50.430
In fact they would even eat lard

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:52.600
It's sounds disgusting,

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.470
but they were willing to just
eat more fat and more sugar.

01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:56.760
And that led to all sorts of things

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.230
like type two diabetes

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:03.460
that led to dysfunction in
the adrenal output, et cetera.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.450
And so the real key is to learn

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:07.620
to shut off the stress response.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.910
Because the interesting thing is,

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.150
is that dominant colleagues

01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:14.040
and some studies that followed
up on their work found that

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.710
if the system was kicked
into motion for too long,

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:22.240
then there was a tremendous
shift overall towards anxiety,

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.490
because it turns out that body fat itself

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:26.760
receives neural innervation.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.500
Neurons actually talked to body fats

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.190
so now you have body fat
releasing certain hormones,

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:35.070
you've got the adrenals
releasing cortisol,

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:37.120
and all of that is
feeding back to the brain

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.210
to make you want more
sugar and fatty foods.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:43.240
So that's how the so-called
comfort foods work.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.870
And you should watch yourself

01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.460
next time you experience stress.

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.150
If it's a short-term about of stress,

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:50.880
typically it blocks hunger.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.810
If it's a longer about of stress

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:54.490
typically it triggers hunger,

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.100
in particular for these
so-called comfort foods,

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.720
sugary and fatty foods.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.760
And it's kind of interesting

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.500
how short-term stress can
actually block hunger.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.000
It does that by activating

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
or interacting with a system
called the bombesin system.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.593
Bombesin is a peptide hormone.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.740
I think it was named after
some sort of reptiles

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.140
or amphibians, excuse
me, some sort of toad.

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:24.070
I think it was initially
sequenced from the toad

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:25.900
before it was later discovered in humans.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.330
And I think the Toad's Latin
name is Bombina bombina,

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:30.440
or something of that sort.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.870
And so they decided to
call this thing bombesin,

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:37.430
but it reduces eating and
stress liberates bombesin

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:38.800
and makes you want to eat less.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.190
But chronic stress causes all these

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:45.130
positive feedback changes,
which are not positive.

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:45.963
I'm calling them positive

01:14:45.963 --> 01:14:48.520
because they amplify the
stress response over and over

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.430
not because they are good for you.

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:54.360
So short-term stress great,

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.700
long-term stress really, really bad.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.360
Other bad effects of stress
that we can talk about

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.970
and I won't list off
too many more of these,

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.070
because you know so many of
them, you hear about them.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:05.290
You really want to know how
to control them I'm guessing

01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:08.563
is that yes indeed stress
can make you go gray.

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:13.590
The rates at which people
go gray, meaning gray hair,

01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.280
some cases gray body hair as well

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:18.540
depend on some genetic factors.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.300
There are a couple of
ways that we can go gray.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.420
There's actually a STEM cell,

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.210
what they call niche in every follicle.

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:27.550
So you have STEM cells in the follicle

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:30.040
that can produce more and
more of the given hair cell.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.150
And they're actually peroxide groups.

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:33.920
You know we hear about
bleaching hair with peroxide,

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.490
at least in the 80s that was a thing,

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.840
but you can use hydrogen
peroxide to bleach things,

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.860
and you can produce your own
peroxide in the hair follicle,

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.010
that will cause the hairs to go gray.

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:46.870
In addition pigmentation of hair,

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:48.350
just like pigmentation of skin

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:51.630
is controlled by melanocytes,

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.737
our old friends, the melanocytes.

01:15:52.737 --> 01:15:54.920
And I say old friends
'cause on previous episodes

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.060
I talked about why sunlight
and getting ample sunlight

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.550
can increase levels of certain things

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.280
like melanocytes stimulating hormone

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.240
which reduce hunger.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.130
It can improve testosterone
and estrogen levels

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:08.590
and all the reasons for that.

01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:11.780
Well, it turns out that activation

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.990
of the so-called
sympathetic nervous system,

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.910
which is really just another name for

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:19.777
the system that liberates
adrenaline from the adrenals

01:16:19.777 --> 01:16:21.290
and epinephrine in the brain

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:26.830
drives depletion of
melanocytes in hair stem cells.

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.640
So indeed there's a rate of aging

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.950
that we will undergo
based on our genetics,

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:33.130
but stress will make us go gray.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.020
And the paper that you should look to

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.120
if you want to read more about this

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.260
came out very recently.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:42.100
This is Zang et al, Z
H A N G et al. Nature.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:46.330
Fabulous journal, definitely
one of the apex journals, 2020.

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:51.330
So this paper showed that
the activation of stress

01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:54.663
in various forms will deplete
these melanocytes stem cells.

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.500
You do not have to
worry about an ice bath,

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.050
or hard exercise or breathing,

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:00.500
increasing your levels of stress

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.940
to the point where it's
going to make you go gray.

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.870
We're talking again about chronic stress.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:08.560
And if you want to
offset the stress effects

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.130
on graying of hair you can do that

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:15.060
by either having a practice

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:18.020
that helps you regulate
stress on a consistent basis.

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.190
So something like non sleep
deep breath, or meditation.

01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:24.280
You can get access to massages
or vacations those are great,

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.350
but having a practice
to keep stress clamps

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.250
so that it's not chronically elevated,

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.620
that will be great as well.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.050
This is another case where sunlight

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.770
we know stimulates melanocytes,

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:39.130
not just in skin, but in hair.

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:40.940
And so getting ample sunlight,

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.300
having a practice to regulate stress

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:48.110
will offset the stressed
induced grain of hairs

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:53.110
by way of stress induced
depletion of melanocytes.

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:55.750
And if melanocytes sounds a
lot like melanin you're right.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:57.680
That's because anything
involved with pigmentation

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.750
in the brain and body
generally has "melano"

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:03.960
up in the front of the word
in some way or another.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.680
So if chronic stress is so bad

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.340
because of its effects on
epinephrine and cortisol

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.940
being elevated for too long

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.840
then the question becomes of course,

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.000
well, what's chronic stress?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.670
How do I know the
difference between chronic

01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:18.920
and acute stress?

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.470
And how do I keep chronic stress at bay?

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:23.790
Because of all these negative effects,

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:25.800
I didn't even list out
the number of other ones,

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.840
the effects on depression,

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.203
which certainly has a correlate
with elevated cortisol.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.450
Thyroid hormone.

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:38.010
Low thyroid hormone is
associated with depression.

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:43.010
Mistimed thyroid, once
again getting your light

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:48.660
and your feeding and your
exercise and your sleep

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.930
on a consistent schedule or consistent ish

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:54.250
is going to be the most
powerful thing you can do

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:55.900
in order to buffer yourself

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.820
against negative effects on mental health

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.240
and physical health for that matter.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.940
There are things that one can take

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.350
supplements, prescription
drugs, et cetera.

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:08.110
Some of you out there may have

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.620
or may know people that have Cushing's,

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.850
which is chronically elevated cortisol.

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:13.330
There are prescription drugs
that we will talk about

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.010
that can be used.

01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:17.650
But most people are dealing
with a situation where

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:20.080
life gets stressful then less stressful,

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.340
stressful then less stressful.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.340
I would say, based on the
data from McEwen and others,

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:28.840
Bob Sapolsky's Lab over many years.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.620
I would say any stress that lasts

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:34.440
more than a day or two days, or three days

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.423
is starting to become chronic stress.

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.690
There's really no strict cutoff

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:40.760
because we're not measuring
everybody's cortisol

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.593
from moment to moment.

01:19:41.593 --> 01:19:43.010
My lab has done experiments

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.080
where we measure stress
in people over time.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.430
People vary tremendously

01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.340
in their ability to have a really hard day

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.540
and then fall deeply asleep.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.530
That's going to be the ultimate reset

01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:53.580
is the ability to sleep well

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.170
more or less undisturbed each night,

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:57.000
although one or two wake
ups during the night,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.010
probably not going to be too detrimental

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:00.670
provided they're not too long,

01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:02.210
and you're not viewing light

01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:04.300
during those wake-ups or your phone.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.060
But the things that you can take,

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.700
if you feel like you're
chronically stressed

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:08.840
and you're veering toward

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.420
some of the negative
effects of stress are many.

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.560
There are some simple
things that people can do

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.680
in terms of supplementation.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.110
All supplements of course

01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:23.000
have to be checked out for
their safety margins for you,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.670
because there going to
differ from person to person.

01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:27.360
You're responsible for making
sure they're safe for you

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.720
if you decide to use them.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.520
One of the most common ones is Ashwagandha

01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:37.140
and it has a powerful
anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:40.790
You're welcome to go to
examine.com and for zero cost

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:43.190
you can see their so-called
human effect matrix.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.140
Ashwagandha has many uses,

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.890
It's been used to enhance
power output in athletes

01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:54.740
it has been shown to modestly
increase testosterone.

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:57.540
It has been shown to
modestly adjust things like

01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.120
low density lipoprotein cholesterol,

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.860
the so-called bad cholesterol in quotes.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.870
It has a profound effect on anxiety

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.480
that's been shown in nine studies.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.310
Nine peer reviewed independent studies,

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:11.500
mean funded by organizations
that have no vested interest

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.030
in the answer.

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:17.130
It has a very strong
effect on cortisol itself.

01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:17.970
How strong?

01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:20.090
The decrease in cortisol noted in humans

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:24.440
is 14.5 to 27.9% reduction

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.830
in otherwise healthy but stressed humans.

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:28.663
That's great.

01:21:28.663 --> 01:21:30.130
Six studies.

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:32.480
And it mentions there's
a significantly larger

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.820
than many other supplements.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.930
Now, some people will say

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:39.330
that taking Ashwagandha
chronically may not be good.

01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:40.590
If you've heard about that,

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:43.510
or you can point to specific studies

01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:46.240
that indicate exactly why it's not good,

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.280
please put in the comment
section or let me know.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.260
In the comment section
on YouTube would be best.

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:56.680
The studies that I'm referring
to did explore both genders.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.490
The number of subjects was
reasonably high, 64 or more.

01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:02.390
One to six months study,

01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:03.650
so these were long-term studies.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.050
That's great, you like to see that

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:07.070
not just in an acute study.

01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:10.540
So males and females
lots of different ages

01:22:12.222 --> 01:22:14.570
overweight and non overweight.

01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:16.180
They did blood draws of cortisol

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.250
which is going to end and
as well as saliva test.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:21.400
Saliva is actually the best
way to measure free cortisol.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.340
You can also measure it
from ear wax it turns out

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.570
which sounds pretty gross and kind of is.

01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:29.340
But nonetheless that's where
cortisol will accumulate

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:33.020
in earwax and in saliva,
the free cortisol.

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.630
But that's six very quality studies,

01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:41.030
independently supported
that all points to these

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:44.700
very significant, you know,
14.5 to 27.9% reductions

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.880
in otherwise healthy adults.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.050
So if you're somebody who is
dealing with chronic stress,

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.680
it's a stressful period in your life

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:53.610
and you want to stave off the
negative effects of stress.

01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:56.110
Well then ashwagandha may,

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:57.800
I want to highlight, may be right for you.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.220
It also does tend to lower total cortisol

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.270
which is interesting.

01:23:02.498 --> 01:23:06.540
It can lower depression to
at somewhat minimal degree,

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.090
and can lower as I
mentioned before things like

01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.393
low density lipoprotein.

01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:14.592
I think ashwagandha
comes through is kind of

01:23:14.592 --> 01:23:17.420
the heavy hitter in department.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.780
Now what's interesting also

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.040
is the other effects of ashwagandha

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.970
that are downstream of reducing
chronic stress and cortisol,

01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:24.803
'cause cortisol has so many effects,

01:23:24.803 --> 01:23:28.490
there're receptors for cortisol
all over the body and brain.

01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:30.520
And so I'll just list these off quickly,

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.020
I'm not going to list off each study

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.860
or talk about how many subjects in detail.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.050
Again, you can go to
examine.com if you want,

01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:37.540
and just put it in Ashwagandha.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.220
See reactive protein,

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:44.080
which is a marker of all sorts
of negative health effects.

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:47.920
Cardiovascular health,
even macular degeneration

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.760
is notably reduced.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.170
Heart palpitations notably reduced.

01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:55.420
serum T3 and T4, our old friends
from the thyroid hormones

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.373
from a previous episode are increased.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.840
Symptoms of OCD decreased,

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.416
both the obsessions and the compulsion's

01:24:03.416 --> 01:24:04.736
right obsessions are of the mind

01:24:04.736 --> 01:24:05.569
compulsions are of behavior.

01:24:06.934 --> 01:24:09.940
So there are a lot of
things that are downstream

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:11.563
of reducing cortisol.

01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:16.220
Lowered heart rate,
lowered rates of insomnia,

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:18.160
slightly improved memory.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.460
Why that would be, I don't know,

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.730
because cortisol in the short
term can increase memory,

01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:23.970
I'm guessing it's from increased sleep.

01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:27.000
Decreased pain, increased
quality of you know...

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.080
Decreased reaction times,
things of that sort.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.600
So the list goes on and on,

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.130
but all of those things stem downstream

01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:34.640
of decreased cortisol.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.240
So if one were to decide
to take ashwagandha

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.210
in order to reduce cortisol,

01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:41.310
given that you want
cortisol early in the day

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:43.440
to have energy throughout the day,

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.700
the time to take it as
probably later in the day

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.000
or in the evening.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.930
I've never heard of it preventing sleep

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:51.230
or causing insomnia of any kind.

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:52.690
That certainly wasn't listed

01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:55.570
as one of the major
effects on examine.com.

01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:57.470
I will take ashwagandha from time to time

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:58.600
if I'm chronically stressed,

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.190
or if I'm not sleeping
as well as I ought to.

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:02.490
You might think that with all my knowledge

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:03.990
about sleep and sleep protocols

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:05.350
that I would sleep perfectly every night,

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:07.400
but unfortunately I have a dog that has

01:25:08.702 --> 01:25:11.210
a canine form of of
sundowners, of dementia,

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:13.550
so he's up much of the night, these days.

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:14.650
And so there's no way

01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:17.210
I'm getting a solid night of sleep lately.

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:19.340
And so I will supplement with ashwagandha

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.040
and typically I'll take it before sleep

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.660
and maybe also with my
last meal of the day,

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.750
which is at least two
hours before I go to sleep.

01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:29.360
Again you have to decide
if it's right for you.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.990
The dosages can vary tremendously.

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.940
I would just go buy

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.700
what's on the bottle
from a reputable brand.

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.630
I would also check out examine.com,

01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:40.350
because it mentions a range of dosages

01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:41.210
that people have used.

01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:44.010
And in various studies
to different effects.

01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:45.520
Now, there is something out there

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.720
that some of you may actually
be taking or ingesting

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.820
that can increase cortisol

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:51.220
and not so incidentally

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.040
can decrease estrogen and testosterone.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.020
Because remember cortisol

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.830
is made from the cholesterol molecule

01:25:57.830 --> 01:26:00.290
so is estrogen and testosterone.

01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:02.930
So are estrogen and
testosterone, excuse me,

01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:05.600
and it's competitive.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.440
So you're either making more cortisol,

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.200
or you're making more of
the sex steroid hormones,

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.730
estrogen and testosterone.

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:14.680
Believe it or not liquorice,

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.240
which I always thought of as a candy,

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.030
but liquorice contains a
substance that I can't pronounce.

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:25.170
G L Y C Y R R H I Z I N.

01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:30.170
Glycyrrhizin, which is of
the glabra species of plant,

01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:35.670
actually because of its chemistry,

01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:39.230
this 18-beta-hydroxy-cholenoic acid,

01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:40.300
you don't need to know all that.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:43.690
Liquorice, black liquorice
contains a substance

01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:46.000
that increases cortisol,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.060
and it's increases not
huge, but it is significant.

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:54.770
This has been looked at
in females age 18 to 29,

01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:57.760
males and females age 18 to 29,

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.930
people age 30.

01:26:58.930 --> 01:26:59.920
These are separate studies

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.210
where I'm listing off the different ages,

01:27:01.210 --> 01:27:03.300
ages 30 to 64.

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.750
It turns out that you can see

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:09.750
pretty substantial
increases in serum cortisol

01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:13.170
and decreases in
testosterone and estrogen.

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:14.510
So that was complete news to me.

01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:16.150
Also increases in blood pressure

01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:17.440
that are pretty substantial.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.810
That's going to be downstream of cortisol,

01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:21.810
increasing cortisol
increase blood pressure

01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:24.380
in order to engage the stress response

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:25.920
as part of the stress response.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.680
Increased hormones of other kinds

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.860
that are associated with stress.

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.780
Who knew?

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:32.560
I didn't know maybe you knew,

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.890
previously if you did forgive me

01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:36.300
but licorice and some of the
compounds in black licorice

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.640
can actually increase stress.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.170
Probably not the thing to be ingesting

01:27:40.170 --> 01:27:42.360
during periods of chronic stress.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.860
Whether or not anyone
has had positive effects

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.610
of using it to increase
cortisol and other contexts,

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:48.540
let me know,

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.650
but very interesting that
the chemistry of licorice

01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:53.800
increases stress hormones,

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.250
and therefore you would probably want to,

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.420
almost certainly we want to avoid it

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.550
in conditions of chronic stress.

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:02.880
Also, if you're trying to
optimize testosterone and estrogen

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.270
liquorice seems like a bad idea.

01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:07.830
I suppose one instance where
you might want to use licorice

01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:08.960
would be if you're traveling

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.460
and you're trying to wake
up at a particular location,

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.500
because licorice has
these effects on cortisol

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.500
and cortisol is associated
with the waking phenomenon

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.110
and alertness and energy,

01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:22.710
you could use it in that regard.

01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:25.560
However, I would be careful to time it

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.393
so that you're not getting

01:28:26.393 --> 01:28:29.390
two cortisol increases
throughout the day, two peaks.

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:30.900
So you're going to want to make sure

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:34.330
that you're doing all the other
things correct for jet lag

01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:35.800
and adjusting to jet lag.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.750
And if you want to know
what those things are,

01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:39.240
including timing your feeding,

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.490
using temperature, using exercise,

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:43.940
using light to adjust
to jet lag more quickly,

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:47.020
please see the episode that we
did on jet lag and shift work

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.380
where I cover all those
protocols in detail.

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:52.240
The other compound that I
think deserves attention

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.330
is apigenin.

01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:57.040
A P I G E N I N, apigenin.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.300
which is what's found in chamomile.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.740
Apigenin I've talked about previously.

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.600
It has various effects one
is it is a mild anti-estrogen

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.260
that's been shown in various studies,

01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:12.810
and it does have a bit
of an anxiolytic effect

01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:14.330
of reducing anxiety.

01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:17.140
I take it before bedtime, 50 milligrams.

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.460
Again, you have to decide

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.380
or figure out if that's
safe for you or not.

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.200
I'm not suggesting you take it.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.420
The major source of action is
to calm the nervous system.

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.310
And it does that primarily

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:30.730
by adjusting things like
GABA and chloride channels

01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:33.730
but it also has a mild
effect in reducing cortisol.

01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:36.033
So Ashwagandha and Apigenin together,

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.420
I would consider the most potent

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.740
commercial compounds
that are in supplement

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:45.940
non-prescription form that one could use

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.370
if they were interested in
reducing chronic stress,

01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:50.120
especially late in the day

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.910
by way of reducing
cortisol late in the day.

01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:54.420
So you're probably getting
the impression that

01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:57.200
cortisol and epinephrine are
a bit of a double-edged sword.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.270
You want them elevated, but
not for too long or too much.

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:03.870
You don't want them up for
days and days, and days,

01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:05.980
but you do want to have a practice

01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:08.950
in order to increase
them in the short term.

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:12.610
So we should talk about protocols

01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:17.610
that can set a foundation
of cortisol and epinephrine

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.710
that is headed towards optimal.

01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:22.110
Optimization is always
going to be a series

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:24.110
of regular practices
that you do every day.

01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:25.240
So sleeping at certain times,

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.810
light at specific times,
food at specific times.

01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:29.890
Certain foods, et cetera,
and that's highly individual,

01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:31.120
but there are some universals

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.710
and we've covered a number of
those in the discussion today.

01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:39.010
Meal timing, meal schedules
has a profound effect

01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:40.960
on energy levels.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.100
And as I mentioned before

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:45.780
the energy I'm referring
to is not glucose energy.

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.630
It's not burning carbs
while running or ketones.

01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:50.390
What I'm talking about is neural energy,

01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:51.963
epinephrine and cortisol.

01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:55.940
Fasting and timing one's eating

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.870
are two sides of the same coin.

01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:00.930
So even if you're on a kind
of standard three meal a day

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:03.540
with a couple of snacks in between diet

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.760
or nutrition regimen,

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.420
you are fasting whenever you're asleep,

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.050
or you're not ingesting any calories.

01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:10.190
So unless you're hooked
up to an IV of glucose

01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:12.120
you are fasting while you're sleeping.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.100
There are several
different kinds of fasting

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.290
that can relate to
epinephrine and cortisol.

01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:20.130
I will do an entire episode
on optimizing food intake

01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:23.620
for performance in the sports context.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:26.640
That's coming up but in the meantime,

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.860
I'd like to just talk about

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:32.000
fasting as a source of epinephrine.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.010
Anytime when our blood glucose is low

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:36.270
cortisol and epinephrine
are going to go up.

01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:39.740
If we fast for too long, that is stress.

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.680
There's no way around that.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.130
Now that doesn't mean it doesn't have

01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:44.610
other beneficial effects.

01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.360
Running a marathon is stress,

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:49.840
but it can also have positive
effects if that's your thing.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.880
So stress has been demonized as a term,

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.750
but we want to think about
stress mechanistically,

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:57.310
as epinephrine and cortisol.

01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:58.820
And then if we do that

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.450
we can think about how
to regulate its timing.

01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:05.060
So anytime we haven't eaten
for four to six hours,

01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.460
levels of epinephrine and cortisol

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.520
are going to go up pretty substantially.

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.710
There's an exception to that,

01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:11.670
which is if you are used to eating

01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:14.690
on the clock every two hours or every hour

01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:15.970
being half hour late,

01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:18.310
or being even 10 minutes
late on that schedule

01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:19.210
will induce stress.

01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:20.740
Most of that psychological stress,

01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:22.340
but also the release
of things like ghrelin

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:23.280
that are going to make you hungry,

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.380
'cause they're on that eating clock.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:30.150
So one thing that many
people do to great benefit

01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:33.520
is they follow a so-called
circadian eating schedule.

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.680
They eat only when the sun is up,

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.540
they stop when the sun is down.

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.500
More or less.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.540
The another way to think about this

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:42.730
is they stop eating a
couple hours before sleep

01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:44.470
and they eat more or less upon waking

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:45.620
assuming that they're waking up

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.760
more or less around the
time of the sunrises,

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.500
maybe plus or minus two hours.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.820
Okay. So sort of typical schedule.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.740
Now, let's say you decide to do what I do,

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:56.950
which is I skip breakfast.

01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:57.810
I drink water,

01:32:57.810 --> 01:33:00.090
I delay my caffeine for
90 minutes to two hours,

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:01.500
and then I drink my caffeine.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:04.110
And then my first meal is
typically around lunchtime,

01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:05.290
11:30 or 12:00.

01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:07.080
And yes, occasionally I throw back

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.880
some almonds or walnuts or
something earlier in the day.

01:33:10.798 --> 01:33:12.298
I do do that from time to time

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.570
if I get hungry enough,

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:15.900
or if I just happen to see them.

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.340
I'm kind of a drive by eater,

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.877
if I see blueberries or nuts or something

01:33:18.877 --> 01:33:21.080
I'm just going to pick them
up and put them in my mouth.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.410
I try not do that off
other people's plates,

01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:26.360
but I just have that habit of
doing that from time to time.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.210
But typically I don't
eat until about noon.

01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:30.920
So I've got a cortisol increase

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.200
I've got my sunlight in the morning.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.000
So I'm getting a big pulse
and energy early in the day.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.450
And yes, there's a
little bit of agitation,

01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:39.390
I am hungry sometimes early
in the day sometimes no,

01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:41.670
but my ghrelin system is used to

01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:44.050
kicking in right around noon.

01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:45.470
At the point where I eat

01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:48.140
as long as I don't eat carbohydrate

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:50.650
in my case, I know that
my epinephrine levels

01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:51.800
are going to stay pretty high.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.260
So for me, it's usually meat and salad,

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:56.710
or something of that
sort, or fish and salad.

01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:59.170
although I don't
particularly like eating fish

01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:00.940
because of the taste,

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.670
but I'm assuming low carb or ketones ish

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:03.810
throughout the day.

01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:07.360
So I'm probably in a
slightly elevated state

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.520
of epinephrine and cortisol
throughout the day.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.060
Some of you are fasting even longer.

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.160
You're pushing out till
4:00 PM or 8:00 PM,

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.530
or maybe you're even
fasting around the clock.

01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:16.900
Anytime you're fasting

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:19.940
you're increasing epinephrine
and cortisol release.

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.740
You can do all the meditation in the world

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.230
to keep your mind calm,

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:26.460
but you are closer to that edge of stress.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.550
And you're closer to
that edge of peak stress.

01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:32.470
So that's something that's
just important to understand

01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:34.640
the description about
comfort foods and cortisol

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.070
was one of kind of an extreme case

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:38.280
where cortisol systems

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.150
kick over to a positive feedback loop.

01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:44.200
But we all eat to suppress
cortisol and epinephrine.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.080
When we're hungry cortisol and epinephrine

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.370
create an agitation so we go seek food.

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:50.470
When we ingest food

01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:52.020
typically if it includes carbohydrate,

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.360
there's a blunting of cortisol.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.270
There's a blunting of
epinephrine in the bloodstream.

01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:57.250
If you've ever had too
much coffee to drink

01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:59.440
and you go and have a
couple of pieces of bread,

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.810
you will feel the...

01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:02.990
You might describe it as the caffeine

01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:04.520
getting soaked up out of your system,

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.730
but what you're doing is
you're elevating blood glucose

01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:09.310
which is more or less saturating

01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:10.860
the effect of caffeine in your system.

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.570
Not completely, but it's
going to have that effect.

01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:16.480
If you're very stressed and
you sit down to eat something

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.070
it will calm you down.

01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:20.100
Yes. Because some of the blood
that goes to your stomach

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.470
but more so because of these effects

01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:23.310
in blunting cortisol and epinephrine.

01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:25.290
So the important point here is that

01:35:25.290 --> 01:35:27.230
if you want to be alert

01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:30.240
you can do that by way of not eating.

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.910
Of course, please ingest fluids.

01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:33.800
I know some people water fast out there.

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.410
I am yet to see good
science on water fasting

01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:38.100
and why that can stimulate stem cells,

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:39.970
or people love the idea of

01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:42.227
after the Nobel prize
was given for autophagy

01:35:42.227 --> 01:35:44.550
and this idea that our
cells clean up debris

01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:46.470
in senescent cells, yes, that's true.

01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:49.720
But the idea that water fasting
is going to promote that,

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.860
I find rather amusing.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.830
Please send me the data

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.980
if you know of some great
study in a decent journal,

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:56.320
but pretty much this is
something I hear about.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.710
I don't think water
fasting is a good idea,

01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:00.930
nor should you be drinking so much water

01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:01.763
that you kill yourself.

01:36:01.763 --> 01:36:04.940
You can actually drink
enough water that you die.

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:07.550
So I think ingesting
water in healthy amounts

01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:08.960
is a good thing, stay hydrated.

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.120
But if you want to be alert stay hydrated,

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.320
caffeine may or may
not be in your regimen,

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:19.320
but fasting will make sure that
your levels of energy are up

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.640
and you will be primed very well for doing

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.470
a protocol of the sort
that we talked about

01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:25.800
earlier in this episode.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.090
Of breathing, or cold
exposure, or exercise

01:36:28.090 --> 01:36:31.110
to get that increase in
the immune system function.

01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:32.940
And if you do that after learning

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.480
after trying to learn something,

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.710
it will increase learning

01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:38.520
for that particular set of information,

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.960
whether or not it's motor, or language,

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.450
or whatever it happens to be.

01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:43.500
Mathematics, programming.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.580
So fasting is a tool for many reasons,

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.750
it can increase growth hormone, et cetera.

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:52.550
But today I'm talking
about fasting as a tool

01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:55.350
to bias your system toward more

01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:56.830
epinephrine adrenaline release

01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:58.610
and toward more cortisol release

01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:01.920
but still low enough that
it's not chronic stress,

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.200
that it's not causing
negative health effects.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.350
But please know that if
life is very, very stressful

01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:11.010
if you're experiencing lots of stressors

01:37:11.010 --> 01:37:13.520
and you're chronically fasting,

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.280
you are positioning yourself
toward a greater likelihood

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.330
of being chronically stressed

01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:20.850
in the ways that are negative.

01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:22.560
Negative effects on the
reproductive access,

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.890
lower testosterone and estrogen.

01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:27.440
Negative effects on you're
hair will turn gray,

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.640
there's reasons for that,

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.160
Your sleep will suffer.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.890
Your immune system will suffer.

01:37:31.890 --> 01:37:34.770
So I think while it's nuanced

01:37:35.970 --> 01:37:39.860
our discussion today about
epinephrine and cortisol

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:44.860
increasing energy and immunity
are designed to help you

01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:48.290
understand when you should
be doing certain things.

01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:49.710
When you should throttle back.

01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:52.210
When you might want to kick
up your adrenaline a bit,

01:37:52.210 --> 01:37:54.350
if you're suffering from low energy

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.630
because you're just kind of feeling down

01:37:56.630 --> 01:37:58.940
and a little bit under activated,

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.880
well then the practices of ice baths

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.570
and intense breathing, et cetera,

01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:05.950
could be very beneficial so might fasting.

01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:10.060
But if you're feeling
exhausted and burnt out

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.010
sort of drained and stressed

01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:16.180
well then fasting or doing
a lot of cold exposure,

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.900
or doing a lot of intense exercise

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:20.980
is driving you further and
further into chronic stress.

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:24.900
So because I don't have a
saliva test or a blood test,

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.570
or God forbid an earwax test
to measure your cortisol

01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:30.910
as we're engaging in
this discussion together,

01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:33.460
you have to gauge for yourself

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.780
whether or not you are in
a state of under activated

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:38.983
and need more epinephrine and cortisol,

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:43.640
or whether or not you are over activated,

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.170
in terms of cortisol and epinephrine.

01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:48.360
And you need ways to
buffer those ashwagandha,

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.130
Maybe it should be a warm
mellow bath not an ice bath.

01:38:51.130 --> 01:38:53.950
So one has to learn how
to regulate these hormones

01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:55.450
with behavior, with nutrition,

01:38:55.450 --> 01:38:56.980
perhaps with supplementation.

01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:58.780
And then of course there
are prescription drugs,

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:01.140
and I always leave these to the end

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.870
because A, I'm not a medical doctor

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.110
I'm not prescribing anything.

01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:04.943
I'm a professor,

01:39:04.943 --> 01:39:05.980
I'm professing a number of things

01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:09.520
that you can decide for
yourselves what to do with or not.

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.860
But of course there are prescription drugs

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:15.170
that can increase cortisol
or decrease cortisol

01:39:15.170 --> 01:39:16.740
in cases like Cushing's syndrome,

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:19.030
which if you have that diagnosed,

01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:20.700
you should talk to a physician.

01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.610
You should talk ideally
to a endocrinologist

01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:25.290
but to a physician of some sort,

01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:26.793
board certified physician.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.820
There are drugs that can
be used to treat injury

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:33.090
like corticosteroids,

01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:35.250
that you can inject to
reduce inflammation injury,

01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:36.700
but they are cortisol.

01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:38.640
So they're going to bias
you towards more stress

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.490
in other domains.

01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:41.970
Remember cortisol can cross
the blood brain barrier

01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:44.460
so you're going to be more
prone to psychological stress.

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.810
I also want to mention again,

01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:48.080
that I think there's great
benefit to having a practice

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.370
that perhaps you do every other day,

01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:53.040
but if you can't maybe every
third day or every other day

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.310
of deliberately increasing
your adrenaline in your body

01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:58.550
while learning to stay calm in the mind,

01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:01.330
so that you learn to separate
the brain body experience.

01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:04.120
You know, we hear so much
about how beneficial it is

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.710
to unify the brain and body,

01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:08.370
that we're all out of touch
with our brain and bodies.

01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:11.700
I particularly dislike claims like that

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.610
or statements like that

01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:16.200
because there's great
power as we learned today

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:20.340
in having your body activated
by some sort of stimulus,

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.820
cold water or even psychological stress,

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.030
but learning to stay calm in your mind.

01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:27.800
I should just remind you that most of the

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.840
negative effects on your life
and on the lives of others

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.030
are due to people perhaps you I hope not

01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:36.900
being unable to regulate their mind

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.040
when they have high levels
of adrenaline in their body,

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.650
either 'cause they read
something on a text

01:40:40.650 --> 01:40:42.210
or a comment section,

01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:44.060
of course that never happens to me,

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.290
but it may happen to you.

01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:47.810
Of course it happens to me,

01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:49.960
but the idea is to stay calm in your mind

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.480
so that then you can
regulate your action, right?

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.150
And so I think that
there are these practices

01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:57.400
that one can develop over time

01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.347
that are really straight
forward and zero costs, right?

01:41:01.347 --> 01:41:03.350
You could find any number of ways

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:06.120
to increase your adrenaline and stay calm.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.050
And we tend to focus
on things like exercise

01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:10.780
as the way that we get our energy up.

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:13.090
But today, again I'm talking about

01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:15.200
deliberately increasing adrenaline

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.420
while staying calm mentally,

01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:18.960
because that has great utility

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.930
when the adrenaline hits
through unwanted events,

01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:25.990
through things that we didn't seek out.

01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:30.030
So the ability to regulate
adrenaline cortisol

01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:32.620
is about inducing them deliberately

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:35.280
when you want to push back on infection,

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.890
potential infection from bacteria viruses.

01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:40.830
It's about pulling back on
adrenaline and cortisol,

01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:42.450
maybe through the use of supplementation

01:41:42.450 --> 01:41:45.740
but certainly through proper
use of light and sleep

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:48.200
and mental tools that
we talked about as well

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.870
when they are chronically elevated.

01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:52.760
It's about training your system,

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.930
not just to be unified at brain and body,

01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:57.110
which sounds great until you're stressed

01:41:57.110 --> 01:41:58.280
and then that's terrible.

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.390
It's really about having
a deliberate dissociation

01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:03.443
between the adrenaline
response from the adrenals

01:42:03.443 --> 01:42:06.640
and the adrenaline response
from the brainstem.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.350
So once again, we've
covered a ton of material.

01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:12.710
I hope right now, you're thinking,

01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:15.300
okay, am I in state of chronic stress?

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.420
Am I under activated?

01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:19.100
Or could I afford to increase my levels

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.770
of adrenaline cortisol to
improve my relationship

01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:26.130
to my immune system and
to energy, neural energy.

01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:29.430
If you like the information
that you heard today

01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:30.810
and you want to remember it,

01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:33.570
well, then at the end of this episode,

01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:34.640
perhaps you go do something

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.910
to increase your level of adrenaline.

01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:38.230
And now you know what
some of those things are,

01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:40.060
because it will help you
retain the information,

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.460
or you could apply that to anything else

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:44.040
that you learn or experience of course.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.890
And I hope that you'll think about

01:42:46.890 --> 01:42:50.680
some of the ways in which
cortisol and adrenaline

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.070
are not good or bad, that
stresses in good or bad

01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:54.940
but short-term stress is healthy.

01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.370
Alertness and energy is healthy

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:58.810
even if it puts you at
the edge of agitation,

01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:00.010
that's an opportunity

01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:02.350
to learn how to control
these hormones better.

01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:04.510
And I hope that if you're
in a state of chronic stress

01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:05.570
that you'll do things

01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:08.560
to start tamping down some of that stress

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.727
and that you realize
that your nervous system

01:43:10.727 --> 01:43:13.090
and your hormone system are linked,

01:43:13.090 --> 01:43:14.940
but they're linked in
ways that you can control,

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.150
that we don't have to be
slaves to our hormones.

01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:19.430
And certainly not the
hormones that cause us stress,

01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:20.820
we can learn to control those

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.440
both to the benefit of our body

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.310
and benefit of mind.

01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:25.930

01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:08.510
We do read all the comments

01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:10.810
and I know many of you
are anxiously awaiting

01:44:10.810 --> 01:44:13.050
particular topics and episodes,

01:44:13.050 --> 01:44:14.830
and we will eventually get to them all,

01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:16.390
I'm not going anywhere.

01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:19.170
And we do want to be
thorough about every topic.

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:22.910
Today we rounded out the
discussion about hormones.

01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:25.090
We aren't going to continue
with that topic any longer,

01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:27.210
we are moving to a new topic segment

01:44:27.210 --> 01:44:29.370
for an entire month or so.

01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:31.570
If you know of other people
that you think could benefit

01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:33.450
from the information on this podcast,

01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:35.700
or that you think would
enjoy listening to it

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.270
please forward it along to them,

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:39.030
we'd really appreciate that.

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:40.480
Another great way to support us

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.080

beginning of the podcast.

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.400
We also have a Patreon,

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.380
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

at any level that you like.

01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.360
I should mention that I will
be answering some questions

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.780
that come up frequently in
the comment section on YouTube

01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.320
in Instagram Lives every once in a while.

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.460
I am on Twitter @hubermanlab.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.900
I'm on Instagram, also @hubermanlab.

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.720
And on Instagram from
time to time coming up

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.460
I'm going to be discussing

01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:15.000
answers to your common questions
in these Instagram Lives

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.010
and I will make sure
that they're recorded.

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:19.480
So you can check those out,
please follow our Instagram.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.280
If you are not already doing that

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:23.600
and check out our Twitter
if you're on Twitter.

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.540
I covered a lot of different
types of tools today,

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:27.210
behavioral tools, et cetera.

01:45:27.210 --> 01:45:28.900
But I did mention supplements.

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:31.010
For those of you that are
interested in supplements

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:34.470
we've partnered with Thorne, T H O R N E,

01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:35.790
because we believe them

01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:38.120
to have the highest levels
of stringency and quality

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.380
in terms of supplement production,

01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:41.930
in terms of amounts of supplements

01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:44.940
in their different
formulations, et cetera.

01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:47.690
If you want to check out
the supplements that I take

01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:50.190

Thank you for joining me

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.990
for what I hope was an
informative discussion

01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:15.930
and an actionable discussion

01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:18.470
about how to increase
energy and the immune system

01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:22.630
by way of cortisol and
adrenaline epinephrine.

01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:25.960
I really appreciate your
willingness to learn new topics

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.280
as well as to embrace
and think about new tools

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.150
and whether or not they're right for you.

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:33.491
And as always, thank you for
your interested in science.

01:46:33.491 --> 01:46:36.074
