00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.290
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.640
where we discuss science

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.953
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.080
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.530
Today, we continue in our
discussion about sensation

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.370
or how we sense things.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.920
On previous episodes, we
talked about sensing light

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.620
and sound waves for things
like vision and hearing.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.290
Today, we are going to
talk about our sense

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.453
of self or what's called interoception.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.360
Interoception is our sensing

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.870
of our internal landscape,
things like our heartbeat,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.580
our breathing, and our gut,
how full our gut might happen

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.200
to be, or how empty our
gut might happen to be.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.630
But also our inner landscape
with respect to chemistry,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.630
how acidic, or how good or
bad we feel on the inside.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.240
This discussion about sense

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.010
of self and interoception
has many important,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.340
actionable items that relate

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.960
to bodily health and brain health,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.253
and believe it or not,

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:07.530
our ability to perform well
or perform poorly in life.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.810
Indeed, it has profound influence
on our rates of healing.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.980
So today we are going to talk
about all the aspects of our

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.030
inner landscape and how our
brain and body communicate.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.360
And there will be many
actionable protocols

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.240
as we go along that discussion.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.770
Before we begin our discussion
about sense of self,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.290
I want to highlight some very
recently published research

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.800
findings that I believe
are immediately actionable

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000
and that everybody should be aware of.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.860
These are data that were
published by my colleague,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.470
Justin Sonnenberg's laboratory

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.490
at Stanford University School of Medicine,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.920
and the data were published
in the Journal Cell,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.660
which is a very high
stringency cell press journal.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.700
So phenomenal data.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.360
What this study showed was
that individuals given a high

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.550
fiber diet actually
experienced less diversity

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.870
of what's called the gut microbiome.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.670
The number of positive or
health promoting bacteria

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.090
in the gut was actually
reduced by a high fiber diet,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.910
whereas individuals that ate just a couple

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.400
of servings of fermented food each day,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.400
experience important
and beneficial increases

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.300
in anti-inflammatory markers.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.830
And that could be traced
back to improvements

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.470
in the gut microbiome
diversity, the diversity

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.550
of bugs, literally little bacteria

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.405
that live in the gut,
which might sound bad,

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:28.290
but they are actually
very health promoting.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.210
I'm going to get into all
the details of this study

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.540
later in the episode,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.690
but I just wanted to
emphasize these findings

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.680
because they are immediately actionable.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.880
I think for most people
ingesting one or two servings

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.010
of fermented food each day is
reasonable and does not bring

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.500
with it tremendous costs or
tremendous inconvenience.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.340
And I think many people are
ingesting high fiber diets

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.940
thinking that that's the best way

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.000
to improve their gut microbiome.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.300
So while these data may prove
to be controversial among the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.680
folks out there in the
nutrition community,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.790
that really high fiber diet,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.380
I want to just emphasize that
these data were looked at

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.780
in a very unbiased way.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.020
They were done with large scale screens

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.160
of all sorts of inflammatory markers.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.290
There was no specific hypothesis going in.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.330
It was purely exploratory,
but the data are very clear.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.270
It doesn't mean you shouldn't
eat fiber doesn't mean

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.450
that fiber is bad,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.550
but it really shows that
eating fermented foods,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.210
just one or two servings a day,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.010
and maybe even ramping up to
three or four servings per day

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.010
can be very beneficial for
many aspects of health.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.240
Before we go any further.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.610
I'd like to emphasize that this
podcast is separate from my

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.410
teaching and research roles
at Stanford, it is however,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.530
part of my desire and effort
to bring zero cost to consumer

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.290
information about science
and science related tools

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.810
to the general public.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.900
In keeping with that theme,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.790
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.760
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.040
Rocha makes sunglasses

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.460
and eyeglasses that are of the
absolutely highest quality.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.700
The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.020
from Stanford and everything
about their sunglasses

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.780
and eyeglasses is developed
with performance in mind.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.180
I've spent my career
working on the visual system

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.620
and its various functionings

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.575
within the brain and within the eye,

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.010
Roka sunglasses and
eyeglasses are so phenomenal

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.870
because they allow the visual system

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.150
to do what it does best,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.090
which is to adjust to changes
in what we call luminance

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.830
or brightness, with many
sunglasses out there

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.220
and with many eyeglasses as well,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.480
if the brightness in the room changes

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.700
or you get cloud cover, or you walk

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.110
into a shadow, you have to
take the glasses on or off,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.600
you can't see as well.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.170
But the folks at Roka really understand

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.325
how the visual system works.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:35.020
And so they've designed their sunglasses

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.790
and eyeglasses such that you
never experienced that shift.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.990
You can walk into a shadow.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.340
The amount of sunlight can change.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.190
You can go into a dark room, et cetera,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.670
provided there's enough
light to see you're going

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.220
to see everything crystal clear.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.760
In addition you see
everything crystal clear

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.040
because the lens quality is terrific

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.330
and the sunglasses and
eyeglasses are very lightweight.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.680
So you don't even notice
that they're on your face.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.500
Also the sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.950
are designed for performance.

00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:59.460
You can use them while
running or while cycling.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.350
Even if you sweat, they
won't slip off your face.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.880
And as I mentioned before,
they're very lightweight.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.820
So everything about
these glasses is terrific

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.890
and they have a terrific aesthetic.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.800
They have a lot of different
styles to select from.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
And unlike a lot of performance
eyeglasses out there,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.180
they won't make you look like a cyborg.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.940
You could wear them to
dinner or to somebody's home.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.180
And they look really nice.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.650

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.640
Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.080
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.710
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.050
to help you better meet your health goals.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.740
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done for

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.030
the simple reason that many of
the factors that impact your

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.720
immediate and long-term
health can only be assessed,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.470
can only be measured from
a quality blood test.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.080
And now with the advent
of quality DNA tests,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.310
you can get further insight

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.430
into the status of your
immediate and long term health.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.590
One of the problems with a
lot of blood and DNA tests

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.130
that are out there, however,
is you get the numbers back,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.250
you get the levels of
metabolic factors, hormones,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.650
et cetera, but you don't
get any information about

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.450
what to do with those numbers
or how to actually shift them

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.150
in the direction that you want to.

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.956
With Inside Tracker, they have

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:16.470
this very easy to use dashboard

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.400
and that dashboard makes
it very clear, not just

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.600
what your levels of
hormones, et cetera are,

00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:24.470
but what actions to take in
terms of nutrition or exercise

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.840
or other lifestyle factors
to bring those numbers

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.260
into the appropriate ranges for you.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.700

Inside Trackers plans.

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:48.980
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.510
Headspace is a meditation app

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.570
that's backed by 25 peer
reviewed published studies

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.870
and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.390
I started meditating
when I was in my teens,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.040
but for many years I found it
hard to maintain a meditation

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.920
practice, I don't think
I'm alone with that.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.860
I think many people start meditating.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.500
They'll do it for a few
weeks or a few months,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.820
or maybe even a year.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.810
And then they'll give up
the meditation practice.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.400
And we know from so many
peer reviewed studies that

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.040
meditation has a number of
very positive effects on our

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.830
brain health, our ability to
focus and our bodily health.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.840
So it's a great thing, we
probably should all be doing it,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.730
but most of us, including myself,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.690
have found it hard to stick
to a meditation practice.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.370
Then I started using the Headspace
app and what I found is I

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.970
could be very consistent
with my meditation practice

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.140
because they have
meditations that are short,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.973
meditation that are medium length,

00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:38.580
and meditations that are a bit longer,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.540
all of which benefit me.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.120
The meditations that they have
also are of different styles.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.410
You can try different forms of meditation.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.860
I particularly like having
a guide for my meditation.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.120
It just helps me stay focused,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.820
helps me stay on track and
I'm able to derive all those

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.060
regular benefits of meditation
and keep the practice up

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.750
on a regular basis, if
you want to try Headspace,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.760
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.435
And if you do that,

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.130
you'll get a one month totally free trial.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.830
And with that, you'll get all

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.400
of Headspace's meditations, the
full library of meditations.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.460
You just go to
headspace.com/special offer,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.280
and you get all of their
meditations for one free month

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.360
and you get to try it, if you
don't like it, you can stop.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.710
But I think you will enjoy it.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.980
I certainly enjoy meditation

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.910
and we know that it's very
beneficial for all of us.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.930
If you're somebody who cares

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.000
about your immediate and long-term health,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.400
and if you're somebody who's
interested in performance

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.160
of any kind in work in
relationships, et cetera,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.450
today's topic I believe

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.513
is among the more important ones for you.

00:08:35.357 --> 00:08:36.940
Of all the topics I could cover,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.420
this thing that we call sense of self,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.150
which is also called
interoception has perhaps the most

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.160
foundational level of
importance for all that.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.450
We feel all that we do and all
that we are capable of doing.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.120
In fact I will go so far as to say

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.170
that interoception or our ability

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.510
to sense our inner real estate
is right there next to sleep.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.780
And perhaps one other feature
of our health and bodily

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.060
function that primary early
determine how good we feel

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.890
in the now in the short
term, and in the longterm,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.720
and sets the stage for everything
we are capable of doing.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.450
And if we don't take care of this thing

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.460
that we call interoception,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.580
just like if we don't take care of sleep,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.973
we cannot perform well and
we will not remain healthy.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.010
Interoception and sense of
self are essentially the same

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.730
thing, I will use those
terms interchangeably,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.730
at least for sake of today's discussion.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.920
And I promise that if you
can learn a little bit

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.980
about the mechanisms of self sensing,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.170
of understanding what's going
on in your internal milieu,

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.580
as we say your internal environment,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.060
you will position yourself
to do some very simple things

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.320
that can lead to outsize positive effects

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.450
on everything from sleep
to body composition,

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.820
to mental focus, to mood, your
ability to regulate stress,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.350
and indeed even your ability
to heal and recovery from

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.400
injuries of different kinds,
brain injury and bodily injury.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.440
So sense of self is absolutely crucial.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.060
It's sometimes called our sixth sense,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.450
right alongside the other five
senses like hearing vision,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.000
touch, taste, smell, et cetera,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.340
but sense of self is different.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.570
Sense of self is really about what's going

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.440
on internally within the
confines of our skin.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.920
And it involves two key features
that if you can understand

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.700
those features, and you
understand what modulates

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.950
or changes, our ability
to sense those features,

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.620
there are a lot of things that you can do

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.920
in terms of how you structure
your nutritional practices,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.950
how you relate to your exercise practices,

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.330
perhaps even certain things
that you take in terms

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.820
of supplementation that can
basically make you feel better,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.040
more alert, and more
capable for everything.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.730
I don't think that's a
hyperbolic statement, I, in fact,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.520
I know it's not a hyperbolic
statement because we have a

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.500
system in our body that connects our brain

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.530
to all of our bodily organs

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.190
and connects all of those
bodily organs to our brain.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.730
And that communication
between brain and body

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.540
in both directions creates a situation

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.470
where either we are
positioned to do things well,

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.850
or we are positioned to do things poorly.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.010
So I really want to dive in and dissect,

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.290
what is this system of
brain, body communication?

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.123
What does it look like?

00:11:23.123 --> 00:11:25.060
What are the actual
neurons and connections?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.700
And as I do that,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.900
I promise that I'm going
to place protocols,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.260
tools that you can apply
in order to make sure

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.760
that those neurons and
connections are working optimally.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.750
So let's begin by talking about
what system communicates the

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.383
brain to the body and the
body back to the brain.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.250
The system that's most often
associated with this is our

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.540
10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.730
The word vagus relates
to the word vagabond,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.530
which to wander, and indeed
the vagus nerve is a vast,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.810
enormous wandering set of
nerves, so it's not one nerve.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.820
It's not like one fiber, one axon.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.170
As we say in the nervous
system, we have these wires,

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.560
we call axons that let
neurons communicate.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.270
It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.550
of wires that go everywhere,
so where do they go?

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.493
Well they leave the
brain, and the brain stem,

00:12:14.493 --> 00:12:17.430
the brain stem is kind of
the back of your brain.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.550
If you touch the back of your neck,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.070
it's about three inches deep
to where you're touching.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.090
The neurons that are there

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.210
send information into the body

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.430
to control your bodily organs,
how fast your heart is,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.700
beating how fast you're breathing,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.070
how fast your digestion is occurring.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.930
Even things like whether
or not you are going

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.470
to secrete so-called killer cells,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.960
your immune cells from your
spleen to go ward off bacteria.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.100
Now the neurons there don't
know what to do unless they

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.170
receive information about
what's going on within the body

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.200
and within the body, your heart,
your lungs, your diaphragm,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.610
your gut, so everything
from your intestines

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.993
to your stomach, et cetera,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.710
and your spleen or sending
information also up to the brain.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.530
So as I mentioned before,
it's a two-way street.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.280
So the vagus nerve is
a very important nerve,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.300
but just by saying vagus nerve,
it sounds like a singular.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.640
It sounds like one thing,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.870
but actually what we're
talking about is a series

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.780
of super highways, it's like Google maps,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.080
it's got stuff going everywhere

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.943
with alternate routes,
communicating back and forth.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.340
There are two fundamental
features of what's going

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.310
on in your body that
need to be communicated

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.450
to your brain, these neurons
in your brain stem in order

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.640
for your brain and your body
to work together correctly.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.390
And the two types of information
are mechanical information.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.550
So things like pressure,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.350
things like lack of pressure
and chemical information,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.320
whether or not your gut is acidic

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.630
or whether or not it's not acidic,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.613
whether or not you have some
sort of pathogen, you know,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.360
something that you ate or that
got into your body somehow

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.080
and is making you sick or whether or not

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.110
you don't have a pathogen in your body.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.020
So you've got mechanical
sensing and chemical sensing.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.290
So when you think about your sense

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.070
of self and your ability
to understand what's going

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.030
on in your body, if you feel
good, or if you feel bad,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.010
your sense of self is
dependent on these mechanical

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.890
phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.950
And for every organ in your body,

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.060
whether or not that's
your heart or your lungs

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.020
or your spleen, both the
mechanical information about

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.020
that organ for instance, is
if your gut is full or empty,

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.860
whether or not your heart is
beating fast or beating slowly,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.680
that's mechanical, and
chemical information,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.360
whether or not your gut feels
nice, and whether, you know,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.560
when I say nice, I mean,

00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:40.810
whether or not it has a balance
of acidity and alkalinity,

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.210
that feels right to you or
whether or not your gut feels

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.730
off, it doesn't feel quite right.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.770
That's chemical information.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.340
If you are not getting enough oxygen

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.540
and levels of carbon dioxide
and other gas go up too high.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.710
So your lungs can register

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.030
that and that chemical
information is sent to your brain.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.180
And then your brain does
certain things actually really

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.630
encourages you to do certain things

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.403
in order to adjust that chemistry.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.210
So the first principle that
everyone should understand about

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.890
their sense of self is that
they are sensing mechanical

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.940
and chemical information about every organ

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.540
in their body, except for
one, and that's the brain.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.240
Your brain actually doesn't
have pain receptors.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.040
It doesn't even have touch receptors.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.840
The brain is a command center.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.180
It helps drive and govern changes
in the organs of the body.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.970
But your brain doesn't
move, at least not much.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.530
It can move a little bit
fluid moves within it.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.500
But as long as you're healthy,
it's not moving that much.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.570
Your brain has no sensation

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.970
of its own, in fact, when they
do brain surgery on people,

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.070
they will the size or put
some anesthesia on the scalp.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.070
They'll cut away the skin there

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.853
so that people don't feel anything.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.260
They'll use some anesthesia
they'll peel back the skin

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.156
and then they'll use a,

00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:54.660
let's call it what it is, it's a bone saw.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.000
And they basically saw open
a little window in the skull.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.040
I've actually done this
before and seen this before.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.860
I've done this many times before,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.980
and once you're inside the brain,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.980
you can put electrodes in
there and you can put various

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.860
things in there, of course,
all for therapeutic purposes.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.980
And you do that without any
anesthesia to the actual brain

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.180
tissue, because it has no
receptors to sense anything.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.950
It doesn't have pain receptors.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.300
It doesn't have pressure receptors.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.080
None of that, when you have a headache

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.540
in your head, feels like
it's too much pressure,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.770
well that's because of here's
that lie outside the brain.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.840
So your organs are different.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.090
They need to tell your
brain what's going on.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.940
And there are ways that you
can control the mechanical

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.510
and the chemical state of your organs

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.650
in ways that are very
powerful, and this is crucial

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.990
to do, because if you can
properly regulate the mechanical

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.130
and chemical environment

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.983
of your body, your brain functions better.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.980
This is absolutely clear from data

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.360
that if your gut is healthy,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.760
if you get the alkalinity
right, the acidity, right,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.290
and if your spleen is healthy

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.840
and happy, and if your
lungs are working properly,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.210
not just breathing and
pumping in and out air,

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.450
but you're breathing at the
right cadence for a particular

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.750
activity, then your brain
will function better.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.000
So let's talk about how you
can adjust the mechanical

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.300
and chemical environment of your organs

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.000
in order to make your brain better

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.390
and how your brain can make the mechanical

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.540
and chemical environment within
your organs function better.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.200
For instance we're going to talk about

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.350
how you can change the
chemistry of your gut in order

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.320
for your brain to be able to
focus better, think better,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.270
remember better and sleep better.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.420
And we're going to talk
about how you can change

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.930
the chemistry of other
organs in your body,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.060
such that your immune
system will function better

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.283
than it would otherwise.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.100
And you can actually heal
faster from small cuts and

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.940
bruises, but also injuries of
any kind, even major injuries.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.900
So as I mentioned before,
we've got these organs,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.160
the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.810
and I'll explain what that
is, the gut and the spleen.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.540
And the spleen is this immune organ.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.240
Let's take one example of these
and explain how mechanical

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.430
and chemical information
from this particular set

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.040
of organs communicates to the brain

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.460
and how that changes how our brain works.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.100
And the organ I'd like to focus on first

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.550
are the lungs and the diaphragm.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.900
So we're all familiar with
our lungs, these two big bags

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.510
of air, but they're actually
not two big bags of air.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.860
They actually have little
tiny sacs within them,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.640
actually millions of little sacs

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.710
called the alveoli of the lungs.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.680
The alveoli of the lungs

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.693
are like little tiny balloons
throughout our lungs,

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.560
and the more of those balloons, we have,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.340
the more air that we can actually contain.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.700
So we are not too big bags
of air in there, our lungs,

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.700
we actually have millions and
millions of little tiny bags

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.033
of air within those lungs.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.450
Those little bags of air can
fill up or they can deflate,

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.700
right, just like your
lungs overall can fill up

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.210
or they can deflate.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.660
The diaphragm is a muscle, it's
kind of shaped like a dome.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.870
So it's kind of a, you know,

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.870
think about a basketball or a soccer ball

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.320
that has most of the air pushed out of it.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.110
And so it's kind of crescent
shape or dome shaped,

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.257
and it sits below our lungs
and the way the diaphragm

00:19:07.257 --> 00:19:09.460
and the lungs work together
is very interesting.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.400
The diaphragm is actually
skeletal muscles.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.580
So it's just like a bicep or a quadricep.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.160
And the fact that it is
skeletal muscle is important

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.640
because it has a unique property,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.120
which is that you can
control it voluntarily.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.560
You can decide to take control

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.830
of your diaphragm by just
consciously deciding you want

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.380
to breathe in a particular way,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.070
just like you can take conscious
control over your legs.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.680
They will work just fine,
if you're not thinking

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.630
about them, as you walk as
provide, you already know

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.135
how to walk, but at any moment,

00:19:36.135 --> 00:19:36.968
you can decide to change the rate

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:40.090
of your walking, your
so-called cadence of walking.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.780
So the diaphragm as a
skeletal muscle also has

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.860
that property, the diaphragm moves up

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.770
and down, depending on how you breathe,

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.740
or rather, I should say
how the diaphragm moves up

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.960
and down determines how you breathe.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.220
How you breathe is also dependent
on little muscles that are

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.160
between your ribs, the
intercostals and other muscles,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.540
if you're a martial arts fan
that Bruce Lee was famous

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.400
for having these very pronounced
intercostals from doing all

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.850
sorts of, you know, bridging
exercise, et cetera.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.320
But those are the muscles.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.410
And we all have them, even if some

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.780
of us, most of us don't have,
intercostals like Bruce Lee.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.590
So when you breathe a
couple things happen,

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.040
but let's talk about the
mechanical things first.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.310
And then let's talk about how
those mechanical steps relate

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.570
back to the brain and what
that does for the brain.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.130
And I can promise you that

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.310
if you develop an awareness
of these mechanical changes,

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.100
you do not have to go through
extensive breathwork practice

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.050
or do extensive breathwork.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.980
You will immediately believe
it or not develop a sense

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.510
of your breathing self of
your lungs and diaphragm.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.800
It takes no practice, but once you do it,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.300
you will forever be changed
in terms of your awareness of

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.810
your breathing and your ability
to leverage your breathing.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.000
Kind of like the steering
wheel on a car in order

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.670
to shift your brain in the
direction that you want to go.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.480
So it's a very powerful system.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.340
And the way it works is the following.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.887
And this will also
incorporate the heart, so,

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:06.270
and by the heart, I don't mean
it in the emotional sense.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.500
Although we don't rule out emotions here

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.760
at the Huberman Lab
podcast, we like emotions,

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.710
but I'm talking about the heart

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.410
as an organ, as a beating
organ, that circulates blood.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.410
So when we inhale, these little
sacs in our lungs fill up

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.480
and our lungs expand.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.370
And when we do that, we take
up space in our thoracic cavity

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.880
and our diaphragm moves down, okay.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.730
When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.470
the lungs get smaller, okay?

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.130
So inhales, diaphragm moves down.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.963
Exhales, diaphragm moves up.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.470
This actually controls our heart rate,

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.040
but it does it by changing
the way that our brain works.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.770
And it works in the following way.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.110
So when we inhale, our lungs
fill our diaphragm moves down.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.140
Our heart actually has a little more space

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.010
because the diaphragm's moved down.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.720
So the heart gets a little
bit bigger, physically bigger,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.700
not in the emotional sense,
but physically bigger.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.810
And as a consequence,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:10.130
whatever blood is in the
heart flows at a slower rate

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.550
because it's a larger volume,
so bigger volume heart,

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.360
same amount of blood inside
the heart means slower flow.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.340
Okay, sort of like expanding a pipe.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.590
The brain registers that
because there are a set

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.570
of neurons in the heart
called the sinoatrial node.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.723
It sends that information to the brain.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.380
That information is registered
by the brain and the brain

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.720
sends a message back to the
heart to speed the heart up.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.290
So every time you inhale because
of these mechanical changes

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.410
in the diaphragm and lungs,

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.400
and because of the mechanical
changes in the heart,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.470
your brain sends a signal to
the heart to speed the heart

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:51.470
up, so if you do long inhales
or you inhale more vigorously,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.520
you actually are speeding your heart up.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.930
Now, of course you have to exhale as well.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.423
But for instance, if I were
to inhale very long like

00:22:59.423 --> 00:23:00.870
[inhales heavily]

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.810
the entire time my heart
rate is increasing.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.571
And then if I did a quick exhale,

00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:05.450
[exhales quickly]

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.015
something else will happen,
but if I kept doing that,

00:23:08.015 --> 00:23:10.470
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly]

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.120
my heart rate would increase.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.170
It's not going to increase
linearly and forever,

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.050
but it will increase with each inhale.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.855
Or I can simply make my
inhales more vigorous.

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:20.070
[inhales quickly]

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.560
And my heart rate will speed up.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.380
This is an autonomic and
automatic relationship

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.170
between the diaphragm, the
lungs, the brain, and the heart.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.000
Now, if inhale speed the heart
up, what happens on exhales?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.110
When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.200
It's a little counterintuitive,

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.050
but you can kind of think about it

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.240
as like pushing the plunge
on a syringe, right?

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.550
When you exhale,

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.890
this thing moves up and
as the diaphragm moves up,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.320
the heart has less space.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.410
Meaning it gets a little bit smaller,

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.570
which means that whatever
volume of blood is inside the

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.180
heart moves faster, through
that smaller volume,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.640
that information is sent to
the brain via these collection

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.460
of neurons called the sinoatrial
node for you aficionados.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.730
The brain then sends information
via the vagus nerve back

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.030
to the heart, to slow the heart down.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.010
So while inhales speed up the heart,

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.370
that's the net effect
exhales, slow the heart down.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.010
And the reason they slow the heart down is

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.130
because of a register in the
change in mechanical pressure

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.810
between the diaphragm,
the lungs and the heart.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.100
So this is to me, the simplest

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.930
and most straightforward example

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.360
of how the brain is changing
the way our organs work,

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.990
our heart in this case,

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.900
according to changes in
mechanical interoception.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.740
Now, we're not always aware
of this, some of us are aware

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.961
of it, some of us aren't.

00:24:43.961 --> 00:24:45.300
If you do it right now,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.410
you will be aware of
it, so you can try this.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.410
You can basically, this is an experiment

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.640
or an example in interoception,
in sensing one's self.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.180
So if you inhale, doesn't
matter how long you inhale.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.097
I'll do it for a couple seconds

00:24:58.097 --> 00:24:59.532
[inhales quickly]

00:24:59.532 --> 00:25:01.048
and then exhale twice as long.

00:25:01.048 --> 00:25:02.490
[exhales slowly]

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.090
Nose or mouth, doesn't
matter, the entire time

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.090
that you're exhaling, you're
slowing your heart down.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.800
So just as a car has an
accelerator and a brake,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.750
or you can slow a car by
coming off the accelerator.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.583
When you exhale,

00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:16.540
you're effectively coming
off the accelerator,

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.410
or if you want to think
about it differently,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.610
you're hitting the brake,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.720
you're slowing down your heart rate.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.389
Now, normally your heart
rate stays in more or less

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:26.250
the same range for a given activity

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.500
because you're inhaling and exhaling.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.490
But this is just a simple way of showing

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.240
that mechanical changes in
your viscera can change the way

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.290
that your brain works

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.920
and then your brain changes the
way that those viscera work.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.440
And it's a very concrete agreement,

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.380
it's like a contract between the organs

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.400
of your body and the brain.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.320
In fact, you can think about
this contract in more detail,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.490
and you can leverage this
in a very powerful way

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.423
to set the conditions of your mind.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.300
If you want to be more
calm, emphasize exhales,

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.440
and the simplest way to do this.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.430
I've talked about this many times before,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.680
but if you haven't heard me say it,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.440
this will become immediately clear is

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.520
to emphasize exhales through

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.223
what's called a physiological sigh.

00:26:08.346 --> 00:26:09.610
Two inhales, could be through
the nose of the mouth,

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.797
but ideally through the nose,
so [inhales quickly twice]

00:26:13.797 --> 00:26:15.640
so followed by a long
exhale. [exhales slowly]

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.493
Those double inhales are
kind of important because

00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:20.000
what they do is they maximally
fill all those little sacs

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.580
in your lungs, and then
when you breathe out,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.040
you're exhaling as much of
the so-called carbon dioxide

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.190
in your system as possible.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.170
We'll talk about carbon oxide in a second.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.840
So the fastest way to calm
down is to emphasize exhales.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.163
When you make exhales longer,

00:26:35.163 --> 00:26:38.230
you're slowing your heart
rate, you're calming down.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.900
You don't need any sophisticated training.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.830
You don't have to do
this for minutes on end.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.750
You don't have to do anything.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.665
You don't even have to call it breathwork.

00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:46.670
It's just respiration, and in
fact, you do this every night.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.530
When you go to sleep and carbon
dioxide builds up too much

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.363
in your bloodstream,

00:26:50.363 --> 00:26:52.220
or if you hold your breath or something,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.460
or you watch an animal or a
small child that sleeping,

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.990
they will occasionally do these
double inhale long exhales

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.480
it's way of slowing the heart down

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.603
and eliminating carbon oxide.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.550
The opposite is also true.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.230
If you inhale deeply or vigorously

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.190
and then exhale less
long or less vigorously,

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.740
you will increase your level
of alertness through these

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.940
purely mechanical aspects
of your interoception.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.107
So for instance, if I were
to take a big deep inhale

00:27:23.107 --> 00:27:25.754
[inhales deeply] and then a short exhale,

00:27:25.754 --> 00:27:27.445
[exhales quickly] and then
another one, a big inhale,

00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:28.740
[inhales deeply] short
exhale, [exhales quickly]

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.107
It only takes two or three of those

00:27:31.107 --> 00:27:32.580
before you start to feel more alert.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.400
And that's because your
heart rate is increasing.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.642
And actually if you keep doing that

00:27:36.642 --> 00:27:39.112
for 25 or 30 breaths of
inhale deep short exhale,

00:27:39.112 --> 00:27:42.010
you will start to secrete
a lot of adrenaline.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.560
This hormone that comes from your kidneys

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.660
and from your brainstem
make you feel really alert.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.580
You will actually feel as if
you've had a cup of espresso.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.380
So you will immediately wake up.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.390
And there's an intermediate form

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.410
of breathing, which is
sometimes called box breathing,

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.550
but it's really equal
inhale and exhale duration.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.190
And these, it basically goes like this.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.340
You're you're going to inhale,
so do this for maybe two,

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.458
three seconds inhale, [inhales]

00:28:06.458 --> 00:28:08.978
then hold, okay, two, three seconds.

00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:10.578
Then exhale, two, three seconds.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.080
Then hold two, three seconds.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.730
Most often people forget to hold.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.070
So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.720
for equal or more or less equal durations,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.270
could be one second, could be two seconds,

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.370
could be three seconds.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.360
Most people find that when you get

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.565
out past five seconds,
they start to struggle

00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:28.883
to maintain the so-called box breathing.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.550
And most people can't
consciously box breathe

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.110
for too terribly long without
having to think about it.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.000
But the point here is that
through purely mechanical means

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.840
changing the way that you
breathe, emphasizing inhales

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.280
or exhales, or keeping them the same

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.190
will change the way that your brain works,

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.840
how alert you are and how
well you function in anything.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.190
And again, this doesn't mean
that breathwork has no value.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.460
It's just simply to say
that long extended protocols

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.150
of breathwork are simply,

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.090
they are truly simply just
an exploration of this

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.580
fundamental relationship
between the mechanics

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.080
of your internal organs and your brain

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.140
and how your brain controls
those internal organs.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.750
Now you might ask, well,
how is this pressure known?

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.530
How does the body actually know
how full the lungs are, now?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.430
This is an answer that's more
for the aficionados out there,

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.580
but I've had a few requests,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.110
or I should say thousands of
requests for more in-depth

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.290
science, so if you're not
interested more in depth science,

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.550
just this will allow you to
tune out now for maybe just 10

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.080
seconds, and if you are
interested, pay careful attention,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.846
there is a set of receptors

00:29:32.846 --> 00:29:35.300
which are called piezo receptors,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.800
P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors,
piezo means pressure.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.890
And these were discovered
a few years ago by a couple

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.960
of different laboratories,
but one of the main ones,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.767
one of the main laboratories

00:29:46.767 --> 00:29:47.970
that discovered these piezo receptors

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.570
is the laboratory of Ardem Patapoutian.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.580
I love saying his name,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.570
even though I'm probably pronouncing it,

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.320
he's a friend and a former
colleague when my lab was down

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.810
in San Diego, he's at
the Scripps Institute,

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.280
he's a Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator,

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.100
which basically means
that he's a total stud

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.650
of science and has made
many important discoveries.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.480
The piezo receptors line many tissues,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.290
and inform the brain about
pressure in those tissues.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.600
But the lungs have a particular category

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.740
of piezo receptors called
piezo two receptors.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.440
And as you fill your lungs
and these little sacs

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.860
of air, the alveoli fill,
the piezo two receptors

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.740
because of the way they
react to that filling

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.640
send information by way
of a bunch of neurons,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.990
a bunch of wires up to the
brain and tell you how full your

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.330
lungs are, so that's the
kind of mechanistic detail.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.590
If you want to learn more about that,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.610
you can look up our
Ardem's lab at the Scripps

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.770
and the beautiful work that
they and other laboratories

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.420
are doing on piezos,
piezos are pretty cool.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.250
I think I also just like saying piezo,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.320
so that's why I brought that up as well.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.630
So mechanical sensing of the
lungs, heart and diaphragm.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.320
And now let's talk about chemical sensing

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.600
because there's carbon
dioxide and there's oxygen.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.380
And this is really simple.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.270
You have oxygen and carbon
dioxide and you need them both.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.230
I sometimes hear people
talk about carbon dioxide

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.040
is this bad thing and
oxygen, it has a good thing.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.475
You need them both,

00:31:12.475 --> 00:31:13.930
and you need them in
the appropriate balance.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.430
You have a collection of neurons
in your brain that register

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.230
when carbon dioxide levels
get to a certain point

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.070
in your bloodstream.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.890
When that point, that
threshold is reached,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.040
these neurons fire,

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.440
and they cause you to
breathe sometimes called

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.330
the gasp reflex, it just
makes you want to inhale.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.860
And as a consequence,
you bring in more oxygen.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.600
Okay, so we don't really
breathe to get oxygen.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.600
That's a by-product of inhaling
to eliminate carbon dioxide.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.150
You don't want carbon dioxide
levels to go too high.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.320
In fact, if you want to freak
somebody out and we do these

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.430
in experiments, and I don't
recommend you do this,

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.940
you just increase the levels
of carbon dioxide that they

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.850
inhale, and the brain will go
into an almost immediate panic

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.170
response because the health
of all our tissues depends on

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.840
keeping a nice balance between
carbon dioxide and oxygen.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.380
You don't want carbon dioxide
levels to go too high.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.410
So the impulse to breathe,
if you're under water,

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.150
or if you hold your breath is triggered

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.320
by these neurons and the
triggering of those neurons comes

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.910
from elevated carbon
dioxide in the bloodstream.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.440
And for those of you that don't quite know

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.020
how to conceptualize the relationship

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.040
between bloodstream and breath,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.290
I do think it's important.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.970
And maybe you remember this
from high school biology,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.030
but if you don't,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.300
I'll make it clear for
you now, it's very easy.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.300
You inhale air and that air
and the oxygen molecules

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.100
in that air actually move

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.030
from your lungs into the bloodstream

00:32:41.373 --> 00:32:43.381
because these little alveoli of the lungs,

00:32:43.381 --> 00:32:44.990
those little sacs of air are in there,

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.640
they basically have a lot
of little micro vessels

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.500
and capillaries, little tiny,
basically blood vessels,

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.140
essentially, although
they're mostly capillaries,

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.815
micro capillaries are
the little tiny ones,

00:32:56.815 --> 00:32:58.050
that line them, so there's actually

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.350
an interface and opportunity for air

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.300
and molecules within the
air to pass into the blood

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.540
and then they move in your
bloodstream, and when you exhale,

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.710
the opposite is true.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.640
So you can move things from the air,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.740
into your bloodstream or from
your bloodstream into the air

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.650
by way of the lungs, and
there's a lot more detail to it.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.960
And I'm sure those of you
that are experts out there.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.540
If you want to put some
stuff in the comments,

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.020
maybe a little bit of a kind
of intermediate tutorial,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.720
you might even entitle
it, intermediate tutorial.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.960
If you know a lot about
this, just I'll check it,

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.210
but make sure you get the details, right.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.200
Make sure you know the process.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.910
And I find that for
people that are interested

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.880
in understanding how
breathing really works,

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.630
it's really nice to think
about the relationship

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.418
between the heart and the vascular system,

00:33:41.418 --> 00:33:44.420
the blood and the air system,
the respiration system,

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.170
and breathing, because those
two things are very, we say,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.340
they're interdigitated, they're
interwoven with one another.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.290
So how does this work, well,
carbon dioxide is too high,

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.080
you breathe in, you inspire, you,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.470
inhale you off as a consequence,

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.030
when you exhale, you
offload carbon dioxide.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.320
There's a really cool way
that you can explore this

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.380
chemistry of your breathing
and your bloodstream

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.381
and the way that your brain works

00:34:08.381 --> 00:34:10.715
in ways that can really
benefit your health.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.300
And it works the following way.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.010
You want to essentially sit or lie down.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.283
It doesn't really matter.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.980
You definitely don't want
to be anywhere near water,

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.690
not a bathtub, not a hot
tub, not a, you know,

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.270
not a cold dunk or something.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.730
In fact, don't even be in a puddle.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.000
And what you want to do

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.905
in this case is you're
going to breathe in deep.

00:34:30.905 --> 00:34:32.750
So that's going to increase
your heart rate and then exhale

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.110
passively by just letting
air fall out of your mouth.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.753
So it will look something like this.

00:34:36.753 --> 00:34:38.090
[inhales vigorously, exhales passively]

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.720
So it's you breathe in vigorously

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.830
and then you let the air
just fall out of your mouth.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.110
When you do that,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.730
what you're essentially
doing is you're bringing

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.310
in a lot of oxygen
through that deep breath.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.610
And you're exhaling a little
bit of that carbon dioxide.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.370
But if you were to repeat
it 25 times, maybe 30 times,

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.860
it doesn't matter if it's 25
or 30, somewhere in there,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.730
you would essentially start
bringing in a lot of oxygen

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.330
and blowing off or exhaling
a lot of carbon dioxide.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.900
So you're actually going
to change the chemistry

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.090
of your internal landscape,
and you can then sense it.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.880
You can interocept what that is like.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.040
And there are some really
interesting reasons

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.240
for wanting to do that, so
I'm not going to do all 25

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.680
or 30 now, maybe do five or 10,

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.960
so you can get a sense
of what it looks like,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.280
so that it's clear.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.988
I'm going to essentially
demonstrate now, so it's inhale,

00:35:27.988 --> 00:35:28.990
[inhales vigorously]

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.634
exhale through the mouth,[exhales]
I am inhaling the nose,

00:35:32.634 --> 00:35:37.634
[inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times]

00:35:40.083 --> 00:35:43.660
So it's essentially, excuse
me, a two second or so inhale

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.070
and then a one second or so
exhale, and as I was doing that,

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.278
I can kind of feel my face get
flush and my body is heating

00:35:48.278 --> 00:35:50.860
up and my brain is heating
up, what's happening there?

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.170
Well that pattern of breathing

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.130
is increasing levels of adrenaline

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.063
in my brain and body, and
I'm getting more alert.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.743
Then after 25 or 30 of those,
you exhale all your air.

00:36:03.743 --> 00:36:05.050
[exhales deeply]

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.477
You dump all your air.

00:36:06.477 --> 00:36:08.970
You can do that, your nose or your mouth.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.200
And then you hold your
breath with your lungs empty

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.760
for about 15 to 30 seconds.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.120
Now, for those of you that want

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.930
to explore this, and please be
careful as you explore this,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.679
don't do anything stupid,

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:22.290
like do this while you're
driving or something like that.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.230
You can exhale all your air

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.330
and what you'll find then
is you can hold your breath

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.840
for a very long time.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.700
And the reason you can do that
is because you've blown off

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.740
all the carbon dioxide or
most of the carbon dioxide

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.573
in your bloodstream.

00:36:36.573 --> 00:36:39.880
So you shifted the chemistry of your blood

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.380
by breathing in a particular way.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.350
And by doing that,

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.910
you are no longer triggering these neurons

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.620
that cause the gasp reflex
or the reflex to breathe.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.210
Now, of course you have
to breathe sooner or later

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.270
but what you'll find is if
normally your ability to hold

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.410
your breath is a minute or
so before you really feel

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.300
that gasp reflex kick in,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.330
you might find that you can
go 90 seconds or two minutes.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.250
And with some practice,

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.820
people find that they can
start holding their breath

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.170
for three or four minutes or longer.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.900
This is actually how free
divers do what they do.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.250
I do not want anyone free diving.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.610
If you're going to learn free diving,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.650
please learn it from an expert.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.230
Many people die trying to teach
themselves out of free dive

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.760
or trying to teach their
friends at a free dive

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.320
when they don't know what they're doing.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.240
This is not what this
is about, don't again,

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.720
don't do this anywhere near water,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.060
but it is a very interesting
exploration of how you can

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.520
shift the chemistry of your
bloodstream by modulating your

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.120
air by modulating the mechanics
of your diaphragm and lungs

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.917
and thereby shift the way
your mind works, your brain.

00:37:36.917 --> 00:37:39.480
And in fact, what you'll
notice is that even though

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.669
during that 25 or 30 breaths,

00:37:41.669 --> 00:37:43.430
[inhales and exhales quickly]

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.240
you'll feel very alert,
when you exhale all your air

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.560
and you're in the breath hold,
you will feel very alert,

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.683
but very calm.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.040
Now this is interesting

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.970
because it's a state that we all sort

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.640
of want to achieve alert, but calm,

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.250
but have a hard time achieving.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.010
And so for those of you that
have a hard time obtaining

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.810
focus for sake of work or
focus for sake of anything I

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.220
should say, and when you
are able to achieve focus,

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.170
it's through the use of
things like stimulants,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.030
or you feel like you have
to have a cold shower

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.200
or ice bath, or you have to
have four espresso in order

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.640
to be alert, but then you're
too alert, you're jittery.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.950
You can't focus.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.990
This pattern of breathing
can lend itself very well

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.390
to entering states of alert,
but calm for the fall,

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.180
the 10 or even 20 minutes
that follow that breathing.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.880
And then you could repeat it if you want.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.300
So it's a very useful practice to explore.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.670
Some of you may be familiar

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.985
with this practice and
so-called Wim Hof breathing.

00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:41.750
Wim Hof is a practitioner of
what's called Tumo breathing.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.800
Tumo breathing has been
around for centuries.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.000
And for those of you that are familiar

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.120
with breathwork and yoga practices,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.510
I acknowledged that nothing
I just described is new based

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.164
on science, however,

00:38:54.164 --> 00:38:56.930
the science informs why
those practices work.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.890
And just as a little mini editorial,

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.210
I just want to emphasize as well.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:05.790
That one thing that this podcast
is really about is trying

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.400
to remove fancy nomenclature, whether

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.120
or not it's yogic nomenclature
or scientific nomenclature

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.684
so that people can access protocols.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.930
Because the moment we start
naming things after people

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.250
or calling them Tumo et cetera,
I have no problem with that,

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.450
but it doesn't inform how
the practices are done,

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.570
nor does it inform the
underlying mechanisms.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.860
So here I'm trying to
teach you the mechanisms.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.730
And as a final point to that,

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.750
the most powerful form
of breathing is the one

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:32.678
that takes into account

00:39:32.678 --> 00:39:35.270
the fundamental mechanisms
that in increase heart rate,

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:39.480
that exhales decrease heart
rate, and that carbon dioxide

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.330
and oxygen relate to the
bloodstream and the brain

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.470
in particular ways, once you
understand those components,

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.170
then you can create your own
so-called breathwork practices.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.930
You can breathe in the
ways that best serve you,

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.230
as opposed to thinking that
one protocol is the best

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.080
or holy protocol for everything,
because it's simply not.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.940
As a final final point,

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.560
I want to say that as you
shift the way that you breathe,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.940
whether or not you're showing
off more carbon dioxide

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.240
or bringing in more oxygen,

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.950
you are fundamentally
changing the chemistry

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.250
of your internal milieu have your body,

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:17.210
and that has been shown
to have important effects

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.620
on the way that your immune
system functions and the way

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.700
that you deal with
inflammation and all sorts

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.750
of different sort of things
that can enter your body

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.260
and cause problems or
conditions of stress, et cetera.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.190
So I will explore that further
as the episode goes on,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.920
but I want to move on to just
touch on one other aspect

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.160
of reading, that's purely mechanical,

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.410
which I think is very interesting

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.980
and important, which relates
to a particular reflex

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.250
that you're going to be very
familiar with in a second.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.730
And that can serve you very
well in times of extreme stress.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:50.100
The reflex I'm referring to

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.790
is something called the
Hering Breuer Reflex.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.070
I'm not going to go into details

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.960
about how the Hering Breuer reflex works,

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.610
but it has to do with particular classes

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:02.410
of neurons and cells that
are called a Baroreceptors.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.240
Those are basically pressure
receptors, they sense pressure.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.390
And basically what the
Hering Breuer reflex is

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.340
about is that when your lung is inflated,

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.040
your desire to breathe is reduced.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.365
So you can try that
right now, you can inhale

00:41:17.365 --> 00:41:20.177
[inhales] huge big thing of air.

00:41:22.215 --> 00:41:23.457
And hold, okay?

00:41:23.457 --> 00:41:26.440
Your desire to breathe
will kick in later than

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:31.430
were are you to exhale all
your air and hold your breath.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.220
When you exhale all your
air and your breath,

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.470
unless you've done the sort
of protocol I described a few

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.040
minutes ago of doing a bunch
of inhales and exhales first

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.070
in a very deliberate
way, you will feel empty.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.750
Those Baroreceptors are
going to be firing like crazy

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.900
saying, there's no pressure in here,

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.140
there's no pressure here,
I got nothing in here.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.480
You need to breathe,
you need to breathe in,

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.980
the gasp reflex will kick in sooner.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.730
You can apply that in all
sorts of situations related

00:41:55.730 --> 00:42:00.170
to exercise, related to
modulating stress, et cetera.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.260
So the Hering Breuer reflex
is a very powerful one.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.980
This is why you take a big deep breath

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.858
before you go under
water. [inhales heavily]

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:08.200
All right, you're not going

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.040
to exhale all your air and go under water.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.530
If you were to exhale all
your air and go under water,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.790
you would absolutely feel
the need to come up sooner

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.570
for a breath of air than
had you a full tank,

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.610
so to speak a full of lungs full of air.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.560
And this is also the way
that people teach themselves

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.710
to feel comfortable under water.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.700
So when you learn how to swim,

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.290
you learn how to swim both by having air

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.930
in your lungs while you're
underwater and no air

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.960
in your lungs while you're underwater.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.770
In any event the Hering
Breuer reflex is yet another

00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:40.470
dimension to the way that
mechanical pressure influences

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.460
your brain's decision-making,
about what to do

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.220
with your body, in this case,
whether or not to breathe.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.640
So now I want to shift away from breathing

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.210
and diaphragm and lungs and
move toward another organ

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:55.290
within our viscera, which is our gut.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.370
So this includes our stomach

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:59.580
and our intestines, our
esophagus and so forth.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.020
It's been said before,
both by me and by others

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.130
that we are, but a series of
tubes, and indeed that's true.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.870
Believe it or not, every
system in your body is a tube.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.060
Your brain is actually a tube
that connects your spinal

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.650
cord, which has also a tube.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.110
You started off as a tube,
you were like a churro.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.240
You know, those churros

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.450
I don't know if you're
not familiar with churros,

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.680
they're like donuts that
are shaped like a tube.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.080
That's essentially what you
look like early in development,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.790
not long after conception
and the front end

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.080
of that churro grew and grew and grew,

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.560
but you always maintained
a hollow through that tube.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.960
That's why you have what are
called ventricles, gaps or a

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.980
space in your brain and spinal
cord that run the length

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.010
of your brain and spinal cord

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.900
and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid,

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.900
and other things move through that space.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.380
We're going to return
to the ventricles later,

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.320
they are very important.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.580
They're just space filled
with fluid, but they do a lot.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.260
Similarly your digestive system

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.150
starts with the tube at your mouth

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.640
and of course goes down
through your throat.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.770
And then you've got all
the elements of the stomach

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.340
and the intestines, and then
it comes out the other end.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.370
So you are, but a series
of different tubes,

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.640
your vascular system, a
series of other tubes.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.123
So you're tubes.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.037
The way your digestive system works

00:44:14.037 --> 00:44:16.620
is to communicate to your brain

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.470
about the status of the
mechanical pressures

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.020
along this tube, so within your stomach

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.570
and your intestines, et cetera,

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.680
and the chemical status of
that tube at various portions

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.400
within that tube to inform your brain

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.253
about how your brain
should control that tube.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.093
So let's start with the
mechanical sensing of your gut.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.160
If you drink a lot of fluid,
or if you eat a lot of food,

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.080
your gut will fill up, your
stomach will fill up with food.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.290
Now it gets digested there.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.860
It gets digested elsewhere
along your digestive track too,

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.430
of course but it starts
getting digested there

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.095
because along this tube,

00:44:57.095 --> 00:44:59.720
you have a series of what
are called sphincters,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.970
which basically are
like little draw pulls.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.210
Have you ever had a laundry bag,

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.400
which has a drawstring on it?

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.140
You pull it and then it cinches shut,

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.340
and then you can open it
again, that's what those are.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.350
Those are sphincter
openings and you have them

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:14.770
in your throat, you have them
along your digestive tract,

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.920
all the way to the end.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.100
Food will enter your gut.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.320
And if there's a lot of that
food, pressure receptors,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.770
some of which are these
piezo receptors will

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.930
communicate to the areas of
your brain that are involved

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.930
in feeding, and we'll
say, don't eat anymore.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.660
You don't need to consume anymore, now,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.940
some people bypass that these,

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.530
I guess they have these like
hotdog eating competitions.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.250
I'm always struck by how some
of those people are like,

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.680
seem to be rail thin,

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.060
but they actually train for
those competitions by ingesting

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.870
large volumes of water, actually
a very dangerous practice.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.290
You can actually kill yourself
by drinking too much water,

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:55.330
and you can kill yourself by
ingesting too much of anything,

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.070
really to expand your
gut, not a good practice,

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.100
not a big fan of those competitions.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.640
But even if you're one of those
people or you're the world

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.930
heavyweight champion of them,

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.400
they are informative
toward what I'm talking

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.873
about now, which is that
as you expand the gut,

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.760
a signal is sent by neurons,

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.170
literally nerve cells that
are in the gut to the brain,

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.510
stem up to the areas of
the brain that are involved

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.560
in feeding, I did a
whole episode on feeding.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.000
You can find on "Feeding,
Metabolism And Hunger."

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.780
You're welcome to listen to
that episode, if you like,

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.880
and we'll shut down the
neurons that drive the desire

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.880
to put more stuff in your mouth.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.580
That thing that people say sometimes

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.410
on well in this country frequently
after Thanksgiving meal,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.420
I can't put another bite in my mouth.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.500
Literally they shut down
some of the basic movements

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.570
of the musculature to
take another fork bite.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.135
I know it sounds crazy,

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.690
but they can actually control your brain.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.820
So your gut is so full that
it's controlling your brains,

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.370
such that this action of spooning food

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.310
towards your mouth is actually inhibited.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.663
It's made more difficult
or less likely to occur.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:46:59.660
It's incredible.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.140
The converse is also true, when
these piezo receptors signal

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.220
to the brain, that the
gut is empty independent

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.440
of your need, your actual need for food.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.490
There's a signal that sent to
your brain that says gut is

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:14.520
empty and neurons get stimulated
in areas like the arcuate

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.410
nucleus and these areas
of the hypothalamus

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:21.100
and et cetera, that drive the
desire to make this action,

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.430
to open the mouth and to put
stuff in it in particular food.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.330
So when you find yourself
at the refrigerator

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.610
or you find yourself almost, you know,

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.780
manically trying to get
food of different cons,

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.220
you're not even thinking
about what you're eating,

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.440
because you're so hungry, in
part that's because the lack

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.470
of food in your gut has sent
that information to your brain

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.660
and is driving particular
fixed action patterns

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.210
that are associated with eating, in fact,

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.430
one of the first things
children learn how to do is open

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.460
their mouth when something
is presented to it.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.090
And then they learn how
to move a spoon or a fork.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.405
They're not very good at
it, at first, they get all

00:47:56.405 --> 00:47:57.540
over the place, but
eventually they get good at,

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.670
or at least most people get good at

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.570
if you watch how people eat, you know,

00:48:01.658 --> 00:48:02.643
it's kind of very variable out there.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.010
In any event, this is a
purely mechanical phenomenon.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.640
And this purely mechanical
phenomenon is driving our brain

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.910
to drive certain behavior.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.920
You can get better at registering sense

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.470
of fullness or lack of fullness
in a very particular way.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:23.430
Some people have a very
keen sense of how full

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:26.780
or empty their stomach is,
so if you've eaten anything,

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.400
even if it's a small volume
of food in the last hour

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.240
to three hours,

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.920
it's actually a worthwhile
practice to take a few moments,

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.460
maybe 10, 20 seconds,

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.650
and actually just try and
concentrate on sensing the neurons

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.730
in your gut and how full
you are, like for instance,

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.100
I ate a few hours ago and
then I had a little snack

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.330
about 30 minutes ago or so.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:51.290
And my gut feels neither
terribly full nor terribly empty.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:56.030
It's kind of, I would put it
kind of like 30, 40% okay.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:59.088
So by just taking conscious awareness

00:48:59.088 --> 00:49:01.530
of how full or empty our gut is

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:05.370
at various times between
meals, after a meal,

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:09.600
before a meal, you can very
quickly develop a sense

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.840
of how full or empty you are.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.800
Now, what's the consequence of that?

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.870
The consequence of that is
actually rather interesting.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.230
It's been shown that the consequence of

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.460
that is actually that you can
better override the signals

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.200
of these piezo receptors and
gut fullness or emptiness.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.170
So for those of you that
find that you eat kind

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.190
of compulsively or non-consciously,

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.180
or subconsciously, I should say,

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.540
probably have to be conscious
enough to be awake to eat,

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.457
but subconsciously you
just find yourself eating

00:49:34.457 --> 00:49:36.200
and here I'm describing myself, I'm like,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.060
I'm a drive by blueberry eater.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.040
If there's a bowl of blueberries,
every time I walk past it,

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.380
I sort of have to grab a handful of them

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.160
and pop them in my mouth,
but if you develop this sense

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.900
of how much mecho-pressure,
it's not really word,

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:53.020
but how much mechano-sensation
is in your gut, very quickly,

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.010
you can learn to override that.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.409
You might ask, why would I
want to be able to override

00:49:57.409 --> 00:50:00.360
whether or not my stomach is
empty or my stomach is full?

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.080
Well, there are many
reasons to want to do that.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.660
Many people right now are interested

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.180
in so-called intermittent fasting.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.100
They're doing fast of
anywhere from 12 to 16 hours,

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.150
every 24 hour cycle, that's
actually what my practice is.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:13.760
I do that on a regular
basis, sometimes the,

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.335
I eat breakfast,

00:50:15.335 --> 00:50:16.890
but normally I pushed breakfast
out to about 11 or noon,

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.100
or sometimes a little later,

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.800
some people are doing longer fast,

00:50:20.905 --> 00:50:21.738
and there are really wonderful data

00:50:21.738 --> 00:50:24.760
publishing excellent
journals from my colleagues

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.960
Satchin Panda at the Salk
Institute Of Biological Studies.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.090
And of course from other
laboratories showing that

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.490
intermittent fasting can and
will have some positive health

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.560
effects on things like liver health

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.240
and brain health and
other aspects of health.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.830
Whether or not it's the
best form of dieting

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.350
for the sake of losing weight,
that's very controversial,

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:48.080
but it's clear that having
a period of fasting every 24

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.610
hours or perhaps even longer
from time to time can be

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.750
beneficial because it stimulates
what's called autophagy,

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.280
the clearing away,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.100
or the body's ability to
eat certain dead cells,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.440
so called senescent cells,
and for many people,

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.450
they struggle with fasting
because they feel they have a

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:09.550
very keen sense of their
stomach being empty.

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.560
And they feel as if they have to eat.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.010
And in a kind of counter-intuitive way,

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:15.710
there's some data that
indicate that being able

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.010
to sense whether or not
your gut is full or empty,

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:20.910
and just the knowledge that
that's communicating information

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.780
to your brain about whether to not

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.663
to eat or not just that awareness,

00:51:26.555 --> 00:51:28.380
that understanding allows
them to override the signal.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.213
They think, oh, you know,

00:51:29.213 --> 00:51:31.490
I'm not actually in need
of nutrients right now.

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.490
It's just that my stomach is empty.

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.770
And these piezo receptors,

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:38.250
and some other ones that I'll
tell you about in a moment

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.270
are signaling to my brain that it's empty.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:42.760
I don't actually need food, it's just,

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.480
it's just that my brain is reacting

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.510
to the fact that my gut is deflated,

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.380
so to speak or a smaller,
doesn't have food in it.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.010
So there are other ways that
our guts communicate with our

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.650
brain, it's not just our
stomach talking to our brain.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.413
It's also our intestines
talk to our brain.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.660
The Liberles Lab the guy's
name is Steven Liberles,

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.030
he runs a lab at Harvard Medical School,

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.300
it's a terrific lab, does excellent work

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.760
on gut, brain communication

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.740
and other aspects of
viscera brain communication.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.130
They discovered a category

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:16.433
of neurons called the GLP1R neurons,

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.840
these are neurons that are basically

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.700
in your neck, I mean, they're
part of the nervous system,

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.460
but they're, you can, they
can be found near your neck.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.280
And those neurons send little wires down

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.180
into the intestines and
deep into the stomach,

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:35.130
but mostly into the intestines
and they sense stretch

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.700
of your intestines.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.810
So this is pretty wild.

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:40.390
These neurons sense how
stretched out your intestines are

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.800
and how fast things are moving
through your intestines,

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.780
slow or fast, or if there's nothing there.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.210
And then those neurons
send another branch,

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:48.660
they have a branch in one direction,

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.370
senses what's going on in your intestines.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.280
And they have another branch that goes up

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.310
from your neck in your brain
to either trigger the desire

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:57.720
to eat more or just stop eating.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.100
So these are really cool neurons

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.470
and they're basically stretch receptors.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.030
They look a lot like the piezo receptors

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.090
that we talked about before,
so these GLP1R neurons

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.170
are sensing stretch, so
purely mechanical sensing.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.900
And in addition to that,

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.530
the Liberles Lab discovered neurons

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.080
that detect nutrients themselves.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.680
Now, the main reason why we need

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:21.620
to eat is to bring
nutrients into our body.

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.030
And there is another set of neurons,

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:25.740
those are called GPR65 neurons,

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.050
if you want to know, but you
don't have to remember that,

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.950
do the same thing in terms
of their connections.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.160
They send connections down into
the intestines and into the

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.030
gut, into the stomach, but
mostly into the intestines.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.260
And then send that information back up

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.880
to the brain as to whether or
not there are certain kinds

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.140
of nutrients in our digestive track.

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.380
Now, these neurons are the
ones to pay attention to

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.370
if we're talking about chemical signaling

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.230
and then in the next couple of minutes,

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:52.810
I'm going to tell you about
how you can understand hunger

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.890
and had a modulate your
hunger for the right foods,

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.250
in fact, for healthy foods.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:02.420
The way this is done is
by leveraging the activity

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.660
of these GPR65 neurons,

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.556
these neurons that sense nutrients, okay.

00:54:07.556 --> 00:54:09.080
They're telling your brain

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.560
what's in your gut and intestines,

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.870
and you have another set of
neurons that were discovered

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.330
by another guy he's
out at Duke University,

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.320
his name is Diego, excuse me,

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.620
Diego Borges he's a wonderful scientist.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.050
He has a degree in nutrition,
but also in neuroscience.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:28.763
And he found that there are
neurons that line the gut,

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.870
and those neurons in
collaboration with these GPR65

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.830
neurons are sensing
for three things, okay?

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:38.550
So we say nutrients, which
nutrients are they looking for?

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:40.420
What are these neurons
paying attention to?

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.410
While these neurons are
activated by the presence

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:47.790
of fatty acids in particular,
omega-3 fatty acids,

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:51.300
sorts of things that come
from fatty fish, oil, krill,

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.570
certain kinds of animal protein, animal,

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.410
and plant substances.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:59.700
You can look up what has a
lot of omega-3s and those

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.170
omega-3s make these neurons
fire electrically like crazy

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.840
up to the brain and make you
want to eat more of those

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.070
things, but it turns out in
pretty appropriate levels.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:12.540
These neurons also respond to amino acids.

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.530
So when you eat a food,
it's broken down in the gut,

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:16.520
actually the way it's
broken down in the gut

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.670
is kind of interesting.

00:55:18.922 --> 00:55:20.950
Your gut basically cinches
off a sphincter up top,

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.010
cinches off a sphincter below
it when there's food there.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.460
And then you have a
series of smooth muscles

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.060
that tumble the food and literally
physically break it down.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.490
And then of course,

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:33.930
enzymes come in and
start digesting the food.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.350
And we're going to talk about digestion

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:37.290
and how that's communicated
to the brain in a moment.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.090
And for those of you with any
autoimmune issues or digestive

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:43.180
issues, this is going to be
very important conversation.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.770
But meanwhile there are these neurons

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:47.780
in the gut and as these fatty acids

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.340
float out of the digested food,

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:54.340
so literally fat molecules,
and as amino acids are coming

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.000
from the proteins as
they're digested in the gut.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.040
And as a third food item,

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.360
sugars are coming from
the foods that we eat.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.720
These neurons will fire a lot
to the brain that says, Hey,

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.493
whatever you're doing up
there, do more of it, okay?

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:11.950
Now the sugars are a
little bit cryptic because

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.603
when I say sugars or I say amino acids,

00:56:15.542 --> 00:56:19.470
or I say fatty acids, this
has nothing to do with taste.

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.690
In fact, beautiful
experiments have been done

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:24.030
by the Borges Lab and
by other labs showing

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.930
that even if you numb the mouth,

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:29.280
even if you gavavge,
which is a really, just a,

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.040
it's a fancy word for
basically tube feeding,

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.170
you put a tube down into the gut,

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.250
you just deliver the food to the gut.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.490
So you get no opportunity to
taste, it sounds pretty awful.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:41.100
If you force feed by gavage,
or you numb the mouth,

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.720
these neurons don't care about the mouth.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.110
They only care about the
nutrients coming from these foods.

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:48.990
And then they signal to the
brain, hey, do that thing, do

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.940
that thing where you lift
that object, we call a fork

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.480
or a spoon, do that thing
where you drink the milkshake,

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.600
do that thing where you
move your mouth like this,

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.010
not talking, but do that
thing where you swallow.

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:02.060
So that's how the nutrients
in our gut control us.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.440
And this is why for people
that experience extreme sugar

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.620
cravings, or even mild sugar cravings,

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.440
replacing those foods with
foods that have high levels

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.250
of omega-3 or amino acids
can produce sugar cravings.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.690
And I've talked about this
on a previous episode,

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:18.010
but if you didn't catch it, no big deal.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.770
I'll tell you right now
that for many people,

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.840
the solution to sugar cravings
is to ingest a small amount,

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.113
maybe a teaspoon or so of an
amino acid called glutamine.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:30.690
And if you have really
extreme sugar cravings,

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:34.040
you can even mix that glutamine
with a full-fat cream,

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.630
which actually makes it
taste pretty darn good.

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.970
And you drink that anytime
you have a sugar craving

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:38.907
or just a sip or two of that.

00:57:38.907 --> 00:57:40.980
And we find is that the
sugar cravings disappear,

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.320
because you're basically
giving fat and amino acids

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.010
to those neurons in the
gut and in the intestine,

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:49.160
that signal to the brain
that you want more.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.230
Now, this doesn't give you a kind

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.523
of runaway hunger for full fat cream.

00:57:53.626 --> 00:57:55.920
Although it will say when I
was in high school for various

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.570
reasons, but mostly because
I liked the way it tastes.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:59.940
I was using half and half in my cereal.

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.610
And I was waking up in the
middle of night and drinking half

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.250
and half, and that stuff
tastes pretty darn good

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:05.040
once you get used to the high fat content.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.810
Not something I do now.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:11.430
But the point is these neurons
don't really know taste,

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:12.820
they only know nutrients.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.300
And so you can work with that
system if you crave sugar,

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.640
and I do believe that most if
not all of us should be trying

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.490
to limit, if not eliminate simple sugars,

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:23.890
as much as possible most of the time,

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.890
then things like glutamine,
things like high omega-3 foods,

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.950
et cetera, maybe even want to supplement

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:33.550
with fish oil or something
similar to get omega-3s,

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.383
there are other reasons

00:58:34.383 --> 00:58:36.510
for wanting to do that too,
can be very beneficial.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.350
And here's what we're talking
about is interoception,

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:43.410
it's your ability to sense
your inner real estate,

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:44.620
but in this case, by way

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:47.963
of chemical signaling, not by
way of mechanical signaling.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.130
So now I'd like to talk
about another aspect

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:54.840
of gut chemistry that has profound effects

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.370
on the brain, as well
as on the immune system.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:59.780
And for those of you with
auto-immune conditions,

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.260
or for those of you that
know people with auto-immune

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.260
conditions, this is going to
be a very important discussion.

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.800
Your gut needs to maintain
a certain level of acidity

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.540
or alkalinity, for those of
you without any chemistry

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.050
background, basically the
low numbers on the pH scale,

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:20.120
that means more acidic,
the higher, the numbers,

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.620
more alkaline, so more
alkaline means more basic

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.233
and acidic means acidic.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:28.600
And it has to do with whom
hydrogen atoms and all this other

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.720
stuff, but you don't need to
worry about that right now.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.110
We're not going to pH your gut right now,

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:34.240
but we are going to talk
about the pH of your gut.

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.450
Your gut needs to be more acidic
than essentially all other

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.000
tissues of your body in
order to function properly,

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.490
bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions.

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.180
I think this is important
for people to understand.

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.200
People are always thinking, oh,

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.420
you should be more alkaline being acidic,

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:53.190
that almost sounds like being
inflamed at well, you know,

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:54.350
it's a complicated discussion,

00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:56.560
but I think the semantics
can be confusing,

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.750
sometimes you want your gut to be acidic.

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:02.580
You may ask, well, why are
people taking antacids?

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.720
Well, those antacids are
there for a particular purpose

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.710
to essentially combat acid reflux,

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:11.860
which is the sending up of stuff

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.793
in the gut towards the esophagus.

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.380
And it can cause heartburn
and things of that sort.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.790
And the way the antacids
work is they essentially

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:23.480
cause the sphincters above the gut

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.620
to sinch shut, but they
really are only dealing

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.770
with a symptom, not the cause.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.510
So rewind, and about 10, 20 years ago,

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:34.510
the discussion about gut acidity
was quite a bit different

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:37.030
than it is now in the scientific
and medical literature.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.230
In fact, for many years long before,

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:42.690
I'm going to say it here,
people have been saying

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.150
that it's important to
maintain proper acidity

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:50.270
of the gut, but the science
and medical professions sort

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:53.110
of looked at that as kind
of a scance like, you know,

01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:54.070
what's going on there, I don't,

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:55.780
I don't know that there's any
evidence that that's actually

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.030
true, there are communities of
people that were prescribing,

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.220
or I should say recommending
that people take hydrochloric

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.570
acid HCL and adjusting
gut acidity that way.

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.740
And it was kind of frowned upon,

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.375
now in looking over the
peer reviewed literature,

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.010
it's clear that this business
of trying to make the gut a

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:14.550
little more acidic is actually one way

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:18.970
in which people treat or try
and ameliorate acid reflux.

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:21.570
So it's kind of counterintuitive
increasing acidity in the

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:24.260
gut to try and reduce acid
reflux, thought you're supposed

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:27.720
to take antacids, well, the
field has shifted quite a bit.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.870
And so we're going to review
what it is to maintain the

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:34.650
chemistry of the gut at a
slightly more acidic level

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.480
or a more aesthetic level, I should say,

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.340
because it turns out
that there are a number

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.300
of things that are in gut
are just call it what it is,

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.650
it's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.000
But gastric juices are actually

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:49.193
powerful modulators of brain state.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.860
Put differently, one of the best things

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.595
that you can do to have a healthy brain,

01:01:54.595 --> 01:01:55.686
a well-functioning brain

01:01:55.686 --> 01:01:57.366
and a healthy and well-functioning body

01:01:57.366 --> 01:01:59.450
is to maintain proper gut chemistry.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.910
And that's basically accomplished
by getting the right level

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:05.423
of acidity and alkalinity in your gut.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.420
Now this is not quack pseudoscience.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.550
This is not based on cleanses
or anything of that sort.

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.420
Well, we're going to talk about
now are peer reviewed data

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.830
in very high quality journals,
like the Journal Cell,

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:20.760
which is one of the three
apex science nature, so,

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.220
and journals of that sort,

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.180
that point to the gut
microbiome and its relationship

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.850
to acidity of the gut and how
the gut microbiome can help

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:32.820
enhance auto-immune function

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.270
and various other aspects
of brain and body health.

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:39.480
So within all the mucosal
lining tissues of our body,

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.220
we have what are called
microbiota, little micro organisms

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.630
that we didn't make that actually come

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:49.630
from our environment or our
food and live inside us.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:53.490
And there are good microbiota
and there are bad microbiota

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:58.000
whether or not we have good microbiota

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.180
or bad microbiota depends on one thing.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:04.400
And that one thing is how acid or alkaline

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.193
the given mucosal tissue is.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.740
So we actually have a
microbiome in our nose.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.280
And just as a very brief aside,

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.900
because I'd be remiss
if I didn't say this,

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.630
if you emphasize nasal breathing most

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.830
of the time, except
when speaking or eating.

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:24.280
And if you downplay mouth breathing,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.950
meaning you refrain from mouth breathing,

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:30.950
especially in sleep, you
improve the nasal microbiome.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.740
It gets better at fighting off infections.

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.170
This was shown in a beautiful paper,

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.640
published in Cell Reports last year.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.190
And that paper I should mention
was performed in humans.

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:44.990
So you've got a microbiome in your nose

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:47.270
and my nasal breathing most
of the time, not all the time.

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.103
Cause there going to be times

01:03:48.103 --> 01:03:49.770
when you need to breathe
through your mouth

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.430
for whatever reason, hard exercise

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.380
or eating or speaking, but by
breathing through your nose,

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.350
most of the time you are
creating an additional layer of

01:03:57.350 --> 01:04:00.660
immune defense against particles
that could get you sick.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.030
Whereas when you mouth breathe,

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:04.040
you are taking down a layer of defense

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.170
and you are putting yourself
more at risk of infection.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:07.670
This is what this paper shows.

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.860
You also have a gut microbiome that is

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.360
in your throat, in your
stomach and in your intestines.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.950
And that gut microbiome
is extremely powerful

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:24.770
in regulating your mood
and your immune function.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:27.210
Now, this is not something
that you can sense directly.

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:30.830
You don't know when you have a
bunch of good microbiota or a

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:33.400
bunch of bad microbiota because
you can feel them moving

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.210
around in there, actually
that would be pretty awful,

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.023
that would be pretty creepy feeling.

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:41.560
Rather that according to whether
or not your gut is alkaline

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.860
or acidic in the appropriate ways,

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.003
you will populate your gut with
the appropriate microbiota.

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:52.960
So you want your stomach
to be pretty acidic,

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.260
but other elements of your digestive tract

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.220
are going to be more pH.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.930
And basically there's a gradient,

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:03.930
meaning there's a low to high
pH gradient along the gut.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.770
You don't have to know what the pH

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:08.140
should be at any one given point,

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:10.460
because you're not going
to go and put microbiota

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.490
at one location and not another.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:16.060
What you essentially want to
do is create an environment

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.480
where the proper can thrive,
because when you do that,

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.550
you greatly decrease what are
called inflammatory cytokines.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.970
So these are things that
are secreted both by cells,

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:30.660
within the body and cells
within the brain to impact brain

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.070
health and brain function
and bodily health.

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:36.010
They go by particular name,
so there's something called

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:38.670
TNF alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha.

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.050
It is inflammatory.

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:43.040
It's not a good thing to
have at elevated levels.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.950
You have something called
Interleukin Six, IL-6

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:47.580
also causes inflammation,

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.080
causes damage to tissues,
not a good thing to have

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.263
elevated for long periods of time.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.450
And then you have
anti-inflammatory cytokines,

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:58.020
things like Interleukin 10,
which reduce inflammation.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.650
And there are hundreds of these,

01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:01.880
if not thousands of these
different cytokines,

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.600
some of which promote inflammation,

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.140
some of which reduce inflammation.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:11.120
The simple way to adjust these
things in the proper ratios

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.070
is to adjust your gut microbiome.

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.120
The best way to adjust your microbiome is

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.570
to ingest certain types of foods.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.470
So there is a beautiful literature

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:22.070
on this now, but the most
important literature is the one

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:25.280
that I referred to at the
beginning of this episode,

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.100
which is what to ingest
and what not to ingest

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:33.010
in terms of foods in order
to create the best conditions

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.270
in your gut so that you can
create the best conditions

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.420
in your brain and body.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:39.560
There was a study done by my colleague,

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.240
Justin Sonnenberg at
Stanford School of Medicine.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.660
Justin's actually my upstairs neighbor

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.890
in the building at Stanford where I work

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:51.230
and they explored how different foods

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.800
or different diets, I should say,

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.710
impact the gut microbiome
and inflammatory markers.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:58.460
And this is a beautiful
study because it was done

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.710
in hundreds of human patients.

01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:02.510
These actually weren't
patients that were sick,

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:06.320
I should say human subjects
that were otherwise healthy

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.180
from a huge variety of
backgrounds, so you had men,

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.960
you had women, you had people

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.220
of different races, different ethnicities.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.690
You had a huge range of backgrounds

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.140
and they tracked all of that.

01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:19.140
And what they did is they
explored two types of diets.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.180
One is a high fiber diet.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:25.670
So dietary fibers are
non-digestible are only partially

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.960
digestible carbohydrates typically.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.660
And they compared that to diets

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:33.420
that were unchanged, except
for the inclusion of a few,

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:36.680
to a few more servings of
fermented foods, each day,

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.010
things like sauerkraut,
things like kimchi,

01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:41.000
they even explored, it
sounds pretty disgusting

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.230
to me, but who knows, I've never tried it,

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.680
which is fermented cottage cheese.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.460
And what they found was
that after initial period

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.370
of a few weeks, where they
had people either eat a lot

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.700
of fiber or eat one or two
servings of fermented foods,

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.530
they had those people ramp
up their ingestion of either

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:00.200
fiber or fermented foods, so
they kind of ease them into it.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.950
As they went baseline then ramp up

01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:04.400
to the point where they
were ingesting, you know,

01:08:05.427 --> 01:08:06.690
four or five servings of fiber or

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.420
of fermented foods per day,
which sounds like a lot.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.670
But for fermented foods,
that would be, you know,

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:16.170
four or five tablespoons
of sauerkraut or kimchi.

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:17.737
It's not quite,

01:08:17.737 --> 01:08:20.140
it's not like huge platefuls
of fermented foods.

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.440
And then they looked
at a number of things.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.760
They looked at the proteome,

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.420
which is a kind of like
looking at the genome,

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.640
but a bunch of proteins
that are made in the body.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.890
And they did this by fecal
samples, by stool samples,

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.020
and they did this by blood
draw, which is great,

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.410
it's a real power of this study.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.620
In fact, the most comprehensive
study that I'm aware of.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.450
By looking at these different
tissues across long periods

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:44.990
of time, so many weeks, and
then returning people to their,

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.410
to the diet that they were
on before they went into the

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:51.430
study, they will were able
to establish in a causal way,

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:55.730
how ingesting fibers or fibrous
foods versus ingesting these

01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:58.370
fermented foods on a daily
basis could impact the gut

01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:02.190
microbiome and many inflammatory markers

01:09:03.342 --> 01:09:05.612
and many markers of immune function

01:09:05.612 --> 01:09:07.970
and auto immune function.

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.570
And the takeaway message
from this study is that the

01:09:10.570 --> 01:09:15.250
fermented foods far out
performed the high fiber diet.

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:18.480
In fact, the high fiber diet
in some people was beneficial

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.330
and in other people caused
issues with inflammation.

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:25.127
This is very different than
what I was taught growing up

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.743
and what many of us were taught.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:30.270
Interestingly they also
observed that people

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.960
that ate the high fiber diet

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.620
had increases in certain enzymes

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.900
that lend themselves to better
digestion of carbohydrates.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.350
And I think there's an important
insight to come from this.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.350
Nowadays we kind of live
in the age of extremes

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:45.610
where people seem to
either want to be carnivore

01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:47.320
or like never ingest a vegetable,

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.350
I hear they don't even like allow pepper,

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.620
but they're not even allowed, you know,

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.720
sauerkraut or something like very extreme

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.270
or pure plant based, pure vegan or pure.

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:59.040
So essentially pure carbohydrate

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.550
or pure animal protein, very extreme.

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:03.970
I'm an omnivore, I like to eat a mixture

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.130
of different things at
different times of days,

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:09.560
but very extreme, but this is
interesting because what this,

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.350
what these data show is that
perhaps ingesting a high

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:16.040
carbohydrate high fiber diet,
which is really what these,

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.480
the high-fiber condition really was

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.530
actually makes people better
at digesting carbohydrates.

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:23.363
This may explain

01:10:23.363 --> 01:10:27.050
why people who are used to
a, kind of a more paleo type

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.950
or carnivore type diet
might eat carbohydrates

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:32.440
and say, oh, that doesn't work
for me, I don't feel good.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.070
It might also explain why
people who predominantly eat

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:37.530
plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:40.090
will try eating meat as an experiment,

01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.040
or because they lost a
bet or whatever it is

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.020
and they'll do or desperation,
or they'll do that.

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.800
And then they'll say, oh, I
don't feel good when I eat meat.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.470
How good you feel,

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:53.100
it seems how well you
can utilize that food,

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.750
and how much of that food
you crave may be determined

01:10:57.750 --> 01:11:00.090
in fact, it appears is determined

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.630
by your food eating history,
the types of food you eat.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.750
And I think this might
explain some of the divide

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:08.510
and hopefully might bridge
some of the chasm between these

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:10.240
different groups that are
saying it should be one way,

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.810
or it should be another.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:15.700
But at the core of the study
was the bigger message.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:20.320
The bigger message is that
all of us should be ingesting

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.270
on a regular basis, daily basis,

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:25.280
two to four servings of fermented
foods of different kinds.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.840
And why I say that is because

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.110
the inflammatory markers went down,

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:35.090
the markers of auto-immune
disruption went down,

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:39.030
and the chemistry of the
gut therefore was adjusted

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:41.130
in the appropriate ways.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.260
Now it's not to say that high fiber is bad

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.830
or that fiber is bad, I don't want people

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:46.530
to confuse this, but even
though this is a discussion

01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:48.860
about interoception,
about sensing the self.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:52.740
This is a subconscious
mechanism by which the gut

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.650
communicates to many
organs, including the brain.

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:59.080
And it's been shown in other
studies also in quality peer

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:03.290
review journals that when
the correct gut microbiota

01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:07.240
are present and these
inflammatory markers are reduced,

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.650
cognition improves so ability to focus,

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:12.600
ability to sleep ability
to ward off infection

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.510
and wound healing all enhanced,

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:17.530
in fact, even in autism spectrum disorder,

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:20.920
in people that struggle with
various mental conditions

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.370
or disorders of the mind
improving the gut microbiome seems

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:28.260
to have powerful effects on
improving brain symptoms.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.120
Along the lines of auto-immunity,

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.920
there are a number of conditions

01:12:32.984 --> 01:12:36.030
that we call auto-immune conditions,

01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:37.480
and we will do entire episodes
about these going forward.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.100
But for people with so-called
irritable bowel syndrome,

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.570
for people with Crohn's disease,

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:45.240
for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's,

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.270
which is a kind of an
immune system self-attack

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:51.210
on one's thyroid gland
and things like eczema,

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:55.010
skin conditions, adjusting the
gut microbiome has been shown

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:59.930
to be useful in positively
adjusting the symptoms

01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:04.010
of all of those, will it fix
those conditions entirely?

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.903
Probably not.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:07.840
But can it have a significant
positive impact on them?

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.943
Probably, yes.

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:11.420
There is one thing that's worth mentioning

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.350
in that list, which is leaky
gut, what is leaky gut.

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:16.230
Here, we're talking about the guts,

01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:17.890
what is it to have a leaky
gut, it sounds awful.

01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.440
It sounds like something sort
of like leaking out the end

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.500
of the tube, and it maybe
that too, I don't know.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:27.500
But leaky gut is actually
because, your gut is not a tube

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:30.180
that's continuous, one
cell it's actually made up

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.950
of many cells and those
cells form a barrier

01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:36.310
and they form what are
called tight junctions.

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:38.870
If you have two cells and you
want to create a fence out

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:40.900
of those cells, you bind them together.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.160
The way that the body does
this is to bind them together

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.010
with what are called tight
junctions, these are,

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:47.120
they go by names like
claudins and things like that,

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.230
if you want to look them up.

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:50.870
These tight junctions form a nice barrier,

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:53.780
like a cyclone fence, that
things can't get past,

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.970
but like a cyclone fence only
molecules of a certain size

01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:58.635
can go through those holes.

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:00.300
So you're not going to pass a soccer ball

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.220
through an intact cyclone
fence, but you could pass

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.790
for instance, a feather
through that fence.

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:09.790
So leaky gut is when the
conditions in the gut are

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:14.280
too alkaline or the gut
microbiota are off in the gut,

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.280
meaning microbiota that like
alkaline guts are living there.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.250
And those tight junctions can't
function at that particular

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:26.660
pH and you create little
holes in that fence.

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.690
And then what happens is
when you ingest foods,

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.230
some of those foods
literally leak out of the gut

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.790
and into the extracellular
space and into the bloodstream.

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:39.900
And because foods include proteins

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:44.580
and antibodies react to proteins,

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.840
what ends up happening in leaky gut,

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.040
and the reason we talk about
in auto-immune conditions is

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.340
that you start developing antibodies

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.583
to particular food proteins.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.210
And then people start feeling
like they have food allergies

01:14:56.210 --> 01:14:59.240
and they do, they actually
create particular food allergies.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.730
Now, one way to prevent
leaky gut is to get the rest

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.330
of the gut situation happy
by ingesting the proper foods

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:06.340
that we talked about before,

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.860
ingesting fermented
foods on a regular basis.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.250
The other is our old
friend glutamine, again.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.270
There are some data and I
should say it's a limited number

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.280
of studies showing that
ingesting glutamine anywhere

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.600
from one to three, excuse
me, teaspoons per day,

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.360
can help alleviate leaky gut.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.730
Now, the mechanism for that
still isn't clear whether

01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:30.863
or not it's adjusting pH or
whether or not it's creating

01:15:30.863 --> 01:15:34.260
more favorable environment
for the microbiota,

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.500
but it is clear that
supplementing with glutamine can,

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.870
in some people enhance where I
should say improve conditions

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.550
of leaky gut, so that
might be useful as well.

01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:44.890
And then the final thing about this,

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:47.920
I want to talk about is we're
talking about chemical sensing

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.330
in the gut and how that
impacts wellbeing is about gut

01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:56.530
acidity, and this I confess
is a little bit controversial.

01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:59.550
Some people are on board,
this other people are not.

01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:02.850
And so I'd love your feedback
on this, if you, if you agree,

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.170
please tell me if you
disagree, please tell me,

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:07.833
but please tell me why you
disagree in particular,

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:11.000
experience or data,
although it's always better

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.460
if you can point me towards
peer reviewed studies.

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.090
There is a practice that
some people embrace.

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:17.950
I'm not recommending
people necessarily do this.

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:19.780
And you would definitely
want to talk to your doctor,

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.970
but where people have food
allergies or they're having mood

01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:27.250
or auto-immune issues,
and they treat this,

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.400
some people recommend treating this

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.850
through the ingestion of HCL,
hydrochloric acid tablets.

01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:35.010
Now hydrochloric acid can burn you, right?

01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:38.500
Acids can burn you, they
literally can melt away skin.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.060
You want to be very careful
with acids of all kinds, truly,

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.910
but hydrochloric acid is sold

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:48.660
as in supplement form
in capsule or pill form.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.050
And there is a practice
of starting to ingest one

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:55.500
or two hydrochloric acid
tablets midway through a meal

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.330
and then what people will
generally do is examine to see

01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:02.610
whether or not that improves
their symptoms of indigestion,

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:05.700
how it relates to mood, how
it relates to well-being,

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.240
how it relates to their
sensation of their gut viscera.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.490
By changing the acidity,
you also changed the way

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.940
that the gut communicates with the brain

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.770
through the mechanisms
we talked about before.

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:16.540
And there are a growing number
of people embracing these

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.640
practices of taking HCL.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.060
It's often combined with other
things, it's usually combined

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:28.060
with an enzyme and that enzyme is pepsin.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.838
So most of these
supplements come in the form

01:17:31.838 --> 01:17:36.770
betaine HCL pepsin and while
they're not a cure-all,

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:38.630
and certainly don't want to
suggest that they're a cure-all,

01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:42.150
many people that have a hard
time adjusting the pH of

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:45.650
their gut and have a hard time
adjusting the microbiota of

01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.090
their gut in the appropriate
ways have benefited from taking

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:53.940
these betaine HCL pepsin tablets
or capsules during meals.

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.810
And the general instruction is

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.700
to start slow, to start with one or two,

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.840
and then to find a level
that you're comfortable with

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.380
that doesn't create an
excessive feeling of warmth

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.190
in the stomach, it doesn't
throw off your digestion.

01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:07.140
So it takes a little bit
of experimentation, again,

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:09.520
definitely talk to your
healthcare provider

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.703
before exploring this,

01:18:12.425 --> 01:18:14.590
but this has become a very
common practice for people with

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:19.590
auto-immune disorders and
accessing the gut because it is

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.540
accessible by taking things
has also become way in which

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.920
people with various mental
conditions are trying to adjust

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.440
their mood and adjust their wellbeing.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.580
Along these lines,

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:33.220
I do want to mention that
there are studies that show

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:37.870
that people that supplement
with a lot of probiotics

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:41.700
or even prebiotics can
sometimes experience brain fog.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.050
This isn't discussed a lot

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:45.300
and the data are a little
all over the place,

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:48.266
but it is that we're thinking about.

01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:51.045
The goal here is not to
create as many microbiota

01:18:51.045 --> 01:18:54.933
as possible, what you want
is microbiota diversity.

01:18:54.933 --> 01:18:56.830
And I should mention this again

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:59.430
in reference to the Sonnenberg study,

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.620
which was what the high fiber diet does

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.160
is it increases certain microbiota,

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.480
but it limits their diversity

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.750
and what the fermented food diet does,

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.700
or I should say the diet that
includes regular ingestion

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.129
of fermented foods a few servings a day

01:19:15.129 --> 01:19:19.200
is it increases microbiota diversity.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.193
Now, lack of microbiota diversity

01:19:21.193 --> 01:19:23.810
has a name in the medical profession.

01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:26.600
It's called dysbiosis
and dysbiosis is bad.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.870
Dysbiosis is what you see
when people are spending long

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:31.910
periods of time on bedrest

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:35.620
or when they've been chronically
ill, and so here again,

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:39.150
we're talking about creating
a positive environment

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:40.990
in the gut, either by adjusting acidity,

01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:43.930
maybe you explore the
betaine HCL pepsin thing.

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:45.570
I think if you have healthy digestion,

01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:48.710
if you feel like you
have a good relationship

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:50.580
to your gut, and it has a
good relationship to you,

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.463
sort of a silly phrase, because
it is you and you are it,

01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:57.800
then I don't think there's
any need to pursue this,

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.648
but if you don't, that might
be one avenue to pursue.

01:20:00.648 --> 01:20:02.690
However I think primary in all

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:04.890
of this is the fermented food findings,

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:08.030
and it's not just one study,
it's many many findings

01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:10.150
that now bring us to a place where a huge

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:12.380
center of massive data are
pointing us in the direction

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:16.510
of saying ingest fermented
foods on a regular basis.

01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:20.190
I should also mention that
conditions like sarcopenia,

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:23.020
which is the loss of
muscle tissue as we age,

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:26.750
has been shown to be offset by
improving the gut microbiota.

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:27.860
So while today is

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:30.140
about interoception, we're
talking about sensing,

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.260
we're also talking about
subconscious sensing.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.840
What are we talking about,
subconscious sensing,

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.870
we're talking about subconscious sensing

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:37.450
of the milieu of the body.

01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:40.740
When the milieu of the
gut and the body is right,

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.620
than the brain and the immune
system function very well.

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.630
And so this isn't something
where you can sit back

01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:49.360
and say, oh, you know, I feel
all those good microbiota

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.480
in my gut, or, oh, no,
those are bad microbiota.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.930
You can't do that unless you're
going to take fecal samples

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:57.750
and blood samples and analyze them

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:01.130
in the, with the extreme exhaustive nature

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.280
that the Sonnenberg and other labs do,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.760
you're not going to get
that kind of information.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.470
I know there are companies out there

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:08.810
that do this, and I don't
want to knock on any

01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:13.010
of them, but I do want to
emphasize that to do this right,

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:15.700
to really analyze which
cytokines you're making,

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.640
which ones you're not,

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.440
you really need to look
at a huge number of them.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.560
And that requires large-scale proteomic

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:25.010
and genomic and inflammatory
markers screens.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:27.520
It's just not the kind of
thing that most commercial

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.940
enterprises can really provide

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.560
to people in a way that
they can interpret, rather,

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.860
this is a case where you can
simply go to the effector,

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.590
to the thing that can
actually move the needle

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.710
in the right direction for you.

01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:39.460
It's very clear that's fermented
foods and that's keeping

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.710
the stomach slightly more acid

01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:44.070
than one might think you would want to.

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:46.470
So let's talk about barfing first.

01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:51.470
Barfing, AKA vomiting, is when
the contents of your guts run

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.888
in reverse, meaning when
they go up from your stomach.

01:21:54.888 --> 01:21:56.696
Sometimes even up from the intestines,

01:21:56.696 --> 01:21:58.330
even though that sounds horrible,

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:02.000
it sometimes happens up,
out the esophagus and mouth

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:06.093
and onto whatever surface
happens to be in front of you.

01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:08.500
It's a terrible thing,
nobody likes to do it,

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.960
but it's a very interesting
aspect of our biology because it

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.700
reveals a beautiful and absolutely
fundamental relationship

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:20.890
between our chemistry and our brain.

01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:25.680
So your brain is actually
locked behind a gate

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.170
and that gate is not your skull.

01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:31.230
That gate is the so-called
blood-brain barrier.

01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:34.307
So just like your gut has these
epithelial tight junctions,

01:22:34.307 --> 01:22:36.770
the things I talked about
before that provide a fence,

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:40.880
so things can't get through
and get through in leaky gut,

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.860
your brain has tight
junctions that are very tight.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.910
It's absolutely fundamental
that only certain molecules get

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:52.430
across the blood brain
barrier and that others don't.

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:57.397
And the reason for that is
that most all 99.99999% of your

01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:01.870
neurons do not regenerate, I
don't care what you've read,

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:04.210
especially in the news recently
about how psychedelics cause

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:07.680
neurogenesis, because they
don't, it's absolutely wrong.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.810
Psychedelics have effects

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:10.400
on brain plasticity, but they have nothing

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.520
to do with neurogenesis, at least no data

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.780
to support it, but because
you can't make new neurons,

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.090
you also can't damage the ones you've got,

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:20.860
or you shouldn't as much as possible.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:25.120
And that's why you have a
blood brain barrier or a BBB.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:30.120
So the BBB as it's called
prevents substances

01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:35.430
from getting to the brain,
however, like any fence,

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:39.490
it is not always uniform along its length.

01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:43.820
And there are little spots
within that fence where chemicals

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.960
can sneak across to the
brain and through a beautiful

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.720
design, I don't know
anything about the design.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.680
As I always say, I wasn't
consulted the design phase.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.100
I'm not talking about any
kind of intelligent design

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.963
or anything that is not
the topic of this podcast.

01:23:56.963 --> 01:23:58.950
This is not a philosophy podcast,

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.960
nor is it a religion podcast,
it's a science podcast,

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.460
but through a beautiful design

01:24:04.313 --> 01:24:08.490
of some sort, there are
little holes in that fence.

01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:12.110
And they're little neurons that
sit right behind those holes

01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:17.110
and those neurons sense what
the chemistry of the blood is.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.370
So I'm guessing you probably
didn't imagine that today's

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:21.529
discussion about sensing the self

01:24:21.529 --> 01:24:23.520
would be sensing your
own blood, but you do.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.530
There's a little area of your
brain, that's little indeed,

01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:29.810
but is very important called area postrema

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:32.800
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.660
And area postrema is an
area of the brainstem

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.810
that sits right next to another brain area

01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:41.940
called the chemo receptor trigger zone.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:45.110
And when the contents in your bloodstream

01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:48.350
are of a particular kind,

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:51.953
meaning when there are
pathogens or it's too acidic,

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.210
the neurons and area postrema the neurons

01:24:56.210 --> 01:25:00.690
in the chemo receptor trigger
zone, the CTZ as it's called,

01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:05.660
trigger a bunch of motor
reflexes in the abdominal wall

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.030
that make you barf.

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:13.040
Okay, the feeling that you
need to throw up is triggered

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.330
by these neurons in the brain stem.

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:16.280
And those neurons in the
brainstem are triggered

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.440
by the presence of certain chemicals.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.130
And the reason why you don't
have any blood brain barrier at

01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:23.970
that location is because
post-trauma has to be there

01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:25.340
like a crossing guard,

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:28.090
making sure that everything
that's coming through the blood

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.610
is okay, and if it even
senses just the tiniest bit,

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:35.220
that things are off, it's
going to trigger that reflex.

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.630
Now, the really interesting thing is

01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:40.620
that the neurons and area
postrema respond to the chemistry

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:43.370
of the blood, but they also will respond

01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:45.980
to our consciousness,
to things that we think

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.610
and things that we believe
and even particular memories.

01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:53.110
This is why when certain people see vomit

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:56.530
or see someone else vomit, or
even somebody else heaving,

01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:57.970
as if they're going to vomit,

01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:00.500
they themselves feel as
if they're going to vomit.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.040
I'm guessing they're probably
even a few of you right now

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.870
that feel like you might vomit.

01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:07.550
You might feel salivation in your throat,

01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:09.550
which is always a precursor to vomiting.

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:13.320
Some people, the memory of,

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:16.500
or the thought of something
like blood or vomit or,

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.540
use your imagination, can
actually trigger the vomit reflex.

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:24.880
And that's because these neurons
in area are very sensitive

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.490
to prior experience of
interactions with negative things.

01:26:29.490 --> 01:26:31.140
So and actually, as I'm saying this,

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.770
I feel my gut kind of
cramping up again, I'm not,

01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:36.427
I don't vomit very easily, I'm not one

01:26:36.427 --> 01:26:39.563
of those, nor am I somebody
who's never vomited.

01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:42.730
And here we are talking
about my vomit history,

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:44.700
but I think it's appropriate

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.000
in this, in this context,
the neurons of area,

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:51.960
or they're basically to keep
your whole system safe and

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.420
thank goodness they are, because
for instance, some people,

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.008
unfortunately, they drink so much alcohol

01:26:58.008 --> 01:26:59.300
that they throw up.

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:00.600
Have you ever wondered why that is?

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.190
Well it's because alcohol
fundamentally is a poison.

01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:05.650
I'm not saying for, you know,

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.520
age appropriate folks that
ingesting alcohol is bad.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.910
This isn't a judgment call,

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:13.110
but alcohol itself at excessive levels

01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:17.470
in the bloodstream triggers
post-trauma to cause vomiting.

01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:22.373
So this is an example,
whereby memories, context,

01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:25.580
but also just the chemistry
of our internal state

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:29.130
is triggering behaviors
that are very hardwired.

01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:30.460
They're very reflux driven.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:33.760
And why would it be that
some people get more nauseous

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.250
than others at a given level, well,

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.120
they'll have to do with alcohol tolerance.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.110
Some people have what's
called a, you know,

01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:42.610
we refer to as a stronger
stomach or a stomach of steel.

01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:45.270
Other people they throw out very easily

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:47.910
if they don't feel well,
or if they ingest anything

01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:49.360
that's just a little bit off.

01:27:50.677 --> 01:27:52.830
From a purely adaptive standpoint,

01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:55.172
it's probably better to vomit up things

01:27:55.172 --> 01:27:56.380
that aren't good for you

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.890
rather than to have them
pass through your system.

01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:02.610
Especially if those things
are contained in lipids.

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.110
For instance if you ingest something

01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:06.120
that's in liquid form because cells,

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.080
literally every cell in
your body is surrounded

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.870
by a little thin layer
of fatty tissue, we call

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:13.960
the bilayer membrane,
it's a little membrane.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.470
Fat can move through fat very easily.

01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:18.640
And so any bad stuff you ingest

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.510
can get stuck in your system.

01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:22.654
So let's talk for a second about

01:28:22.654 --> 01:28:25.930
how to reduce nausea, because
nausea is that salivation,

01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:28.450
that feeling that you're
going to vomit, can be very

01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:31.600
beneficial in an, in an
adaptive circumstance.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.810
Like you've ingested something bad,

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:36.130
but some people experience
nausea, for other reasons,

01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:39.040
there are good ways to regulate nausea

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.820
and the ways they regulate
nausea, very interesting.

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.940
They actually adjust the activity

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.400
of these neurons in area postrema

01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:49.660
or they change the chemistry
of the blood directly.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.340
And many of you have heard
this before, perhaps,

01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.530
but it turns out that there are good data,

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:57.270
11 research studies where the
ones that I could find peer

01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:59.310
reviewed research studies with no bias,

01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:01.520
so independent studies showing that ginger

01:29:03.035 --> 01:29:06.200
can cause a notable reduction in nausea,

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.210
how much ginger, one to three grams,

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:09.910
what's one to three grams where
you have to measure it out

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:12.250
on a scale, unless you're taking
it in pill or capsule form.

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:13.540
It doesn't seem to matter if you take it

01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:16.540
in pill or capsule form, so
this thing that you've heard

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:20.283
before that ginger can reduce
nausea, indeed is true.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.530
Peppermint, apparently can also do that.

01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:28.010
And some of you will not be
surprised to learn that cannabis

01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:30.630
can reduce nausea, not
surprise because cannabis,

01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:32.870
which has different legality
in different places,

01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:34.425
and I understand that,

01:29:34.425 --> 01:29:35.970
so please take that into consideration.

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.565
But cannabis, THC and, or it turns out CBD

01:29:39.565 --> 01:29:41.460
can reduce nausea,

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.060
that's been shown in at least one study.

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.700
And it probably does that,
not by changing the chemistry

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.700
of your blood, but by
changing the threshold

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.400
for firing of these neurons
in area post-trauma.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.350
And there are conditions
such as in chemotherapy and

01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:59.510
radiation therapy and others
where people are feeling very

01:29:59.510 --> 01:30:02.150
nauseous, I'm not recommending
people go use cannabis,

01:30:02.150 --> 01:30:05.490
unless they've decided with their selves

01:30:05.490 --> 01:30:07.520
and their family and their
doctor that they should.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.370
But what's interesting
is this thing about CBD

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:12.660
and we'll do a whole episode
on THC and CBD doesn't have,

01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:15.100
or isn't supposed to have
these psychoactive properties

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.163
that THC does.

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:19.890
Although CBD can have a
mild to major anxiolytic

01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:21.510
anxiety-reducing effect,

01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:25.960
but it does appear that the
data are what the data support.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.660
I should say, the anecdotal reports,

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:33.440
which are that cannabis can reduce nausea.

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.530
So to barf less, ginger, peppermint,

01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:40.040
and if appropriate and legal
for you, possibly cannabis.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.593
Now let's talk about fever.

01:30:43.169 --> 01:30:45.560
In previous episodes,
and in future episodes,

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.420
we deal with thermal regulation,

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.890
which is the body's ability
to regulate its temperature.

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:52.430
Talk about cold and heat

01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:55.383
and saunas and ice baths
and physical performance.

01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:58.400
We're not going to deal
with all that right now,

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.060
but I promise we will going forward.

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.370
Today, I only want to talk about fever

01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:07.360
because fever directly
relates to interoception.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.880
What do I mean by that?

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.180
Well, a fever is simply an
increase in body temperature,

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.080
that increase in body
temperature is triggered

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.280
by neurons in the brain.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.280
And those neurons in
the brain are triggered

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:21.193
by the presence of particular
things in the bloodstream.

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:23.883
What sorts of things?

01:31:25.575 --> 01:31:28.210
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses,

01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:30.640
when something bad gets in our system,

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.740
the body doesn't know it's bad,
it just knows it's foreign,

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.500
and it hasn't seen it before.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.140
Or that it's in the wrong
compartment of the body.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.570
So earlier we were talking about proteins

01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:42.790
that leak out of the gut
and get elsewhere, you know,

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:45.260
you don't want a piece of
steak sitting in your bicep.

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.090
That would be bad, you would
actually develop antibodies,

01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:48.980
you would have a horrible infection.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.600
But your body has this intelligence,

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.800
and that intelligence is to know, Hmm,

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.540
these proteins are normally
not seen in this region

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:59.030
and then your body or the
cells there, I should say,

01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:02.820
we'll release something that
then will travel to the brain

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.700
and will trigger an increase
in body temperature so that

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:09.100
your body cooks the bad thing
or the cause of the bad thing.

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.120
It's really a beautiful
adaptive mechanism.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.530
We always think fever is so terrible,

01:32:12.530 --> 01:32:16.280
but fever is there to cook the
bad thing that's inside you,

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:18.880
or that has left the correct
compartment inside you

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.730
and is in the wrong
compartment inside you.

01:32:22.730 --> 01:32:26.570
So what's beautiful about
the fever mechanism is

01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:28.990
that it looks a lot like
the barfing mechanism.

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:32.040
Basically you have a set of
neurons that sit near the

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:35.730
ventricles, remember the
ventrals is hole in the tube,

01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:39.010
that is you, the tube
that is, you are a tube,

01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:40.110
a series of tubes.

01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:42.250
And your brain has a hole down the middle.

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.610
And it extends down to the
bottom of your spinal cord,

01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:46.800
at the front, it's called the ventricles,

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.650
they start with what are
called the lateral ventricles

01:32:48.650 --> 01:32:49.830
and the excuse me,

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:52.250
starts with the third and
the lateral ventricles,

01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:53.660
and then it goes to the fourth ventricle

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:55.010
and then to what's
called the central canal.

01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:57.080
But basically is just a
big space in the middle

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.920
of your nervous system in
the middle of your brain.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.380
And you have one ventricle

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.480
that I already mentioned
called the third ventricle.

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:06.600
And it's shaped kind of
like a thin oval up upright,

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.320
if you're listening to
this, just think an I,

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.960
the shape of an I, but it's
kind of rotated 90 degrees.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.473
So it's up and down as opposed to across.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.260
And along that third ventricle,

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.250
there's there a little
neurons that can sense what's

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:24.750
in the cerebral spinal fluid
that fills the ventricle.

01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:25.650
So in other words,

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.020
you have neurons that
are sensing the chemistry

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.530
of your cerebral spinal fluid,

01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:33.410
and that have access therefore

01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:35.823
to the chemistry of your body.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.570
Because that cerebral
spinal fluid is going up

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:40.320
and down the brain and spinal cord.

01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:43.270
But into that cerebral
spinal fluid are signals

01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:44.860
about the various
chemicals within the body.

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.930
So this is not a mechanical system.

01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:48.670
This is a chemical system.

01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.650
Remember we're talking
about mechanical information

01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:53.600
and chemical information
accessing the brain.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.740
So if you have something bad

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:58.440
in your system, you've ingested a,

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.870
you breathe in a virus or
you inhaled some bacteria,

01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:03.630
or you got a cut on your leg

01:34:03.630 --> 01:34:05.653
and some bacteria are growing there.

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:09.440
Of course, locally, there will be effects,

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.190
little things called the mast cell.

01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:14.460
This M-A-S-T little packets
of histamine literally

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:17.930
will go there and explode
[poofs] and cause inflammation,

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:19.490
which is actually a good inflammation.

01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:21.638
And we'll release little things

01:34:21.638 --> 01:34:23.750
called macrophages to
gobble up the infection.

01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:26.103
The other day, it was
in Texas, it was some

01:34:26.103 --> 01:34:28.030
mean little mosquitoes in
Texas, and a lot of them,

01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:29.960
and I would stand outside
and I'd get bitten,

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.950
I didn't feel a thing,
but then later that night,

01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:34.600
they started swelling up and itching

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.790
and then I'd itch them, and
then they'd swell even more.

01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:38.992
That was because of the release

01:34:38.992 --> 01:34:40.967
of mass cells, of histamines
inside those mass cells

01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:44.620
that would literally causing
inflammation of the tissue.

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:45.960
It wasn't the poison
from the mosquito itself.

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:48.410
It was the immune response to those.

01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:51.670
Well, you also have this systemic

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.990
or body-wide attempt to kill
stuff, and that's the fever.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.990
So the neurons that these
ventricles with cerebral spinal

01:34:58.990 --> 01:35:01.680
fluid go by a particular
name, they're called

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.620
circumventricular organs,
meaning near circum,

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.490
ventricular near the ventricles.

01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:09.670
And you have these organs
and there are a set

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:12.470
of neurons, has a really
cool name called the OVLT.

01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:13.800
I don't know why I like
that, but I just like it,

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.650
it's the organum vasculosum
of the lateral terminalis

01:35:17.650 --> 01:35:21.830
organum vasculosum of the
lateral terminalis, OVLT

01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:25.420
are the neurons that respond to toxins

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:28.990
and bad stuff in your bloodstream,
however minor or major.

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.863
And they release things like ILK-1,

01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:36.390
which are inflammatory cytokines
inflammatory in this case

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:39.870
is good, you want inflammation
at the site of an infection.

01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:41.340
It's a good thing.

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.230
It's going to help with healing.

01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:46.270
And it's going to change
the conditions in your body,

01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:47.720
what's going to happen is

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.900
when those OVLT neurons are activated,

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.550
because you have
something bad in your body

01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:54.740
or something bad is
happening in your body,

01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.630
they communicate with an
area of the brain called the

01:35:56.630 --> 01:36:00.010
preoptic area of your
hypothalamus and the preoptic area

01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:03.203
cranks up your temperature and
tries to cook that bad thing.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.730
Now it's worth talking about fever

01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:08.940
for a moment and talking
about thermal regulation,

01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:12.200
because I think this actually
could save some lives.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:17.200
So if you are overheated
to a point where, you know,

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.960
you're getting up past 102

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.860
or 103, it's going to vary depending

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:24.230
on person to person and
certainly age, you know, kids,

01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:25.990
some people think can
tolerate higher levels

01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:27.510
of fever than adults, but look,

01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:29.690
you always want to be cautious
about heating up the brain

01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:31.350
too much, because once
those neurons are gone,

01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:33.680
they do not come back and
neurons do not do well

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.370
in very high temperatures.

01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:37.570
Once your body temperature
starts getting up

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.110
to 102, 103, certainly 104,

01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:43.500
you are starting to enter
serious danger zone.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.570
This can happen through
exercise in hot environments

01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:49.250
or an inability to escape heat

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:51.251
because you don't have covering

01:36:51.251 --> 01:36:53.570
or adequate ventilation or cooling.

01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:55.670
It can also be because of excessive fever,

01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:56.970
for whatever reason.

01:36:56.970 --> 01:36:59.750
A lot of people think the way
to deal with this is to put a

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:04.343
cool compress on the back of
the neck or to cool the torso.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.170
In discussing this with
my colleague, Craig Heller

01:37:08.170 --> 01:37:10.690
who's at Stanford School of Medicine,

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:12.680
and he's on the undergraduate side

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.900
of the campus as well, runs a biology lab.

01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.360
He's a world expert in thermal regulation.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.270
It's very clear that
that's the wrong response

01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:21.733
to try and cool off the body.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.770
If you put a cold towel
or you put an ice pack

01:37:26.770 --> 01:37:29.340
on the back of the neck, what
you effectively do is cool

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.310
the blood that's going to the brain.

01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:33.030
And if you do that,

01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:36.980
then your brain will react
by turning up the crank

01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:40.550
in so to speak on the neurons
in the pre optic area,

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:43.100
and will heat you up further
and can cook your brain

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.740
and organs further.

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.760
So what you want to do is, as I've talked

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.540
about before, you want to
cool the bottoms of the feet,

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.660
the palms of the hands and
the upper part of the face.

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:55.480
And I'm not going to
go into all the details

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.140
as to why you want to do that right now,

01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:58.820
but those are the
locations you want to cool.

01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:00.890
Now you can also cool
the rest of the body,

01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:03.290
but it's not okay to just
stay under the covers

01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:06.380
and just cool, you know, the
neck or something like that.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:09.220
You really want to try
and create a systemic

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.160
or whole body cooling, if the
goal is to bring fever down,

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.100
but in many cases, fever is adaptive.

01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:17.800
And so taking a non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.230
like Advil and Tylenol

01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:22.610
sometimes can be good,
if that's recommended,

01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:24.590
but other times, because
it reduces your fever,

01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:26.980
it's allowing that pathogen,

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.520
that pyrogen, it's sometimes called,

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.950
a pyrogen is a substance
that causes fever,

01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:35.553
think pyro, think fire, think
pyromaniacs, think pyro,

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:40.440
those pyrogens can survive at
moderate to low temperatures,

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.880
and they can't survive
at high temperatures.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.457
So the fever is an adaptive
mechanism and the OVLT,

01:38:44.457 --> 01:38:48.780
and the sensing of your
chemistry is how the OVLT,

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.640
organum vasculosum of the
lateral terminalis does that.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.250
So we've talked about sensing lung volume,

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:56.433
speed of our heartbeat,

01:38:57.375 --> 01:38:59.250
we talked about sensing the gut volume,

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:01.560
the intestinal volume,
or the absence of volume.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.560
We talked about chemistry of
the gut and the gut microbiota

01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:08.400
and auto immune functions.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.760
And we've now talked about
vomiting, and we've talked

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:16.160
about fever, lots of aspects
of sensing our internal self.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.090
Now I want to turn our attention

01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:22.270
to interoception as it
relates to feelings,

01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:25.350
the way that interoception
is most commonly described.

01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.370
And I want to highlight a term that many

01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:29.850
of you have probably heard,
which is the vagus nerve.

01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:31.520
We talked about vagus
a little bit earlier,

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:35.383
but the vagus nerve, this
vagabonding wandering nerve

01:39:35.383 --> 01:39:39.680
is involved in everything I've
talked about up until now.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.760
And the reason I saved it till now,

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.840
rather than mentioning all
along is to highlight a specific

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:47.510
point, which is that whenever
we hear about the vagus

01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:50.050
in popular culture, it's like
the vagus calms you down,

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:51.640
you want to stimulate the vagus by rubbing

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:54.080
in front of the ear, and
it's a parasympathetic nerve,

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.690
and it will calm you down,
he'll mellow you out.

01:39:55.690 --> 01:39:59.760
Actually, most of the time,
the vagus is stimulatory.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.010
When you ingest foods
with amino acids, sugars,

01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:04.320
or fatty acids,

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.886
the vagus nerve gets activated

01:40:06.886 --> 01:40:08.903
and triggers the release of dopamine,

01:40:09.832 --> 01:40:11.010
it makes you more alert and go seek more

01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:13.703
of those foods or what
led to those conditions.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.727
When you feel nauseous
it's rarely calming,

01:40:16.727 --> 01:40:20.140
when you feel like you have
a fever, it's rarely calming.

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.790
So you're starting to
get the picture that even

01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:25.805
though the vagus nerve is in
the parasympathetic branch

01:40:25.805 --> 01:40:27.550
of the autonomic nervous system.

01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:28.740
And if that doesn't mean anything to you,

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.000
because you're not in
aficionado, don't worry about it.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.350
But it's not a calming system,
it's a communication system,

01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:36.530
and it's a motor system.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.830
It communicates brain to
body and body to brain,

01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:41.943
and it changes the function
of different organs, now,

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:47.240
one thing that's important
to highlight is that stress

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.600
itself will alter the
chemistry of your gut

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.910
because of the ways that
it down the vagus nerve

01:40:55.775 --> 01:40:58.170
and quiets the neurons that
communicate from gut to brain.

01:40:58.170 --> 01:40:59.290
I want to say that again,

01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:01.130
stress will disrupt your gut

01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:04.878
and make you feel not
good, poor digestion,

01:41:04.878 --> 01:41:07.890
and just lousy, because
of the way that it shuts

01:41:07.890 --> 01:41:10.730
down the vagus nerve and
the neurons of your gut.

01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:13.930
So what stress does is it
blocks the communication

01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:16.770
between gut and brain, it
doesn't mess up your gut.

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:18.920
It just doesn't let your
gut get the signals up

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.460
to your brain, and it also
then throws off the chemistry.

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.220
And then there's a whole
cascade of effects.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.500
If you want to learn more about stress,

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.840
I did a whole episode
called "Master Stress,"

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.977
or I think maybe it was
called "Conquer Stress"

01:41:28.977 --> 01:41:31.340
and it was "Master Stress," either one.

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:33.230
The whole point of that
episode is to give you tools

01:41:33.230 --> 01:41:36.230
and practices to deal with
short term, acute stress,

01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:39.003
moderate term stress, and
long-term chronic stress

01:41:39.003 --> 01:41:40.870
through behavioral mechanisms,

01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:45.140
nutrition, supplementation,
and many other things as well.

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.023
It's chockablock full of
protocols and tools for stress.

01:41:49.190 --> 01:41:51.580
The vagus nerve, however,

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:55.350
is responsible for emotion
and the way it does that

01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:59.690
is to pool, to aggregate the conditions

01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:02.000
of your gut, the conditions of your heart

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.930
and the conditions of your breathing,

01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:07.480
which includes your diaphragm
and lungs and takes that kind

01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:11.490
of as a collection of
information and sends it

01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:14.873
to the brain and controls
what we call your emotions.

01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:19.070
Now that might seem
obvious to some people,

01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:21.600
but to other people that
might seem totally crazy.

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.370
You thought your emotions were
because the market was down

01:42:24.370 --> 01:42:25.730
and you had invested,

01:42:25.730 --> 01:42:27.720
or because something that
you thought was going

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.970
to happen is not going to happen,

01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:33.160
or because you thought
that school was open

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.420
and then it's not, or
maybe thought it wasn't,

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.810
and it is whatever it is that bothers you,

01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:41.340
you think of generally as
a purely cognitive event.

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.930
But the brain doesn't really know

01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:45.780
what to do with that information.

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.950
It doesn't act directly on that
information to create moods.

01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:52.450
Moods are created through
the heart's response

01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:55.870
to reading that headline, to
the change in your breathing,

01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:58.860
that's caused by someone
that you love telling you

01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:00.530
that actually they're not interested

01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:02.565
in spending time with you anymore,

01:43:02.565 --> 01:43:04.634
or that you screwed up or
that they're interested in

01:43:04.634 --> 01:43:06.750
spending a lot of time with
you and you like that, right?

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:09.510
Emotions can be good or bad or neutral.

01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:12.750
So this thing that we call interoception,

01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:14.580
the sense of self I've been building up

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.770
from very fundamental
layers, gut chemistry,

01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:21.290
spleens, immune systems,
auto-immune and you might've been

01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:23.050
thinking, wait, I thought this was going

01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:26.530
to be about a sense of self,
a noticing or a feeling.

01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:30.270
And indeed all of those things
are plugging in like a series

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.870
of ingredients in a recipe that gives rise

01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:35.350
to your mood and how you feel,

01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:40.150
and that mood and how you feel is shown

01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:43.350
in one location in your body
that other people can see.

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.830
And that's in your facial expressions.

01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:49.613
And indeed there are now
beautiful data showing

01:43:49.613 --> 01:43:53.920
that your face, including
the size of your pupils,

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:56.820
the tonality of your
face, how flushed you are,

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.140
or how pale you are,

01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:01.240
even the degree to which you're frowning

01:44:02.370 --> 01:44:04.673
or smiling relative to
other periods of time,

01:44:06.986 --> 01:44:10.460
that is all an aggregate
of, or a reflection rather

01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:12.750
of your gut, your heart and your breathing

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:14.480
and the chemistry of your body.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.390
And so this is why I sort of
backed into this conversation

01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:20.680
about interoception I kind
of Trojan horse this on you

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.770
on purpose which is that

01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.620
when we talk about the
vagus and you hear, oh,

01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.200
you know, you can get vagal
tone by breathing or rubbing

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.520
on the front of the or
short that's probably true,

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.890
but another fundamental layer
is the acidity of your gut,

01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:36.470
how fast your breathing
are you inhale-emphasized,

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:40.070
or exhale-emphasized breathing.

01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:44.753
When we are relaxed our
pupils tend to constrict.

01:44:45.690 --> 01:44:47.880
When we are very alert,

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.530
our pupils tend to be
dilated, whether or not

01:44:49.530 --> 01:44:53.650
that alertness has to do with
being happy or being sad.

01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:56.780
And what's remarkable, and
this is where interoception

01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:00.000
really takes a leap into the incredible

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.850
is that there are
beautiful studies that show

01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:06.120
that for instance, when we
know somebody pretty well

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.537
and they are going through
some sort of experience

01:45:09.537 --> 01:45:11.470
of any kind, our heart rate

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:14.230
actually starts to mimic their heart rate.

01:45:14.230 --> 01:45:16.230
Our breathing starts to
mimic their breathing,

01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:18.770
even if we aren't conscious
of their breathing.

01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.820
It's not like we see their chest heaving,

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.620
and we think, oh my goodness,
and then we breathe that way.

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.070
There's a mirroring

01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:29.040
and no it's not carried
out through mirror neurons.

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.160
Mirror neurons are more
of a myth and a reality,

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.900
sorry to burst people's bubbles.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.560
But that bubble around mirror
neurons is definitely made of

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:40.560
myths and a topic for another
time, but we start to mirror.

01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:45.470
Somehow human beings are able
to register the internal state

01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:47.810
of other beings, and I think
probably for animals too,

01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:51.040
but certainly for other
humans, even at a distance.

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.100
And these studies are many now,

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:54.600
and they're really wonderful studies.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.270
And so your sense of
your internal landscape

01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:00.360
is linked to others.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.690
Now you can enhance this
interoceptive capacity

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:06.530
for how you feel and how
others feel, in other words,

01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:09.810
you can start getting a better
readout of your internal

01:46:09.810 --> 01:46:14.810
state by doing a simple
exercise, what is really a tool.

01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:18.733
And that is to learn to
sense your heartbeats.

01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:23.340
So some people are very good
at this, other people are not,

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:25.790
some people can do this more
easily when they have all their

01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:27.900
air exhaled and some
people can do it better

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:30.630
when they are holding a breath hold.

01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:33.000
But one thing that's kind of cool

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.050
about this whole interoceptive capacity

01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:38.463
is that you can enhance it very quickly.

01:46:39.695 --> 01:46:41.660
You can learn or teach yourself
to have heightened levels

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:45.400
of interoception in a way that
you can't really just give

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.980
yourself heightened levels of vision

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:49.700
by snapping your fingers, in
one of one tool or exercise,

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:51.850
there are things you can
do to improve vision.

01:46:51.850 --> 01:46:53.400
That's the topic of a previous episode.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.545
I encourage you to look it up.

01:46:54.545 --> 01:46:56.740
There are things you can
do to improve your hearing

01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:59.820
and your taste and your smell,
we talked about all those,

01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:01.900
but with interoception you can get

01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.335
very good at this very fast.

01:47:04.335 --> 01:47:05.490
And I think this is one

01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:06.410
of the reasons why meditation is powerful.

01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:08.350
Think there are a lot of reasons
why meditation is powerful,

01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:10.680
but one of the reasons
is when you stop taking

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:14.700
in exteroceptive information
from the outside world,

01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.713
by closing your eyes and
focusing inward, as they say,

01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:20.920
you start paying attention
to your breathing cadence,

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.420
you start directing your mind's attention

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:24.662
to your heart rate,

01:47:24.662 --> 01:47:28.290
and if you can start to
perceive your heart beating.

01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:31.830
You actually are very quickly strengthen

01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:35.170
the vagal connections between
the body and the brain.

01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:36.940
And so there's no real practice here.

01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.460
There's no breathe this
way or do this thing

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:45.430
except to direct your awareness
toward your heartbeat.

01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:48.560
And some people can get
very good at this very fast.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.180
Most people find that just by doing this

01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:52.880
for a minute or so, every once in a while,

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.580
they start to tap into this sixth sense.

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:59.640
They start to notice when
they don't feel quite right

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.520
about something or
somebody or some situation,

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.720
or they start to notice
when they feel quite right

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.250
about somebody or something
or some situation.

01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.880
So this interoceptive
awareness can be tuned up.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.160
It used to be called vagal tone,

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.600
but I think that term doesn't
take into account all the

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.410
other things that are
going on with the vagus.

01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:18.800
So I don't really like that term.

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.870
It's more of an interoceptive awareness.

01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:24.690
And again, there are
many studies now showing

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:29.180
that for sake of bettering
one's mood overall,

01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.330
for sake of moving through
a challenging phase

01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:34.560
in life, for sake of just
enhancing one's experience

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:36.770
of life overall, whether or
not it's the taste of foods,

01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:41.680
interactions with other people,
enjoyment, focus, pleasure,

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.200
tuning up one's interoceptive awareness

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.010
is both easy again by just
taking a minute or two

01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:48.970
and trying to count heartbeats.

01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:50.900
And then this works best, of course,

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.240
if you have some independent
readout of heartbeats and you

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.137
can compare, you can see
how accurate you are,

01:48:56.137 --> 01:48:58.460
but even if you don't use
a device or have a device

01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:01.230
to do that, without taking your pulse,

01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:03.470
using your thumb on your wrist
or something, or your fingers

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:06.220
on your neck, as you typically
would for taking your pulse,

01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.960
trying to sit still for a
minute or two every once

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.610
in a while, maybe once a
week, maybe twice a week,

01:49:12.610 --> 01:49:14.700
maybe while you're meditating,
maybe while breathwork,

01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:16.160
maybe during the breath
holds of breathwork,

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.420
you don't really have to do this

01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:19.070
in any kind of extended way,

01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:22.010
you can very quickly increase
your interoceptive tone.

01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:24.800
And that has a huge and outsized effect

01:49:26.267 --> 01:49:28.200
on the brain, body relationship

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.060
and your brain's ability to tap into

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:35.230
both the subconscious
and the conscious aspects

01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:37.170
of this chemical and mechanical signaling

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:38.440
that's happening all the time.

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.635
And it can have real and
out-sized positive effects

01:49:40.635 --> 01:49:42.640
on your ability to engage

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:45.900
with other people and your
ability to focus at work

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:48.300
and your ability to notice, ah,

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:52.340
I'm finding myself kind of
feeling like I'm losing focus,

01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:54.250
but really it was my heart
rate was just increasing.

01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:55.720
Maybe I just exhale a little bit

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.903
and bring my heart rate down.

01:49:59.185 --> 01:50:00.090
So whatever effectually tried to do today

01:50:00.090 --> 01:50:03.900
is to give you a window into
this incredible relationship

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.197
between your viscera and
your brain and your brain

01:50:06.197 --> 01:50:08.190
and your viscera, all
these organs of your body,

01:50:08.190 --> 01:50:11.360
and what I hope is that you'll appreciate

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.690
that it's a system, that you
aren't just a system of tubes.

01:50:14.690 --> 01:50:16.300
I said that in a sort of in jest, I mean,

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.410
you have a lot of tubes and
you are a system of tubes,

01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:21.590
but that system of tubes is
linked through the nervous

01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:25.050
system, and those links
work in very specific ways.

01:50:25.050 --> 01:50:27.940
So whether or not you remember
about pesos and all the GLPRs

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:30.280
and all that stuff, it
doesn't really matter.

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:33.550
What I encourage you to do
is start sort of pushing and

01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:36.300
pulling on the various leavers
within this beautiful system

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:40.380
that we call the interoceptive
system, this sense of self.

During the course of today's episode,

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.030
and on previous episodes,
I mentioned supplements.

01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:19.840
I realized supplements
aren't for everybody,

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.120
but for those of you that are
interested in supplements,

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.890
it is important that the
supplements that you take have a

01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:28.030
high level of stringency
with respect to the amounts

01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:30.110
of the contents that are
listed on the bottle matching

01:51:30.110 --> 01:51:33.040
what's actually in the bottle,
in the capsules and tablets,

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.850
and that the quality of those
ingredients be extremely high.

01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:39.720
For that reason we partnered
with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.750
because Thorne supplements
have the highest levels

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:45.030
of stringency for both
the content and the amount

01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:47.230
of content in those
bottles and supplements.

01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:49.660
If you want to try Thorne supplements,

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.170
and you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:55.670
you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman.

01:51:55.670 --> 01:51:57.290
And you can see all the
supplements that I take.

01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:59.710
You can get 20% off any of those.

01:51:59.710 --> 01:52:02.270
And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:04.390
you can get 20% off any of the supplements

01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:05.650
that Thorne makes.

01:52:05.650 --> 01:52:07.563
In addition we have a Patreon account,

01:52:08.422 --> 01:52:10.510
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:11.910
There you can support the podcast

01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:13.430
at any level that you like.

01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:15.940

01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:28.990

it's totally zero cost.
