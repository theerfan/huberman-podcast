00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.320
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.973
for everyday life.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.960
of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.120
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.750
Today, we're going to talk
all about hearing and balance

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.260
and how you can use your
ability to hear specific things

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.030
and your balance system in
order to learn anything faster.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.570
The auditory system,
meaning the hearing system,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.200
and your balance system, which is called

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.560
the vestibular system, interact
with all the other systems

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.630
of the brain and body and, used properly,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.050
can allow you to learn
information more quickly,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.070
remember that information
longer and with more ease

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.840
and you can also improve
the way you can hear.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.480
You can improve your balance.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.880
We're going to talk about
tools for all of that.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.770
This is one area of science,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.670
where we understand a lot about the cells

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.880
and the mechanisms in the ear
and in the brain and so forth.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.510
So we're going to talk
about that a little bit,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.710
and then we're going to get
directly into protocols,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.840
meaning tools.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.420
We're also going to talk about ways

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.940
in which the auditory and
balance system suffer.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.170
We're going to talk about tinnitus,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.581
which is this ringing of the ears that,

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:18.470
unfortunately, for people
that suffer from it,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.860
they really suffer.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.580
It's very intrusive for them.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.250
We're going to talk about some treatments

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.800
that can work in some circumstances

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.070
and some of the more
recent emerging treatments

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.680
that I think many people aren't aware of.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.210
We're also going to talk about this,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.870
what seems like kind of a weird fact,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.840
which is that 70% of people, all people,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.020
make what are called
otoacoustic emissions,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.550
their ears actually make noises.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.810
Chances are your ears are
making noises right now,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.460
but you can't perceive them.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.580
And yet those can have an
influence on other people

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.553
and animals in your environment.

00:01:53.553 --> 00:01:56.290
It's a fascinating aspect of your biology.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.110
You're going to learn a
lot about how your biology

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.980
and brain and ears and
the so-called inner ear

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.170
that's associated with balance,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.530
you're going to learn a lot
about how all those work,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.470
you're going to learn
a lot of neuroscience.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.020
I'll even tell you what
type of music to listen to.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.930
And if you listen to me,
you can leverage that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.710
in order to learn faster.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.600
Before we begin talking about the science

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630
of hearing and balance and tools

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.390
that leverage hearing and
balance for learning faster,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.130
I want to provide some information

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.437
about another way to learn much faster.

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.850
There's a paper that
was published recently.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.600
This is a paper that was published

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.430
in Cell Reports, an excellent journal.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.530
It's a peer-reviewed paper
from a really excellent group,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.933
looking at skill-learning.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.880
Now, previously, I've talked about how,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.880
in the attempt to learn
skills, the vital thing to do

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.610
is to get lots of repetitions.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.580
You've heard of the 10,000 hours thing,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.230
you've heard of lots
of different strategies

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.601
for learning faster,
80/20 rule and all that;

00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:01.000
the bottom line is you need to generate

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.530
many, many repetitions of something

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.690
that you're trying to learn.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.530
And the errors that you generate

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.380
are also very important for learning.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.837
It also turns out that taking rest

00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:16.560
within the learning
episode is very important.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.969
I want to be really clear
what I'm referring to here.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.380
In earlier episodes, I've
discussed how when you're trying

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.210
to learn something it's beneficial,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.054
it's been shown in scientific studies,

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:30.150
that if you take a 20-minute shallow nap

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.870
or you simply do nothing
after a period of learning,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.910
that it enhances the rates of learning

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.950
and the depth of learning,
your ability to learn

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.850
and remember that information.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.160
What I'm about to describe are new data

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.660
that say that you actually
should be injecting rest

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.580
within the learning episode.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.950
Now I'm not talking about
going to sleep while learning.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.380
This is the way that the study was done:

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.250
the study involved, having
people learn sequences

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.340
of numbers or keys on a piano.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.210
So let's use the keys on a piano example.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.533
I'm not a musician, but I
think I'll get this correct.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.280
They asked people to
practice a sequence of keys,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.040
G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.300
And they would practice
that either continually

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.340
for a given amount of time,
or they would just do that

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.240
for 10 seconds, they would play G-D-F-E-G,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.440
G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,
G-D-F-E-G for 10 seconds.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.810
And then they would take
a 10-second pause or rest.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.510
They would just space take
a space or a period of time

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.120
where they do nothing for 10 seconds

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.490
then they would go back
to G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.740
So the two conditions, essentially,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.780
were to have people practice continually,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.700
lots of repetitions,
or to inject or insert

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.460
these periods of 10 seconds idle time

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.600
where they're not doing anything,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.880
they're not looking at their phone,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.110
they're not focusing on anything,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.060
they're just letting their mind drift

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.670
wherever it wants to go

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.290
and they are not touching
the keys on the keyboard.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.500
What they found was that
the rates of learning,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.330
the skill acquisition and
the retention of the skill

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.810
was significantly faster
when they injected

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.290
these short periods of rest,
these 10-second rest periods.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.440
And the rates of learning were,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.260
when I say significantly faster,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.810
were much, much faster.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.160
I'll reveal what that
was in just a moment,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.500
but you might ask why would this work?

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.050
Why would it be that injecting
these 10-second rest periods

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.770
would enhance rates of learning?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.330
What they called them
was micro-offline gains

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.817
because they're taking their brain offline

00:05:36.817 --> 00:05:38.470
from the learning task for a moment.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.090
Well, turns out the brain
isn't going offline at all.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.510
You've probably heard of the hippocampus,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.530
the area of the brain involved
in memory and the neocortex,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.820
the area of the brain that's involved

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.380
in processing sensory information.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.540
Well, it turns out that during
these brief periods of rest,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.640
these 10-second rest periods,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.019
the hippocampus and the
cortex are active in ways

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:05.019
such that you get a 20 times
repeat of the G-D-F-E-G.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.240
It's a temporal compression, as they say.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.510
So basically, the rehearsal
continues while you rest,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.730
but at 20 times the speed.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.336
So if you were normally getting just,

00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:18.970
let's just say five repetitions

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.130
of G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,
G-D-F-E-G per 10 seconds.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.120
Now you multiply that times 20.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.760
In the rest periods, you've
practiced it 100 times.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.130
Your brain has practiced it.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.150
We know this because they
were doing brain imaging,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.930
functional imaging of these people

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.390
with brain scanners while
they were doing this.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.960
This is an absolutely staggering effect

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.190
and it's one that, believe it or not,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.500
has been hypothesized or thought to exist

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.633
for a very long time.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.950
This effect is called the spacing effect.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.870
And it was actually first
proposed by Ebbington in 1885.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.870
And since then, it's been demonstrated

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.380
for a huge number of different,
what they call domains,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.410
in the cognitive domain.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.190
So for learning languages,
in the physical domain,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.570
so for learning skills that
involve a motor sequence.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.750
It's been demonstrated for a huge number

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.713
of different categories of learning.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.080
If you want to learn all
about the spacing effect

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.510
and the categories of
learning that it can impact,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.400
there's a wonderful review article.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.200
I'll provide a link to it.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.050
The title of the review
article is parallels

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.250
between spacing effects during behavioral

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.140
and cellular learning.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.250
What that review really does

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.707
is it ties the behavioral learning

00:07:31.707 --> 00:07:36.630
and the improvement of skill
to the underlying changes

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.530
in neurons that can explain that learning.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.000
I should mention that the
paper that I'm referring to,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.780
the more recent paper that injects

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.920
these 10-second little
micro-offline gains,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.390
rest periods is the work of the
laboratory of Leonard Cohen,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.320
not the musician, Leonard Cohen.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.360
He passed away, he was
not a neuroscientist;

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.770
a wonderful poet and musician,
but not a neuroscientist.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.450
Again, the paper was
published in Cell Reports

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.370
and we will provide a link
to the full paper as well.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.250
So the takeaway is if you're
trying to learn something,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.690
you need to get those reps in,

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.540
but one way that you can get 20 times,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.230
the number of reps in is by injecting

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.123
these little 10-second
periods of doing nothing.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.610
Again, during those rest periods,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.930
you really don't want to
attend to anything else,

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.840
as much as possible.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.310
You could close your eyes if you want,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.630
or you can just simply wait

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.750
and then get right back
into generating repetitions.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.000
I find these papers that Cell
Reports and other journals

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.210
have been publishing
recently to be fascinating

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.160
because they're really
helping us understand

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.110
what are the best protocols
for learning anything.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.430
And they really leverage
the fact that the brain

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.615
is willing to generate repetitions for us,

00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:47.710
provided that we give it
the rest that it needs.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.810
So inject rest throughout
the learning period.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.710
And if you can, based
on the scientific data,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.880
you would also want to
take a 20-minute nap

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.850
or a 20-minute decompress period

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.130
where you're not doing anything
after a period of learning.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.645
I think those could both synergize

00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:05.210
in order to enhance learning even further,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.050
although that hasn't been looked at yet.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.590
Before we begin talking
about hearing and balance,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.320
I just want to mention that this podcast

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.300
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.540
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.560
to bring zero-cost to consumer information

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.910
about science and science related tools

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.570
to the general public.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.410
In keeping with that theme,
I want to thank the sponsors

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.920
of today's podcast and make it clear

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.430
that we only work with sponsors

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.360
whose products we absolutely love,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.820
and that we think you
will benefit from as well.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.890
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.900
Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.700
that, in my opinion are the
very highest quality available.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.940
The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.900
from Stanford and everything
about their eyeglasses

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.460
and sunglasses were created
with performance in mind.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.130
These eyeglasses and sunglasses
have a number of features

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.270
that really make them unique.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.120
First of all, they're
extremely lightweight,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.580
the optical clarity of
the lenses is spectacular.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.300
And for the sunglasses, they
have this really great feature,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.270
which is as you move
in and out of shadows,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.350
or across the day, the amount
of sunshine might change,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.400
you always experience the
world as clear and bright,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.890
and that can only come
from really understanding

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.630
how the visual system works.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.530
The visual system has all these mechanisms

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.690
for adaptation and habituation.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.250
You don't need to know
how those things work,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.230
but the folks at Roka clearly do

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.970
because you put these glasses on

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.070
and you don't even notice that they're on.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.420
They also stay on your face
even if you get sweaty.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.770
They were designed to
be used while active,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.320
so running and biking,
et cetera or indoors.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.380
One thing that I really like

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.580
about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.390
is that the aesthetic is terrific.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.580
Even though they were
designed for performance,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.020
unlike a lot of sunglasses out there

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.330
that were designed for performance

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.970
that look kind of ridiculous,
kind of space-age,

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.830
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.162
you could wear anywhere.

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:56.220
The aesthetic is really clean

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.890
and they have a huge
number of different styles

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.240
to select from.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.970
If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.320

and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.926
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:18.420
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.160
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.770
to help you better understand your body

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.660
and reach your health goals.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.770
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.350
for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.430
our immediate and long-term
health can only be analyzed

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.000
from a quality blood test.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.270
And now with the advent of DNA tests,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.643
we can get further insight and information

00:11:40.643 --> 00:11:43.800
into how our metabolism is working,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.610
how our brain is functioning,
how our endocrine system,

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.930
meaning our hormone system is functioning.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.620
One of the issues with a lot of companies

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.030
and programs that involve
getting blood and DNA tests,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.060
however, is that you get
the information back,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.650
you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.200
With InsideTracker, they
make all of that very easy.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.560
First of all, they can send someone

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.380
to your home to take
the samples, if you like

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.980
or you can go to a local clinic.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.010
You get the information
back and, of course,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.941
you get all the numbers and
levels of hormone factors,

00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:12.500
metabolic factors, et cetera,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.840
but the dashboard at
InsideTracker provides directives

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.580
so that if you want to
bring those numbers up

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.460
or bring them down, or
if you want to keep them

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.320
in the same range, it
points to specific regimens

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.500
related to nutrition, exercise,
and other lifestyle factors

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.220
so you can really move
around those numbers

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.500
to best suit your health
goals and health status.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.990
If you want to try InsideTracker,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.050
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.050
and you'll get 25% off any
of InsideTracker's plans.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.300
Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.170
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.020
Headspace is a meditation
app that's backed

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.250
by 25 published studies.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.292
And in addition to those,

00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:51.449
there are hundreds of studies showing

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:54.890
that meditation is
beneficial for our brain

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.370
and for our body.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.930
One of the challenges, however,

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.300
is maintaining a meditation practice.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.000
I started meditating a long time ago,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.080
but I found it very hard to
keep that practice going.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.330
Then I discovered the
Headspace meditation app

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.940
and what I found was that
because they have meditations

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.120
that are very short, as
well as some that are longer

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.070
and some that are much longer,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.670
I could maintain my meditation practice.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.670
Sometimes I do a short
five-minute meditation,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.740
sometimes I do 20-minute meditation,

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.770
I try and meditate at
least 20 minutes per day,

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.580
but sometimes, some weeks, I
only do it five times a week

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.200
and I'll just meditate for longer.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.130
So with Headspace, you
have the full palette

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.160
of meditations to select from.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.450
If you want to try Headspace,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.650
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.400
And if you do that, you'll
get a free one-month trial

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.240
so no cost whatsoever,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.980
with their full library of meditations.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.732
So that's the best offer that they have.

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:46.240
So, again, if you want to try Headspace

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.310
and you want to get access to
all their meditations for free

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.880
go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.713
Can you hear me?

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.010
Can you hear me?

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.410
Okay, well, if you can
hear me, that's amazing

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.432
because what it means is that my voice

00:14:01.432 --> 00:14:04.940
is causing little tiny
changes in the airwaves

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.750
wherever you happen to be.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.500
And that your ears and whatever's
contained in those ears

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.750
and in your brain can
take those sound waves

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.900
and make sense of them.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.550
And that is an absolutely fantastic

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.080
and staggering feat of
biology and yet we understand

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.740
a lot about how that process works.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.170
So I'm going to teach it
to you now in simple terms

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.140
over the next few minutes.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.940
So what we call ears
have a technical name.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.700
That technical name is oracles,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.970
but more often they're called pinna,

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.390
the pinnas, P-I-N-N-A, pinna.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.020
And the pinnas of your ears,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.830
this outer part that is
made of cartilage and stuff

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.160
is arranged such that it can capture sound

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.360
in the best way for your head size.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.030
We're going to talk about ear size also,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.190
'cause it turns out that
your ears change size

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.090
across the lifespan and
that how big your ears are

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.140
or rather how fast your
ears are changing size

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.170
is a pretty good indication
of how fast you're aging.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.510
So we'll get to that in a few minutes,

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.870
but I want to talk about
these things that we call ears

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.000
and some of the stuff
contained within them

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.680
that allow us to hear.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.600
So the shape of these ears that we have

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.350
is such that it amplifies
high-frequency sounds.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.440
High frequency sounds,
as the name suggests,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.070
is the squeakier stuff.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.110
So low frequency sound, Costello
snoring in the background

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.810
that's a low frequency sound
or high frequency sound, okay?

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.600
So we have low frequency sounds
and high frequency sounds

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.900
and everything in between.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.910
Now those sound waves
get captured by our ears.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.290
And those sound waves, for those of you

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.620
that don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.010
are literally just fluctuations or shifts

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.610
in the way that air is
moving toward your ear

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.443
and through space.

00:15:57.443 --> 00:15:59.355
In the same way that water can have waves,

00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:01.880
air can have waves.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.093
So it's reverberation of air.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.300
Those come in through your ears

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.840
and you have what's called your eardrum.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.310
And on the inside of your eardrum,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.450
there's a little bony thing that shaped

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.490
like a little hammer.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.560
So attached to that eardrum,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.327
which can move back and forth like a drum,

00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:24.450
it's a little membrane, you
got this hammer attached to it.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.350
And that hammer has three parts.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.340
For those of you that want to know,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.166
those three parts are called
malleus, incus and stapes.

00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.550
But basically, you can just
think about it as a hammer.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.190
So you've got this
eardrum and then a hammer.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.100
And then that hammer has
to hammer on something.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.500
And what it does is it hammers
on a little coiled piece

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.760
of tissue that we call the cochlea,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.070
sometimes called the cochlea,

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.060
depending on where somebody
lives in the country.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.960
So, typically, in the
Midwest, on the East Coast,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.000
they call them coh-chleah.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And on the West Coast, we call
them caw-cochlea, same thing.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.260
So this snail-shaped
structure in your inner ear

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.050
is where sound gets converted
into electrical signals

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.900
that the brain can understand.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.580
But I want to just bring your attention

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.920
to that little hammer
because that little hammer

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.250
is really, really cool.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.460
What it means is that sound
waves come in through your ears,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.320
that's what's happening right now,

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.140
that eardrum that you have,
it's like the top of a drum.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.020
It's like a membrane, or
it can move back and forth.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.850
It's not super rigid and it
moves that little hammer.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.830
And then the hammer
goes, doom-doom-doom-doom

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.110
and hits this coil-shaped thing

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.660
that we're calling the cochlea.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:39.060
Now the cochlea, at one end,
is more rigid than the other.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.490
So one part can move really easily

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.350
and the other part
doesn't move very easily.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.640
And that turns out to be very important

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.640
for decoding or separating
sounds that are low frequency

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.200
like Costello's snoring and sounds

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.050
that are of high frequency,
like a shriek or a shrill.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.880
And that's because within
that little coil thing,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.630
we call the cochlea, you
have all these tiny little

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.770
what are called hair cells.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.370
Now they look like hairs, but
they're not at all related

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.230
to the hairs on your head
or elsewhere on your body.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.690
They're just shaped like hair,
so we call them hair cells.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.690
Those hair cells, if they move,
send signals into the brain

00:18:23.712 --> 00:18:26.800
that a particular sound
is in our environment.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.640
And if those hair cells don't move,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.600
it means that particular sound
is not in our environment.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.640
So just to give you the
mental picture of this,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.250
sound waves are coming in,
because there's stuff out there,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.960
making noises like my voice;

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.030
it's changing the
patterns of air around you

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.980
in very, very subtle ways;

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.970
that information is getting
funneled into your ears

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.670
because your pinnas are
shaped in a particular way.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.180
The eardrum then moves this little hammer

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.790
and the hammer bangs on this
little snail-shaped thing.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.020
And because that snail-shaped
thing, at one end,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.810
is very rigid, it doesn't want to move

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.150
and at the other end, it's very flexible,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.660
it can separate out high-frequency
and low-frequency sounds.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.300
And the fact that this
thing in your inner ear

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.480
that we call the cochlea is coiled,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.119
is actually really important to understand

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:19.690
because along its length,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.300
it varies in how rigid or flexible it is,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.363
I already mentioned that
before and at the base,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.350
it's very rigid and that's
where the hair cells,

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.920
if they move, will make
high-frequency sounds,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.970
and at the top, what's called the apex,

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.010
it's very flexible and
it's more like a bass drum.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.273
So basically what happens
is sound waves come

00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:45.150
into your ears and then
at one end of this thing

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.040
that we call the cochlea, at the top,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.130
it's essentially encoding
or only responding

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.100
to sounds that are like,
doom-doom-doom-doom.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.070
Whereas, at the bottom, it
responds to high-frequency sounds

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.370
like a cymbal, [clanging].

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.890
And everywhere in between,
we have other frequencies,

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.680
medium frequencies.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.700
Now this should stagger your mind.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.750
If it doesn't already, it should.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.920
Because what this means is that everything

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.120
that's happening around us,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.760
whether or not it's
music or voices or crying

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.740
or screaming or screaming of
delight from small children

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.210
who are excited, 'cause they're playing

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.080
or 'cause they get cake;

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.380
all of that is being broken
down into its component parts

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.030
and then your brain is making
sense of what it means.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.990
These things that I've been talking about,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.740
like the pinna of your
ears and this little hammer

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.770
and the cochlea, that's
all purely mechanical.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.480
It has no mind of its own.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.110
It's just breaking things
down into high frequencies,

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.110
medium frequencies and low frequencies.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.880
And if you don't
understand sound frequency,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.110
it's really simple to understand,

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.200
just imagine ripples on a pond.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.840
And if those ripples
are very close together,

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.990
that's high frequency; they
occur at high frequency.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.400
If those ripples are further
apart, it's low frequency.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.430
And obviously, medium
frequency is in between.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.048
So just like you can have waves in water,

00:21:09.048 --> 00:21:10.170
you can have waves in air.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.390
So that's really how it works.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.730
Now we are all familiar with light

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.290
and how, if you take a prism
and put it in front of light,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.010
it will split that light into
its different wavelengths,

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.973
its different colors, red,
green, blue, et cetera.

00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:29.810
So like the Pink Floyd "Dark
Side of the Moon" album,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.870
I think, has a prism and
it's converting white light

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.790
into all the colors, all the wavelengths

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.610
that are contained in white light.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.760
Your cochlea, essentially,
acts as a prism.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.030
It takes all the sound in your environment

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.780
and it splits up those sounds
into different frequencies.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.950
So you can think of the
cochlea of your ear,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.640
sort of like a prism
and then the brain takes

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.720
that information and puts it back together

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.130
and makes sense of it.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.653
So those hair cells in
each of your two cochlea,

00:21:57.653 --> 00:22:01.380
because you have two ears,
you also have two cochlea,

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.910
send little wires, what we call axons

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:09.610
that convey their patterns
of activity into the brain.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.230
And there are a number
of different stations

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.830
within the brain that
information arrives at

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.150
before it gets up to
the parts of your brain,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.130
where you are consciously aware.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.270
And because some of you
have asked for more names

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.640
and nomenclature, I'll give that to you.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.180
If you don't want a lot of detailed names,

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.770
you can just ignore what I'm about to say.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.980
But, basically, the
cochlea send information

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.130
to what's called the spiral ganglion.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.140
A ganglion, by the way,
if you're going to learn

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.000
any neuroscience, just know
that anytime you hear ganglion,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.930
a ganglion is just a clump, so
it means a bunch of neurons.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.620
So a clump of cells.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.180
So the spiral ganglion
is a bunch of neurons

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.050
that the information then goes off

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.770
to what are called the cochlear
nuclei in the brainstem.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.020
Brainstem is down near your neck,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.890
then up to a structure
that has a really cool name

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.270
called the superior olive,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.820
because you have one on
each side of your brain.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.450
And if I were to bring
you to my lab and show you

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.550
the superior olives in your
brain or anyone else's brain,

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.230
they look like little olives,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.128
even that little divot in them that to me,

00:23:09.128 --> 00:23:10.660
it looks like a pimiento,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.320
but they just call them
the superior olive.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.570
And then the neurons
in the superior olive,

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.970
then they send information up

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.720
to what's called the inferior colliculus,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.880
only called inferior because it sits below

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.940
a structure called the
superior colliculus.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.060
And then the information
goes up to what's called

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.380
the medial geniculate nucleus.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.930
And then up to your neocortex

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.510
where you make sense of it all.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.950
Now you don't have to remember all that,

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.650
but you should know that
there are a lot of stations

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.140
in which auditory information is processed

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.493
before it gets up to
our conscious detection.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.900
And there is a good reason for that,

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.930
which is that more important than knowing

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.500
what you're hearing, you need to know

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.963
where it's coming from.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.750
It's vital to our survival,
that if something, for instance,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.230
is falling toward us, that
we know if it's coming

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.260
to our right side, if it's
going to hit us from behind,

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.300
we have to know, for instance,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.650
if a car is coming at us from
our left or from our right.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.500
And our visual system can help with that.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.070
But our auditory and our
visual system collaborate

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.870
to help us find and locate the
position of things in space.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.550
That should come as no surprise.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.430
If you hear somebody
talking off to your right,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.800
you tend to turn to your
right, not to your left.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.250
If you see somebody's mouth
moving in front of you,

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.960
you tend to assume that
the sound is going to come

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.383
from right in front of you.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.970
Disruptions in this auditory hearing

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.030
and visual matching are actually the basis

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.280
of what's called the ventriloquism effect,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.140
which we'll talk about in a
few minutes in more depth.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.500
But the ventriloquism effect
can basically be described

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.760
in simple terms as when
you essentially think

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.140
that a sound is coming from a location

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.343
that it's not actually coming from.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.440
We'll talk about that in a moment

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.100
but what I'd like you to realize

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.070
is that one of these stations,
deep in your brainstem

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.210
is responsible for helping
you identify where sounds

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.490
are coming from through a process

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.910
that's called interaural time differences.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.880
And that sounds fancy, but really,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.020
the way you know where
things are coming from,

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.330
what direction a car or a boss
or a person is coming from

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.020
is because the sound lands
in one ear before the other.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.294
And you have stations in your brain,

00:25:27.294 --> 00:25:29.210
meaning you have neurons in your brain

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.890
that calculate the
difference in time of arrival

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.380
for those sound waves in your
right versus your left ear.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.270
And if they arrive at the same time,

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.020
you assume that thing is making
noise right in front of you.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.250
If it's off to your right,

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.790
you assume it's over on your right.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.656
And if the sound arrives
first to your left ear,

00:25:45.656 --> 00:25:47.850
you assume, quite correctly,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.960
that the thing is coming
toward your left ear.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.750
So it's a very simple
and mechanical system

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.053
at the level of sound localization.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.290
But what about up and down?

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.610
If you think about it, a
sound coming from above

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.890
is going to land on your right ear

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.713
and your left ear at the same time.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.770
A sound from below is going
to land on your right ear

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.550
and your left ear at the same time.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.750
So the way that we know where things are

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.260
in terms of what's called elevation,

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.740
where they are in the up and down plane

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.350
is by the frequencies.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.490
The shape of your ears
actually modifies the sound

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.810
depending on whether or not
it's coming straight at you,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.780
from the floor or from high above.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.390
And so already at the level of your ears,

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.170
you are taking information
about the outside world

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.800
and determining where that
information is coming from.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.150
Now, this all happens very,
very fast and it's subconscious

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:48.730
but now you know why if people
really want to hear something,

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.650
they make a cup around their ear.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.320
They essentially make their ear

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.750
into more of a fennec fox type ear.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.400
If you've ever seen those
cute little fennec fox things,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.850
they have these big spiky ears,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.470
they look like a French bulldog,

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.480
although the fox version
version of the French bulldog.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.120
This big, tall ears,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.290
and they have excellent
sound localization.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.705
And so when people lean in with their ear,

00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:13.040
with their hand like this,
if you're listening to this,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.260
I'm just cupping my hand at my ear,

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.180
I'm giving myself a bigger pinna.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.190
And if I do it on the left
side, I can do this side.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.690
And if I really want to hear
something, I do it on both sides.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.350
So this isn't just gesturing,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.430
this actually serves a mechanical role.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.460
And actually, if you
want to hear where things

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.740
are coming from with a much
greater degree of accuracy,

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.980
this can actually help because
you're capturing sound waves

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.373
and funneling them better.

00:27:39.373 --> 00:27:41.633
It's really remarkable, this whole system.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.950
So you've got these two ears
and because of the differences

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.600
in the timing of when things
arrive in those two ears,

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.841
as well as these differences
in the frequencies

00:27:49.841 --> 00:27:52.920
that certain things sound,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.567
or I should say the
differences in the frequencies

00:27:55.567 --> 00:27:57.320
that arrive at your ears,

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.970
depending on whether or
not the thing is above you

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.640
or right in front of you or below you,

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.050
you're able to make out where things are

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.370
in space pretty well.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.170
So now you're probably starting to realize

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.650
that these two things
on the side of our head

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.760
that we call ears are there for a lot more

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.900
than hanging earrings on or
for other aesthetic purposes

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.660
or for putting sunglasses on top of.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.300
They are very powerful devices

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.183
for allowing us to capture sound
waves from our environment.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.660
Now I have a question for you,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.980
which is, can you move your ears?

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.520
It turns out that unlike other animals,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.950
humans are not terrifically
good at moving their ears.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.280
Other animals can move their
ears even independently.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.900
So Costello is pretty
good at raising his ears,

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.800
the two of them together,

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.350
He can't really move his ear separately.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.530
Some dogs can do that really well.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.790
In fact, sighthounds and some scenthounds

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.510
do that exquisitely well.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.480
Some animals like deer and other animals

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.110
that really have very acute hearing

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.990
will put one ear down to
a very particular angle

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.220
and will tilt the other one

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.570
and they will actually capture information

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:15.060
about two distant sound-making organisms,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.980
those could be hunters coming after them

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.650
or other animals coming after them.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.250
They are very good at doing this.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.470
We're not so good at it.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.990
But about 60% of people, it's thought,

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.560
can move their ears consciously

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.240
without having to touch their ear.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.710
So can you do that?

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.543
Maybe you should try it.

00:29:31.543 --> 00:29:32.980
Ask someone to look at you

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.480
and see whether or not you can do it.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.730
The typical distances
that people can move it

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.340
is usually no more than
two or three millimeters.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.537
It's subtle but can you flap your pinna

00:29:42.537 --> 00:29:45.770
with just using mental control?

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.084
If you can, or if you can't,

00:29:49.084 --> 00:29:52.120
try looking all the way to your right

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.123
or all the way to your left.

00:29:53.123 --> 00:29:54.960
Obviously, if you're driving a car

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.520
or doing something or exercising,

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.820
don't put yourself in danger right now.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.420
But if you move your eyes
all the way to your left,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.050
which I'm doing now or
all the way to my right,

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.149
you might feel a little bit of
a contraction of the muscles

00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:10.283
that control ear movement.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.590
Now I want to ask you this:
can you raise one eyebrow?

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.620
I'm not very good at it,
I can do a little bit,

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.080
but it's mostly by like cramping
down my face on one side.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.330
And I certainly can't
raise my right eyebrow.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.650
I can only do my left eyebrow.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.483
Trying to talk while I'm doing this,

00:30:25.483 --> 00:30:27.080
that's why it looks strange.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.263
People who can raise
one eyebrow very easily,

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.890
almost always, can move their ears

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.500
without having to touch them.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.540
It's controlled by the same motor pathway.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.480
And there does seem to be a small,

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.731
but statistically
significant sex difference

00:30:43.731 --> 00:30:47.220
in the ability to move one's ears.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.500
Typically, men can do
this more than women can,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.150
although plenty of women
can move their ears as well.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.970
Now, if you think that is all
a little strange or off topic,

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.009
it's not because what we're
really talking about here

00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:05.520
is a system of the brain,
but also of the body

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.440
of the musculature for
localizing things in space.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.260
And so you might find
it interesting to note

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.680
that one of the things
that we share very closely

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.980
with other primates,
with non-human primates,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.520
like macaque monkeys and chimpanzees,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.550
if you look at their ears,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.830
their ears are remarkably
similar to our ears,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.873
or rather our ears are
remarkably similar to their ears.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.670
The eyes of certain monkeys
like macaque monkeys

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.940
are remarkably similar to human eyes.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.150
This is one of the reasons why,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.120
if you look at a baby macaque monkey,

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.340
it has this unbelievably
human element to it.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.950
But the ears of these
primates is very similar

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.680
to our ears; our ears,
similar to their ears.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.220
If you're interested in ear movements

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.540
and what they could mean
and some of the things

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.340
that ear movements correlate
with in other aspects

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.030
of our biology, there's
a nice paper, actually,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.293
a scientific paper.

00:32:04.293 --> 00:32:07.970
The author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E,

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.650
it was published in 1995.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.050
I'll give a reference to that.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.510
It's a review article that discusses

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.950
some of the sex differences
in ear movement control,

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.960
as well as the relationship
between ear movements

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.200
and eye movements.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.880
And it's a pretty accessible paper.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.110
It's one that I think any
of you who are interested

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.050
in this topic could parse fairly easily.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.900
And there's some very
interesting underlying biology

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.240
and some theories as to why humans

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.350
would have this so-called vestigial

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.943
or ancient carry-over of a
system for moving our ears.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.040
Now, if ear movement seems strange,

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.258
next, I want to talk
about a different feature

00:32:45.258 --> 00:32:49.960
of your hearing and ears
that's even stranger,

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.663
but that has some really
interesting implications

00:32:52.663 --> 00:32:54.653
for your biology.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.133
And I'm guessing that
you've not heard of this.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.380
What am I about to describe

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.200
are called otoacoustic emissions.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.210
And otoacoustic emissions,
as the name suggests,

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.903
are sounds that your ears make.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:17.080
Believe it or not, 70%
of people make noises

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.410
with their ears, but they
don't actually detect them.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.870
Like I said, you've never heard of this.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.620
Okay, that's not what I mean.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.720
But what I do mean is
that 70% of people's ears

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.970
are making noise that's
cast out of the ear.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.870
And these otoacoustic emissions, actually,

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.410
can be detected by microphones.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.900
Sometimes they can be
detected by other people

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.520
in the room if they
have very good hearing.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.210
Now, it turns out that women
or, I should be technical here,

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.873
females who report
themselves as heterosexual,

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.700
have a higher frequency,
not frequency of sound,

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.880
but a higher frequency
of otoacoustic emissions

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.470
than do men who report
themselves as heterosexual.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.343
Women who report themselves
as homosexual or bisexual,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.593
make fewer otoacoustic emissions
than heterosexual women.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.660
These are data that come
from Dennis McFadden's lab

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.720
at the University of Texas, Austin.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.510
He actually discovered these,

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.510
what are called sexual
dimorphisms and differences

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.570
based on sexual orientation
without looking for them.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.010
He was studying hearing.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.050
He's a auditory scientist
and people were coming

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.230
into his laboratory
and they were detecting

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.430
these otoacoustic emissions.

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:35.070
And they started to notice
the group differences

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.300
in otoacoustic emissions.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.330
So they started asking
people about their sex

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.360
and about their sexual orientation.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.340
And these differences fell
out of the data, as we say.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.480
And it's interesting because
otoacoustic emissions

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.810
are not something that we associate

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.390
with sex or sexual dimorphism.

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:55.630
But what these data really
underscore is, first of all,

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.800
a lot of us are making
noises with our ears,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.450
some of us more than others.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:04.250
And that exposure to certain
combinations of hormones

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.520
during development are
very likely shaping the way

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.670
that our hearing apparati,
meaning the cochlea

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.590
and the pinna and all sorts of things,

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.440
how those develop and how those functions

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.660
throughout the lifespan.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:19.210
We did do an episode on
hormones and sexual development,

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.970
which gets much deeper
into the other effects

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.420
that hormones have on the
developing brain and body.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.239
If you want to check out that episode,

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:29.870
we will put a link to it in the captions.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.300
So now I want to shift to talking

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.860
about ways to leverage
your hearing system,

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.900
your auditory system so
that you can learn anything,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.950
not just auditory information,
but anything faster.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.960
I get a lot of questions about
so-called binaural beats.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.250
Binaural beats, as their name suggests,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.510
involve playing one
frequency of sound to one ear

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.230
and a different frequency
of sound to the other ear.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.230
So it might be doomed, doon,
doon, doon to your right ear,

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.640
and it might be to
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.050
to the left ear.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.860
And the idea is that the brain

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.952
will take those two frequencies of sound

00:36:08.952 --> 00:36:12.300
and because the pathways
that bring information

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.920
from the ears into the
brain, eventually crossover,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.640
they actually share that
information with both sides

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.939
of the brain, that the brain
will average that information

00:36:20.939 --> 00:36:25.050
and come up with this sort
of intermediate frequency.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.380
And the rationale is that
those intermediate frequencies

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.490
place the brain into a state
that is better for learning.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.700
And when I say better for learning,

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.660
I want to be precise about what I mean.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.592
That could mean more focus for encoding

00:36:39.592 --> 00:36:42.860
or bringing the information in.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.760
As you may have heard me say before,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.280
we have to be alert and
focused in order to learn.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.490
There is no passive learning

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.163
unless we're little tiny infants.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.810
So can binaural beats
make us more focused?

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.800
Can binaural beats allow us to
relax more if we're anxious?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.330
I know some people, they go to the dentist

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.400
and the dentist offers binaural beats

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.690
as they drill into your
teeth and give root canals

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.850
and things of that sort,
probably causing some anxiety

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.750
just describing those things right now.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.883
But those are available
in many dental practices.

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.520
Binaural beats have been
thought to increase creativity,

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.660
or at least they have been
proposed to increase creativity.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.370
So what does the scientific
data say about binaural beats?

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.140
There are a number of
different apps out there

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.020
that offer binaural beats.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.530
There are a number of different programs.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.197
I think you can also even
just find these on YouTube

00:37:31.197 --> 00:37:32.200
and on the internet.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.610
But typically, it's an
app and you'll program in

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.160
a particular outcome that you want:

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.440
more focused, more creative, fall asleep,

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.540
less anxious, et cetera.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.450
So what does the scientific data say?

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.100
So believe it or not, the
science on binaural beats

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.550
is actually quite
extensive and very precise.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.990
So sound waves are measured, typically,

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.530
in hertz or kilohertz.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.810
I know many of you aren't familiar

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.940
with thinking about things
in hertz or kilohertz.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.720
But again, just remember
those waves on a pond,

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.500
those ripples on a pond.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.470
If they're close together, then
they are of high-frequency.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.730
And if they're far apart, than
they are of low frequency.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.880
So when you hear more hertz,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.690
what you're essentially
hearing is higher frequency.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.350
And so if it's many more kilohertz

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.570
then it's much higher frequency

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.570
than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:23.250
And so you may have heard of
these things as delta waves

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.720
or theta waves or alpha waves
or beta waves, et cetera.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.350
Delta waves would be big,
slow waves, so low frequency.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.116
And, indeed, there is quality evidence

00:38:33.116 --> 00:38:36.110
from peer-reviewed studies
that are not sponsored

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.522
by companies that make binaural beat apps

00:38:38.522 --> 00:38:42.800
that tell us that delta
waves like one to four hertz,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.320
so very low frequency sounds,
think Costello's snoring,

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:51.090
can help in the transition to
sleep and for staying asleep.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.720
And that theta rhythms,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.060
which are more like four to eight hertz

00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.060
can bring the brain into
a state of subtle sleep

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.350
or meditation, so deeply
relaxed, but not fully asleep.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.850
And then you can sort of ascend

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.920
the staircase of findings
here, so to speak.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.900
And you'll find evidence that alpha waves,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.620
eight to 13 hertz can increase alertness

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.030
to a moderate level.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.390
That's a great state
for the brain to be in

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:20.282
for recall of existing information.

00:39:20.282 --> 00:39:22.881
And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz

00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:25.380
are great for bringing the brain

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.130
into focus states for sustained thought

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:31.690
or for incorporating new information

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.140
and especially gamma waves,
the highest frequency,

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.710
the most frequent ripples
of sound, so to speak,

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.640
32 to 100 hertz for learning
and problem-solving.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.210
Now, all of this matches, or I should say,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.790
maps onto what I've said before

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.580
about learning really nicely,

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.900
which is that you need to
be in a highly alert state

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.880
in order to bring new information in,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.480
in order to access a state of mind

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.060
in which you can tell
your brain or the brain

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.910
is telling itself, okay,
I need to learn this.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.101
This is why stress and
unfortunate circumstances

00:40:02.101 --> 00:40:04.500
are so memorable is because our brain gets

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.130
into a really high alert system.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.420
Here, we're talking about
the use of binaural beats

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.250
in order to increase
our level of alertness

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.180
or our level of calmness.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.843
Now that's important to
underscore because it's not

00:40:16.843 --> 00:40:19.050
that there's something
fundamentally important

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.810
about the binaural beats.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.430
They are yet another way
of bringing the brain

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.100
into states of deep relaxation

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.880
through low frequency sound
or highly alert states

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.490
for focused learning with
more high-frequency sound.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.790
So they are effective and
I'll review a little bit

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.070
of the data in detail, they're effective,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.960
but it's not that they're
uniquely special for learning.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.220
It's just that they can
help some people bring

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.860
their brain into the state that
allows them to learn better.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.080
So there are a lot of studies
that allowed us to arrive,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.770
or I should say allowed
the field to arrive

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:01.690
on these parameters of slow, slow,

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.930
low frequency waves are going to
bring you into relaxed states,

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.883
high frequency waves
into more alert states.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:11.660
There's very good evidence
for anxiety reduction

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.310
from the use of binaural beats.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.700
And what's interesting is
anxiety reduction seems

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.010
to be most effective
when the binaural beats

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.320
are bringing the brain into delta,

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.290
so those slow big waves like
sleep, theta and alpha states.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.330
And I'll link to a couple of these studies

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:36.060
although I will probably
link more to the list

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.060
that really segregates them out one by one

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.601
so you can see them all
next to one another.

00:41:39.601 --> 00:41:41.600
There's good evidence that binaural beats

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.890
can be used to treat pain, chronic pain.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.680
There's three studies in
peer-reviewed journals

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.620
which I took a look at, and
they seem to be of good quality,

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.560
not sponsored research, as we say,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.000
not paid for by any specific company.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.170
Binaural beats have been shown

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.090
to modestly improve cognition,

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.720
attention, working memory
and even creativity.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.050
But the real boost from
binaural beats appears

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:11.030
to be for anxiety reduction
and pain reduction.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.720
Some people might find these beneficial

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.633
for these oral surgeries, right?

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.470
Believe it or not, there are people

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:21.810
who would rather have
the entire root canal

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.260
or cavity drilled without Novocaine.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.560
And that's because they
sometimes have a syringe phobia

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.393
or something of that sort

00:42:28.393 --> 00:42:30.170
or they just don't like being
numb from the Novocaine,

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.130
or maybe there's an
underlying medical reason.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.630
But I think most people
do don't enjoy getting

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.680
their teeth drilled even if
they have Novocaine in there

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.890
or a root canal.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.540
And so it seems that binaural
beats can be effective

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.720
in that environment.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.650
And you don't have to go

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.040
into that sort of extreme environment

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.420
to benefit from binaural beats.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:50.420
Binaural beats are a either
relatively inexpensive thing

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.760
to access, most of the apps
are pretty inexpensive.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.520
I don't have a favorite binaural beats app

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.710
to recommend to you.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.170
I confess I did use binaural
beats a few years ago.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:04.070
I shifted over to other what I call NSDR,

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.550
non-sleep deep rest
protocols in favor of those,

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.630
but many people like binaural beats

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.750
and say that they benefit from them,

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.490
especially while studying or learning.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.120
I think part of the
reason for that relates

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.380
to the ability to channel our focus

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.370
when we have some background noise.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.170
And this is something I
also get asked about a lot.

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.863
Is it better to listen to
music and have background noise

00:43:26.863 --> 00:43:29.850
when studying or is it better
to have complete silence?

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.420
Well, there's actually
a quite good literature

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.240
on this as well, but not
so much as it relates

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.930
to binaural beats, but
rather whether or not people

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:42.490
are listening to music, so-called
white noise, brown noise;

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:43.610
believe it or not, there's white noise

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.120
and there's brown noise,
there's even pink noise

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.160
and how that impacts brain states

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.350
that allow us to learn
information better or not.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.150
So now I'd like to talk about white noise

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.010
and I want to be very
clear that white noise

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.520
has been shown to really enhance
brain states for learning

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.500
in certain individuals,
in particular, in adults.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.520
But white noise actually can
have a detrimental effect

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.070
on auditory learning and
maybe even the development

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.920
of the auditory system
in very young children

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.980
in particular in infants.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.070
So first I'd like to talk

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:22.424
about the beneficial effects
of white noise on learning.

00:44:22.424 --> 00:44:25.490
There are some really
excellent studies on this.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:26.500
The first one that I'd like

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.340
to just highlight is one that's entitled:

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.830
Low Intensity White Noise
Improves Performance

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:36.010
in Auditory Working Memory
Task, an fMRI Study.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.550
This is a study that explored

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:43.030
whether or not learning could be enhanced

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.113
by playing white noise in the background.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.900
But the strength of the
study is that they looked

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.447
at some of the underlying neural circuitry

00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:52.340
and the activation of the neural circuitry

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.410
in these people as they
did the learning task.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.810
And what it, essentially, illustrates

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.290
is that white noise,
provided that white noise

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.566
is of low enough intensity,
meaning not super loud,

00:45:04.566 --> 00:45:09.140
not imperceptible, so not so
quiet that you can't hear it,

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.780
but not super loud either,

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.770
it actually could enhance
learning to a significant degree.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.000
And this has been shown now

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.153
for a huge number of
different types of learning.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.180
There's a terrific article as well

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.930
in a somewhat obscure journal, at least,

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:24.910
obscure to me, which is:

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:27.480
The Effects of Noise Exposure
on Cognitive Performance

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.293
and Brain Activity Patterns.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.683
That's a study involving 54 subjects.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.430
They, basically, were
evaluated for mental workload

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.730
and attention under different
levels of noise exposure,

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.480
background noise and
different, essentially,

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.590
loudness of noise.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.790
And the reason I like this
study is that they looked

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.506
at different levels of
noise and types of noise,

00:45:47.506 --> 00:45:50.480
and they varied a number
of different things,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.810
as opposed to just doing a two-condition,

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.280
either white noise or no
white noise type thing.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.850
And what they found, again, is
that provided the white noise

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.730
is not extremely loud,

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.960
it could really enhance brain function

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.550
for sake of learning any number

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.463
of different kinds of information.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.664
Now that's all great, but
it really doesn't get to

00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:12.930
the deeper guts of mechanism.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.150
And as a neuroscientist,
what I really want to see

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.910
is not just that something has an effect.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:17.743
That's always nice.

00:46:17.743 --> 00:46:20.370
It's always nice to see in
a nice peer-reviewed study

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.390
without any kind of commercial biases

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.300
that there's an effect, binaural
beats can enhance learning

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.510
or listening to white noise, not too loud

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.970
can enhance learning.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.610
But you really want to
understand mechanism

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.810
because once you understand mechanism,

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:36.340
not only does it start to make sense,

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.927
but you can also imagine ways in which

00:46:37.927 --> 00:46:40.710
you could develop better
tools and protocols.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.540
So I was very relieved to find,

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.230
or I should say excited to
find this study published

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.500
in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.240
this is a 2014 paper, White
Noise Improves Learning

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.410
by Modulating Activity in
Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions

00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:59.670
and Right Superior Temporal Sulcus.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:00.540
Now I don't expect you to know

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.039
what the right spirit temporal sulcus is.

00:47:02.039 --> 00:47:03.530
I don't expect you to know

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.330
what the dopamine midbrain
region is, but if you're like me,

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.770
you probably took highlighted notice

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.260
of the word dopaminergic.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.770
Dopamine is a neuromodulator,
meaning it's a chemical

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:16.470
that's released in our brain and body,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:20.160
but mostly in our brain that modulates,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.150
meaning controls the likelihood

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.830
that certain brain areas will be active

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.530
and other brain areas won't be active.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.770
And dopamine is associated
with motivation.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.550
Dopamine is associated with craving.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.840
Motivation is associated with
all sorts of different things,

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.260
including movement but what
this study so nicely shows

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:42.250
is that white noise can really enhance

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.970
the activity of neurons in what's called

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:45.850
the substantia nigra VTA.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.270
The substantia nigra VTA is a
very rich source of dopamine

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.670
and that's because it's
very chockablock full

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.540
of dopamine neurons.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.180
It's an area of the
brain that is, perhaps,

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.310
the richest source of dopamine neurons.

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.780
And you actually can see this brain region

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.530
under the microscope if
you take a slice of brain

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.240
or you look at a brain
without even staining it

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.490
for any proteins or dopamine or anything.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:14.740
It's two very dark regions
at the bottom of the brain.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.540
And the reason it's
called substantia nigra,

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.280
nigra meaning dark is
because the dopamine neurons

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.750
actually make something that
makes those neurons dark.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.713
And so you've got these
two regions down there,

00:48:27.713 --> 00:48:30.600
that contain dopamine
and can release dopamine

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.000
and, essentially, activate
other brain regions

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.720
and activate our sense of motivation

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.740
and activate our sense of desire

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.040
to continue focusing and learning.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.490
But you can't just snap your fingers

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.520
and make them release dopamine.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.980
You actually have to trigger
dopamine release from them.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.020
Now that trigger can be
caused by being very excited

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.830
about something or the fact
that that thing gave you

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.190
a lot of pleasure in the past,

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:55.200
or you're highly motivated
by fear or desire.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.630
But what's so interesting
to me is that it appears

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:03.430
that white noise itself can
raise what we call the basal,

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.580
the baseline levels of dopamine
that are being released

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.320
from this area, the substantia nigra.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.030
So now we're starting to
get a more full picture

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.700
of how particular sounds
in our environment

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.300
can increase learning.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.460
And that's, in part, I believe,

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.750
through the release of
dopamine from substantia nigra.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.260
So I'm not trying to shift
you away from binaural beats,

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.860
if that's your thing, but it does appear

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.890
that turning on white noise
at a low level, not too loud.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.130
You may say, "Well, how loud?"

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:36.180
And I'll tell you in a moment,

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.390
but not too loud can
allow you to learn better

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.310
because of the ways that it's modulating

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:42.690
your brain chemistry.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:46.628
So how loud or how soft
should that white noise be

00:49:46.628 --> 00:49:48.053
while you learn?

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.490
Well, in these studies,
it seemed that white noise

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.350
that could be heard by the person,

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:55.870
so it wasn't imperceptible to them,

00:49:55.870 --> 00:50:00.870
so it was loud enough that they
could hear, but not so loud

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:05.800
that they felt it was intrusive
or irritating to them.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.680
So that's going to differ
from person to person

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.130
because people have different levels

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:10.900
of auditory sensitivity.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.300
It's going to depend
on age, going to depend

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.840
on a number of different factors.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.281
So I can't tell you turn to level two

00:50:16.281 --> 00:50:17.950
on your volume controller.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:18.783
That's just not going to work.

00:50:18.783 --> 00:50:20.110
Also, I don't know how far you are

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.630
from a given speaker in the room

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.470
or if you've got earphones in your head

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:26.110
or you've got speakers in the room

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.810
or if it's coming out of your computer.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:29.000
I don't know those things.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.350
So what you're going
to have to do is adjust

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.240
that white noise to the place

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.110
where it's not interfering
with your ability to focus,

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.840
but rather it's enhancing
your ability to focus.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.070
I think a good rule of thumb
is going to be to put it

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:46.110
probably on the lower third
of any kind of volume dial,

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:49.210
as opposed to in the upper third,

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.520
where it would really be blasting.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.870
And really blasting any
noise, frankly, is not good,

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:59.650
but that's especially not good,
meaning it's especially bad

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:01.480
if you have headphones in.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.500
I do want to mention
something about headphones

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.040
before I talk about white noise
in the developmental context

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.740
and why it can be dangerous there.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:12.483
When you put headphones in your ears,

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:17.770
it has this incredible
effect of making the sounds

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:19.730
like they come from inside your head,

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.710
not from out in the room.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.760
And now that might seem
like kind of a duh,

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.900
but that's actually really amazing, right?

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.770
Your brain assumes that the sounds

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:30.140
are coming from inside your head,

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.640
as opposed from the environment

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.630
that you're in the moment
you put headphones in.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:34.980
So if you're listening to an audiobook

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.290
or maybe you're listening to
this podcast with headphones,

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:39.140
that's very different
than when you're listening

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.680
to something out in the room
and there are other sounds,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.240
other sound waves, especially if you use

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.220
these noise-cancellation headphones.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:49.550
So if you're going to use
white noise to enhance studying

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.360
or learning of any
kind, this also could be

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.780
for skill-learning, motor skill-learning

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.800
while you're exercising,
my suggestion would be

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.310
that if you're using headphones,
to keep it quite low.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:03.420
This is an effect on the
midbrain dopamine neurons

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.160
that's a background effect of raising

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.730
the baseline of dopamine release.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.910
The way that dopamine neurons
fires, they're always firing;

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:10.720
yours are firing right now, so are mine,

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.020
when something exciting
happens, they fire a lot.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.410
And when something disappointing happens,

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.340
that firing, the release of dopamine

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.010
goes down below baseline.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:19.600
What you're talking about here is raising

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.660
your overall levels of
attention and motivation,

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.480
which translate to better learning

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.330
by just tickling those
neurons a little bit,

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.943
raising the baseline firing.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.200
You're not turning up the white noise

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.100
to the point where you're feeling amazing.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.100
This isn't like turning
on your favorite song.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.830
This is actually the opposite.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:39.023
This is about getting that
baseline up just a bit.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.460
So I recommend turning
the volume up just a bit

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.780
so that you can focus entirely on the task

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:47.613
that you're trying to do.

00:52:47.613 --> 00:52:49.290
And, of course, you've
turned on white noise

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:50.900
so your attention might
drift to that for a moment.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.870
Is it too loud? Is it too soft?

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:55.330
If you can disappear into
the work, so to speak,

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.180
if your attention can
disappear into the work,

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.310
then that's probably sufficiently quiet.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.330
And for those of you that say,

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:02.600
well, I like really loud music

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.430
and if I just blast the music,

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:06.860
then I forget about the music.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.580
I don't suggest blasting music.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.570
And this is coming from somebody

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.250
who really likes loud music.

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:14.670
I grew up with kind of a
loud fast rules mentality,

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:17.430
and if you don't know what
loud fast rules means,

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:22.080
then I can't help you, but
there's a time and a place,

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.670
perhaps, to listen to music loud

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.630
but, especially, with headphones,

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:30.030
you can trigger, excuse me,
hearing loss quite rapidly.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.210
And unfortunately,
because these hair cells

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.170
that we talked about earlier,

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.140
our central nervous system
neurons, they do not regenerate,

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.030
they do not come back.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.963
Now along the lines of hearing loss,

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.220
I should just say that the best way

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.220
to blow out your hearing for good,

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.900
to eliminate your hearing
is to have very loud sounds

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.890
super imposed on a loud environment.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.430
So loud environments can
cause hearing loss over time.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:00.330
So if you work at a construction
site, clanging really loud,

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:03.730
or if you work the sound
board in a club or something,

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:05.760
you are headed towards hearing loss

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.630
unless you protect your hearing

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:09.698
with earplugs and headphones.

00:54:09.698 --> 00:54:12.840
Nowadays, some of the ear
plugs are very low profile,

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.890
meaning you can't see them.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.160
So that's kind of nice,
so you're not like the,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.990
when I was younger, like you
didn't want to be the dork

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.410
to go to the concert with the earplugs,

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.980
but it turns out those dorks were smarter

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.240
than everybody else,
because they're not the ones

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.450
who are craning their neck to
try and hear trivial things

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:32.490
at the age of 30 or so 'cause
they blew out their hearing.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.380
So if you are working
in a loud environment

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:38.690
or you expose yourselves
to a loud environment,

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:42.020
you really want to avoid big inflections

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.400
in sound above that.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.240
So loud environment plus fireworks,

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.190
loud environment plus gunshot,

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:53.137
loud environments plus very
high-frequency intense sound,

00:54:53.137 --> 00:54:55.433
that's what we call the two-hit model,

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:57.840
this is also true for concussion,

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.490
that you can take a stimulus that normally

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.080
would be below the threshold of injury,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.180
you add another stimulus at the same time,

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.840
that would be below the
threshold of injury.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.840
And then, suddenly,
you killed the neurons.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.610
So I don't want to make people paranoid,

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:11.880
but you do want to protect your hearing.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.640
It's no fun to lose your hearing.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.760
If you're going to use
headphones and you feel

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.100
like you want to crank it up all the way,

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.780
just remember that the
more that you can get

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.830
out of a lower volume, meaning the longer

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.690
that you can go listening
to things at lower volume,

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:30.180
the longer you'll be able to
hear that music or that thing.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.880
So again, I'm not the hearing cop.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.790
That's not my job, but
as somebody who's lost

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:38.700
some of his high-frequency hearing,

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.893
I can tell you it's not a pleasure.

00:55:42.067 --> 00:55:45.123
The old argument that it
helps you not have to hear

00:55:45.123 --> 00:55:47.320
or listen to people that
you don't want to listen to,

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.380
that does it doesn't really work.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.420
They just send you text messages instead.

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:54.000
So what about white noise and
hearing loss in development?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.380
I know a lot of people with children

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.680
have these noise machines like sound waves

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.000
and things like that,
that help the kids sleep.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.670
And look, I think kids getting good sleep

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.530
and parents getting good sleep is vital

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:08.990
to physical and mental
health and family health.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:13.930
So I certainly sympathize
with those needs.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:17.040
However, there are data that indicate

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.820
that white noise during development

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.440
can be detrimental to the auditory system.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.740
I don't want to frighten any parents

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.530
if you played white noise to your kids,

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.090
this doesn't mean that
their auditory system

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.790
or their speech patterns
are going to be disrupted

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:31.150
or that their interpretation of speech

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:32.930
is going to be disrupted forever.

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:37.077
But there are data published
in the journal, Science,

00:56:37.077 --> 00:56:39.610
and Science being one of
the three, APEX Journal,

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.423
Science, Nature, Cell, the
most stringent journals,

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.210
data published in the journal,
Science, some years ago,

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:48.330
actually by a scientist
who I know quite well,

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.860
his name is Edward Chang,
he's a medical doctor now,

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.270
he's a neurosurgeon, he's actually

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:55.140
the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.870
and he runs a laboratory where
they study auditory learning,

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:03.120
neuroplasticity, et cetera,
he and his mentor at the time,

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.190
Mike Merzenich published a paper showing

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:10.490
that if young animals and
this was in animal models

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:15.020
were exposed to white noise, so [shushing]

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.726
the very type of noise that
I'm saying as a older person,

00:57:18.726 --> 00:57:20.980
and when I say older,
I mean, somebody who's

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.140
in their late teens, early 20s and older

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.930
could benefit from listening
to that at a low level

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:28.202
in the background for sake of learning,

00:57:28.202 --> 00:57:31.642
well, they exposed very young
animals to this white noise,

00:57:31.642 --> 00:57:36.630
it actually disrupted the
maps of the auditory world

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:37.463
within the brain.

00:57:37.463 --> 00:57:39.280
And we haven't talked
about these maps yet,

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.710
but I want to take a
moment and talk about them

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:44.050
and explain this effect and
what it might mean for you

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:45.580
if you have kids or if you were exposed

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.660
to a lot of white noise early on.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.660
So auditory information goes
up into our cortex, into these,

00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:55.790
essentially, the outside
portion of our brain

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:59.550
that's responsible for all
our higher level cognition

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.840
and our planning, our
decision-making, et cetera,

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.720
creativity and up there,

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.970
we have what are called tonotopic maps.

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:08.430
What's a tonotopic map?

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.770
Well, remember the
cochlea, how it's coiled

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:12.517
and at one end, it responds
to high frequencies

00:58:12.517 --> 00:58:15.770
and the other end, it
responds to low frequencies?

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.780
Like a piano, the keys sound different

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.000
as you extend down and up the piano keys.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.720
And it's organized in
a very systematic way.

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.264
It's not all intermixed high frequencies

00:58:25.264 --> 00:58:26.300
and low frequencies.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.070
It's organized in a very systematic way

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.730
from one end to the other.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:33.660
Your visual system is in,
what's called a retinotopic map.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.880
So neighboring points in
space off to my right,

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.940
like my two fingers off to my right

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:43.030
are mapped to neighboring
points in space in my brain.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.440
And that space right in front of me

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.200
is mapped to a different
location in my brain,

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.980
but it's systematic, it's regular.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.080
It's not random. It's not salt and pepper.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:55.000
It goes from high to low or
from right to center to left.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.110
In the auditory system,

00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.500
we have what are called tonotopic maps,

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.360
where frequency, high
frequency to low frequency

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.270
and everything in between is organized

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.370
in a very systematic way.

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.950
Now our experience of life from the time

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.680
we're a baby until the time
that we die is not systematic.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.846
We don't hear low frequencies
at one part of the room

00:59:14.846 --> 00:59:16.810
or at one part of the
day and high frequencies

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.870
is another part of the room
and other part of the day,

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.420
they're all intermixed.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.520
But if you remember, the
cochlea separates them out.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.580
Just like a prism of light separates out

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:26.780
the different wavelengths of light,

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.020
the cochlea separates out
the different frequencies.

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.770
And the developing brain takes

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:37.040
those separated out frequencies
and learns this relationship

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.913
between itself, meaning the
child and the outside world.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:48.460
White noise, essentially contains
no tonotopic information.

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:51.300
The frequencies are all intermixed.

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.870
It's just noise.

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:55.450
Whereas when I speak, my voice has,

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:57.410
now I'm getting technical,
but it has what's called

00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.140
a certain envelope, meaning
it has some low frequencies

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.973
and some slightly higher frequency.

01:00:00.973 --> 01:00:02.800
Like I might a voice higher,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.090
although I'm not very good at that.

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:07.220
My voice starts to crack and
I can make my voice lower,

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.900
although not as low as Costello's snore.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.453
So it has an envelope, it has a container.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.040
White noise has no container.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.440
It's like all the colors of the
rainbow spread out together,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.900
which is actually what you
get when you get white light

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.440
white noise is analogous to white light.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.440
So one of the reasons why
hearing a lot of white noise

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.900
during development for
long periods of time can be

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.410
detrimental to the development
of the auditory system

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:37.180
is that these tonotopic
maps don't form normally;

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.070
at least, they don't in
experimental animals.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:41.900
Now, the reason I'm raising this

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.860
is that many people I know, in particular,

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.367
friends who have small children, they say,

01:00:46.367 --> 01:00:51.367
"I want to use a white
noise machine while I sleep.

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:56.210
But is it okay for my baby to
use a white noise machine?"

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:59.780
And I consulted with various
people, scientists about this.

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.320
And they said, "Well,
the baby is also hearing

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.141
the parent's voices and is hearing music

01:01:05.141 --> 01:01:06.530
and it's hearing the dog bark.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.350
So it's not the only
thing they're hearing."

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:12.737
However, every single person
that I consulted with said,

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:15.850
"But there's neuroplasticity during sleep.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.700
That's when the kid is sleeping.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.510
And I don't know that you'd
want to expose a child

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.600
to white noise the entire night,

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.150
because it might degrade
that tonotopic map."

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.640
It might not destroy it.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.910
It might not eliminate it,

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:32.040
but it could make it a little less clear,

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.627
like taking the keys on the piano

01:01:34.627 --> 01:01:37.400
and taping a few of them together, right?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.980
So you still got the highs and
lows in the appropriate order

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.110
and everything in between.

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:42.750
But when you take the keys together,

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.360
you don't get the same fidelity.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.950
You don't get the same
precision of the noise

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:49.926
that comes out of that piano.

01:01:49.926 --> 01:01:52.960
So, again, I don't want to scare anybody,

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.630
but I would say if you are in a position

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:57.630
to make the choice of
either using white noise

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:00.310
or something similar, pink
noise is just a variation.

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.300
It's got a little bit more
of a certain frequency,

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.220
just like pink light has a little bit more

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.270
of a certain wavelength than white light.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.060
If you are in a position to make choices

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.890
about things, to put in a young,

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:16.430
especially very young
child's sleeping environment,

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.720
white noise might be something
to consider avoiding.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.240
Again, I'm not telling you what to do,

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.770
but it's something to
perhaps consider avoiding.

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.430
I don't think most pediatricians

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.340
are going to be aware of these data,

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.250
but if you talk to any
auditory physiologists

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:31.990
or an audiologist or somebody

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:34.330
who studies auditory development,

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:37.240
I'm fairly certain that they
would have opinions about that.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.480
Now, whether or not their
opinions agree with mine

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.870
and these folks that I
consulted with or not

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:42.703
is a separate matter.

01:02:42.703 --> 01:02:45.000
I don't know, cause I don't know them,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.320
but it's something that I
felt was important enough

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.490
to cue you to, especially
since I've highlighted,

01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:54.110
excuse me, the opposite
effect is true in adulthood.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.500
Once your auditory system has formed,

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.680
once it's established
these tonotopic maps,

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.200
then the presence of
background white noise

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.760
should not be a problem at all.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.280
In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.330
because you're also not attending to it.

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:09.500
The idea is that it's playing
at a low enough volume

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.120
that you forget it in the background

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.680
and that it's supporting learning

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.230
by bringing your brain into a
heightened state of alertness

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.970
and, especially, this
heightened state of dopamine,

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.830
dopaminergic activation of the brain,

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.390
which will make it easier to learn faster

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.720
and easier to learn the information.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.380
So now I want to talk
about auditory learning

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.030
and actually how you can get better

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.980
at learning information that you hear,

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.890
not just information
that you see on a page

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:35.960
or motor skill learning.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.590
There are a lot of reasons
to want to do this.

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:40.270
A lot of classroom teaching,
whether or not it's by Zoom

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:42.990
or in-person is auditory in nature.

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:47.120
Not everything is necessarily
written down for us.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.120
It's also good to get better
at listening or so I'm told.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.990
So there's a phenomenon called
the cocktail party effect.

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:58.100
Now, even if you've never
been to a cocktail party,

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.451
you've experienced and participated

01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:02.930
in what's called the
cocktail party effect.

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:04.840
The cocktail party effect is where you are

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.130
in an environment that's rich with sound,

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:09.780
many sound waves coming
from many different sources,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.613
many different things,

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:13.260
so in a city, in a classroom,

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.523
in a car that contains people
having various conversations,

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:22.070
you somehow need to be able to
attend to specific components

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:23.450
of those sound waves, meaning you need

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:25.670
to hear certain people and not others.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:27.970
The reason it's called
the cocktail party effect

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:31.195
is that you and meaning your brain

01:04:31.195 --> 01:04:35.590
are exquisitely good at creating

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.660
a cone of auditory attention,

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.980
a narrow band of attention
with which you can extract

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.810
the information you care about

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:46.113
and wipe away or erase all the rest.

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:50.400
Now this takes work, it takes attention.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.400
One of the reasons why
you might come home from

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.000
a loud gathering, maybe
a stadium, a sports event

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.840
or a cocktail party, for that matter,

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.600
and feel just exhausted is
because if you were listening

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.520
to conversations there or trying to listen

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.460
to those conversations
while watching the game

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.160
and people moving past you
and hearing all this noise,

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.560
clinking of glasses, et cetera,

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.480
it takes attentional effort
and the brain uses up

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.560
a lot of energy just at rest,

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.970
but it uses up even more energy

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:22.200
when you are paying strong
attention to something,

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.080
literally caloric energy
burning up things like glucose,

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.690
et cetera, even if you're
ketogenic, it's burning up energy.

01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:32.700
So the cocktail party effect
has been studied extensively

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.870
in the field of
neuroscience and we now know

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.100
at a mechanistic level,
how one accomplishes

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.780
this feat of attending to certain sounds,

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.510
despite the fact that
we are being bombarded

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:45.410
with all sorts of other sounds.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:46.900
So there are a couple
ways that we do this.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.900
First of all, much as
with our visual system,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
we can expand or contract
our visual field of view,

01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:59.610
so we can go from panoramic vision,

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:03.360
see the entire scene that we
are in by dilating our gaze,

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.900
talked a lot about this on
this podcast and elsewhere.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.560
We can, for instance, keep
our head and eyes stationary

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.610
or mostly stationary, you don't
have to be rigid about it,

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:12.010
and you can expand your field of view

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.240
so you can see the walls
and ceiling and floor,

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.413
can see yourself in the
environment, that's panoramic view.

01:06:16.413 --> 01:06:18.920
It's what you would accomplish
without having to try at all

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.910
if you went to a horizon, for instance,

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.550
or we can contract our field of view,

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.423
I can bring my focus to
a particular location,

01:06:26.423 --> 01:06:28.610
what we call a vergence point,
directly in front of me.

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.740
Now I'm pointing at the camera
directly in front of me.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.240
We can do that, we can expand and contract

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.260
our visual field of view.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:39.260
Well, we can expand and contract
our auditory field of view,

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.140
so to speak, our auditory window.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.430
You can try this next time
you are in an environment

01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:49.500
that's rich with noise, meaning
lots of different sounds.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.500
You can just tune out all the
noise to a background chatter.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:59.310
You try not focus on
any one particular sound

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:02.890
and you get the background
chatter of noise.

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:05.070
And you'll find that it's
actually very relaxing

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:06.890
in comparison to trying
to listen to somebody

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.610
at a cocktail party or
shouting back and forth.

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.610
Now, if you're very, very
interested in that person,

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:13.970
or getting to know them better
or what they're telling you,

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:15.470
or some combination of those things,

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:17.470
then you'll be very motivated to do it

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.670
but nonetheless, it requires energy

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:21.273
and effort and attention.

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:23.300
How do we do this?

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.090
Well, it's actually quite simple

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.650
or, at least, it's simple, in essence,

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:32.780
although the underlying
mechanisms are complex.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.930
Here, I have to credit the laboratory

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:39.610
of a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R,

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:42.080
up at the University of
Oregon who essentially

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.930
figured out that we are able to accomplish

01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:48.500
this extraction of particular sounds.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.180
We can really hear one person
or a small number of people

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.870
amidst a huge background of chatter

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:59.870
because we pay attention
to the onset of words,

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:03.020
but also to the offset of words.

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:07.070
Now, the way to visualize this
is if the background noise

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.950
is just like a bunch of waves of noise,

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:11.370
it's literally just sound
waves coming every frequency,

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:13.750
low frequency, high frequency,
glasses clinking together.

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.240
If you've got a game, people are shouting,

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.120
people are talking on their phone,

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.270
there's the crack of the ball,

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:21.943
if somebody actually
manages to hit the ball,

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.400
the announcer, et cetera,

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.340
but whatever we were paying attention to,

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.862
we set up a cone of auditory attention,

01:08:29.862 --> 01:08:33.470
a tunnel of auditory attention,
where we are listening

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:34.960
although we don't realize
it, we are listening

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.110
for the onset and the
offset of those words.

01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:41.710
Now this is powerful
for a couple of reasons.

01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:46.710
First of all, it's a call
to arms, so to speak,

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.550
to disengage your auditory system

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:52.450
when you don't need to
focus your attention

01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:53.870
on something particular.

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:56.050
So if you are somebody,
you're coming home from work,

01:08:56.050 --> 01:09:00.230
you've had a very long day
and you're trying to make out

01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:03.440
a particular conversation
on background noise,

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.420
you might consider just not
having that conversation,

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.460
just letting your auditory
landscape be very broad,

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.913
almost like panoramic vision.

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:17.100
If you're trying to learn how
to extract sound information,

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.100
it could be notes of music,
it could be scales of music,

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.830
it could be words spoken by somebody else,

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:27.530
maybe somebody is telling
you what you need to say

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.290
for a particular speech or the information

01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:32.600
that you need to learn
for a particular topic,

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.100
and they're telling it to you,

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.652
deliberately paying
attention both to the onset

01:09:37.652 --> 01:09:41.350
and to the offset of those
words can be beneficial

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:45.320
because it is exactly the way
that the auditory system likes

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.260
to bring in information.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.500
So one of the more common phenomenon

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.701
that I think we all experience
is you go to a party

01:09:53.701 --> 01:09:56.210
or you meet somebody new and you say hi,

01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:57.400
I would say, "Hi, I'm Andrew."

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.797
And they'd say, "Hi,
I'm Jeff," for instance.

01:09:59.797 --> 01:10:00.630
"Great to meet you."

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.960
And then a minute later, I
can't remember the guy's name.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.690
Now, is it because I don't
care what his name is?

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:08.130
No, somehow the presence

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:10.290
of other auditory information interfered.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:12.780
It's not that my mind was
necessarily someplace else.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:17.540
It's that the signal-to-noise
as we say wasn't high enough.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:22.490
Somehow the way he said it or
the way it landed on my ears,

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:24.236
which is really all that matters,

01:10:24.236 --> 01:10:28.680
when it comes down to
learning, is such that

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.650
it just didn't achieve high
enough signal-to-noise.

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.990
The noise was too high
or the signal was too low

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:35.880
or some combination of those.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.490
So the next time you ask somebody's name,

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:40.120
remember listen to the
onset of what they say

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:40.953
and the offset.

01:10:40.953 --> 01:10:43.990
So it would be paying
attention to the j in Jeff

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.980
and it would be paying
attention to that in f in F,

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.233
in Jeff, excuse me.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.160
And chances are, you'll be
able to remember that name.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.440
Now, I don't know if people
who are super learners

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.410
of names do this naturally or not.

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:01.030
I don't have access to their brains.

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.210
I don't think they're
going to give me access

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.530
to their brains either.

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:07.100
But it's a very interesting
way to take the natural biology

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.160
of auditory attention and
learning and apply it to scenarios

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.645
where you're trying to
remember either people's names

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:14.570
or specific information.

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:17.630
Now, I do acknowledge that
trying to learn every word

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:19.530
in a sentence by paying attention

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:23.050
to its onset and offset
could actually be disruptive

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:24.830
to the learning process.

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:27.380
So this would be more
for specific attention,

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.560
like you're asking directions
in a city and somebody says,

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.270
okay, you say you're
lost and they say, okay,

01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:34.580
you're going to go two blocks down,

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:35.870
you're going to turn left.

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:37.860
And then you're going to see
a landmark on your right.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.860
And then you're going to go in
the third door on your left.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.450
That's a lot of information,
at least, for me.

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.820
So the way you would
want to listen to that

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.310
is you're going to go down the road.

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:51.433
See, I already forgot.

01:11:52.334 --> 01:11:54.870
You're going to go left and
you're just going to program

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:56.240
and instead of just hearing the word left,

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.920
you're going to think the L at
the front of left and the T.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.723
You're going to left, okay.

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:05.090
So you're coding in specific words.

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:07.810
And what this does is this hijacks

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:10.110
these naturally-occurring
attention mechanisms

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.550
that the auditory system likes to use.

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:15.500
So a little bit of data
that for auditory encoding,

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.690
this kind of thing can be beneficial.

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:20.610
There are a lot of data that attention

01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:23.700
for auditory coding is beneficial.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.700
There are a little bit of data showing

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.020
that deliberately encoding
auditory information this way,

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.800
meaning trying to learn
auditory information this way

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.590
can be beneficial or
can accelerate learning.

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:39.030
And some of these features
of what I'm describing here,

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:43.630
map onto some of the work that
of Mike Merzenich and others

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:46.550
that have been designed
to try and overcome things

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:49.800
like stutter and to treat various forms

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.220
of auditory learning disorders.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.640
But more importantly,
and perhaps more powerful

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.560
is the work of Mike
Merzenich that was done

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.860
with his then graduate
student, Gregg Recanzone

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.740
that showed that, using
the attentional system,

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.400
we can actually learn much faster

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.710
and we can actually
activate neuroplasticity

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:16.040
in the adult brain, something
that's very challenging to do.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.500
And that the auditory system
is one of the main ways

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.620
in which we can access
neuroplasticity more broadly.

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.160
So I just want to take a couple of minutes

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.390
and describe the work of
Recanzone and Merzenich,

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:30.550
because it's absolutely
fantastic and fascinating.

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:34.360
What they did is they had subjects try

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.980
to learn auditory information,

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.060
except that they told
them to pay attention

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.440
to particular frequencies.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.790
So now you know what frequencies are

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:47.463
so, essentially, high-pitched
sounds or low-pitched sounds.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:52.340
What they found was
just passively listening

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.220
to a bunch of stuff does not
allow the brain to change

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.960
and for that stuff to
be remembered at all.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.970
That's not a surprise.

01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:02.660
We've all experienced the phenomenon

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.660
of having someone talk and
we see their mouth moving

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:05.869
and we're like, yeah,
this is really important,

01:14:05.869 --> 01:14:06.710
this is really important.

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.040
We're listening. We're trying to listen.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.320
And then they walk away and we think

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.370
I didn't get any of that.

01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:13.380
And you wonder whether or not it was them,

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.080
maybe this is happening to you right now.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.750
You wonder whether or not it was you,

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.770
you wonder whether or not you
have trouble with learning

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:21.270
or you have attention deficit.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.210
It could be any number
of different things.

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.300
But what Recanzone and
Merzenich discovered

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.520
was that if you instruct
subjects to listen

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.810
for particular cues within
speech, or within sounds,

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:35.780
that not only can you learn
those things more quickly,

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:40.780
but that you can remap these
tonotopic maps in the cortex

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.170
that I referred to earlier.

01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:45.470
You actually get changes
in the neural architecture,

01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:47.020
the neural circuitry in the brain,

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.680
and this can occur not only very rapidly,

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.130
but they can occur in the adult brain,

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:55.730
which prior to their work was not thought

01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:57.380
to be amenable to change.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.450
It was long thought that neuroplasticity

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:01.260
could only occur in the developing brain,

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.230
but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:06.820
in the auditory system
actually was some of the first

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.750
that really opened up
everybody's eyes and ears

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:14.100
to the idea that the brain
can change in adulthood.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.127
So here's how this sort
of process would work

01:15:16.127 --> 01:15:18.370
and how you might apply it.

01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:20.580
If you are trying to learn music,

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.560
or you're trying to learn information

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.210
that you're going to then recite,

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.781
you can decide to highlight certain words

01:15:29.781 --> 01:15:33.670
or certain frequencies of sound

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.420
or certain scales or
certain keys on the piano,

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:40.270
and to only focus on those
for certain learning bouts.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:44.350
So I'll give an example
that's real time for me,

01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:46.000
meaning it's happening right now.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:51.370
I know generally what I want
to say when I arrive here,

01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:53.320
I even know specifically certain things

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.563
that I want to make
sure get across to you,

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.940
but I don't think about every single word

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.500
that I'm going to say
and the precise order

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.330
in which I'm going to say those things.

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:05.240
That would be actually very disruptive

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.540
because it wouldn't match
my normal patterns of speech

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.158
and you'd probably think I
was sounding rather robotic

01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:11.883
if I were to do that.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.560
So one way that we can
remember information

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.470
is as we write out, for instance,

01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:19.190
something that we want to say,

01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:22.283
we can highlight particular
words, we can underline those.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:24.690
If we're listening to somebody

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.810
and they're telling us information,

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:31.780
we can decide just to
highlight particular words

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.430
that they said to us and write those down.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:37.020
Now, of course, we're listening
to all the information,

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.970
but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:44.350
and the work of others in
addition to his former student

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.660
or former post-doc, I don't know which,

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.580
Michael Kilgard who's now
got his own lab down in Texas

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:52.480
or others have shown that
the cuing of attention

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.730
to particular features of speech,

01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.060
particular components of speech,

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.460
the way in which it increases
our level of attention overall

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:04.140
allows us to capture more
of the information overall.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.010
And so I don't want this
to be abstract at all.

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.900
What this means is when you're listening,

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.430
you don't have to listen to every word.

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:12.120
You're already listening to every word.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.410
All the information is
coming in through your ears.

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:18.780
What you're trying to
extract is particular things

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.770
or themes within the content.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.620
So maybe you decide if
you're listening to me

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.210
that you're only going to
listen to the word tools,

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:27.250
or you're only going to listen

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.840
to when my voice goes above background,

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.720
you get to decide what you
decide to listen to or not.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.140
And what you decide to
focus on isn't necessarily

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:39.280
as important as the fact
that you're focusing.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.570
So I hope that's clear.

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:42.840
The auditory system does this all the time

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.040
with the cocktail party effect.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.750
What I'm talking about is
exporting certain elements

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:49.410
of the mechanisms of the
cocktail party effect,

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.850
paying attention to the
onset and offset of words

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:55.550
or particular notes within
music or particular scales,

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:59.560
or you can make it even
broader and particular motifs

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.310
of music or particular sentences of words

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.550
or particular phrases.

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:05.910
And in doing that, you extract more

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:08.320
of the information overall,

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.530
even though you're not paying attention

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:11.810
to all the information at once.

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:13.460
Now, I'd like to talk about a phenomenon

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:17.950
that you've all experienced
before, which is called Doppler.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:22.950
So the Doppler effect is the
way that we experience sound

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.883
when the thing that's
making that sound is moving.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.520
The simplest way to explain
this is to translate the sound

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.420
into the visual world once again.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.800
So if you've ever seen a
duck or a goose sitting

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.533
in a pond or a lake and
it's bobbing up and down,

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.620
what you'll notice is
that the ripples of water

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:49.400
that extend out from that duck or goose

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.090
are fairly regularly
spaced in all directions.

01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:54.760
And that's because that
duck or goose is stationary.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.810
It's moving up and down,
but it's not moving forward

01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:59.010
or backward or to the side.

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:02.130
Now, if that duck or
goose were to swim forward

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:05.940
by paddling its little webbed
feet under the surface,

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.120
you would immediately notice
that the ripples of water

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.490
that are close to and in
front of that duck or goose

01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:15.520
would be closer together than
the ones that trailed it,

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.950
that were behind.

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:20.767
And that is essentially what
happens with sound as well.

01:19:20.767 --> 01:19:24.700
With the Doppler effect,
we experience sounds

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.930
that are closer to us at higher frequency,

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:29.340
the ripples are closer together,

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.730
and sounds that are further
away at lower frequency,

01:19:32.730 --> 01:19:35.040
especially when they're moving past us.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.130
So if you've ever, for
instance, heard a siren

01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:40.843
in the distance, [humming]

01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:50.440
that's essentially my
rendition of a siren,

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.890
I don't know what ambulance
or police or what,

01:19:52.890 --> 01:19:57.320
passing you on a street,
that is the Doppler effect.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.960
The Doppler effect is one of the main ways

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.630
that we make out the direction
that things are arriving

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:08.050
from and their speeds and trajectories.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.710
And we get very good,
from a very young age,

01:20:11.710 --> 01:20:15.330
at discerning what direction
things are arriving from

01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:19.350
and the direction that they
are going to pass us in.

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.850
And the Doppler effect has probably saved

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:23.030
your life many, many times.

01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:24.570
In this way, you just don't realize it

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.637
because you'll step off the curb

01:20:25.637 --> 01:20:29.340
or you're driving your car
and you pull to the side

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.160
so that the ambulance
or firetruck can go by

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:37.090
because you heard that
siren off in the distance,

01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:38.550
and then you pull away from the curb

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:40.450
and you get back on the road in part,

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:41.880
because you don't see it any longer,

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.970
but also you don't hear any
other sirens in the distance.

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:49.040
Now, some animals such as
bats are exquisitely good

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.950
at navigating their
environments according to sound.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:55.350
Now, we've all heard that bats don't see.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.400
That's actually not true.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.710
They actually have vision,

01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:00.380
but they just rely more heavily
on their auditory system.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.540
And the way that bats navigate in the dark

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.300
and the way that bats navigate using sound

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:07.890
is through Doppler.

01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:11.610
Now, they don't simply listen
to whether or not things

01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:14.660
are coming at them or
moving away from them

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.330
and pay attention to the
Doppler like the siren example

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:18.940
I gave for you.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:22.640
What they do is they
generate their own sounds.

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.640
So a bat, as it flies around
is sending out clicks,

01:21:27.857 --> 01:21:29.130
[Andrew clicks tongue]

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:30.913
I think that's my best
bat sound or maybe it's

01:21:30.913 --> 01:21:32.370
[Andrew clicks tongue]

01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:35.120
and they're clicking, they're
actually propelling sound out

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.350
at a particular frequency that they know.

01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:40.210
Now, whether or not they're
conscious of it, I don't know.

01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:41.043
I've never asked them.

01:21:41.043 --> 01:21:42.307
And if I did ask them, I
don't think they could answer.

01:21:42.307 --> 01:21:43.910
And if they could answer,
they couldn't answer

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:45.860
in a language that I could understand.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.160
But the bat is essentially flying around,

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.350
sending out sound waves,
pinging its environment

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:53.380
with sound waves of a particular frequency

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.840
and then depending on the
frequency of sound waves

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.930
that come back, they know
if they're getting closer

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.160
to an object or further away from it.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.923
So if they send out
sounds at a frequency of,

01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:06.700
this was much slower than
it would actually occur,

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.750
but let's say one every
half second, [whining]

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:13.810
and it's coming back even faster [roars]

01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:15.760
then they know they're getting closer

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.040
because of the Doppler effect.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.280
And if it comes back more slowly,

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.310
they know that there's
nothing in front of them.

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:25.880
So the bat is essentially
navigating its world

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.420
by creating these auras of sound

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.710
that bounce back on to them

01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:33.930
from the various objects,
trees, et cetera,

01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.420
buildings and people, it's
kind of eerie to think about.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.920
But yes, they see you, they
experience you with their sound,

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:44.460
they sense you and they're
using Doppler to accomplish it.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.010
Now I'd like to talk
about ringing in the ears.

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:51.040
This is something that
I get asked about a lot.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.380
And speaking of signal-to-noise,

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.580
I don't know if I get
asked about it a lot,

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.950
because many people suffer
from ringing in their ears,

01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:01.310
or because the people
who suffer from ringing

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.140
in their ears suffer so much

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.510
that they are more prone to ask.

01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:08.330
So it could be a sampling
bias, I don't know,

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:12.050
but I've been asked enough times
and some of the experiences

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:14.380
of discomfort that people have expressed

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.360
about having this ringing of the ears

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.690
really motivated me to go
deep into this literature.

01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:24.180
So the ringing of the
ears that one experiences

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.180
is called tinnitus, not
ti-nahy-tus, but tinnitus.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.750
And tinnitus can vary in intensity

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:36.250
and it can vary according
to stress levels,

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:40.550
it can vary across the
lifespan or even time of day.

01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:43.410
So it's very subject to background effects

01:23:43.410 --> 01:23:45.840
and contextual effects.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.840
So I think we all know
that we should do our best

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.210
to maximize healthy sleep.

01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:52.070
We did a number of episodes on that.

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.820
Essentially, the first four episodes

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.660
of the Huberman Lab Podcast
were all about sleep

01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.060
and how to get better sleep.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.150
We all know that we should
try and limit our stress.

01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:02.250
And we had an episode about stress

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:04.453
and ways to mitigate stress as well.

01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:08.470
However, there are people, it seems,

01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:09.890
that are suffering from tinnitus,

01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:12.450
for which stress or lack of sleep

01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:15.930
just can't explain the
presence of the tinnitus.

01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:19.650
Tinnitus can be caused by disruption

01:24:19.650 --> 01:24:21.610
to these hair cells that
we talked about earlier

01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:23.710
or damage to the hair cells.

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.230
So that's another reason why,

01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:28.460
even if you have good hearing now

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.090
that you want to protect that hearing

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:32.590
and really avoid putting yourself

01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:34.710
into these two-hit environments,

01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:36.960
environments where there's
a lot of background noise,

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.990
and then you add another
really loud auditory stimulus.

01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:43.570
This also can happen at different
times, I should mention.

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:46.910
If you go to a concert or
you listen to loud music

01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:49.660
with your headphones and
then you go to a concert,

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.170
or you go into a very
loud work environment,

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.960
the hair cells can still be vulnerable.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.120
And once those hair cells
are knocked out, currently,

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.840
we don't have the
technology to put them back.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.140
Although many groups,
including some excellent groups

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.985
at Stanford and elsewhere, too, of course,

01:25:03.985 --> 01:25:07.320
are working on ways to
replenish those hair cells

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.773
and restore hearing.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.570
There are treatments for tinnitus

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:16.423
that involve taking certain substances.

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:19.930
There are medications for tinnitus.

01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:21.850
In the non-prescription landscape,

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:24.320
which is typically what we
discuss on this podcast,

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.053
when we discuss taking anything,

01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.670
there are, essentially, four compounds

01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:32.620
for which there are
quality peer-reviewed data,

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:36.910
where there does not appear to
be any overt commercial bias,

01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:39.100
meaning that nothing's
reported in the papers

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.130
as funding from a particular company

01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:46.130
and those are melatonin, Ginkgo
bilboa, zinc and magnesium.

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:49.110
Now I've talked about melatonin before.

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:53.130
I'm personally not a fan of
melatonin as a sleep aid,

01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:57.220
but there are four studies,
first one entitled:

01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:00.480
The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus,

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.700
tinnitus, excuse me, and Sleep.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.800
Second one, Treatment of Central
and Sensory Neural Tinnitus

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.670
with orally-administered melatonin.

01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:09.660
And then the title goes on much longer,

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.600
but it's a randomized study.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.730
I'm not going to read out all these.

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:14.680
Melatonin: Can it Stop The ringing?

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.730
which is an interesting
article, double-blinded study,

01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:21.050
and The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus.

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:23.860
Each one of these studies
has anywhere from 30

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:28.290
to more than 100 subjects,
in one case 102 subjects;

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:31.010
both genders as they list them out,

01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:34.090
typically, it's listed as
sex, not gender in studies

01:26:34.090 --> 01:26:37.443
so it should say both
sexes, but nonetheless;

01:26:38.665 --> 01:26:42.620
an age range anywhere from 30 years old,

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.430
all the way up to 65 plus.

01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:47.833
I didn't see any studies
of people younger than 30.

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:52.980
All three focused on
melatonin, not surprisingly,

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.500
because of the titles, looking at a range

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.650
of dosages anywhere from
three milligrams per day,

01:26:58.650 --> 01:27:02.320
which is sort of typical of
many supplements for melatonin,

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.480
still much higher than one
would manufacture endogenously

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.350
through your own pineal gland,

01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:12.340
but three milligrams in these studies

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.370
for a duration of anywhere from 30 days

01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:19.270
to much longer in some cases, six months.

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:22.720
And all four of these studies found modest

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.623
yet still statistically
significant effects

01:27:25.623 --> 01:27:28.240
of taking melatonin by mouth,

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.410
so it's orally-administered melatonin

01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:36.330
in reducing the severity of tinnitus.

01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:38.376
So that's compelling, at least to me.

01:27:38.376 --> 01:27:40.970
It doesn't sound like a cure.

01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:44.460
And, of course, as always,
I'm not a physician,

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.520
I'm a scientist, so I
don't prescribe anything.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.660
I only profess things, I
report to you the science.

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:51.100
You have to decide if
melatonin is right for you

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.140
if you have tinnitus.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.300
And certainly, I say that
both to protect myself,

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.590
but also protect you.

01:27:57.590 --> 01:28:00.040
You're responsible for
your health and wellbeing.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.380
And I'm not telling anyone to run out

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.951
and start taking melatonin for tinnitus,

01:28:04.951 --> 01:28:07.350
but it does seem that
it can have some effects

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:09.513
in reducing its symptoms.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:13.188
Ginkgo Boaboa is an interesting compound.

01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:16.560
It's been prescribed for or recommended

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.560
for many, many things, but
there are a few studies,

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.147
again, double-blinded studies
lasting one to six months,

01:28:25.147 --> 01:28:27.970
one that has have an
impressive number of subjects,

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:32.970
978 subjects ranging from
age 18 all the way up to 65

01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:38.130
so on and so forth that show
not huge effects of Ginkgo,

01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:43.250
but as they quote,
limited evidence suggests

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:47.220
that if tinnitus is a side
effect of something else,

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.470
in particular, cognitive decline,

01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:54.470
so age-related tinnitus might
be helped by Ginkgo Boaboa.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.010
I won't go through all the
details of the zinc studies,

01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:00.650
but it seems that zinc supplementation

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.330
at higher levels than are typical

01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:05.320
of most people's intakes
of 50 milligrams per day,

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.500
do appear to be able to
reduce subjective symptoms

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.000
of tinnitus in most of the people

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.750
that took the supplemented zinc.

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:13.900
There aren't a lot of studies on that.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.840
So I could only find one
double-blinded study.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.750
It lasted anywhere from one to six months,

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:23.430
41 subjects, both genders
listed out again here, 45 to 64,

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:26.913
and they saw a decrease in the
severity of tinnitus symptoms

01:29:26.913 --> 01:29:31.190
with 50 milligrams of
elemental zinc supplementation.

01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:34.370
And then last but not least
is the magnesium study.

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:36.410
Again, only a single study.

01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:38.750
It's a Phase II study looking

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.030
at a fairly limited number of subjects,

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:45.160
so only 19 subjects taking 532 milligrams

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.500
of elemental magnesium.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.760
For those of you that take magnesium,

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.600
there's magnesium and elemental magnesium,

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.320
and it's always translated on the bottle,

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.800
but it was associated with
a lessening of symptoms

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.090
related to tinnitus.

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:59.770
So for you tinnitus sufferers out there,

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.230
you may already be aware of this,

01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:03.386
you may already be taking these things

01:30:03.386 --> 01:30:06.310
and had no positive effects,

01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:08.470
meaning they didn't help, maybe not.

01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:11.570
I hope that you'll, at
least, consider these,

01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:13.160
talk to your doctor about them.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.300
I do realize that tinnitus
is extremely disruptive.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:20.090
I can't say I empathize because I don't,

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:21.540
from a place of experience, that is,

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:22.690
because I don't have tinnitus,

01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:24.670
but for those of you that
don't include myself,

01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:27.620
you can imagine that
hearing sounds of things

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:29.510
that aren't there and
the ringing in one's ears

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:33.030
can be very disruptive and I
think would be very disruptive

01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:36.340
and explains why people with
tinnitus reach out so often

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.410
with questions about
how to alleviate that.

01:30:38.410 --> 01:30:40.870
And I hope this information
was useful to you.

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:44.840
I'd like to now talk about
balance and our sense of balance,

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.080
which is controlled by, believe it or not,

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:51.000
our ears and things in our ears,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.590
as well as by our brain and
elements of our spinal cord.

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:58.190
But before I do that, I want
to ask you another question

01:30:58.190 --> 01:31:01.850
or I would rather, I'd like
to ask you to ask yourself

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:06.850
a question and answer it,
which is how big are your ears.

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:10.563
It turns out that the
ears grow our entire life.

01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:15.430
In the early stage of our
life, they grow more slowly.

01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:19.150
And then as we age,
they grow more quickly.

01:31:19.150 --> 01:31:22.140
You may have noticed if
you have family members

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.038
who are well into their 70s and 80s,

01:31:25.038 --> 01:31:28.847
and if you're fortunate, into their 90s

01:31:28.847 --> 01:31:32.200
and maybe even 100s, is that the ears

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.200
of some of these individuals
get very, very big,

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.586
relative to their previous ear sizes.

01:31:38.586 --> 01:31:41.470
So it turns out that biological age

01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:46.210
can actually be measured
according to ear size.

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:48.350
Now you have to take a few
measurements but there's,

01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:50.430
believe it or not, there is a formula

01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:51.923
in the scientific literature,

01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:56.600
if you know your ear circumference,

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.340
so the distance around
your ear, ears, plural,

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:04.440
presumably you have two, most people do,

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.510
in millimeters, so you're
going to take the circumference

01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:08.470
of your ears in millimeters.

01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:10.170
How would you do this?

01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:11.070
How would you do this?

01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:14.340
Maybe you take a string and
you put it around your ear,

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.450
and then you measure the string.

01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:18.110
That's probably going to be
easier than marching around

01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:20.420
your ear or somebody
else's ear with a ruler

01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:21.610
and measuring in millimeters.

01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:24.810
So what's your ear
circumference, on the outside,

01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:26.410
don't go in on the divot or anything.

01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:28.070
You're just going around
as if you're going to trace

01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:30.910
the closest fitting oval,

01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:33.910
assuming your ears are
oval, closest fitting oval

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.043
that matches your ear circumference.

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:40.950
Take that number in
millimeters, subtract from it...

01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:43.270
Oh, excuse me, I should do this correctly.

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:46.080
Do that for both ears, add them together,

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.890
add those numbers together, divide by two,

01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:50.160
get the average for your two ears,

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.850
get your average ear circumference,

01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:53.560
of course, your two ears.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.960
Then take that number in millimeters,

01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.960
subtract 88.1 and then
whatever value that is,

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:04.400
multiply it times 1.96

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.400
and that will tell you
your biological age.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.803
Now why in the world
would this be accurate?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.130
As we age, there are changes in number

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:15.803
of different biological pathways.

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.730
One of those pathways
is the pathways related

01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:21.780
to collagen synthesis.

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:24.570
So not only are our ears growing,

01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:26.717
but our noses are growing too,

01:33:26.717 --> 01:33:28.930
and my nose seems to be growing a lot.

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:30.460
But then again, I did
sports where I would get

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.510
my nose broken, something
I don't recommend.

01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:33.460
As I always point out, you don't get

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:37.270
a nose like mine doing
yoga, but nonetheless,

01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:39.590
my nose is still growing and
my ears are still growing.

01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:41.220
And I suspect as I get older,

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.030
if I have the good fortune of
living into my 80s and 90s,

01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:47.340
my ears are going to continue to grow.

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:50.240
A comparison between chronological
age and biological age

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.380
is something that's a really
deep interest these days

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.280
in the work of David Sinclair

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.530
at Harvard Medical School and others.

01:33:57.530 --> 01:34:01.030
So called Horvath clocks
that people have developed

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.908
have tapped into how the
epigenome and the genome

01:34:03.908 --> 01:34:07.850
can give us some insight
into our biological age

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:09.830
and how that compares to
our chronological age.

01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:12.020
Most of us know our chronological age,

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:13.890
because we know when we were born

01:34:13.890 --> 01:34:16.950
and we know where we are
relative to that now.

01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:21.090
But you can start to make a little chart,

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:23.890
if you like, about your
rates of ear growth.

01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:26.380
Your rates of ear growth
actually correlate pretty well

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:29.670
with your rates of biological progression

01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:32.490
through this thing that we call life.

01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:34.720
So it's not something that
we think about too often,

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:38.830
but just like our DNA and our epigenome,

01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:41.480
and some other markers of metabolic health

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.970
and hormone health relate to our age,

01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:46.040
so does our collagen synthesis.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.738
And one of the places
that shows up the most

01:34:47.738 --> 01:34:50.280
is in these two little goodies
on the sides of our heads,

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.760
which are our ears.

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.910
So even though it's a little
bit of a bizarre metric,

01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:57.690
it makes perfect sense in
the biological context.

01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:59.220
So let's talk about balance

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:01.700
and how to get better at balancing.

01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.330
The reason why we're talking about balance

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.000
and how to get better at balancing

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.930
in the episode about hearing
is that all the goodies

01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:12.563
that are going to allow you
to do that are in your ears.

01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:16.830
They're also in your brain, but
they're mostly in your ears.

01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:19.960
So as you recall from the
beginning of this episode,

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.800
you have two cochlea, cochleas,

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.630
that are one on each side of your head.

01:35:25.630 --> 01:35:27.810
And that's a little
spiral snail-shaped thing

01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:30.680
that converts sound waves
into electrical signals

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.390
that the rest of your
brain can understand.

01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:34.710
Right next to those,

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:37.433
you have what are called
semicircular canals.

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.460
The semicircular canals
can be best visualized

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.380
as thinking about three hula
hoops with marbles in them.

01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.360
So imagine that you have a hula hoop

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.420
and it's not filled with
marbles all the way around,

01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.920
it's just got some marbles
down there at the base.

01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:57.310
So if you were to move
that hula hoop around,

01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:59.130
the marbles would move around, [shushing].

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:03.300
You've got three of those and
each one of those hula hoops

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.853
has these marbles that can move around.

01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:10.360
One of those hula hoops
is positioned vertically

01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:12.800
with respect to gravity.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.570
So it's basically parallel to your nose.

01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:17.570
It sits like this, if
you're watching on a video,

01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:19.200
but basically it's upright.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:22.935
Another one of those
hula hoops is basically

01:36:22.935 --> 01:36:27.360
at a 90-degree angle to your nose.

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.770
It's basically parallel to the floor

01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:32.270
if you're standing up right
now, if you're seated.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.250
And the other one, it's kind of tilted

01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:40.170
about 45 degrees in between those.

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:42.900
Now why is the system there?

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.310
Well, those marbles within
each one of those hula hoops

01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:49.760
can move around, but
they'll only move around

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.720
if your head moves in a particular way,

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:54.560
and there are three planes or three ways

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.340
that your head can move.

01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:00.110
Your head can move up and down
like I'm nodding right now.

01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:01.660
So that's called pitch,

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:04.443
it's pitching forward or pitching back.

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:08.520
So it's a nod, up and down,

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.570
or I can shake my head no, side to side.

01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:12.940
That's called a yaw.

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:16.040
You pilots will be very
familiar with this, yaw.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.280
Not yawn, yaw.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.260
And then there's roll, tilting
the head from side to side,

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.830
the way that a cute
puppy might look at you

01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:27.360
from side to side or that if somebody

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:30.700
doesn't really understand or
believe what you're saying,

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:34.260
they might tilt their head,
very common phenomenon.

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:35.550
I mean, nobody does that to me,

01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:37.690
but they do that to each other.

01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:41.960
So pitch, yaw and roll are
the movements of the head

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.380
in each of the three major
planes of motion, as we say.

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:49.010
And each one of those causes those marbles

01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:53.483
to move in one or two of
the various hula hoops.

01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:57.250
So if I move my head
up and down when I nod,

01:37:57.250 --> 01:38:00.070
one of those hula hoops,
literally, right now,

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:01.420
the marbles are moving back and forth.

01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:03.220
They aren't actually marbles by the way,

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:08.220
these are little, kind of
like little stones, basically,

01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:11.020
little calcium-like deposits

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.820
and when they roll back and forth,

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.790
they deflect little hairs,

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:18.930
little hair cells that
aren't like the hair cells

01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:21.040
that we use for measuring sound waves.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.600
They're not too different, but
they are different from them,

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.070
not like the hairs on our heads,

01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:29.300
but they're basically rolling past

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:32.600
these little hair cells
and causing them to deflect

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.765
and when they deflect
downward, the neurons,

01:38:35.765 --> 01:38:37.340
because hair cells are neurons,

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.730
send information up to the brain.

01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:42.520
So if I move my head like this,

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.570
there's a physical movement
of these little stones

01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:48.430
in this hula hoop as I'm referring to it,

01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:51.740
but they deflect these
hairs, send those hairs,

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.460
which are neurons, those hair cells,

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.930
send information off to the brain.

01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:56.650
If I move my head from side to side,

01:38:56.650 --> 01:38:58.630
different little stones move.

01:38:58.630 --> 01:39:00.890
If I roll my head, different stones move.

01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:04.920
This is an exquisite system
that exists in all animals

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.550
that have a jaw.

01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:10.610
So any fish that has
a jaw has this system,

01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:12.300
a puppy has the system,

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:16.120
any animal that has a jaw has
this so-called balance system,

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.290
which we call the vestibular system.

01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:20.120
One of the more important things to know

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.500
about the vestibular, the balance system

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:26.473
is that it works together
with the visual system.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.040
Let's say I hear something off to my left

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:32.790
and I swing my head over to
the left to see what it is.

01:39:34.165 --> 01:39:37.130
There are two sources of
information about where my head is

01:39:37.130 --> 01:39:39.970
relative to my body and
I need to know that.

01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:43.930
First of all, when I quickly
move my head to the side,

01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.410
those little stones, as
I'm referring to them,

01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:47.770
I realize they're not actually stones,

01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:49.440
but as I'm referring to them,

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.410
they quickly, whoom,
activate those hair cells

01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:54.930
in that one semicircular canal,

01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:56.910
and send a signal off to my brain

01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:58.760
that my head just moved
to the side like this,

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.670
not that it went like
this and pitched back

01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:03.970
or not that it tilted, but
it just moved to the side.

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:08.750
But also visual information
slid past my field of view.

01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:09.750
I didn't have to think about it,

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:11.670
but just slid past my field of view.

01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:14.353
And when those two signals combine,

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.630
my eyes then lock to
a particular location.

01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:21.270
Now, if this is at all complicated,

01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:23.820
you can actually uncouple these things.

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:26.210
It's very easy to do. You
can do this right now.

01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:27.910
In fact, I'd like you
to do this experiment

01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:29.610
if you're not already doing something else

01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:30.840
that requires your attention.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.106
And certainly, don't do
this if you're driving.

01:40:33.106 --> 01:40:37.220
You're going to sit down and
you're going to move your head

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:42.090
to the left very slowly
with your eyes open.

01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:45.390
So you're going to move
it very, very slowly.

01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:47.460
The whole thing should
take about five, six,

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.373
maybe even 10 seconds to complete.

01:40:52.150 --> 01:40:53.720
Okay, I just did it.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.980
Now, I'm going to do it very quickly.

01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.130
I'd like you to do it
very quickly as well.

01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:59.653
Now do it slowly again.

01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:05.780
What you probably noticed

01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:08.593
is that it's very
uncomfortable to do it slowly,

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.070
but you can do it very quickly

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:13.390
without much discomfort at all.

01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:14.970
You just move your head to the side.

01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:18.810
The reason is when you move
your head, very slowly,

01:41:18.810 --> 01:41:22.030
those little stones at the
base of that hula hoop,

01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:24.060
they don't get enough momentum to move.

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.570
So you're actually not
generating this signal

01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:29.230
to the brain that your head is moving.

01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:31.677
And what you'll notice is
that your eyes have to go,

01:41:31.677 --> 01:41:35.330
boom, boom, boom, jumping
over step-by-step.

01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:37.290
Whereas if you move your
head really quickly,

01:41:37.290 --> 01:41:38.940
the signal gets off to
your brain and your eyes

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:41.880
just go boom, right to the
location you want to look at.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.320
So moving your body slowly
is actually very disruptive

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.960
to the vestibular system.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.310
And it's very disruptive
to your visual system.

01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.680
Now, if you've ever had the misfortune

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.690
of being on a boat and you're
going through big oscillations

01:41:56.690 --> 01:41:57.842
on the boat, for those of you seasick,

01:41:57.842 --> 01:41:59.690
folks that get seasick,

01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:01.510
this can actually make
certain people seasick

01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:04.620
just to hear about it,
those big oscillations

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.040
going up and down and up and down.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.370
Those are very disruptive.

01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:10.060
We'll talk about nausea in a minute

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.100
and how to offset that kind of nausea.

01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:13.560
I get pretty seasick, but there are ways

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.500
that you can deal with
this but this is incredible

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.360
because what it means is
a purely physical system

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.230
of these little stones
rolling around in there

01:42:22.230 --> 01:42:24.960
and directing where your eyes should go.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.180
So you can do this also
just by looking up.

01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.240
So let's just say, you're
sitting in a chair,

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:31.040
you're going to look
up towards the ceiling

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.320
and your eyes will just go there.

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.230
You're doing this eyes
open and you look down.

01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:38.943
Now try doing it right
really, really slowly.

01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.290
Some people even get
motion sick doing this,

01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:46.240
which if you do, then just stop.

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.120
Okay, so you can do this also to the side,

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.451
although it works best if
you're moving your head

01:42:50.451 --> 01:42:55.370
from side to side and
we're nodding up and down.

01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:57.440
So what we're doing
here is we're uncoupling

01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.190
these two mechanisms,
we're pulling them apart,

01:42:59.190 --> 01:43:00.970
the visual part and the vestibular part,

01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:03.780
just to illustrate to you that, normally,

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.700
these mechanisms in your
inner ear tell your eyes

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.000
where to go, but as well,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.070
your eyes tell your balance
system, your vestibular system,

01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:15.450
how to function.

01:43:15.450 --> 01:43:18.050
So I'd like you to do
a different experiment.

01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:21.570
I'm not going to do it right
now, but basically stand up.

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:23.260
If you get the opportunity,
you can do this safely,

01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.120
wherever you are, you're going to stand up

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.020
and you're going to look
forward about 10, 12 feet.

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.901
Pick a point on a wall or you can,

01:43:29.901 --> 01:43:32.670
anywhere that you like,
if you're out in public,

01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:33.710
just do it anyway.

01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:36.838
Just tell them you're listening
to Huberman Lab Podcasts,

01:43:36.838 --> 01:43:38.940
and someone's telling you to do it.

01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.320
Anyway, if you don't want
to do it, don't do it.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.540
But, basically, do it.

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:45.160
Stand on one leg and
lift up the other leg.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.580
You can bend your knee, if you like

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:50.393
and just look off into the
distance about 10, 12 feet.

01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:53.600
If you can do that, if
you can stand on one leg,

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.090
now close your eyes,
chances are you're going

01:43:57.090 --> 01:44:00.410
to suddenly feel what
scientists call postural sway.

01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:02.520
You're going to start
swaying around a lot.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.634
It is very hard to balance
with your eyes closed.

01:44:06.634 --> 01:44:09.130
And if you think about that,
it's like, why is that?

01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:10.100
That's crazy.

01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:11.950
Why would it be that it's hard to balance

01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:12.783
with your eyes closed?

01:44:12.783 --> 01:44:16.634
Well, information about the
visual world also feeds back

01:44:16.634 --> 01:44:18.760
onto this vestibular system.

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.770
So the vestibular system
informs your vision

01:44:20.770 --> 01:44:22.160
and tells you where to move your eyes

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.750
and your eyes and their positioning tell

01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:27.030
your balance system,
your vestibular system

01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:28.700
how it should function.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.070
So there's a really cool way

01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:33.730
that you can learn to optimize balance.

01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:35.370
You're not going to try
and do this by learning

01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:37.330
to balance with your eyes closed.

01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:41.080
What you can do is you can raise one leg

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.040
and you can look at a short distance,

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.270
maybe off to just the distance
that your thumb would be

01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:46.730
if you were to reach your
arm out in front of you.

01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:48.290
Although you don't necessarily have to put

01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:49.123
your thumb in front of you.

01:44:49.123 --> 01:44:51.570
So maybe just about two
feet in front of you.

01:44:51.570 --> 01:44:52.740
Then while still balancing,

01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:56.260
you're going to step your
vision out a further distance,

01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:57.450
and then a further distance

01:44:57.450 --> 01:44:58.870
and as far as you can possibly see

01:44:58.870 --> 01:45:00.450
in the environment that you're in.

01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:03.240
And then you're going
to march it back to you.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.570
Now, what the literature shows

01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:07.590
is that this kind of balance training

01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:12.409
where you incorporate the
visual system and extending out,

01:45:12.409 --> 01:45:14.620
and then marching back in the point

01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:16.930
at which you direct your visual focus,

01:45:16.930 --> 01:45:20.510
sends robust information
about the relationship

01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:23.793
between your visual world
and your balance system.

01:45:23.793 --> 01:45:25.490
And, of course, the
balance system includes

01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:28.590
not just these hula hoops,
these semicircular canals,

01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:30.470
but they communicate with the cerebellum,

01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:32.700
the so-called mini-brain,
it actually means mini-brain

01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:33.930
in the back of your brain,

01:45:33.930 --> 01:45:35.470
combines that with visual information

01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:37.563
and your map of the body surface.

01:45:39.130 --> 01:45:44.130
That pattern of training
is very beneficial

01:45:44.530 --> 01:45:47.360
for enhancing your ability to balance

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.190
because the ability to balance

01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:53.350
is, in part, the activation of
particular postural muscles,

01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:57.250
but just as much, perhaps even moreso,

01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:01.570
it's about being able to
adjust those postural muscles,

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.688
excuse me, it's about the ability

01:46:03.688 --> 01:46:05.671
to adjust those postural muscles

01:46:05.671 --> 01:46:08.770
as you experience changes
in your visual world.

01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:10.640
And one of the most robust ways

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:13.370
that you can engage changes
in your visual world

01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:15.200
is through your own movement.

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.870
And so most people are not trying

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:19.300
to balance in place, right?

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.600
They're not just trying to stand there

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.270
like a statue on one leg.

01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:24.220
Most of what we think about
when we think about balance

01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.800
is for sake of sport or dynamic balance

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:29.090
of being able to break ourselves,

01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:30.870
when we're lunging in
one particular direction

01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:32.220
to stop ourselves, that is,

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.960
and then to move in another direction

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.740
or for skateboarding or surfing or cycling

01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:39.210
or any number of different
things, gymnastics.

01:46:39.210 --> 01:46:41.970
So the visual system is the primary input

01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:43.370
by which you develop balance,

01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:46.490
but you can't do it just
with the visual system.

01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:49.340
So what I'm recommending
is if you're interested

01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:50.730
in cultivating a sense of balance,

01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:54.470
understand the relationship
between the semicircular canals,

01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:58.850
understand that they are
both driving eye movements

01:46:58.850 --> 01:47:01.130
and they are driven by eye movements.

01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:03.100
It's a reciprocal relationship.

01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:06.540
And then even just two
or three minutes a day,

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.040
or every once in a while,
even three times a week,

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:13.540
maybe five minutes, maybe
10 minutes, you pick,

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.860
but if you want to enhance balance,

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:18.900
you have to combine changes
in your visual environment

01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.230
with a static posture, standing on one leg

01:47:21.230 --> 01:47:26.230
and shifting your visual
environment or static visual view,

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:32.440
looking at one thing and
changing your body posture.

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.690
So those two things,

01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:36.047
we now know from the
scientific literature,

01:47:36.047 --> 01:47:39.070
combine in order to give an
enhanced sense of balance.

01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:42.650
And there's a really nice paper
that was published in 2015

01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:45.590
called Effects of Balance
Training on Balance Performance.

01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:47.980
This was in healthy adults.

01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:51.040
It's a systematic review
and a meta analysis.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.670
A meta analysis is when you combine

01:47:52.670 --> 01:47:54.690
a lot of literature from
a lot of different papers

01:47:54.690 --> 01:47:56.680
and extract the really robust

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.330
and the less robust statistical effects.

01:47:59.330 --> 01:48:02.120
So it's a really nice paper as well.

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.960
There are some papers
out there, for instance,

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.810
comparison of static balance

01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:09.400
and the role of vision
in the elite athletes.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.840
This is essentially the paper

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.376
that I've extracted
most of the information

01:48:12.376 --> 01:48:14.570
that I just gave you from.

01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:18.240
And that paper, and there
are some others as well,

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.860
but basically I distilled them down

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.860
into their core components.

01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.940
The core components are
move your vision around

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:26.900
while staying static, still

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.370
but in a balanced position
like standing on one leg,

01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:30.680
could be something more complicated

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.530
if you're somebody who can do
more complicated movements.

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:37.200
Unilateral movement
seemed to be important,

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:40.430
so standing on one leg as opposed to both,

01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:44.040
or trying to generate
some tilt is another way

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.450
to go about it or imbalance,

01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:48.140
meaning one limb
asymmetrically being activated

01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:49.830
compared to the other limb.

01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:52.810
And then the other way to encourage

01:48:52.810 --> 01:48:56.740
or to cultivate and build
up this vestibular system

01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:00.430
and your sense of balance
actually involves movement itself,

01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:01.480
acceleration.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.490
So that's what we're
going to talk about now.

01:49:03.490 --> 01:49:05.370
So up until now, I've
been talking about balance

01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:06.730
only in the static sense,

01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:08.470
like standing on one leg for instance,

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:11.090
but that's a very artificial situation.

01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:13.210
Even though you can
train balance that way,

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:15.840
most people who want to
enhance their sense of balance

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:18.830
for sport or dance, or
some other endeavor,

01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:21.550
want to engage balance in a dynamic way,

01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:24.220
meaning moving through lots of
different planes of movement,

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:26.900
maybe even sometimes
while squatting down low

01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:30.130
or jumping and landing
or making trajectories

01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:31.430
that are different angles.

01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:34.490
For that, we need to consider

01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:39.248
that the vestibular system
also cares about acceleration.

01:49:39.248 --> 01:49:41.010
So it cares about head position,

01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:43.580
it cares about eye position
and where the eyes are

01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.660
and where you're looking,
but it also cares

01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:49.430
about what direction
you're moving and how fast.

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:52.460
And one of the best things that you can do

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.900
to enhance your sense of balance

01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:59.440
is to start to bring
together your visual system,

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.330
the semicircular canals of the inner ear

01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:05.110
and what we call linear acceleration.

01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:08.920
So if I move forward in
space rigidly upright,

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:11.040
it's a vastly different situation

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.273
than if I'm leaning to the side.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.450
One of the best ways to cultivate

01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:20.280
a better sense of balance, literally,

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.030
within the sense organs and the neurons

01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:27.990
and the biology of the
brain is to get into modes

01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:31.080
where we are accelerating
forward, typically,

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.680
it's forward while also tilted
with respect to gravity.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.510
Now this would be the
carve on a skateboard

01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:40.760
or on a surf board or a snowboard.

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.280
This would be the taking
a corner on a bike

01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.810
while being able to
lean, safely, of course,

01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:49.310
lean into the turn so that your head

01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:52.890
is actually tilted with
respect to the earth.

01:50:52.890 --> 01:50:55.780
So anytime that we are rigidly upright,

01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:00.420
we aren't really exercising the
vestibular system imbalance.

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.380
And this is why you see people in the gym

01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:04.710
on these, one of those bouncy balls,

01:51:04.710 --> 01:51:07.520
Bocce balls are the one that
the guys roll in the park.

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.313
Bouncy balls, where they're
balancing back and forth,

01:51:09.313 --> 01:51:11.940
that will work the small
stabilizing muscles.

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.870
But what I'm talking about
is getting into modes

01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:17.280
where you actually tilt
the body and the head

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:19.463
with respect to earth.

01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:24.110
What I mean is with respect
to Earth's gravitational pull.

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:27.370
Now the cerebellum is a
very interesting structure

01:51:27.370 --> 01:51:29.850
because not only is it
involved in balance,

01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:33.040
but it's also involved in skill-learning

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.970
and in generating timing of movements.

01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:37.680
It's a fascinating structure deserving

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.800
of an entire episode or several
episodes all on its own,

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:45.000
but some of the outputs of the cerebellum,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.850
meaning the neurons in
the cerebellum get inputs,

01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:50.520
but they also send information out.

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:53.400
The outputs of the cerebellum
are strongly linked

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.560
to areas of the brain that
release neuromodulators

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.560
that make us feel really
good, in particular,

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.350
serotonin and dopamine.

01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:04.666
And this is an early emerging
sub-field within neuroscience,

01:52:04.666 --> 01:52:07.910
but a lot of what are
called the non-motor outputs

01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:11.230
of the cerebellum have
a profound influence,

01:52:11.230 --> 01:52:15.670
not just on our ability to
learn how to balance better,

01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:18.460
but also how we feel overall.

01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:20.770
So for you exercisers out there,

01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:21.847
I do hope people are getting

01:52:21.847 --> 01:52:23.930
regular healthy amounts of exercise.

01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:26.590
We've talked about what that
means in previous episodes,

01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:29.120
so at least 150 minutes
a week of endurance work,

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:29.953
some strength training,

01:52:29.953 --> 01:52:33.370
a minimum five sets per body
part to maintain musculature

01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:34.910
even if you don't want to grow muscles,

01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:36.940
you want to do that in
order to maintain healthy,

01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.480
strengthened bones, et cetera.

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.580
If you're doing that but
you're only doing things

01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.750
like curls in the gym, squats in the gym,

01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:47.480
riding the Peloton, or even
if you're outside running,

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.480
and you're getting forward acceleration,

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:51.360
but you're never actually getting tilted,

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.850
you're never actually getting tilted

01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:56.440
with respect to Earth's
gravitational pull,

01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:01.250
you're not really exercising
and getting the most

01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:03.220
out of your nervous system.

01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:06.720
Activation of the cerebellum in this way

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.980
of being tilted or the head being tilted

01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:11.340
and the body being tilted
while in acceleration,

01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:13.010
typically forward acceleration,

01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:16.820
but sometimes side to side has a profound

01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:20.200
and positive effect on our
sense of mood and wellbeing.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.880
And as I talked about in previous episode,

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.220
it can also enhance our
ability to learn information

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:29.640
in the period after
generating those tilts.

01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.380
And the acceleration.

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:33.840
And that's because the
cerebellum has these outputs

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.890
to these areas of the brain

01:53:34.890 --> 01:53:36.490
that release these neuromodulators,

01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:38.800
like serotonin and dopamine.

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.460
And they make us feel really good.

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:44.190
I think this is one of the
reasons why, growing up,

01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:46.628
I had some friends, some
of whom might've been

01:53:46.628 --> 01:53:50.270
the world heavyweight
champions of laziness

01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:52.170
for essentially everything,

01:53:52.170 --> 01:53:56.340
except they would wake up at
4:30 in the morning to go surf.

01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:00.110
They would drive, they would
get up so early to go surf.

01:54:00.110 --> 01:54:02.450
It's not just surfers and
some surfers, by the way,

01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:04.730
I should point out are not lazy humans.

01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:06.070
They do a lot of other things.

01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:08.970
But I knew people that couldn't
be motivated to do anything,

01:54:08.970 --> 01:54:13.160
but they were highly driven
to get into these experiences

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.240
of forward acceleration while tilted

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.610
with respect to gravity,

01:54:16.610 --> 01:54:21.150
likewise, with snowboarding
or skiing or cycling.

01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:25.850
Those modes of exercise seem
to have an outsized effect

01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:28.420
both on our wellbeing and our ability

01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:32.530
to translate the vestibular
balance that we achieve

01:54:32.530 --> 01:54:35.250
in those endeavors to
our ability to balance

01:54:35.250 --> 01:54:36.770
while doing other things,

01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:39.710
and I don't mean psychological
balance necessarily.

01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:41.590
I mean physical balance.

01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:43.490
So for those of you that
don't think of yourselves

01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:47.010
as very coordinated or
with very good balance,

01:54:47.010 --> 01:54:49.880
getting into these modes of
acceleration forward movement

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.760
or lateral movement while getting tilted,

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.260
even if you have to do it
slowly, could be beneficial,

01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:56.087
I do believe, and the
scientific literature points

01:54:56.087 --> 01:54:58.750
to the fact that it will be beneficial

01:54:58.750 --> 01:55:02.540
for cultivating better
sense of physical balance.

01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.470
It can really build up the circuits

01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:06.320
of this vestibular system.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.820
And then, of course,
the feel-good components

01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.380
of acceleration while tilted
or while getting the head

01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:15.858
into different orientations
relative to gravity,

01:55:15.858 --> 01:55:18.780
well, that's the explanation
for roller-coasters.

01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:20.080
Some people hate roller-coasters.

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.990
They make them feel nauseous.

01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:24.870
Many people love roller-coasters

01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:26.750
and one of the reasons
they love roller-coasters

01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:30.330
is because of the way that
when you get the body,

01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:31.930
even if you're not
generating the movement,

01:55:31.930 --> 01:55:34.030
you get the body into forward acceleration

01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:36.540
and you're going upside
down and tilted to the side

01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.270
as the tracks go from side
to side and tilt, et cetera,

01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:42.840
you're getting activation
of these deeper brain nuclei

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.310
that trigger the release
of neuromodulators

01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:47.230
that just make us feel
really, really good.

01:55:47.230 --> 01:55:49.450
In fact, some people get a long arc,

01:55:49.450 --> 01:55:51.870
a long duration buzz from having gone

01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:53.120
through those experiences.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.464
Some people who hate roller-coasters

01:55:54.464 --> 01:55:58.000
are probably getting nauseous,
just hearing about that.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.770
So I encourage people to get
into modes of acceleration

01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:03.320
while tilted every once in a while,

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.710
provided you can do it safely.

01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:08.590
It's an immensely powerful
way to build up your skills

01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:10.160
in the realm of balance.

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.070
And it's also, for most
people, very, very pleasing.

01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:16.660
It feels really good because
of the chemical relationship

01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:21.230
between forward acceleration
and head tilt and body tilt.

01:56:21.230 --> 01:56:23.563
Now, speaking of feeling nauseous,

01:56:24.930 --> 01:56:27.270
some people suffer from vertigo.

01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:30.263
Some people feel dizzy,
some people get lightheaded.

01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:33.950
An important question
to ask yourself, always,

01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:36.560
if you're feeling quote-unquote
dizzy or lightheaded,

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:39.660
is are you dizzy or are you lightheaded?

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.740
Now, we're not going to
diagnose anything here

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:43.470
because there's just
no way we can do that.

01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:45.350
This is essentially me
shouting into a tunnel.

01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:46.830
So we don't know what's going on

01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:48.280
with each and every one of you

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.973
but if ever you feel that
your world is spinning,

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.550
but that you can focus on
your thumb, for instance,

01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:58.610
but the rest of the world is spinning

01:56:58.610 --> 01:57:01.943
and your thumb is stationary,
that's called being dizzy.

01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:05.190
Now, if you feel like you're falling

01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:07.210
or that you feel like you need to get down

01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:10.450
onto the ground because
you feel light-headed,

01:57:10.450 --> 01:57:12.080
that's being light-headed.

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.380
And, oftentimes, with
language we don't distinguish

01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:16.620
between being dizzy and being lightheaded.

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:19.210
Now there are a lot of ways that dizziness

01:57:19.210 --> 01:57:21.030
and lightheadedness can occur.

01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:22.870
And I don't even want to
begin to guess at the number

01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:25.530
of different things and
ways that it could happen

01:57:25.530 --> 01:57:26.780
for those of you that suffer from it

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.960
because it could be any number of them.

01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.260
But, oftentimes, if people
are lightheaded, yes,

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:33.240
it could be low blood sugar.

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.860
It could also be that you're dehydrated.

01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:38.770
It could also be that you
are low in electrolytes.

01:57:38.770 --> 01:57:40.710
We talked about this
in a previous episode,

01:57:40.710 --> 01:57:43.330
but we will talk about it
more in a future episode.

01:57:43.330 --> 01:57:46.960
Many people have too little
sodium in their system, salt,

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:49.380
and that's why they feel lightheaded.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:51.260
I have family members who, for years,

01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:53.820
thought they had disrupted blood sugar.

01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:56.980
They would get shaky,
jittery, lightheaded,

01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:59.190
feel like they were nauseous, et cetera.

01:57:59.190 --> 01:58:02.210
And simply the addition of little sea salt

01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:04.360
to their water remedied
the problem entirely.

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:06.710
I don't think it's going
to remedy every issue

01:58:06.710 --> 01:58:08.980
of lightheadedness out
there by any stretch,

01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:12.060
but just the addition of
salt, in this particular case,

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:12.940
helped the person.

01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.640
And they are not alone.

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.480
Many people who think that
they have low blood sugar,

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.580
actually are lightheaded
because of low electrolytes

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:22.960
and because of the way
that salt carries water

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:25.500
into the system and creates
changes in blood volume,

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:26.850
et cetera.

01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:30.500
Low sodium can often be a
source of lightheadedness

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.340
as can low blood sugar and, of course,

01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:33.470
other things as well.

01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:36.040
Now for dizziness or seasickness,

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.920
we were all taught that
you need to pick a point

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.740
on the horizon and focus on it.

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.323
But actually, that's not correct.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.500
It is true that if you are
down in the cabin of a boat

01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:52.070
or you're on the lower
deck and all you can see

01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:53.903
are things up close to you,

01:58:54.810 --> 01:58:57.280
that getting sloshed around, like so

01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.880
or the boat going up and down, like so,

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:01.497
I think I'm getting a little
seasick, even as I do this

01:59:01.497 --> 01:59:02.653
and I describe it,

01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:09.160
focusing on things close
to you can be problematic.

01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.420
And in that case, the
advice to go up on deck

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:15.940
and get fresh air and to
look off into the horizon,

01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:17.630
that part is correct.

01:59:17.630 --> 01:59:20.060
But focusing your eyes
on a particular location

01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:23.110
on the horizon is effectively like trying

01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:26.300
to move very slowly as
I had you do before,

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:28.280
where you're trying to
move your head very slowly

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.530
while fixating on one location.

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:32.410
Your eyes and your balance
system were designed

01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:33.970
to move together.

01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:36.830
So really, what you want to
do is allow your visual system

01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:40.260
to track with your vestibular system.

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:43.470
This is why sitting in the
back of an Uber or a taxi

01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:45.340
and being on your phone

01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:47.750
can make you suddenly feel very nauseous.

01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:49.730
Sometimes the cabs,
particularly in New York City,

01:59:49.730 --> 01:59:51.050
they have a lot of occluders,

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:53.220
they have a lot of stuff
blocking your field of view.

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.660
There's usually a little
portal where you can see out

01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:59.270
to the front of the front windshield,

01:59:59.270 --> 02:00:00.340
but there's all this stuff now,

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:02.360
televisions in the back
seat and you're watching

02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:04.150
that television and the cab is moving.

02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:05.902
You're in linear acceleration,

02:00:05.902 --> 02:00:09.050
and sometimes you're taking
corners, you're braking

02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:11.710
so then your vestibular
system has to adjust to that.

02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:14.540
If you're looking at your phone or a book,

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:17.280
or even if you're talking
to somebody, actually,

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:18.380
I'm starting to feel a little nauseous

02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:19.213
just talking about it.

02:00:19.213 --> 02:00:20.930
I promise I'm not going
to finish this episode

02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:23.900
by vomiting at the end, at least not here,

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:27.798
but what can happen is
that you're uncoupling

02:00:27.798 --> 02:00:31.140
the visual information from your motion,

02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:32.880
from your vestibular information.

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.200
You want those to be coupled.

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.960
This is why a lot of people have to drive,

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.440
they can't be in the passenger seat.

02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.273
Because when you drive,

02:00:39.273 --> 02:00:41.520
you also get what's called
proprioceptive feedback.

02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:44.950
Your body is sending signals
also to the vestibular system

02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:46.910
about where you are in space.

02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:48.100
When you're the passenger,

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:51.160
you're just getting jolted
around as the person is driving.

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.370
And if you're looking at
your phone, it's even worse.

02:00:53.370 --> 02:00:54.700
And if you're looking at the occluder

02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:58.710
between you and the two front
seats, that's even worse.

02:00:58.710 --> 02:01:01.400
So this is why staring out
the front windshield is great

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.760
but you don't want to fixate.

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:06.450
So, hopefully, I spared a
few people and, hopefully,

02:01:06.450 --> 02:01:08.510
a few cab drivers of
having people get sick

02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:10.323
in their cars or Ubers.

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:12.410
Let your visual system

02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:15.360
and your vestibular system work together.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:18.600
If appropriate, get into
linear acceleration,

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.850
and you'll improve your sense of balance.

02:01:20.850 --> 02:01:22.010
Once again, we've covered

02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:23.841
a tremendous amount of information.

02:01:23.841 --> 02:01:25.980
Now, you know how you hear,

02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.590
how you make sense of the
sounds in your environment,

02:01:29.590 --> 02:01:31.130
how those come into your ears

02:01:31.130 --> 02:01:33.440
and how your brain processes them.

02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:35.120
In addition, we talked about things

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.140
like low level white noise
and even binaural beats,

02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:40.780
which can be used to enhance
certain brain states,

02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:42.380
certain rhythms within the brain,

02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:44.610
and even dopamine release in ways

02:01:44.610 --> 02:01:46.840
that allow you to learn better.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.337
And we talked about the balance system

02:01:48.337 --> 02:01:49.955
and this incredible relationship

02:01:49.955 --> 02:01:52.980
between your vestibular apparatus,

02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:55.210
meaning the portions of your inner ear

02:01:55.210 --> 02:01:56.550
that are responsible for balance

02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:59.580
and your visual system and gravity.

02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:02.830
And you can use those to
enhance your learning as well,

During this episode, I
mentioned some supplements.

02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:33.830
We partnered with Thorne because Thorne

02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:35.870
has the very highest levels of stringency

02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:38.310
with respect to the quality
of their ingredients

02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:40.210
and accuracy about the amounts

02:02:40.210 --> 02:02:43.000
of those ingredients contained
within their products.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.520
If you'd like to see the
products that I take from Thorne,

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.830
you can go to T-H-O-R-N-E
dot com, slash the letter U

02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:50.900
slash Huberman.

02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:55.900
So that's thorne.com/u/huberman
to see all the supplements

02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.813
that I take.

02:02:56.813 --> 02:02:58.920
And if you do that, you can get 20% off

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:02.420
any of those supplements or
20% off any of the supplements

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:03.600
that Thorne makes.

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:05.713
For those of you that might want
to support us in other ways,

02:03:05.713 --> 02:03:07.330
we have a Patreon account.

02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:13.880
