00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
[offbeat uplifting music]

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.920
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.207
where we discuss science

00:00:03.207 --> 00:00:05.963
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.350
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.799
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.791
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.552
Today, we're talking all about fasting.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:20.270
And anytime we're talking about fasting,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.070
we are also talking about eating,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.740
because we all need to
eat sooner or later.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.038
We're going to talk about how fasting

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:29.216
and when we eat influences

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.343
a large range of aspects

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:35.590
of our health and wellbeing,
both physical and mental.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.760
So, well, nowadays,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.323
most people are familiar with
the term intermittent fasting,

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:43.651
also sometimes called
time-restricted feeding.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.082
I think most people
don't really understand

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:47.768
how that process works.

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:50.450
It's sort of obvious that
intermittent fasting,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.398
aka time-restricted feeding,

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:56.350
involves eating at certain
periods of each 24-hour cycle,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.812
or maybe even not eating for
entire days, in some cases.

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:03.345
But, if you think about it,
everybody sleeps eventually.

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:07.581
And therefore, because people
don't eat during their sleep,

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:10.640
almost everybody is employing some form

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.930
of intermittent fasting or
time-restricted feeding.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.420
What we're going to talk about today

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.384
is how particular schedules
of time restricted feeding

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:22.340
can impact our health in different ways.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.160
And when I say different ways, I mean,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.828
we're going to talk about
how intermittent fasting,

00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:30.588
aka time-restricted feeding,
impacts weight loss,

00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:32.317
fat loss in particular,

00:01:32.317 --> 00:01:36.630
muscle maintenance, and
loss and gain, organ health,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
such as gut health and
liver health, the genome,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200
the epigenome, inflammation,
sickness, recovery,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.870
and healing from sickness,
exercise, cognition,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.910
mood, and lifespan.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.420
So we're going to cover a
tremendous amount of information.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.390
I promise to make it
all directly accessible,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.740
regardless of whether or not you have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.026
a background in biology and
metabolic science or not.

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:04.710
I'm also going to talk
about a lot of tools.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.360
In fact, I'm going to discuss

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.451
a number of tools during today's episode

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.179
that actually make it such

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.988
that you don't have to
follow any feeding schedule,

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:16.550
or fasting schedule, same thing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.890
if you think about it,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.056
in any absolutely strict regimented way,

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:26.380
meaning if you were to only
eat during an eight hour period

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.860
of each day, most of the time,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.210
but then occasionally eat
across a 12 hour period

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.249
of the day,

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.700
in theory, that could
actually have pretty serious

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.260
detrimental health effects.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.705
And yet, there are things that you can do

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.310
to attenuate those negative effects.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.143
In fact,

00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:42.815
there are things that
you can do and or take

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:46.235
that can make it as if
you did not eat at all.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.324
And so we'll discuss what those tools are.

00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:51.660
And in many cases, for sake
of health, weight loss,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.520
and performance,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.595
making the body think that
it did not eat at all can

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:57.469
actually be quite beneficial.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.163
So today, we're going to cover mechanism

00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:01.050
and we're going to cover tools.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.140
Before we do that,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.820
I want to highlight a particular
result that was published

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.083
recently, because it
serves as a useful backbone

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:10.442
as we wade into the
conversation about fasting.

00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:12.930
This is a study that was published

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.880
in the journal Cell Metabolism:
A Cell Press Journal,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160
excellent journal.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.900
And the title of the paper
is "Fasting Blood Glucose

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.477
as a Predictor of Mortality:
Lost in Translation".

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:26.740
And I'll explain what
the "Lost in Translation"

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.736
part means in a moment.

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.827
But the basic takeaway of this study,

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:30.900
and I should mention that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.763
the first author of the
study is Palliyaguru,

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:34.596
PALLIYAGURU, guru,

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:40.317
Palliyaguru, et al.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.960
The basic finding of the
study is that in humans,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.960
higher blood glucose is
associated with mortality.

00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:54.300
And in fact, if you look at blood glucose,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.610
resting blood glucose across the lifespan,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.087
what you find is as people age,

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:00.850
resting blood glucose goes up.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.110
Now, this is very interesting,

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.330
because for a long time it was thought

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.950
that metabolism actually
goes down as we age.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.423
And to some extent, that's true,

00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:10.640
but the reductions in metabolism

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.000
are not nearly as robust
as we once thought

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.080
that they were across the lifespan.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.604
However, unless there's something done

00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:20.730
to mitigate the increase
in blood glucose associated

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.870
with the aging,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.309
almost everybody experiences a gradual,

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.280
but regular increase in
resting blood glucose

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.370
that predicts mortality.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.730
Now, the title, as I mentioned,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.720
is "Fasting Blood Glucose
as a Predictor of Mortality:

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.767
Lost in Translation".

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:38.630
And the reason that they
included "Lost in Translation"

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.768
in the title is that what I just told you,

00:04:40.768 --> 00:04:43.180
that increases in resting blood

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.300
glucose predict mortality, or
are correlated with mortality,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.858
is true for human beings

00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:50.607
and for non-human primates, monkeys.

00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:53.163
But the opposite is true in mice.

00:04:53.163 --> 00:04:54.970
And so I thought it was important

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.122
to use this study as an example

00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:59.647
of where it studies in mice often,

00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:02.249
but not always, translate to humans

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.230
and to non-human primates.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.500
So today, I'm going to be careful

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.150
to distinguish when a study

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.010
was performed in mice versus in humans,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.424
because it seems that at
least when discussing feeding,

00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:15.606
blood glucose and other aspects of diet

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.659
as they relate to health and wellbeing,

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.340
whether or not a study
was performed in rodents

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.960
or in humans can be very important.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.800
In this case,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.335
the results were directly
180 degrees opposite

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:29.110
to one another.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.270
In other words, in mice,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.148
resting blood glucose went down,

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:34.600
and was associated with mortality.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.630
So lower blood glucose
associated with mortality.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.463
Whereas in humans,

00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:40.250
higher resting blood glucose
was associated with mortality.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.120
And obviously,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.389
what we're mostly interested in is health

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.200
and wellbeing of ourselves, of humans.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.690
I'm sure there are some people
out there that are intensely

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.620
concerned about the health
and wellbeing of mice,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.156
which you could imagine

00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:54.610
a few rare contexts
where that's important,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.220
but obviously most of us are
interested in human health.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.130
So I'll be sure to emphasize
when studies were performed

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.210
in humans versus in mice.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.220
Before we begin,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.592
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

00:06:04.592 --> 00:06:07.355
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:08.680
It is, however,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.940
part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.930
to consumer information

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.030
about science and science-related tools

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.660
to the general public.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.700
In keeping with that theme,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.520
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.893
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:06:20.893 --> 00:06:23.237
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:25.687
that are the absolute highest quality.

00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:28.580
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.206
and how we see, and ROKA,

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:32.850
which is a company developed

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.050
by two all-American swimmers

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.080
from Stanford has developed eyeglasses

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.955
and sunglasses that take into
account the science of vision,

00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:41.698
and they've produced an
absolutely terrific product.

00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:43.284
That product involves glasses

00:06:43.284 --> 00:06:46.257
that, first of all, are very lightweight.

00:06:46.257 --> 00:06:49.811
Second of all, can be worn
when performing any activity.

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:52.830
They really are performance
eyeglasses and sunglasses.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.920
So whether or not you're sweating

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.880
or running around,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.490
whether or not you're working,
whether or not you're hiking,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.510
cycling, et cetera,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.400
you can wear them for
essentially any activity.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.750
The nice thing is they also
have a great aesthetic.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.999
So unlike a lot of other performance

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:05.927
sunglasses and eyeglasses out there

00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:07.300
that can make people

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.810
look more or less like
cyborgs, ROKA eyeglasses

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.240
and sunglasses look great,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.050
whether or not you're wearing
them to dinner or at work,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.010
or whether or not you're headed out

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.602
for a run or a cycle or
something of that sort.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.760
As I mentioned before,
they're extremely lightweight.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.671
They don't slip off.

00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.340
And that's true,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.968
regardless of what activity
you're engaging in.

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.889
If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to ROKA.com,

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.158
that's ROKA.com and

to save 20% off your first order.

00:07:31.888 --> 00:07:33.640
Today's podcast is also brought

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.941
to us by InsideTracker.

00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:37.930
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.500
that analyzes data from your blood

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.890
and DNA to help you better

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.780
understand your body and help
you meet your health goals.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.910
I've long been a believer

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.650
in getting regular blood work done,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.980
for the simple reason
that many of the processes

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.070
that are occurring in your body

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.930
that impact your immediate and

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.796
long-term health can only be assessed

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:55.490
from a quality blood test.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.654
And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

00:07:57.654 --> 00:07:59.284
you can also assess your genome

00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:01.340
and how that's impacting your immediate

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.286
and long-term health.

00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:04.900
The problem with a lot
of blood and DNA tests

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.963
is you get information back,

00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:08.270
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.560
And InsideTracker has solved that problem.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.953
They have a very easy to use dashboard

00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:13.703
so that when you get your results back,

00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:15.810
it will tell you, for instance,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.754
if your levels of a
particular metabolic factor

00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:19.790
or hormone are too high or too low,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.910
what you can do, what you can take,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.110
how you can change your nutrition

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.590
in order to adjust those levels

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.210
and get them where you want them to be.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.050
This is tremendously useful

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.330
and takes all the guesswork out

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.370
of what to do with biomarker information.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.464
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:08:33.464 --> 00:08:36.790

just use the code HUBERMAN at checkout.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.067
Today's episode is brought
to us by Helix Sleep.

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:46.150
Helix Sleep makes mattresses

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.520
and pillows that are tailored

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.100
to your unique sleep needs,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.782
and in doing so, provide
the best sleep possible.

00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.658
I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:54.988
about a year or so ago,

00:08:54.988 --> 00:08:57.381
and it is the best sleep
that I've ever had.

00:08:57.381 --> 00:08:58.804
If you go to the Helix site,

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.963
you take a brief two minute quiz,

00:09:00.963 --> 00:09:03.227
and that quiz asks you questions such as,

00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:05.140
do you tend to sleep on your stomach,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.210
your side, or your back?

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.140
Do you tend to run hot
or cold during the night?

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.070
Maybe you don't know,

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.920
and they match you to
a particular mattress

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.410
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.838
In my case, I matched to
the so-called Dusk mattress.

00:09:14.838 --> 00:09:17.750
I've been sleeping on a Dusk
mattress, and as I mentioned,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.176
it's absolutely terrific.

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:20.688
Best sleep I've ever had.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:24.409
It's really key to get a mattress
that's best suited to you.

00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:26.500
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.370
you can go to HelixSleep.com,
take that two minute quiz,

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.467
and they'll match you to a
customized mattress for you.

00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:35.690
And you'll get up to $200 off
any of your mattress orders,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.972
and you'll get two free pillows.

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:38.640
If you're interested in Helix Sleep,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.716
you can go to HelixSleep.com/huberman,

00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:42.862
and you get up to $200 off your mattress,

00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:44.530
and two free pillows.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.529
I'd like to point you
toward a valuable resource

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:51.065
that's also zero cost and
is available now online.

00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:53.784
This is an event that was recorded.

00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:55.978
The event was held by Logitech,

00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:58.466
and I was fortunate enough
to partake in this event.

00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:00.695
And the entire event
was centered around how

00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:02.433
to be a more effective learner

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:06.777
and teacher using the modern
principles of neuroplasticity.

00:10:06.777 --> 00:10:10.325
So at the link in the
caption for this episode,

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:14.410
you can go to what was called
the Rethink Education Event.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.645
And there, I gave a seminar
of about 20 or 30 minutes

00:10:17.645 --> 00:10:21.980
describing the modern
neuroscience of neuroplasticity,

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.180
the nervous system's ability

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.988
to change in response to experience.

00:10:24.988 --> 00:10:27.290
I focused mainly on human studies

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:31.627
and how different structures
and different things,

00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:33.000
and tools that one can

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.730
implement in the classroom and outside

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.650
of the classroom can lead to
faster and more pervasive,

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.930
longer lasting learning of
motor skills, music skills,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.556
mathematical skills,
language skills, et cetera,

00:10:44.556 --> 00:10:46.963
all based on quality
peer reviewed research.

00:10:46.963 --> 00:10:48.908
So if you'd like to check that out,

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:50.310
you can head to that link.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.149
You'll also see an example of
some of those tools in action,

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:57.039
in a music classroom of a
phenomenal music teacher,

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:00.625
Ben Edie, who's a teacher out in Pasadena,

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:02.260
who has applied these tools,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.222
at least to my knowledge,
for the first time ever.

00:11:04.222 --> 00:11:05.681
Of course, all the tools

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:06.830
that are there are listed out

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.895
in what I call a
plasticity super protocol,

00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:12.770
and all those tools can be applied

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.790
to learning and teaching in
any format that you like.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.730
So check it out.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.451
It's in the caption to
this week's episode,

00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.490
and it will remain there,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.482
it's up on YouTube and
I hope you enjoy it.

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:25.222
Okay, so let's talk
about feeding, fasting,

00:11:25.222 --> 00:11:27.434
health and performance.

00:11:27.434 --> 00:11:31.362
And I want to just establish
a few foundational terms

00:11:31.362 --> 00:11:33.721
so that we're all on the same page.

00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:34.800
First of all,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.756
rather than talk about fasting
or time restricted feeding,

00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:41.080
I'm largely going to talk
about time restricted feeding,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.342
but please understand that
time restricted feeding

00:11:43.342 --> 00:11:45.626
is just one side of the coin

00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:48.120
that is a two-sided coin

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.960
that includes fasting on the one hand,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.140
not eating, and time restricted
feeding on the other hand,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.180
I may occasionally say fasting,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.278
but because fasting and
eating establish different

00:11:58.278 --> 00:12:00.960
biological conditions in the body,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.060
time-restricted feeding

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.606
is the term that I will use to describe

00:12:04.606 --> 00:12:08.789
the overall plan of
restricting one's eating window

00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:13.789
as it's called to a particular
phase of each 24 hour day,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.360
or in some cases two particular
days within the week.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.573
Because as you'll soon learn,

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.947
there are aspects of
time restricted feeding,

00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:25.817
aka fasting, that involve
eating every other day,

00:12:25.817 --> 00:12:28.880
or eating one way for five days

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.210
and then fasting for
two days, and so forth.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.396
So I'll be very precise about
what I mean and why I mean it.

00:12:34.396 --> 00:12:36.450
But for the time being,

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.540
I'm going to refer to
time restricted feeding

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.433
as a way to put an umbrella
over this conversation.

00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:44.437
Second of all,

00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:47.848
I am going to emphasize a
lot of biological mechanism.

00:12:47.848 --> 00:12:49.703
If you've listened to this podcast before,

00:12:49.703 --> 00:12:53.590
you know that I always begin
with biological mechanism.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.936
I do describe tools of how to
implement those mechanisms,

00:12:56.936 --> 00:13:01.050
but I wholeheartedly believe
that knowing mechanisms

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.138
and understanding how these processes work

00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:05.300
gives you tremendous

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.172
flexibility and understanding,

00:13:07.172 --> 00:13:09.671
and control over the processes

00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.530
of your mental and physical health.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.862
Whereas if I were to just list off a menu

00:13:13.862 --> 00:13:17.952
of things to do and not
to do, those will work,

00:13:17.952 --> 00:13:20.900
but those will not give you the kind

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.960
of understanding that would allow you

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.590
to navigate through life, through travel,

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.935
through dinners out, through
different exercise schedules,

00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:32.210
whether or not you're one age
or another age, male, female,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.402
et cetera, I'm giving you mechanisms

00:13:34.402 --> 00:13:37.078
so that you can gain more
control over the systems

00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:38.775
in your brain and body.

00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:40.390
Everything's timestamped,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.030
so if you want to jump to the to do's,

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.270
you can certainly do that,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.740
but I encourage you to hang in
there for the mechanism bit.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.844
I will make it all very clear

00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:49.718
because if you understand mechanism,

00:13:49.718 --> 00:13:51.985
you are in a true place
of power and control

00:13:51.985 --> 00:13:53.332
over your biology.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:56.730
If ever there was a topic
that is controversial,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.050
especially on the internet,

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.760
it is that of diet and nutrition.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.769
So I'm wading into this
with a smile and in eager

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:07.430
anticipation of all the but but but this

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.742
and but but but that, and wait,

00:14:08.742 --> 00:14:10.376
but this showed that.

00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:11.960
Here's the deal,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.300
we need to precisely define

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.790
what it is that we're talking about

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.450
when we talk about nutrition.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.320
I'm going to give you an example

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.760
of a study that was
published a few years ago,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.580
2018, by a colleague of mine at Stanford,

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.940
Chris Gardner, he's a terrific professor

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.826
of nutrition and has done a lot

00:14:30.826 --> 00:14:33.843
of important studies on
how nutrition impacts

00:14:33.843 --> 00:14:35.863
different aspects of health.

00:14:35.863 --> 00:14:38.020
This is a large-scale study.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.660
It was published in JAMA,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.650
the Journal of the American
Medical Association,

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.690
one of the very top tier
journals in the area of medicine,

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.680
and certainly for a paper on nutrition

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.170
to show up there meant that it had

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.821
to meet an exceedingly high standard.

00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:56.260
This paper, where Chris
is the first author,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.872
it's Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA,

00:14:58.872 --> 00:15:03.643
looked at weight loss
in people following one

00:15:03.643 --> 00:15:06.703
particular diet versus
another particular diet.

00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:09.550
And this was a 12 month weight loss study.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.777
So it was focused
specifically on weight loss,

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:14.610
although they looked at some
other parameters as well.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.329
And the basic conclusion of the study was

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:19.450
that there was no significant difference

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.410
in weight change between
people following a healthy,

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.042
low fat diet versus a healthy,

00:15:24.042 --> 00:15:26.011
low carbohydrate diet with significantly

00:15:26.011 --> 00:15:28.459
more dietary fats in them.

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:31.217
This caused a lot of ripples

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:35.060
in the world of nutrition
and nutritional science,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.957
and certainly in the general population,

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:40.110
because anyone that understands diet

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.970
and nutrition would
immediately say, but wait,

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.268
there are all sorts of
different implications of eating

00:15:45.268 --> 00:15:48.637
one type of diet, say low
carbohydrate, higher fats,

00:15:48.637 --> 00:15:51.545
versus a higher
carbohydrate, lower fat diet.

00:15:51.545 --> 00:15:53.148
And indeed there are.

00:15:53.148 --> 00:15:55.202
This study was focused specifically

00:15:55.202 --> 00:15:58.607
on fat loss and on weight loss.

00:15:58.607 --> 00:16:03.400
So as we discuss time restricted feeding,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.254
we need to be very precise

00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:07.690
about what are the effects
of time restricted feeding,

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.820
and of eating in particular ways

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.180
at particular times, we are
going to emphasize again,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.940
whether or not the study was
done in mice or in humans,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.500
in athletes, in men, in women, or both,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.357
but the study from Gardner and colleagues

00:16:20.357 --> 00:16:21.715
is a beautiful study,

00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:23.337
and really emphasizes that

00:16:23.337 --> 00:16:26.863
if one's main goal is
simply to lose weight,

00:16:26.863 --> 00:16:31.601
then it really does not
matter what one eats provided

00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:34.653
that the number of calories burned

00:16:34.653 --> 00:16:38.180
is higher than the number
of calories ingested.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.930
However, anyone out there who understands

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.655
a little bit of biology,

00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:46.000
or a lot of biology will agree

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.272
that there are many factors

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:50.687
that impact that calories
burned part of the equation.

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:52.400
Some of those are obvious.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.337
So for instance,

00:16:53.337 --> 00:16:57.910
amount of exercise, type of
exercise, basal metabolic rate,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.039
how much energy one
burns just sitting there.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.398
I've talked before on this podcast

00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:04.800
about NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.969
where if people bounce around
a lot and fidget a lot,

00:17:06.969 --> 00:17:11.060
they can burn anywhere from
800 to 2,000 calories per day.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.142
So their quote-unquote
basal metabolic rate

00:17:13.142 --> 00:17:14.680
is actually much higher simply

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.620
because they're fidgeters,

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.360
whereas people who tend
to be more stationary

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.850
have a lower basal
metabolic rate, on average.

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.249
There's a great science to support this.

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:25.030
Metabolic factors and hormones

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.750
are also very important.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.746
Hormones, such as thyroid hormone

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:31.370
and insulin and growth hormone,

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.577
and the sex story to hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,

00:17:33.577 --> 00:17:36.197
those levels will also
profoundly influence

00:17:36.197 --> 00:17:39.341
the calories out, the
calories burned component

00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:42.161
of the calories in, calories out equation.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:45.450
So if out there on the internet

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.199
or in listening to a particular podcast

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.817
or speaker, somebody says,

00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:50.527
this is the ideal diet,

00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:53.310
or calories in, calories out does not

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.850
matter, or calories in calories out

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.054
is the only thing that matters.

00:17:56.054 --> 00:17:58.130
I think it's very important to understand

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.010
that there are some foundational truths,

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.990
such as calories in, calories out,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.286
but that of course,

00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:06.750
hormone factors and the context in which

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.226
a given diet regimen is taking place

00:18:09.226 --> 00:18:11.210
are exceedingly important.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.160
A good example of this would be puberty

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.180
at that time in life,

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.220
sex steroid hormones
are changing profoundly

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.260
in the body as our growth
hormone and other hormones.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.330
And much of caloric intake

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.679
is directed towards protein synthesis,

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.900
towards the production of muscle and bone

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.230
and other tissues of the body.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.140
And that's because of changes in hormones

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.530
that we call puberty.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.200
So, there's no way that we can drill

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.700
into every aspect of a given feeding plan

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.440
or feeding schedule that would allow us

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.360
to tap into every aspect of the list

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.720
that I read out before weight loss,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.700
fat loss, muscle organ, genome, epigenome,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.802
inflammation, exercise,
cognition, mood, and lifespan.

00:18:50.802 --> 00:18:53.110
But today, we're going to be very precise

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.378
about how time restricted feeding,

00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:58.500
it's very clear from both animal studies

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.382
and human studies

00:18:59.382 --> 00:19:03.433
can have a very powerful
and positive impact

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.660
on everything from weight loss

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.189
and fat loss to various health parameters.

00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:11.040
This is a beautiful literature

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.428
that's emerged mostly in
the last 10 or 15 years.

00:19:14.428 --> 00:19:16.710
And as we march into this literature,

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.166
what you'll see is that there actually

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:22.602
is a perfect diet for you on a given day.

00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:24.684
And that perfect diet for you on

00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:27.850
a given day is contextual,

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.017
meaning it depends on
what you did yesterday

00:19:30.017 --> 00:19:32.960
and what you're going to do tomorrow.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.556
So there is a perfect diet for you.

00:19:34.556 --> 00:19:35.900
And today, I'm going to arm you

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.170
with the mechanisms and understanding

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.620
that will allow you to define what

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.020
that perfect diet is

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.728
and will allow you to eat on a schedule

00:19:43.728 --> 00:19:46.260
and to eat the things that are going

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.641
to best serve your goals.

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:51.400
So let's talk about eating
and what happens when you eat,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.380
and let's talk about
fasting, or not eating,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.059
and what happens when you fast.

00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:58.596
I did an entire episode on eating

00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:01.620
and metabolism, and
hormones and other factors

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.198
that impact appetite.

00:20:03.198 --> 00:20:05.670
We don't have time to go
into all those details now,

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.071
although you're welcome to
listen to that episode as well,

00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:13.044
but we can briefly describe
the overall conditions

00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:15.369
that are set in the body when we eat

00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:17.825
and when we don't eat.

00:20:17.825 --> 00:20:20.498
The key word here is conditions.

00:20:20.498 --> 00:20:24.434
If I can emphasize anything
today, it's that what you eat

00:20:24.434 --> 00:20:28.935
and when you eat it set
conditions in your body,

00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:31.760
and those conditions can
be very good for you,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.195
or very bad for you,
depending on when you eat.

00:20:35.195 --> 00:20:40.195
In fact, when you eat is as
important as what you eat.

00:20:41.349 --> 00:20:43.250
I'll repeat that, when you eat

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.830
is as important as what you eat,

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.100
at least as it relates
to health parameters,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.380
in particular, liver
health and mental health.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.920
Some simple rules about eating.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.550
First of all, when you eat,
typically your blood glucose,

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.464
your blood sugar, will go up.

00:20:58.464 --> 00:21:01.310
Also, insulin levels will go up.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.010
Insulin is a hormone that's involved

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.954
in mobilizing glucose
from the bloodstream.

00:21:05.954 --> 00:21:09.670
How much your glucose and insulin go up

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.060
depends on what you eat
and how much you eat.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.060
In general, simple sugars,
including fructose from fruit,

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.490
but also sucrose and glucose,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.450
and simple sugars will raise your insulin

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.320
and blood glucose more
than complex carbohydrates.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.660
Things like grains, and breads,
and pastas, and so forth,

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.620
and grains, and breads, and
pastas, and so forth will raise

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.026
your blood glucose more
than fibrous carbohydrates,

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:37.643
like lettuce, and broccoli,
and things of that sort.

00:21:37.643 --> 00:21:40.630
Protein has a somewhat moderate

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.200
or modest impact on insulin and glucose,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.031
and fat has the lowest impact

00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:48.369
on raising your blood
glucose and blood insulin.

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:52.640
So what you eat will
impact how steep a rise

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.480
in blood glucose and insulin takes place.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.300
And there are a number of factors

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.240
that are related to your individual health

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.540
that will also dictate how steep

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.570
and how high that rise in
glucose and insulin will be.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.437
For the time being, I'm leaving

00:22:05.437 --> 00:22:08.380
out people who have type one diabetes.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.020
These are people that don't
manufacture their own insulin,

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.990
and type two diabetes is
essentially insulin insensitivity,

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.560
lack of sensitivity to insulin,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.880
which leads to high blood glucose.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.171
But, when you eat,

00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:24.810
blood glucose goes up
and when you don't eat,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.085
blood glucose and insulin go down.

00:22:27.085 --> 00:22:29.870
The longer it's been since your last meal,

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.773
the lower, typically,

00:22:30.773 --> 00:22:33.660
your blood glucose and insulin will be.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.660
And the higher, things like
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1,

00:22:40.053 --> 00:22:43.780
glucagon being a hormone
that's also secreted

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:48.780
when you are in a fasted state
or a low blood glucose state.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.210
It's involved in mobilizing
various energy sources

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.562
from the body, including fat
through what we call lipolysis,

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:58.560
also using carbohydrates,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.280
and potentially even using
muscle as a source of energy.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.250
So, that's kind of a fire hose

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.170
of information about what happens

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.130
when you eat and don't eat,

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.260
but just think of it this way, blood sugar

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.628
and insulin go up when you eat,

00:23:11.628 --> 00:23:13.350
they go down when you don't eat,

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.210
and other hormones go
up when you don't eat.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.059
So there are hormones associated
with the fasted state,

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:20.608
and there are hormones associated

00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:24.656
with the eating and
having just eaten state.

00:23:24.656 --> 00:23:27.090
Now, the most important thing

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.192
to understand is that,
like everything in biology,

00:23:31.192 --> 00:23:34.360
this is a process that takes time.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.237
So insulin and glucose go up when we eat,

00:23:37.237 --> 00:23:38.820
and it takes some period of time

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.020
for them to go down,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.431
even if we stop eating,

00:23:41.431 --> 00:23:44.150
they will remain up for
some period of time,

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.833
and then go back down, it takes time.

00:23:46.833 --> 00:23:48.650
This is very important,

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.140
because if you look at
the scientific literature

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.554
on fasting, on time-restricted feeding,

00:23:54.554 --> 00:23:58.096
it's absolutely clear
that the health benefits,

00:23:58.096 --> 00:24:00.430
not just the weight loss benefits,

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.940
but that the health benefits

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.130
from time-restricted feeding,

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.620
occur because certain conditions

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.400
are met in the brain and body
for a certain amount of time.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.062
And that gives us an anchor

00:24:12.062 --> 00:24:15.080
from which to view what eating

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.640
is in terms of how it sets
conditions in the body over time.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.940
And if that sounds overly
analytic, I promise you,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.110
this is the simplest

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.920
and best way to think
about any eating schedule

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.530
or any eating plan.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.172
So I think it's fair to say
that in the field of nutrition,

00:24:31.172 --> 00:24:34.013
there are a few landmark
studies that serve

00:24:34.013 --> 00:24:37.650
as really strong anchors for
building our understanding

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.717
of what to eat and what not to eat

00:24:39.717 --> 00:24:42.350
and when to eat, depending on our goals.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.360
The Gardner study that I mentioned earlier

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.100
is one such study,

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.114
in that it says if your
goal is weight loss,

00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:53.490
it really does not matter
what foods you consume,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.920
provided that you consume a
sub-maintenance, caloric diet.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.665
However, I want to emphasize again,

00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:04.230
that sets aside issues of adherence,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.680
meaning how easy or hard it
is to adhere to a given diet.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.160
Some people find it much easier

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.240
to follow a high fat,
low carbohydrate diet.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.184
Some people fall follow

00:25:12.184 --> 00:25:14.210
a different diet because it's much easier

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.600
for them to follow.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.930
And some people are concerned

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.010
with mental performance
and athletic performance.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.693
So that study doesn't
say there's a best diet,

00:25:21.693 --> 00:25:23.866
what it says is that what you consume

00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:28.640
is less important than the
amount of food that you consume,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.000
at least for sake of weight loss,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.670
not necessarily for sake of health.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.560
Now, the study that I'm going

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.210
to refer to next is what I would consider

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.050
the second major pillar
of nutritional studies.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.460
This is a truly landmark study

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.878
that was carried out by Satchin Panda,

00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:48.700
who is a professor at the Salk Institute

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.943
of Biological Studies in San Diego,

00:25:49.943 --> 00:25:52.910
an absolutely phenomenal institution,

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.969
and an absolutely phenomenal researcher.

00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:56.970
I've known Satchin for a number of years,

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.168
and I want to emphasize
that the current literature

00:26:00.168 --> 00:26:02.190
on intermittent fasting

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.707
and time restricted feeding can largely

00:26:03.707 --> 00:26:06.196
be attributed to Satchin

00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:08.210
and the work that he's done.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.585
There are others involved too, of course.

00:26:10.585 --> 00:26:12.760
And of course, time-restricted feeding

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.787
and fasting has a rich history
that goes back many hundreds,

00:26:15.787 --> 00:26:17.821
if not thousands of years
in different cultures

00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:19.350
and religions,

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.690
but the science of time-restricted
feeding can really mainly

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.306
be attributed to the incredible
work that Satchin has done.

00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:29.600
And I'm grateful to consider
him a friend and a colleague,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.550
and we consulted at length in
anticipation of this episode.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.200
I also hope to have him on
as a guest in the future.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.810
The landmark paper that
came from Satchin's lab

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.163
was published in 2012.

00:26:39.163 --> 00:26:42.027
This was a paper in
mice that set the basis

00:26:42.027 --> 00:26:45.010
for studies in humans that came later.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.010
And the title of this paper
is time-restricted feeding

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.420
without reducing caloric intake,

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.062
prevents metabolic diseases
in mice fed a high fat diet.

00:26:54.062 --> 00:26:56.520
So the title tells us a lot.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.350
It says that what's varied in this study

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.723
is not what these mice ate,
it was when they ate it.

00:27:02.723 --> 00:27:05.900
And there were essentially four conditions

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.093
in this study and the results
are absolutely remarkable.

00:27:09.093 --> 00:27:11.824
So I'm going to walk you
through the major results.

00:27:11.824 --> 00:27:15.221
What they did is they gave mice access

00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:16.955
to different types of food.

00:27:16.955 --> 00:27:18.870
There were four groups,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.490
one group of mice had access
to just a normal mouse diet.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.284
It would not be a diet that
you'd be very interested in.

00:27:25.284 --> 00:27:27.334
I confess I've actually tasted mouse chow.

00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:29.690
If you work with mice at
all, you just have to do it.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.510
At least once it doesn't taste very good,

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.660
it tastes like a very bland
Graham cracker cookie.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.280
And I confessed that. I only
had the tiniest little bit,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.541
but mice like that stuff.

00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:39.400
And if you allow them to eat that stuff,

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.580
what's called ad libitum
whenever they want,

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.020
you just keep it in their
food. 24 hours a day,

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.240
they will eat sometimes,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.870
and then they won't eat it at
other times, or in this case,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.670
they also had a condition where
they gave them mouse chow in

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.880
a time restricted way,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.831
just for a certain
number of hours each day,

00:27:55.831 --> 00:28:00.831
but about eight hours, or they
gave them a high-fat diet.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.320
That was a separate group,

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.850
got a high-fat diet at
any time they wanted.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.734
So this was kind of the
carnival for mice because mice

00:28:06.734 --> 00:28:09.690
really like high fat,
highly palatable foods.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.949
And so they got a lot of
goodies and high-fat in their

00:28:11.949 --> 00:28:12.950
food.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.530
And then there was a fourth
group that had access to the

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.950
high fat diet as much
as they wanted to eat,

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.870
but only during a restricted
time period of each 24 hour

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.570
cycle, now mice are nocturnal.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.423
Humans are what we call diurnal, actually,

00:28:25.423 --> 00:28:28.370
we're not really diurnal
we're crepuscular,

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.870
which means that we're most
active in the morning and in the

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.322
evening, not so much in the
afternoon, but nonetheless,

00:28:34.322 --> 00:28:39.210
everything I'm going to tell
you is true also for humans.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.624
And we know this now from human studies,

00:28:40.624 --> 00:28:42.783
one of the most important
things to take away from this

00:28:42.783 --> 00:28:46.688
study was that mice that ate
a highly palatable high-fat

00:28:46.688 --> 00:28:48.640
diet, a great tasting diet,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.110
but only during a restricted
feeding window of each 24 hour

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:56.110
cycle maintained or lost
weight over time, whereas mice

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.116
that ingested the same diet,
same amount of calories,

00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:04.644
but had access to those
calories around the clock,

00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:08.670
gained weight, became
obese and quite sick.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.312
And as an additional second point,

00:29:10.312 --> 00:29:14.150
the mice that restricted
their feeding window to a

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.686
particular portion of eight
hours of every 24 hour cycle

00:29:17.686 --> 00:29:22.190
actually showed some
improvement in important health

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.420
markers.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.640
And what was even more incredible
is that mice that only ate

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.264
during a particular feeding window,

00:29:29.264 --> 00:29:34.264
also experienced some reversal
of some prior negative health

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.600
effects.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.610
So this study really lit up the
world and got people excited

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.557
about time-restricted eating again.

00:29:41.557 --> 00:29:45.959
They use an eight hour feeding window.

00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:48.710
The story around that eight
hour feeding window is kind of

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:49.660
interesting though.

00:29:50.703 --> 00:29:52.620
Not many people know this
because it wasn't included in the

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.353
paper, and there was no reason
to include it in the paper,

00:29:56.322 --> 00:29:58.020
not to out anybody,

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.710
but it turns out that the
reason they used an eight hour

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.810
feeding window and not a nine
hour or a 10 hour feeding

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:04.643
window,

00:30:04.643 --> 00:30:08.980
is because studies of this sort
are actually quite demanding

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.950
to perform and require the
constant presence of the graduate

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:13.783
student,

00:30:13.783 --> 00:30:16.541
or post-doc there to ensure
that the food is in the cages at

00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:20.290
particular times and not in
the cages at other times.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.130
And mice are really good at hiding food.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.510
They'll even hide food in their jowls.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.930
And so there's a lot of work
that has to be done to prepare

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.650
for that eight hour feeding window.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.962
And to make sure after that
eight hour feeding window,

00:30:31.962 --> 00:30:35.330
there's all the food has been
removed from the cage and from

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.120
the jowls of the mice and so forth.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.540
And it turns out that the
significant other of the graduate

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.450
student and or postdoc,

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.170
I won't reveal who they were running.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.880
This study forbid their significant other,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.100
the scientist from being in
the lab for periods of time,

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.550
that were much longer than
the 10 or 12 hours that were

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.772
required in order to ensure
this eight hour feeding window.

00:30:57.772 --> 00:31:01.160
So when we hear the eight
hour feeding windows are holy,

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.547
they are not holy and later,

00:31:02.547 --> 00:31:06.730
we are going to talk about
how eating for a time that's

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.524
restricted to eight hours
versus 10 hours versus 12 hours.

00:31:09.524 --> 00:31:10.554
For instance,

00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:13.204
how that impacts various
parameters like health parameters

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:15.340
and weight loss, et cetera.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.465
But the eight hour feeding
window was actually created

00:31:17.465 --> 00:31:20.480
because of a real world
constraint on the research and the

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.507
relationship with the researcher
performing the research,

00:31:22.507 --> 00:31:25.217
not because there's anything
holy about an eight hour

00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:26.670
feeding window, now

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.532
an important point about
when the feeding window falls

00:31:29.532 --> 00:31:31.328
within the 24 hour cycle,

00:31:31.328 --> 00:31:35.322
it is very important that the
feeding window fall during the

00:31:35.322 --> 00:31:39.369
more active phase of
one's day, so for humans,

00:31:39.369 --> 00:31:43.550
that's typically in the early
part of the day or the later

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.383
part of the day,

00:31:44.383 --> 00:31:46.403
but not at night, put very simply,

00:31:46.403 --> 00:31:48.151
there are a lot of data now

00:31:48.151 --> 00:31:52.587
pointing to the fact that eating
during the nocturnal phase

00:31:52.587 --> 00:31:57.555
of the 24 hour cycle is very
detrimental to one's health.

00:31:57.555 --> 00:31:58.685
In fact,

00:31:58.685 --> 00:32:02.920
when we eat can either enhance
our health or can diminish

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.234
our health.

00:32:04.234 --> 00:32:08.135
When we see light can enhance
our feelings of wellbeing or

00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:10.590
can diminish our feelings of wellbeing.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.200
I've talked many times before about this,

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.021
on the human lab podcast,
that during the daytime,

00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:17.370
you want to get as much sunlight
and other types of bright

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.716
light in your eyes as safely possible.

00:32:18.716 --> 00:32:22.029
And then you want to avoid light
in the middle of the night.

00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:24.946
It has detrimental dopamine
lowering effects can cause

00:32:24.946 --> 00:32:27.880
depression, cortisol increases, et cetera.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.576
So when you view light is as
important as the light that you

00:32:30.576 --> 00:32:32.110
view.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:36.325
And when you eat is as important
as what you eat, in this

00:32:36.325 --> 00:32:40.107
study, they saw something
really interesting,

00:32:40.107 --> 00:32:44.500
which was that not only did
restricting food to a particular

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.174
phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit,

00:32:46.174 --> 00:32:51.174
things like lean body mass
and fat loss and a number of

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.880
health parameters that we'll
talk about in a moment,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.127
but it also anchored all the
gene systems of the body and

00:32:57.127 --> 00:33:01.890
provided a more regular stable
so-called circadian rhythm or

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.671
24 hour rhythm, you may be
surprised to learn that 80%,

00:33:05.671 --> 00:33:10.671
80% of the genes in your
body and brain are on a 24

00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:13.870
hour schedule.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.809
That is they change their levels
going from high to low and

00:33:16.809 --> 00:33:19.940
back to high again,
across the 24 hour cycle.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.900
And when those genes are high
at the appropriate times and

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.250
low at the appropriate times,

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.220
meaning their expression is
high and low at the appropriate

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.120
times.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.560
And therefore the proper RNAs
and proteins are made because

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.573
DNA codes for RNA, RNA is
translated into proteins.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.420
When that happens, your health benefits,

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.756
when those genes are not
expressed at the right times when

00:33:42.756 --> 00:33:46.240
they're higher or low at the
wrong times of each 24 hour

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.818
cycle, that's when you get
negative health effects.

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:52.610
This study showed that when
mice restrict their eating to an

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:56.750
eight hour period within the
most active phase of their 24

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.002
hour cycle,

00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:01.100
many of the genes that are
associated with these so-called

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.255
circadian clocks, these genes
have names like PER, BMAL,

00:34:04.255 --> 00:34:06.670
CRY1, et cetera,

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.493
those so-called clock genes
underwent a very regular

00:34:10.493 --> 00:34:15.270
entrainment, a locking in to
the proper 24 hour schedule.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.264
And while this was in mice,

00:34:16.264 --> 00:34:19.170
we now know that this
also occurs in humans,

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.878
I've said before on this
podcast, and I'll say it again,

00:34:21.878 --> 00:34:23.020
that light,

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.850
and when we view light is the
primary way in which these

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.090
genes and the clock systems
of our body get organized or

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.320
entrained, meaning matched to
the outside light dark cycle.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.780
So viewing light early in
the day and in the afternoon,

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.580
and as much as possible all day, great,

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.410
ideally that sunlight, avoiding
light in the middle of the

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.357
night is also great.

00:34:41.357 --> 00:34:46.180
It's great because it causes
the increases in particular

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.620
genes and the decreases in
particular genes in every cell

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.394
throughout your body at
the appropriate times,

00:34:50.394 --> 00:34:54.710
the second most powerful
timekeeper or zeitgeber, as it's

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:59.710
called, is food, and when
you eat, and in this study,

00:35:00.221 --> 00:35:03.210
the results they saw
underscore this point,

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.239
what they saw is that the peaks
in these clock genes became

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:07.830
very regular.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.610
And the dips in these clock
genes became very regular.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.867
And that led to a whole
host of really important,

00:35:13.867 --> 00:35:16.099
positive health effects.

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:18.387
Conversely, when mice ate,

00:35:18.387 --> 00:35:20.669
whenever they wanted
across the 24 hour cycle,

00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:23.929
these clock genes became
really out of whack and the

00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:28.367
negative health consequences
were the downstream result of

00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:31.787
these changes in these clock genes.

00:35:31.787 --> 00:35:35.140
This is now also been shown
to be true for humans.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.130
So if you want to be healthy,
you want your organ health,

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.846
your metabolic health to
be in trained properly.

00:35:41.846 --> 00:35:43.470
One of the most important
things you can do is to,

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.050
if you lied at the appropriate
times of each 24 hour

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.380
schedule and to not view
light at other times of that

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.040
schedule and to eat at the
appropriate time of each 24 hour

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.760
day.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.593
Now, again,

00:35:54.593 --> 00:35:57.079
there are rare instances that
we will discuss when skipping

00:35:57.079 --> 00:36:00.595
entire days or entire 24
hour cycles of eating can be

00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:01.990
beneficial.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.830
But for now we're talking
about schedules of time

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.663
restricted

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:08.550
feeding involve a window of
feeding that falls during

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.790
your more active phase,
so during the daytime,

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.923
putting aside people that work
shift work during the daytime

00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:15.503
is when you want to eat.

00:36:15.503 --> 00:36:19.593
And this eight hour feeding
window provided a very strong

00:36:19.593 --> 00:36:24.250
reinforcing signal that combines
with light to ensure that

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.555
these genes are expressed
at the appropriate times.

00:36:26.555 --> 00:36:29.883
The short takeaway from this
is you probably want to think

00:36:29.883 --> 00:36:34.290
about and perhaps even engage
in time, restricted feeding.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.350
So, as I mentioned earlier,

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.420
when mice can eat around the
clock, bad things happen.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.270
And one of the bad things
that happens is that the liver

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:45.300
suffers, the liver is involved
in all sorts of things,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.283
production of important hormones
and other factors related

00:36:47.283 --> 00:36:49.010
to metabolism.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.442
And when mice can eat around the clock,

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:54.553
their livers got very sick,
fatty deposits in the liver.

00:36:54.553 --> 00:36:58.050
Other factors in the liver
essentially taken down the

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.341
pathway of liver disease,
the time restricted feeding,

00:37:01.341 --> 00:37:04.815
essentially reversed that or
led in many cases to an even

00:37:04.815 --> 00:37:07.262
healthier liver conditions,
and that's based on this study,

00:37:07.262 --> 00:37:10.531
but also additional
studies also now in humans.

00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:14.240
So restricting your feeding
to a particular window,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.710
every 24 hour cycle has clearly
been shown now in mice and

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:22.234
in humans to enhance liver
health, which is wonderful.

00:37:22.234 --> 00:37:27.234
How does it do this, well, it
happens because food intake,

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.520
as I mentioned earlier,

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.660
sets certain conditions in the
body that lasts for a period

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.800
of time.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.930
Anytime we eat,

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.671
whether or not we are a
mouse or a human, there's

00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:39.860
a period of time that's required
for so-called digestion,

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.052
but also gastric emptying and
other processes related to

00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:45.700
breaking down that food and utilizing it.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.759
And that is an active
process. It requires energy.

00:37:48.759 --> 00:37:53.759
And that process of breaking
down food involves certain

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:59.020
cellular functions that if
they're ongoing throughout the 24

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.743
hour cycle or even extended
too far across the 24 hour

00:38:02.743 --> 00:38:06.329
cycle, meaning you're eating
across a 14 or a 16 hour,

00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:10.180
an 18 hour window, that
causes serious problems.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.773
And this is now been established
because of the fact that it

00:38:13.773 --> 00:38:18.100
increases the expression of
different proteins and genes in

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.070
the body, as such as
TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.300
what are all those things?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.540
They are pro-inflammatory markers.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.836
So the reason that the liver
gets sick when you're eating

00:38:26.836 --> 00:38:30.670
too often is because inflammatory
markers are increased.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:34.170
These inflammatory markers
are not inherently bad,

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.171
they're there for a reason,

00:38:35.171 --> 00:38:38.470
but they are there in
order to respond to certain

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.208
challenges, immune challenges,

00:38:40.208 --> 00:38:42.930
or the ingestion of food
and the breakdown of food.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.930
But then in an ideal circumstance,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.418
they are reduced in the period
in which there's no food

00:38:49.418 --> 00:38:52.110
present in the digestive
tract or in which there's very

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.430
little food present in
the digestive tract.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.595
So by eating around the clock,

00:38:55.595 --> 00:38:59.070
you're making yourself sicker
by eating at restricted

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.090
periods of time, each 24 hours a day,

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.870
you're actually making
yourself healthier and you're

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:08.174
activating certain processes
that can positively impact both

00:39:08.174 --> 00:39:11.750
weight, either maintenance
or loss of weight.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.590
We'll talk about weight gain
a little later and positively

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.060
impacting things like liver health.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.755
Also the expression of different
things related to brown

00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:21.810
fat, the fat that
increases your metabolism.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.843
We will return to this also
a little bit later and blood

00:39:24.843 --> 00:39:29.126
glucose regulation, so the
takeaway from this study,

00:39:29.126 --> 00:39:31.150
in fact, there are many
takeaways from the study.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.844
It's so wonderful is that liver health,

00:39:34.844 --> 00:39:39.566
bile acid metabolism, energy
expenditure inflammation,

00:39:39.566 --> 00:39:43.000
liver metabolites, many,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.660
many aspects of our health
are impacted by when we eat,

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.230
not just what we eat, as we move forward,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.779
and we talk about intermittent
fasting for eight hour

00:39:51.779 --> 00:39:53.490
windows, six hour windows,

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.690
12 hour windows for all sorts
of different intents and

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:57.720
purposes.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.153
I want to start to establish
a foundational protocol that

00:40:01.153 --> 00:40:02.560
all of us,

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.463
any of us can use in order
to maximize your particular

00:40:05.463 --> 00:40:07.061
goals.

00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:10.480
There are some absolutes
within this realm of

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.475
time-restricted feeding.

00:40:12.475 --> 00:40:15.070
Here are a couple of absolutes
that you would want to

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.693
consider, first of all,

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:22.017
it pays off in the metabolic
sense and in the health sense

00:40:22.017 --> 00:40:27.017
and in the weight maintenance
or loss sense to not ingest

00:40:27.081 --> 00:40:32.081
any food in the first hour
after waking and potentially for

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.930
longer, so I want to repeat that.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.717
One of the key pillars of
intermittent fasting is that for

00:40:36.717 --> 00:40:38.170
the first hour

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.130
after you wake up and potentially
for longer to not ingest

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.503
any food, okay,

00:40:43.503 --> 00:40:47.120
the second major pillar that's
well supported by research is

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:52.120
that for the two and ideally
three hours prior to bedtime,

00:40:52.385 --> 00:40:57.240
you also don't ingest any food
or liquid calories for that

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.073
matter.

00:40:58.073 --> 00:41:00.357
And we will talk about what
it means to break a fast and

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:02.410
whether or not certain liquids,

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.730
even coffee and tea can
break a fast, et cetera,

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:08.128
in a few moments, but
just as a foundation,

00:41:08.128 --> 00:41:11.429
it's very clear from the research
in humans that not eating

00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:15.259
any food or ingesting any
calories liquid or otherwise for

00:41:15.259 --> 00:41:18.859
the first 60 minutes
after waking up each day.

00:41:18.859 --> 00:41:23.859
And for the two to three
hours prior to your bedtime,

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.220
that's ideal for the
parameters that we've discussed

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.053
earlier,

00:41:28.053 --> 00:41:30.260
all the different things like
weight and liver health and

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.962
metabolic health and so forth.

00:41:31.962 --> 00:41:34.693
The two most common questions
about intermittent fasting are

00:41:34.693 --> 00:41:38.080
when is the ideal time
for the eating window?

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:38.913
Is it early in the day,

00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:41.160
the middle of the day or later in the day?

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.940
And how long should that eating window be?

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.866
Should it be eight hours?

00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:47.760
We already heard why the
eight hour window was first

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.750
established.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.090
It was because of these lab
conditions and the conditions of

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.250
the particular relationship
of the graduate student

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.083
involved,

00:41:54.083 --> 00:41:56.330
or should it be seven hours
or six hours or 12 hours.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:00.220
It turns out that there's some
general frameworks that we

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.377
can follow in order to
answer these questions.

00:42:02.377 --> 00:42:04.516
As we move into this
portion of the discussion,

00:42:04.516 --> 00:42:07.759
I want to highlight a very
important reference that just

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:09.350
came out,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.930
literally came out last week
in the journal endocrinology

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.060
reviews.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.120
And the title of this review
is time-restricted eating for

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.762
the prevention and management
of metabolic diseases.

00:42:19.762 --> 00:42:24.610
Although the data in this
paper go well beyond metabolic

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.890
diseases, this is a paper
from Satchin Panda's lab.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:31.570
It's a very lengthy review
with an enormous table

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.520
that's beautifully organized
that scripts out all the

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.126
studies done in humans.

00:42:37.126 --> 00:42:40.260
Well over a hundred
studies looking at time,

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.818
restricted feeding in
athletes, men, women, children,

00:42:42.818 --> 00:42:45.067
diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,

00:42:45.067 --> 00:42:48.302
with detailed references and
description of the outcomes.

00:42:48.302 --> 00:42:50.460
I've spent a lot of time with this review,

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.895
even though it just came out
recently and is a absolute

00:42:52.895 --> 00:42:54.547
goldmine resource.

00:42:54.547 --> 00:42:57.490
It is also the major resource
for everything I'm about to

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.176
tell you if you would like
to delve deeper into the

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.182
material.

00:43:00.182 --> 00:43:04.290
So let's deal with this first
question of when is the ideal

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.230
feeding window, and here again,

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.560
we're thinking about a schedule
of eating that involves

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.777
eating at least once every 24 hours,

00:43:11.777 --> 00:43:15.534
not two day or three day
or every other day fast.

00:43:15.534 --> 00:43:18.640
So it turns out that the
answer to the question,

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.197
when is it best to eat is
actually best answered by thinking

00:43:22.197 --> 00:43:24.300
about the other side of the coin,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.797
which is when is it best to fast?

00:43:26.797 --> 00:43:29.973
So, because we are fasting during sleep,

00:43:29.973 --> 00:43:34.730
it's very clear that it's best
to extend the sleep-related

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.730
fast either into the morning
or to start it in the evening.

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:42.580
Now this might seem kind of obvious,

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.494
but it's actually not so obvious.

00:43:44.494 --> 00:43:48.500
You could place that feeding
window early in the day,

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.090
middle of the day or late in the day.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.651
Let's think about what happens
when we sleep, when we sleep,

00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:57.370
our body undergoes a number
of different processes in the

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:01.049
brain and body in order to
recover the cells and tissues.

00:44:01.049 --> 00:44:03.170
Many of you have probably
heard of autophagic,

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.250
which is essentially a cleaning
up a gobbling up of dead

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.540
cells and cells that are injured or sick.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.143
And this is a natural process that occurs,

00:44:11.143 --> 00:44:13.510
and it occurs mainly during sleep.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.443
Although not only during sleep,

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:19.388
fasting of any kind does tend

00:44:19.388 --> 00:44:21.420
to enhance autophagy.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.830
It is not the only way to
create autophagic conditions.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:29.380
Autophagic conditions can be
created simply by following a

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.710
sub caloric diet.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.919
And there are other things
that one can do in order to

00:44:32.919 --> 00:44:36.840
trigger autophagy, but fasting
does trigger autophagy.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.290
So when we're asleep,

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.399
the bad cells are getting
gobbled up and eaten.

00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:44.590
And the good cells also are
undergoing certain repair

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.460
mechanisms mainly related to,

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.330
or at least governed by those
circadian genes that we talked

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:50.818
about earlier, those clock genes.

00:44:50.818 --> 00:44:55.769
So you're already fasting when
you're asleep and how deep

00:44:55.769 --> 00:44:58.516
you are into that fast depends
on how long it was since your

00:44:58.516 --> 00:45:00.382
last meal.

00:45:00.382 --> 00:45:03.622
So if you fast early in the day,

00:45:03.622 --> 00:45:08.420
and you've been asleep
for 5, 6, 7, 8 hours,

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.730
I would hope somewhere between
six and eight hours for most

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.181
people is going to be beneficial.

00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:14.217
When you wake up,

00:45:14.217 --> 00:45:17.270
I mentioned earlier that you
don't want to eat for at least

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:19.240
the first 60 minutes after waking,

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.724
but were you to extend
that fasting to say,

00:45:21.724 --> 00:45:23.980
9:00 AM 10:00 AM,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.128
11:00 AM or even 12 noon or
later you are taking advantage

00:45:28.128 --> 00:45:31.950
of the deep, fast that
you were in during sleep.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.720
And certainly toward
the end of sleep, now,

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.960
why do I say deep, fast?

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.619
Well,

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:40.157
because when we eat the clearance
of that food from our gut

00:45:40.157 --> 00:45:44.380
and the processes in our cells
and organs that are related

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.340
to digestion,

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.530
and the utilization of that
food takes about five to six

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:55.530
hours, so if you eat a meal
and that meal lasts 10 minutes,

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.629
20 minutes or 30 minutes, or even an hour,

00:45:57.629 --> 00:46:00.540
and then you stop eating,
you've stopped eating,

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.240
but you are not fasting at that point.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.220
You can say you're fasting
because you're no longer putting

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.862
food into your digestive tract,

00:46:06.862 --> 00:46:09.510
but you're not in a fasted state.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.770
You are not under conditions
of fasting, later,

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.680
I'll talk about things that
you can do to accelerate the

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:15.864
transition into fasting.

00:46:15.864 --> 00:46:19.809
So one thing is certain, that
you want your eating window to

00:46:19.809 --> 00:46:24.809
be tacked or attached to your
sleep based fasting in a way

00:46:25.745 --> 00:46:29.462
that makes it easier for you
to get into the fasted state

00:46:29.462 --> 00:46:31.330
for a period of time.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:36.138
So we can view that point
from the perspective of best,

00:46:36.138 --> 00:46:38.944
better and worst, okay?

00:46:38.944 --> 00:46:42.059
So if you are like most
people and you sleep at night,

00:46:42.059 --> 00:46:44.268
you're waking up somewhere
around 6:30, 7:00 AM,

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.950
or maybe even 8:00 AM.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.405
Let's say you were to push
your fasting window out,

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:52.870
such that you started eating at noon,

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:56.716
and then you stopped eating at 6:00 PM.

00:46:56.716 --> 00:46:57.980
Well,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.820
then you're not eating from
6:00 PM until let's say your

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.630
bedtime is 10:00 PM, but
from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM,

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.792
your body is not yet in a fasted
state because you just ate.

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:09.872
However,

00:47:09.872 --> 00:47:12.873
you're starting to taper into
a fastest state before sleep

00:47:12.873 --> 00:47:15.040
and then all through sleep.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.878
And until the next
morning and late morning,

00:47:16.878 --> 00:47:20.300
you are actually in a fasted state, now,

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.243
most people find it very hard
to only eat in the middle of

00:47:22.243 --> 00:47:25.081
the day, so while that's best,

00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:27.700
it's ideal for sake of the fasting

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.484
related improvements in health,

00:47:29.484 --> 00:47:31.060
it is not ideal.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.440
And it's not very applicable
to most work and family and

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.481
social situations.

00:47:36.481 --> 00:47:39.680
Most people eat breakfast with others and,

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.147
or eat dinner with others.

00:47:41.147 --> 00:47:44.337
Some people eat lunch with
others, but in general,

00:47:44.337 --> 00:47:46.586
it's hard to restrict your
feeding window to just the

00:47:46.586 --> 00:47:48.380
absolute middle of the day,

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.530
but from a purely health perspective,

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.463
in a very objective way, that
would be the ideal situation.

00:47:53.463 --> 00:47:56.840
Let's imagine a different
pattern of eating where the

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.840
feeding window starts in the
afternoon starts around two or

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.120
even 3:00 PM.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.200
Some people don't have much
trouble or they can train

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.138
themselves to get their
feeding window out to two or

00:48:07.138 --> 00:48:11.320
3:00 PM, and then they won't
eat until 10 or 11:00 PM.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.290
Right, if you do the math,

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.720
you realize that that feeding
window is still pretty short.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.600
It still constitutes what we
would call intermittent fasting

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.708
or time restricted feeding.

00:48:18.708 --> 00:48:22.220
But assuming that they go
to bed around 11:00 PM or

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.730
midnight,

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:27.759
they are not actually fasted
in sleep because for the first

00:48:27.759 --> 00:48:30.960
six hours or so of sleep, maybe five,

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.440
but probably more like six hours of sleep,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.724
they're still digesting the
food that they consumed a late

00:48:34.724 --> 00:48:36.163
in the night.

00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:41.163
It does appear beneficial
to grab a hold of that

00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:44.020
sleep-related fast,

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.260
meaning you don't want your
feeding window to be too close

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.093
to bedtime.

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:51.480
And that's why we came up
with this kind of foundational

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.910
pillar that I discussed
with such an earlier,

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.666
which is at least no eating for
the first hour after waking,

00:48:56.666 --> 00:49:01.666
but also no eating within two
to three hours prior to bed.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.616
And because we all need to
sleep and sleep is seemingly

00:49:03.616 --> 00:49:06.627
important for our health of all kinds.

00:49:06.627 --> 00:49:08.780
You want to prioritize sleep,

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.133
but because we also have to eat,

00:49:10.133 --> 00:49:13.340
then you start to think about
this and maybe it's not so

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.290
good to push that feeding
window too late in the day,

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.810
because when you go to sleep,

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.994
you're not actually capitalizing
on the sleep related

00:49:19.994 --> 00:49:21.260
fasting.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.310
Now it's not just the case
that it's easiest to fast while

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.580
in sleep, although that's true
because when we're asleep,

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.490
typically we're not hungry or
looking for food or foraging

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.367
for food or wanting food
or trying to resist food.

00:49:31.367 --> 00:49:33.305
We're just sleeping.

00:49:33.305 --> 00:49:36.730
There is something special
about the fasting that occurs

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:37.830
during sleep,

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.453
because it's associated with
a number of processes that

00:49:40.453 --> 00:49:43.450
relate to the so-called lymphatic system,

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:46.940
the movement of lymph like
fluids and other fluids through

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.110
the brain, and kind of sweeping
out a garbage disposal,

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:50.943
if you will,

00:49:50.943 --> 00:49:53.670
a clearing out of the metabolic
debris and some of the

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:58.059
autophagy that's associated
with bad processes in the brain.

00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:00.340
So we could do a whole episode on this,

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.410
but essentially during
sleep, and in particular,

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.471
during fasted states of sleep,

00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:09.048
we are undergoing a number
of automatic seller processes

00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:13.310
that clear out debris from
our brain enhance cognition,

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.720
or at least offset dementia.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.430
This is now well-established
as well as a number of the same

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:19.900
processes occurring in
the organs of our body.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.630
So what we're starting to
see here is that there are a

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.842
number of constraints on
when you can eat, now,

00:50:24.842 --> 00:50:28.040
I would be remiss if I
didn't acknowledge the social

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.198
constraints and the real
life constraints, some of us,

00:50:30.198 --> 00:50:34.070
because we want to eat with
our family and because our

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:36.590
family or our significant
others eat around eight or

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.360
9:00 PM, and that's the
only time we're together,

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.610
You have to eat late in the day.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.930
And that certainly not a sin.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:43.407
I'm not saying that's good or bad, here

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:46.950
we're trying to establish
if you recall, best, better,

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.080
and worst.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.340
So from both a practical and
a health perspective and a

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.507
purely objective view of how
intermittent fasting works and

00:50:55.507 --> 00:51:00.450
can benefit us, starting to eat each day,

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:04.515
somewhere around 10:00 AM or around noon,

00:51:04.515 --> 00:51:08.982
and then allowing a feeding
window that goes until six or

00:51:08.982 --> 00:51:11.034
maybe 8:00 PM.

00:51:11.034 --> 00:51:13.156
That seems to me,

00:51:13.156 --> 00:51:15.662
at least based on the data
and what I understand about

00:51:15.662 --> 00:51:17.120
typical cultures,

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.093
where people eat in the
daytime and in the evening,

00:51:21.093 --> 00:51:24.960
that seems to me like the kind
of schedule that will allow

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.326
you to get the most out
of intermittent fasting,

00:51:27.326 --> 00:51:29.432
time-restricted feeding,

00:51:29.432 --> 00:51:33.320
but does not set you up to be
really out of sync with the

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.813
social rhythms in most cultures.

00:51:35.813 --> 00:51:39.670
If you think about it from the
perspective of say a noon to

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:41.590
eight feeding window,

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.660
what you'll find is that
you're able to eat lunch with

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.770
others.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.030
If you like, or by yourself,

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.726
you will be able to eat
dinner at a reasonable hour,

00:51:49.726 --> 00:51:51.911
at least in most countries,
in most cultures,

00:51:51.911 --> 00:51:56.788
eating dinner somewhere
between 6:30 and 7:00 PM is

00:51:56.788 --> 00:51:57.943
typical.

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.370
When you say a feeding
window, that goes until eight.

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:03.970
That doesn't mean sitting
down to dinner at eight.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.770
That means your last bite of
food or ingestion of any liquid

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:09.099
calories was at 8:00 PM.

00:52:09.099 --> 00:52:12.620
Assuming that you go to bed
somewhere between 10:00 PM and

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.950
1:00 AM that allows this tapering off,

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.440
or this transition from
feeding to a fasted state,

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.090
and still allows you to capitalize
on the special period of

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:24.920
fasting that is sleep-related fasting.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.753
And again,

00:52:25.753 --> 00:52:27.390
I want to emphasize that the
fasting that occurs during

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.227
sleep is vital and eating too
close to sleep will disrupt

00:52:30.227 --> 00:52:33.215
that fasting related sleep.

00:52:33.215 --> 00:52:34.048
Now,

00:52:34.048 --> 00:52:36.541
there are a number of caveats
and details related to this,

00:52:36.541 --> 00:52:40.699
and there's an important caveat
in detail related to people

00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:44.747
that are specifically
interested in increasing or

00:52:44.747 --> 00:52:46.298
maintaining muscle mass.

00:52:46.298 --> 00:52:51.217
So first let's talk about food
volume and food type and how

00:52:51.217 --> 00:52:56.217
that relates to whether or not
you quickly or slowly enter a

00:52:56.551 --> 00:52:58.230
fasted state.

00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:01.056
Because clearly when we
talk about a feeding window,

00:53:01.056 --> 00:53:03.810
that feeding window could
include any number of different

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.020
foods, it could involve
cake and ice cream, pizza,

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.242
hamburgers, plants, fruit, whatever it is,

00:53:09.242 --> 00:53:13.197
or it could involve just fats
or just proteins, et cetera.

00:53:13.197 --> 00:53:16.529
There are at least three
factors that are going to govern

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:21.064
how quickly you transition
from ingesting food to a fasted

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:22.383
state, remember,

00:53:22.383 --> 00:53:26.396
as you ingest your last
bite or sip of calories,

00:53:26.396 --> 00:53:28.490
that's not when the fast begins.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:31.133
That might be when the fastening
begins on your watch or on

00:53:31.133 --> 00:53:33.250
one of these apps that
I'll refer to later,

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.375
which can help you track your
fasting and eating windows.

00:53:35.375 --> 00:53:38.472
But that's not when it actually
begins because your body is

00:53:38.472 --> 00:53:40.220
still seeing food.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.150
You're actually carrying
around food inside of you,

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:44.813
even though you're not
putting into your mouth,

00:53:44.813 --> 00:53:48.000
you're still eating in some sense.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.979
So it should be somewhat obvious
that very large meals are

00:53:50.979 --> 00:53:53.780
going to take longer to
digest than very small meals.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.929
So that will impact how slowly
or quickly you migrate from a

00:53:57.929 --> 00:54:01.082
fed state to a fasted state.

00:54:01.082 --> 00:54:04.779
There's no way I can spell out
what exact volume of food you

00:54:04.779 --> 00:54:07.680
should ingest based on the
size of your stomach and et

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.550
cetera, but you're all familiar
with being extremely full,

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:15.150
very full, comfortably
full, somewhat full,

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.636
or not feeling full and feeling hungry.

00:54:17.636 --> 00:54:20.922
So learning to gauge
food volume is important.

00:54:20.922 --> 00:54:25.922
Also foods that include some
fats or a lot of fats will tend

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.019
to slow gastric emptying time.

00:54:28.019 --> 00:54:31.010
And depending on the kind of fats,

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.370
it could mean that a given
meal is digested within three

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.417
hours versus five hours.

00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:38.570
And more fats might be a large
meal with a lot of fats has

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:39.960
been, can take five or six hours.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.300
A smaller meal with less fat
is going to be digested more

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.426
quickly consuming calories in
liquid form is going to mean

00:54:45.426 --> 00:54:47.868
that gastric emptying time
is going to be faster.

00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:49.300
And then of course,

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.010
there's the glucose and
the insulin aspect to it,

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.051
which is that foods that lead
to big steep rises in glucose

00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:56.919
like pure sugars.

00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:59.550
Then your glucose will drop, however,

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:00.860
if they're combined with fats,

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.160
then it tends to be a more
gradual rise in glucose and it's

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.580
more sustained, et cetera.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.714
Fibrous foods will also create
a more long lasting sustained

00:55:07.714 --> 00:55:09.453
release in glucose.

00:55:11.027 --> 00:55:14.230
The important thing here is
to establish a feeding window

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.330
that you can comfortably manage, okay?

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:18.830
Meaning that on average,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:22.600
you can obey a six hour
feeding window or an eight hour

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.830
feeding window or a 10
hour feeding window.

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:29.150
And then to place that feeding
window in a social and life

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:32.680
context that you can manage
on a regular basis, now,

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.330
there are two key points that
have been gleaned from the

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.286
scientific data about this
feeding window and when to place

00:55:38.286 --> 00:55:39.370
it.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.160
And this is based on a
really important experiment

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.130
that Satchin and his
colleagues have been doing.

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:47.280
There's a website that they
have zero-cost website called My

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.461
Circadian Clock, you can go
to this website free of cost.

00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:52.700
There are a number of
important resources there,

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.680
but what they've done is
they've examined the feeding

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.382
behavior of thousands of people.

00:55:58.382 --> 00:56:00.685
People will take a picture of
the food they're about to eat,

00:56:00.685 --> 00:56:03.860
and it enters into their
account, maybe your account,

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.470
if you create one on My
Circadian Clock, and they do this

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.740
over many days or weeks,

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.459
what's great about this is it establishes

00:56:11.459 --> 00:56:15.350
what's essentially called a
fetal gram a time in which

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:16.560
people ate.

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.413
And a number of important
findings have emerged from these

00:56:19.413 --> 00:56:22.646
fetal grams, across large
populations of people,

00:56:22.646 --> 00:56:25.510
different time zones with
different schedules, et cetera.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:26.949
First of all,

00:56:26.949 --> 00:56:31.080
almost everybody underestimates
their feeding window.

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.219
Meaning people who think that
they are on an eight hour

00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:39.112
feeding window or six hour
feeding window, when their data

00:56:39.112 --> 00:56:41.050
are analyzed,

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.240
it almost is always the case
that they're actually on a

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.073
feeding window

00:56:44.073 --> 00:56:46.217
that's one or even two hours
longer than they think you

00:56:46.217 --> 00:56:47.270
think, well,

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.380
how could that possibly be if
people are taking their first

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.073
bite at noon and they're taking
their last bite at 8:00 PM?

00:56:53.073 --> 00:56:54.270
Well,

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:57.490
that must mean that they are
on that feeding window of eight

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.400
hours.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.640
And it turns out that people cheat,

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.480
but they don't cheat in
any kind of obvious way.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.989
They might have, you know, a
glass of wine after dinner,

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:08.700
or they'll have a cup of tea
and a little bite of a cookie.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.810
And so when people are
honest and they are honest,

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.442
in most cases for this experiment,

00:57:13.442 --> 00:57:16.160
what you find is that most
people's eating window is

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.203
actually quite a bit longer.

00:57:18.203 --> 00:57:19.330
So in discussing this with
such in and reviewing the

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.610
literature,

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:24.970
it's clear that if you'd like
to be on a 10 hour feeding

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.010
window,

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:28.420
that you should probably
select an eight hour feeding

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.253
window,

00:57:29.253 --> 00:57:32.870
because there's always a
little bit of a taper on either

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:34.220
side of that eating window.

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.986
Very few people are extremely
strict about these eating

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:37.819
windows.

00:57:37.819 --> 00:57:39.444
It's just hard to do in the
context of life events and

00:57:39.444 --> 00:57:42.758
social gatherings and,
and family and so forth.

00:57:42.758 --> 00:57:44.710
Okay, so as we build forward,

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:49.710
your ideal fasting slash
time-restricted feeding schedule,

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.441
we now have several different
rules that we can list out

00:57:52.441 --> 00:57:53.660
first,

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:57.345
at least no food for the first
hour after waking up at least

00:57:57.345 --> 00:58:02.345
one hour, two, no food intake

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.550
for two and ideally three hours

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:06.724
prior to your bedtime.

00:58:06.724 --> 00:58:11.724
Three, if you want to select
an eight hour feeding window,

00:58:12.475 --> 00:58:15.750
then you should probably
focus on a six or seven hour

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.135
feeding window because in reality,

00:58:17.135 --> 00:58:19.893
your feeding window is
going to be longer reality,

00:58:19.893 --> 00:58:22.447
meaning real life constraints.

00:58:22.447 --> 00:58:25.212
And if you'd like to be on
a 10 hour feeding window,

00:58:25.212 --> 00:58:28.140
you should probably select an
eight or a nine hour feeding

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:28.973
window,

00:58:28.973 --> 00:58:31.090
because the way it plays out
is that people almost always

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.640
eat outside of their
eating window, somewhat.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.849
The other nice thing about
selecting a slightly shorter

00:58:36.849 --> 00:58:40.770
eating window than is comfortable
for you is that it takes

00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:45.400
into account that as you take
your last bite or your last

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.315
sip of calories, there's
this time or taper before,

00:58:49.315 --> 00:58:51.675
which you are actually in a fasted state.

00:58:51.675 --> 00:58:54.160
And because you're eating
different things on different

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.139
days, presumably some foods
leave your gut more quickly.

00:58:57.139 --> 00:58:59.539
Some things spike your insulin
and your glucose more than

00:58:59.539 --> 00:59:00.546
others.

00:59:00.546 --> 00:59:04.022
Sometimes you eat more
fat, sometimes less fat.

00:59:04.022 --> 00:59:07.607
This allows you to fall well
within the margins of the

00:59:07.607 --> 00:59:10.600
benefits of time-restricted
feeding that had been

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.930
demonstrated in humans,

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:15.654
which generally involve an
eight hour window or so.

00:59:15.654 --> 00:59:19.414
So I think this eight hour
window or six hour window is a

00:59:19.414 --> 00:59:22.418
good thing to shoot for
most people, some people,

00:59:22.418 --> 00:59:24.540
and we will discuss the exceptions,

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.466
but some people truly
are exceptions to this.

00:59:26.466 --> 00:59:28.965
They just require more food.

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:30.690
And along those lines,

00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:32.910
I just now briefly want to touch
on some of the studies that

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.510
have looked at using a very
short feeding window of about

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.340
four hours, nowadays,

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.020
a number of people are doing
the so-called one meal per day,

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.700
or are restricting their feeding
window to just four hours

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:44.533
or six hours.

00:59:44.533 --> 00:59:47.706
And that turns out to be an
interesting strategy and the

00:59:47.706 --> 00:59:51.370
data around it actually are
a little bit surprising.

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:54.348
One surprising thing to leap
out of this massive literature

00:59:54.348 --> 00:59:56.480
review on time

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.710
restricted feeding in humans
is that relatively short

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:04.410
feeding windows of say four to
six hours do produce a number

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.793
of positive health effects.

01:00:05.793 --> 01:00:07.975
Things like increased insulin sensitivity,

01:00:07.975 --> 01:00:10.210
which we know is good, remember type two

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:13.320
diabetes is a reduction in
insulin sensitivity improvements

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.118
in beta cell function and
the pancreas decreased blood

01:00:17.118 --> 01:00:18.130
pressure,

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:22.928
decreased oxidative stress
decreases in things like evening

01:00:22.928 --> 01:00:24.140
appetite.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.390
So positive health effects
and psychological facts in

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.600
general.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.657
However, they either produce
no change in body weight,

01:00:32.657 --> 01:00:37.657
or they tend to produce even
increases in body weight, now,

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:41.100
of course there's variation
between individuals and between

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.284
studies, but this is somewhat surprising.

01:00:43.284 --> 01:00:46.086
So the eight hour feeding window
seems to be very beneficial

01:00:46.086 --> 01:00:49.672
across almost all the
parameters that we've discussed,

01:00:49.672 --> 01:00:52.171
inflammation, weight,
loss, fat loss, et cetera,

01:00:52.171 --> 01:00:54.340
and adherence.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.598
I should mention people's ability
to stick to the diet seems

01:00:56.598 --> 01:00:59.555
quite good on this eight
hour feeding windows,

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:02.510
but when people try and undergo
very short feeding windows

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:04.109
of four to six hours,

01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:07.730
it seems that they are overeating
in that four to six hours,

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.793
at least overeating with respect
to their metabolic needs.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:14.215
Now,

01:01:14.215 --> 01:01:17.227
the contrast to this is the
so-called a one meal per day

01:01:17.227 --> 01:01:20.375
schedule, very few studies
on one meal per day,

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:23.150
one meal per day, unless
it's a very, very long meal,

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:26.273
a sort of feast typically would
not last four to six hours

01:01:26.273 --> 01:01:28.547
because it sort of depends
on how you define a meal.

01:01:28.547 --> 01:01:31.890
But when you look at the
very few, I should emphasize,

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.602
again, very few studies
on one meal per day.

01:01:33.602 --> 01:01:37.350
People typically maintain or
lose weight on the one meal per

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:38.590
day schedule.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.361
So what we can say is that
the seven to nine hour feeding

01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:45.083
window produces all of the
major health benefits of

01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:48.649
time-restricted feeding
as well as being pretty

01:01:48.649 --> 01:01:51.544
straightforward for most people
to adhere to on a regular

01:01:51.544 --> 01:01:53.940
basis and on a regular basis,

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.170
turns out to be very important.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.640
I'll get back to that point in a moment.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.520
Whereas the four to six hour
eating window doesn't seem to

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.380
serve people as well as say
a seven or eight hour eating

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.213
window,

01:02:03.213 --> 01:02:05.460
simply because people are
overeating during that eating

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.202
window and the one meal per day,

01:02:07.202 --> 01:02:11.140
while perhaps ideal for
certain people's schedules may

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.410
actually cause people to under-eat.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.042
And in some cases that
might be what people want.

01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:16.552
They actually want to under-eat.

01:02:16.552 --> 01:02:21.552
But when we start thinking
about in work and in sport,

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:26.050
and when we start considering
hormone health and hormone

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.354
production, fertility,

01:02:27.354 --> 01:02:32.012
that's when we can really start
to look at the seven to nine

01:02:32.012 --> 01:02:35.050
hour feeding window versus
the four to six hour feeding

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:38.238
window versus the one meal per
day type feeding window with

01:02:38.238 --> 01:02:40.650
some different objectivity,

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.690
we can start to look at it
through a different lens because

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.869
it turns out that when you
place the feeding window and how

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:50.633
long that feeding window is
actually will impact a number of

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.449
other things in particular hormones,

01:02:52.449 --> 01:02:56.610
that can be very important for
a number of things related to

01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:00.480
sex and reproduction can be
related to performance at work

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.760
performance in athleticism.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.384
And there are excellent studies on this.

01:03:05.384 --> 01:03:07.170
So let's explore those now.

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:10.810
So let's talk about some
conditions where having the feeding

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:13.735
window early in the day would
actually be very beneficial.

01:03:13.735 --> 01:03:16.930
There was a study that was
published recently in Cell

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.770
Reports, again, Cell Press Journal,

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:22.023
excellent journal peer
reviewed, very stringent,

01:03:22.023 --> 01:03:23.859
from Aoyama, et al,

01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:25.977
so this is AOYAMA, et al.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.253
This was published just recently
in July, 2021 that looked

01:03:32.253 --> 01:03:37.253
at the distribution of protein
intake in different meals

01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:42.110
delivered either early in
the day or later in the day.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.650
And I'm summarizing here quite a lot,

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:46.459
but I should mention that this
study was performed in both

01:03:46.459 --> 01:03:48.850
mice and humans, same paper,

01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:53.130
mice and humans and involved
hypertrophy training,

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:58.080
essentially increasing the
weight bearing of given limbs to

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.162
try and induce hypertrophy,

01:03:59.162 --> 01:04:02.701
which is the growth of muscle tissue.

01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:07.701
It does appear that muscle
tissue is better able to undergo

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:13.504
hypertrophy by virtue of the
fact that there's better or

01:04:13.504 --> 01:04:16.500
enhanced protein synthesis
early in the day,

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.360
because of the expression of
one of these particular clock

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.133
genes called BMAL, BMAL,

01:04:22.509 --> 01:04:26.122
BMAL regulates a number of
different protein synthesis

01:04:26.122 --> 01:04:28.226
pathways within muscle cells,

01:04:28.226 --> 01:04:32.330
such that eating protein early in the day,

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.663
supports muscle tissue
maintenance and or growth.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.490
And in this study,

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.600
they also looked at the effects
of supplementing so-called

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.900
BCAs branch chain amino acids,

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.176
which is popular in bodybuilding
circles and in strength

01:04:45.176 --> 01:04:50.176
training circles and BCAs
are essential components of a

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.091
number of different foods,
but can also be supplemented.

01:04:53.091 --> 01:04:56.130
The takeaway of this study
is pretty straight forward.

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:57.250
However,

01:04:57.250 --> 01:05:00.250
the takeaway is if your main
interest is maintaining and,

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.365
or building muscle,

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:05.230
then it can be beneficial to
ingest protein early in the

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.898
day, you would still want to obey this,

01:05:07.898 --> 01:05:12.470
what we're calling a kind
of foundational rule of no,

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:15.960
not eating any food for the
first hour post waking or at

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.258
least the first hour post.

01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:20.710
And the cutoff for when you
would want to eat protein would

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:22.764
be sometime before 10:00 AM.

01:05:22.764 --> 01:05:25.048
And there I'm averaging
across a number of different

01:05:25.048 --> 01:05:28.124
situations, but in general,

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:31.433
this BMAL expression is such
that let's say you wake up at

01:05:31.433 --> 01:05:32.500
7:00 AM.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.110
Your main interest is in
hypertrophy or maintenance of

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:36.943
muscle.

01:05:36.943 --> 01:05:39.210
Then you would want to ingest
some protein sometime before

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:40.043
10:00 AM.

01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:42.790
But obviously if you're
interested in getting the health

01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.430
effects of intermittent fasting,

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:48.220
that you wouldn't ingest any
food for at least the first 60

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.360
minutes upon waking.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.220
Now it's not as if at 10:01
AM a gate slam shut and you

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.381
can't generate hypertrophy,
of course that's not the case.

01:05:57.381 --> 01:05:58.340
However,

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.620
it's very interesting that
it doesn't matter when the

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.680
resistance training,

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.342
the load bearing exercise
occurs in the 24 hour cycle.

01:06:05.342 --> 01:06:07.700
So whether or not in other words,

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.900
people are training early in
the day or they're training

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.299
late in the day.

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:14.290
It still appears that ingesting
protein early in the day

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:18.157
favors hypertrophy or that one is better,

01:06:18.157 --> 01:06:22.190
or I should say more easily
able to access hypertrophy by

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.170
way of these clock,

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.686
regulated protein synthesis
mechanisms by ingesting protein

01:06:26.686 --> 01:06:30.270
early in the day, in no way, shape or form

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:33.240
does this study say that
ingesting protein later in the day

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.400
is somehow bad for you?

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.223
It just emphasizes the positive
effects of ingesting protein

01:06:37.223 --> 01:06:41.790
early in the day for sake
of muscle maintenance and or

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:42.980
hypertrophy.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.150
So if you're somebody who is
mainly concerned with muscle

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:46.407
maintenance and hypertrophy,

01:06:46.407 --> 01:06:50.385
then it may make sense to move
that feeding window earlier

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:51.485
in the day.

01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:54.530
And certainly there are people
out there who are interested

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:55.602
in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,

01:06:55.602 --> 01:06:57.747
who aren't doing
intermittent fasting at all,

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.270
and that's also perfectly fine,

01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.276
but this just so happens to be
an episode about intermittent

01:07:01.276 --> 01:07:03.857
fasting and time restricted feeding.

01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:05.530
There are of course,

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:08.037
modes of eating where one eats
small meals spread throughout

01:07:08.037 --> 01:07:10.910
the day or weights meals differently.

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:13.470
Such that meals early in the
day are larger than later in

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:14.303
the day or vice versa.

01:07:14.303 --> 01:07:17.208
There are a near infinite
number of ways to organize this.

01:07:17.208 --> 01:07:20.525
But if you are somebody who
is interested in deriving,

01:07:20.525 --> 01:07:23.507
the many clearly established
health effects of

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:25.200
time-restricted feeding,

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.903
and you are somebody who would
like to maintain or build

01:07:27.903 --> 01:07:30.184
muscle,

01:07:30.184 --> 01:07:34.669
then ingesting proteins in the
early part of the day would

01:07:34.669 --> 01:07:38.880
be important to you at least
on the basis of these results.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.180
And therefore that eight
hour window that we've

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:46.070
established as more or less
ideal shifted to the later part

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.101
of the day might not be
as beneficial for you.

01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:50.945
Now I can just personally say that for me.

01:07:50.945 --> 01:07:52.800
When I wake up in the morning,

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.307
it's very easy for me to
not eat until noon or one or

01:07:56.307 --> 01:07:57.590
2:00 PM.

01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.158
Eating early in the day is
actually somewhat of a challenge.

01:08:00.158 --> 01:08:02.445
I discuss this point with Satchin,

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:06.430
because we were talking about
how is it that one can move

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:09.400
their feeding window or place
themselves onto a different

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.749
schedule of intermittent fasting.

01:08:10.749 --> 01:08:14.303
And it's very clear that one
needs to provide a transition

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:16.740
period in order for that to happen,

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.260
you should allow yourself a
transition period of anywhere

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.370
from one week to 10 days in
which you shift your feeding

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:26.107
window by about an hour each day or so.

01:08:26.107 --> 01:08:29.810
And then once you establish
a feeding window that feels

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:32.370
comfortable for you and that
you think you can maintain over

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.210
time,

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:36.349
that you simply maintain that
feeding schedule for at least

01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:39.879
30 days, but ideally you
would do that indefinitely.

01:08:39.879 --> 01:08:42.306
Now this turns out to be
important based on data that

01:08:42.306 --> 01:08:46.330
they've gleaned from
this My Circadian Clock

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.810
massive experiment that
they've been doing,

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.720
where people are entering the
times that they're feeding

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.292
and, and eating.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.983
Excuse me, anytime we talk about mice,

01:08:52.983 --> 01:08:54.140
I always think about feeding

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:55.820
because I come from a background

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:58.072
in my lab, works on both
laboratory mice and on humans.

01:08:58.072 --> 01:09:00.280
And anytime I think about
humans, I think about eating,

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.977
but of course they are the same thing.

01:09:02.977 --> 01:09:06.250
The interesting thing to emerge
from that very large data

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:10.394
set in humans is that when
people log their feeding times,

01:09:10.394 --> 01:09:11.730
as I mentioned before,

01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:14.300
oftentimes they think they're
eating in an eight hour

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.133
window,

01:09:15.133 --> 01:09:17.804
but they are actually eating
in a much broader window.

01:09:17.804 --> 01:09:18.826
However,

01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:21.559
even for people that are very
good about restricting their

01:09:21.559 --> 01:09:25.150
feeding to a four, six
or eight hour window,

01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:27.047
if they're very strict about
the start and stop times,

01:09:27.047 --> 01:09:29.062
and when they ingest calories,

01:09:29.062 --> 01:09:32.247
one of the findings that's
really been important to note is

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:37.247
that almost every individual
has a lot of drift in when that

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:41.220
eating window resides
in their 24 hour period.

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.674
In particular on the weekends,

01:09:42.674 --> 01:09:47.426
people are either extending or
shifting their feeding window

01:09:47.426 --> 01:09:51.060
in a way that makes it seem
that they've traveled to another

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.017
time zone and are eating
according to another time zone.

01:09:54.017 --> 01:09:56.800
And this is extremely important.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.617
As I mentioned earlier,

01:09:58.617 --> 01:10:02.385
based on the 2012 study
from Satchin's lab,

01:10:02.385 --> 01:10:06.788
where eating at a particular
phase of each 24 hour cycle can

01:10:06.788 --> 01:10:11.048
help enhance the expression
of these clock genes.

01:10:11.048 --> 01:10:16.048
If you are eating within a
very strict or semi strict

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.273
feeding window,

01:10:17.273 --> 01:10:19.763
but that feeding window is
migrating around from day to day

01:10:19.763 --> 01:10:21.280
or five days a week.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.980
You're really organized
about when that falls,

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:27.190
let's say for sake of
example, from noon to 8:00 PM,

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:30.130
noon to 8:00 PM, Monday
Noonday PM, Tuesday, Wednesday,

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.520
noon to 8:00 PM, Thursday and so forth.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.050
But then on the Saturday,

01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:38.940
it's becoming 11:00 AM and
you're ending it early,

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.634
or perhaps your starting
early in the day on Sunday,

01:10:42.634 --> 01:10:45.710
you're having brunch that
starts at nine 30 or 10,

01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:48.270
and then it's extending
out still just eight hours.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:51.745
But it shifting around that
can cause disruptions in the

01:10:51.745 --> 01:10:55.234
circadian clock mechanisms
that cause disruptions in the

01:10:55.234 --> 01:11:00.234
downstream effects of eating
that are taking at least two to

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.989
three days to recover from.

01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:06.540
So obviously we don't want to
be overly neurotic about this

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.511
stuff, but because this is an
episode about the science of

01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:10.870
intermittent fasting and
time restricted feeding, as

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:15.855
important as how long
your feeding window is,

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:20.574
is where that feeding window
resides in each 24 hour cycle.

01:11:20.574 --> 01:11:23.900
And perhaps even more important
than that is that it be

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:27.100
fairly regular where that
feeding window resides.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.100
Because even if you have a
very short feeding window,

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.210
if it's drifting around from day to day,

01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:34.305
that actually offsets a
number of the positive health

01:11:34.305 --> 01:11:36.361
effects of intermittent fasting.

01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:38.842
So to really just underscore
the way that these different

01:11:38.842 --> 01:11:41.943
pieces of the biological
puzzle fit together,

01:11:41.943 --> 01:11:46.040
if you are very strict or semi
strict about your eight hour

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:46.873
feeding window,

01:11:46.873 --> 01:11:48.770
but on the weekends that
eight hour feeding window is

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.880
falling later than it normally
would during the middle of

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.755
the week.

01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:55.820
It is as if you are going to bed later,

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.231
even if you're going to
bed at the same time,

01:11:57.231 --> 01:12:00.110
at least from the perspective
of metabolic health,

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:03.050
because of the way that eating
impacts these clock genes and

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:05.567
impacts, or I should say subtracts,

01:12:05.567 --> 01:12:10.135
the sleep-related fasting that
you would normally experience

01:12:10.135 --> 01:12:13.650
if you were to finish eating
that a couple hours before

01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:14.847
bedtime, so again,

01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:18.075
we don't want to create any
overly obsessive or neurotic

01:12:18.075 --> 01:12:20.750
focus on this, I think that most,

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:23.860
all people could benefit from
a time-restricted feeding

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.693
schedule,

01:12:24.693 --> 01:12:26.500
but they should really think
hard about what they can stick

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.143
to on a regular basis and
understand that they tend to

01:12:29.143 --> 01:12:31.680
underestimate the feeding window,

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.829
that they actually are partaking in,

01:12:33.829 --> 01:12:38.350
and that they should place that
feeding window in a portion

01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:40.936
of the 24 hour cycle that
they can be consistent on most

01:12:40.936 --> 01:12:44.185
days, and I want to emphasize most again,

01:12:44.185 --> 01:12:46.620
because we are not laboratory mice.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.840
We don't have a graduate student
coming in for eight hours a

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.760
day because that's what their
significant other will allow

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.593
them to do.

01:12:51.593 --> 01:12:53.340
And then removing the food
from our jowls and from our

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.558
cages, we have access to food
pretty much, 24 hours a day,

01:12:57.558 --> 01:12:59.461
along those lines, however,

01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:03.562
there are things that we can
all do that will allow us to

01:13:03.562 --> 01:13:07.789
offset some of the drift if you will,

01:13:07.789 --> 01:13:10.446
that we experience or that we
induce in terms of when our

01:13:10.446 --> 01:13:14.396
feeding window occurs or that
the feeding window might push

01:13:14.396 --> 01:13:17.570
out a little later and then
therefore start a little later,

01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:20.514
the next day, there are things
that we can do in there,

01:13:20.514 --> 01:13:21.725
things that we can take.

01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:22.630
And so I'd like to discuss those briefly.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.380
So throughout this episode,

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.631
I've more or less been alluding
to the fact that when you

01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:30.854
eat, there's some period of
time afterwards in which you're

01:13:30.854 --> 01:13:32.780
actually still eating,

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.406
at least from the
perspective of metabolism,

01:13:34.406 --> 01:13:35.850
because glucose is up,

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:40.170
insulin is up and you're
undergoing different metabolic and

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:44.260
digestive processes that don't
really speak to you being in

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.559
a fasted state, right?

01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:48.790
It's not just about when you
take your last bite or your

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:49.919
last sip.

01:13:49.919 --> 01:13:51.034
However,

01:13:51.034 --> 01:13:54.075
there are things that we can
do to accelerate the transition

01:13:54.075 --> 01:13:59.075
from a fed state to a fasted state.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.220
And so I'd like to discuss what those are.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.862
And I want to emphasize that
the term fed state is probably

01:14:05.862 --> 01:14:09.352
a better way to think about
it than eating or not eating

01:14:09.352 --> 01:14:12.210
because we think of eating
the verb, we're eating,

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.783
we're eating, okay, we're
done eating I'm fasting now,

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.692
but you're not actually fasting
you because you are fed.

01:14:17.692 --> 01:14:21.500
So we should really think about
fed and unfed states because

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.270
from a seller processes
perspective and from a health

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:25.103
perspective,

01:14:25.103 --> 01:14:27.185
that's actually what your body
and your system are paying

01:14:27.185 --> 01:14:28.800
attention to.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.340
And by now with everything
that we've laid out,

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:33.861
I think that should be
intuitive to understand.

01:14:33.861 --> 01:14:36.910
So there's a fun and exciting
concept related to this,

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:38.649
which is glucose clearing.

01:14:38.649 --> 01:14:43.040
You may have heard the old adage
that if you take a 20 or 30

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.337
minute walk after dinner,

01:14:44.337 --> 01:14:47.810
that it accelerates the rate
at which you digest that food.

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:51.730
And indeed it does, clearing
out of glucose from your system

01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:54.860
can be accomplished through
a number of different means,

01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:59.100
but light movement or
exercise does increase gastric

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.841
emptying time, so for instance,

01:15:00.841 --> 01:15:05.740
if you were to eat a meal
that ended at 8:00 PM,

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.060
and then plop to the couch, watch TV,

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.066
or get on your computer or go to sleep,

01:15:12.066 --> 01:15:16.104
it would be five or six hours
until you have transitioned

01:15:16.104 --> 01:15:19.038
from a fed state to a fasted state.

01:15:19.038 --> 01:15:19.871
However,

01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:24.050
you can accelerate that
considerably by taking a 20 or 30

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:27.300
minute just light walk, it
doesn't have to be speed walking.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:28.490
It certainly doesn't have to be jogging,

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.878
but just walking outside or moving around.

01:15:30.878 --> 01:15:35.878
So glucose clearing is an
important aspect of the transition

01:15:36.127 --> 01:15:38.377
from the fed state to the fasted state.

01:15:38.377 --> 01:15:41.500
And just a light walk can
allow you to do that, now,

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.670
if you can't get outside,

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:46.230
some people will go
through the gymnastics,

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:48.940
literally of doing things like
air squats and pushups and

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.430
things like that, and indeed,

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:52.999
those will increase the expression
of things like glut four

01:15:52.999 --> 01:15:56.860
and things that mobilize glucose
into muscles and things of

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.440
that sort, but, you know,
under most conditions,

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.260
most people aren't doing
push-ups after dinner,

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.150
or certainly who've had a big meal,

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.356
just taking a light
walk can be beneficial.

01:16:05.356 --> 01:16:10.356
In addition, you could consider
doing intense exercise.

01:16:10.581 --> 01:16:13.208
Now you wouldn't necessarily
want to do that immediately

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:14.190
after eating.

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:16.926
So let's take a look at what
high-intensity training of any

01:16:16.926 --> 01:16:20.560
kind does to blood glucose,
because in this case,

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.040
it turns out that when you
do high intensity training

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.128
actually has opposite
effects on blood glucose,

01:16:26.128 --> 01:16:28.940
depending on whether or not
you do it early or later in the

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.890
day.

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.070
So a fairly recent study looked
at so-called hit training,

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:34.408
high intensity interval training,

01:16:34.408 --> 01:16:37.050
which of course can take
many different forms.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:39.620
It can take the form of
circuit training with weights.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.815
It can take the form of, you know,

01:16:40.815 --> 01:16:44.000
burpees and pushups and sprints
and all sorts of different

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.015
things.

01:16:45.015 --> 01:16:47.040
But high intensity interval
training is typically training

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.822
that gets people's heart
rates up, you know,

01:16:48.822 --> 01:16:53.557
well above 70% of maximum and
then brief periods of rest and

01:16:53.557 --> 01:16:56.440
then repeating and how long
the high intensity interval

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.567
training of course will also vary.

01:16:57.567 --> 01:17:00.670
There's there are a very brief, you know,

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:03.010
six or 12 or 15 minute workouts.

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:05.580
Some people can carry on
with high intensity interval

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.460
training for up to 45
or maybe even 60 minutes

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.410
in extreme cases.

01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:13.470
But when you look at the
studies that have explored high

01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:16.216
intensity interval training and
its effect on blood glucose,

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:19.070
there are a couple of studies
that leap out, for instance,

01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:21.485
one that emphasized that blood
glucose levels will actually

01:17:21.485 --> 01:17:24.291
increase if high intensity
interval training is performed

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:27.294
early in the day and will
decrease if high intensity

01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:30.623
interval training is
performed later in the day.

01:17:30.623 --> 01:17:35.623
Now the purpose for this
exploration was not to explore

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.830
clearance of blood glucose for
sake of intermittent fasting.

01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:42.420
It was mainly focused on athletic
performance and whether or

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.400
not that was better early in
the day or later in the day,

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.610
et cetera.

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:49.771
But we can extract some
information from these studies that

01:17:49.771 --> 01:17:53.227
are beneficial for sake of
understanding glucose clearing.

01:17:53.227 --> 01:17:58.130
If you have ingested food
throughout the afternoon and

01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:59.160
evening and late in the day,

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.840
and you're thinking about going
to sleep and you'd like to

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.144
enter sleep in a way that
is less fed and more fasted,

01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:08.730
then engaging in high-intensity
interval training in the

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:11.820
afternoon will lower or
evening I should say,

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.726
will lower blood glucose.

01:18:13.726 --> 01:18:16.670
And in that way will help you
accelerate your transition

01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:19.310
into the fastest state provided
you don't ingest something

01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:21.580
after the high intensity
interval training.

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.942
Now is the increase in blood
glucose that occurs from high

01:18:24.942 --> 01:18:27.630
intensity interval
training early in the day,

01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:29.590
is that detrimental, not necessarily.

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:32.135
So that oftentimes is
associated with the shuttling of

01:18:32.135 --> 01:18:34.210
nutrients to the muscles.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.000
They've just done a lot of hard work.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.599
So it's not that high intensity
interval training should not

01:18:38.599 --> 01:18:41.360
be done early in the day,
in fact, for many people,

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.448
including myself training
early in the day,

01:18:43.448 --> 01:18:46.260
just for the way that my
psychology and biology works is

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:49.080
always better for me than
training later in the day.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.366
And the other important
thing to mention is that high

01:18:51.366 --> 01:18:54.246
intensity interval training
done late in the day can be

01:18:54.246 --> 01:18:57.811
beneficial from the perspective
of glucose clearing,

01:18:57.811 --> 01:18:59.700
lowering blood glucose,

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.683
and helping transition from
the fed to the fasted state in

01:19:02.683 --> 01:19:04.310
preparation for sleep.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.400
However,

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.464
if you're ingesting caffeine
or anything to engage in that

01:19:08.464 --> 01:19:11.500
high intensity interval training
in a way that prevents you

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.512
from getting to sleep well,

01:19:12.512 --> 01:19:14.496
then it's going to be detrimental overall.

01:19:14.496 --> 01:19:17.567
So the reason I mentioned
this is of course,

01:19:17.567 --> 01:19:21.050
because it's nice to know that
light walks after dinner or

01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:23.347
any other meal for that matter
or high intensity interval

01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:25.830
training provided it's done
in the second half of the day

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:28.847
can lower blood glucose and
speed the transition from fed to

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.942
fasted states.

01:19:30.942 --> 01:19:34.253
But I also mentioned it because
what we are really trying to

01:19:34.253 --> 01:19:38.021
achieve when we partake in
intermittent fasting so-called

01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:41.544
time-restricted feeding is what
we're really trying to do is

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:45.471
access unfed states or fasted states.

01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:48.520
It's not really about when
you eat and what you do.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.787
It's about extending the
duration of the fasting period

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.402
as long as you can,

01:19:53.402 --> 01:19:56.615
in a way that's still compatible
with your eating, right,

01:19:56.615 --> 01:19:58.436
not the other way around.

01:19:58.436 --> 01:20:02.100
And this gets back to this
key feature of our biology,

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:06.000
which is that what we eat
when we eat, when we exercise,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.920
when we view light,

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.137
it's about setting a context
or a set of conditions in your

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:10.807
brain and body.

01:20:10.807 --> 01:20:13.614
So it's not so much about the
activities that you undergo.

01:20:13.614 --> 01:20:17.640
It's about the activities you
undergo and their relationship

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.460
to one another over
time, and so in this way,

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.250
it really beautifully highlights
the way that your biology

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:26.410
is interacting all the
time light is setting.

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:28.433
When you're going to be awakened,

01:20:28.433 --> 01:20:29.639
when you're going to be asleep,

01:20:29.639 --> 01:20:31.443
when you eat is going to be
determining when you're going to

01:20:31.443 --> 01:20:33.040
be awakened, when you're
going to be asleep.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.253
And when you eat is also going
to be determining when you

01:20:35.253 --> 01:20:39.261
are able to clear out debris
from your brain and body and

01:20:39.261 --> 01:20:42.760
repair the various cells
and mechanisms of your body,

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.334
when you're able to reduce
those inflammatory cytokines

01:20:45.334 --> 01:20:46.970
throughout your body.

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:49.720
And this is really the beauty
of time research and feeding,

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.041
which is, it's not really
about restricting your feeding.

01:20:52.041 --> 01:20:56.190
It's about accessing the beauty
of the fasted state, now,

01:20:56.190 --> 01:21:00.108
there are other ways to clear
out blood glucose that involve

01:21:00.108 --> 01:21:02.350
supplements or prescription drugs.

01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:06.880
These are so-called glucose
disposal agents, glucose,

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.450
disposal agents, such as Metformin,

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:12.510
which is a prescription drug or berberine,

01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:15.585
which is an over the counter
substance will lead to very

01:21:15.585 --> 01:21:18.450
dramatic reductions in blood glucose.

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:20.613
And so they shift you from
a fed to a fasted state.

01:21:20.613 --> 01:21:25.125
And I know many people who
take berberine before eating

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:28.960
meals that include a large
number of carbohydrates,

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.731
for instance, as a way
to clear out glucose.

01:21:31.731 --> 01:21:33.349
Now I've tried berberine before.

01:21:33.349 --> 01:21:36.212
And what I can tell you is
that if you take berberine,

01:21:36.212 --> 01:21:38.530
which by the way is very
much like Metformin,

01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.601
its effects are almost
identical to Metformin in fact,

01:21:40.601 --> 01:21:43.850
but it's much less expensive
and it's over the counter.

01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:45.663
If you take berberine
and you have not ingested

01:21:45.663 --> 01:21:49.115
carbohydrates, many
people, including myself,

01:21:49.115 --> 01:21:52.190
experience a splitting headache,

01:21:52.190 --> 01:21:55.184
you become hypoglycemic because
it is a glucose clearing

01:21:55.184 --> 01:21:56.270
agent.

01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:58.930
So if you're going to experiment
with things like Metformin

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.140
and or berberine or similar,

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.967
you want to be very cautious
that you're not clearing out

01:22:03.967 --> 01:22:05.787
blood glucose, that's already low.

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:09.836
And the dose response for this
varies tremendously from one

01:22:09.836 --> 01:22:11.630
individual to the next.

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:14.060
And there's a strong circadian component.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.572
So if some people react very
well to berberine early in the

01:22:16.572 --> 01:22:19.100
day, but find that later in the day,

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.073
it provides extreme headaches
for some people it's the

01:22:22.073 --> 01:22:23.710
opposite.

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:26.739
So I caution you in exploring
things like berberine and

01:22:26.739 --> 01:22:30.270
Metformin that you should
expect to experience a number of

01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:33.534
physical and psychological
effects that may work for you

01:22:33.534 --> 01:22:35.070
might be great for you,

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:37.373
but might also not be
great for you, nowadays,

01:22:37.373 --> 01:22:39.241
there are a number of
commercially available,

01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:42.110
continuous glucose monitors, I've tried

01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:45.760
one of these, it involves putting
what's essentially a patch

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.070
with a little needle
that goes into your skin,

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.310
which is continuing
continually, excuse me,

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:50.567
monitoring your blood glucose.

01:22:50.567 --> 01:22:52.680
And you can look at it
at an app on your phone,

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.070
and you can learn a lot that
way about how different foods

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:58.145
impact the increases in
decrease in blood glucose.

01:22:58.145 --> 01:23:00.657
If you're doing experiments
with berberine or Metformin,

01:23:00.657 --> 01:23:03.566
you can see how those
impact your blood glucose.

01:23:03.566 --> 01:23:06.645
You can see how exercise
hit training or otherwise

01:23:06.645 --> 01:23:09.759
impacts blood glucose, excuse me again,

01:23:09.759 --> 01:23:13.900
it's very hard to assess blood
glucose without a continuous

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.840
blood glucose monitor, and
if you're not using one,

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.600
you're mainly going to be relying
on subjective things like,

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.370
oh, I feel like I have low
blood sugar, or I feel shaky.

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:25.110
Like I have high blood sugar
or shaky cause you have low

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:26.498
blood sugar.

01:23:26.498 --> 01:23:29.976
So I have to say that glucose
clearing agents that involve a

01:23:29.976 --> 01:23:34.976
walk or exercise moderate or
intense are going to be a lot

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:39.360
easier to titrate and adjust
the levels of then things that

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.560
you're going to take, where
you have to adjust the dosage.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.219
And then once you ingest a certain dosage,

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:44.850
you're along for the ride,

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:46.918
at least until the effects of
that particular compound wear

01:23:46.918 --> 01:23:49.490
off, it doesn't mean those
things don't have utility.

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:51.730
It doesn't mean people aren't
using them because many people

01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:56.730
are, but they are potentially
a very sharp blade

01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:58.930
that is a double sided blade.

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:01.070
So I encourage you to
approach those with caution.

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.100
If you decide to at all,

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.560
it's worth thinking about what
the low blood glucose state

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.176
is and why it's beneficial as
well as why it might produce

01:24:10.176 --> 01:24:11.140
headaches.

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.760
And in some cases can also
adjust the effects of other

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:14.908
hormones in the fasted state,

01:24:14.908 --> 01:24:18.814
a number of different proteins
that are expressed in cells

01:24:18.814 --> 01:24:21.860
undergo changes in their expression.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:24.371
We talked about this
earlier, when we are fasted,

01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:27.793
we tend to reduce the activity
of a particular protein

01:24:27.793 --> 01:24:31.090
called MTOR mammalian target of rapamycin.

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:35.460
MTOR is very active in cells
while they are growing.

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.594
So throughout development,

01:24:36.594 --> 01:24:40.855
it's also very active in
cancers of various kinds.

01:24:40.855 --> 01:24:44.463
MTOR needs to be what's
called phosphorylated.

01:24:45.322 --> 01:24:46.155
If you don't know what that
means, don't worry about it.

01:24:46.155 --> 01:24:49.660
But phosphorylation is a manner
in which certain proteins

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.330
are altered so that they can
actually be functional within

01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:53.550
cells,

01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:55.880
MTOR is associated with cell
growth of all kinds healthy

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:56.873
and unhealthy.

01:24:57.731 --> 01:25:01.347
When MTOR is phosphorylated,
there's a marker called PS6

01:25:01.347 --> 01:25:04.581
so phospho MTOR expressed as PM6.

01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:07.680
If this is all escaping
you, don't worry about it.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.790
Phospho MTOR and PS6
are reduced by fasting.

01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:13.460
Now, this makes sense.

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:14.293
If you think about it,

01:25:14.293 --> 01:25:16.845
because eating and growth are
associated with each other,

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:21.597
fasting is not necessarily anti-growth,

01:25:21.597 --> 01:25:24.362
but it is not pro
growth, and when we fast,

01:25:24.362 --> 01:25:27.420
we see increases in cells
of things like AMPK,

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:30.740
the sirtuins, things like transcription

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.210
factors like FOX-O,

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.750
ATF and ketones or ketone bodies.

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.320
You may have heard of the ketogenic diet.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.347
What's the point of all
this biochemistry, it's not,

01:25:38.347 --> 01:25:41.188
you just blitz you with a
bunch of cellular biology and

01:25:41.188 --> 01:25:42.700
biochemistry.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.290
It's to say that we have cell
growth pathways involving MTOR

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:47.610
and PSX,

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:52.391
and we have cell repair and
cell shrinkage processes that

01:25:52.391 --> 01:25:55.349
are associated with AMPK,
the so-called sirtuins,

01:25:55.349 --> 01:25:57.880
which Dr. Davidson Claire

01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.420
from Harvard and others are famous for

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.910
discovering and understanding
things like AMPK,

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:07.280
these two different divergent
pathways of cell growth and

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.130
cell breakdown and repair
and by breakdown, I mean,

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:14.506
actual clearance autophagy, and repair.

01:26:14.506 --> 01:26:17.930
Those can be triggered by
being in either the fed or the

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:19.010
fasted state.

01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.710
So one way I'd like you to
think about the fed state,

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:22.543
not just eating,

01:26:22.543 --> 01:26:24.937
but having recently eaten
or the fasted state,

01:26:24.937 --> 01:26:27.756
meaning high blood glucose and,

01:26:27.756 --> 01:26:30.239
or you've recently eat eaten,

01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:32.667
or are currently eating
or drinking calories,

01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:36.350
is that when you eat or when
you don't eat, when you're fed,

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:37.183
when you're fasted,

01:26:37.183 --> 01:26:40.370
you are either promoting
cellular growth of all kinds or

01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:44.480
you're promoting cellular repair
and clearance of all kinds.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.313
And so, again,

01:26:45.313 --> 01:26:48.340
this is about setting conditions
in the brain and body.

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:52.095
It's not so much about
when you eat food A or B,

01:26:52.095 --> 01:26:56.339
it leads to increases in MTOR,
anytime you eat any food,

01:26:56.339 --> 01:26:58.250
doesn't matter if it's plant-based,

01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:01.890
animal-based fat, protein,
carbohydrate, doesn't matter.

01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:04.567
You are biasing your system
towards a biochemical state of

01:27:04.567 --> 01:27:05.870
cell growth.

01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:09.270
And any time you haven't eaten
for a while or blood glucose

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:10.110
is low,

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:13.940
you're biasing your system
toward a state of cellar repair.

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.853
And this is why people who
do not suffer from any blood

01:27:17.853 --> 01:27:21.391
glucose regulation issues
take things like berberine as

01:27:21.391 --> 01:27:23.960
glucose, disposal agents,
or take Metformin.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.069
I'm not necessarily
suggesting that you do that,

01:27:26.069 --> 01:27:29.210
but it's because those
things mimic fasting.

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.951
They create situations in the
body that promote things like

01:27:31.951 --> 01:27:33.670
AMPKs, and sirtuins,

01:27:33.670 --> 01:27:36.210
and others to push your
body and your system

01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:37.299
down a route of repair,

01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:40.075
even though you might have
just eaten a meal an hour ago,

01:27:40.075 --> 01:27:43.460
along the lines of the health
benefits of intermittent

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:46.962
fasting, there are nice data
showing improvements in the gut

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:50.316
microbiome and in particular,

01:27:50.316 --> 01:27:53.860
in the treatment of irritable
bowel syndrome and other forms

01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:57.670
of colitis in time, restricted feeding,

01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.501
meaning time-restricted feeding
seems to be able to assist

01:28:00.501 --> 01:28:02.227
people with those conditions,

01:28:02.227 --> 01:28:05.450
following the general parameters
that I discussed before

01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.040
eight hours and so forth.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.720
Why and how, well, by way
of intermittent fasting,

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.775
impacting the expression of
these various clock genes,

01:28:13.775 --> 01:28:16.750
and because the clock genes
impact the mucosal lining the

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.749
mucus lining of the gut,

01:28:18.749 --> 01:28:23.684
it appears that intermittent
fasting can reduce the amount

01:28:23.684 --> 01:28:27.582
of so-called lactobacillus
that's present in the gut.

01:28:27.582 --> 01:28:31.464
And lactose bacillus is when
in high levels is correlated

01:28:31.464 --> 01:28:34.330
with a number of different
metabolic disorders.

01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:35.180
At the same time,

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.089
time-restricted feeding seems
to enhance the proliferation

01:28:38.089 --> 01:28:40.604
of some of the gut microbiota,

01:28:40.604 --> 01:28:44.630
like acetobacter and some of
the other ones that promote

01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:46.590
healthy mucosal lining,

01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:50.530
and that promote better
overall intestinal function.

01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:53.420
So these are pathways that
have now been established,

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.416
and it appears that
intermittent fasting isn't just

01:28:55.416 --> 01:28:57.390
modulating these processes,

01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:59.582
but is actually having a direct
effect on the mucosal lining

01:28:59.582 --> 01:29:02.381
in a way that favors a
healthier gut microbiome.

01:29:02.381 --> 01:29:05.310
So it should come as no
surprise that many people who

01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:08.130
experience gut issues benefit
from restricting their feeding

01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:11.740
window to eight hours or so
per every 24 hour period.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.813
The other very exciting finding
about intermittent fasting

01:29:13.813 --> 01:29:16.263
is one of the major health issues

01:29:16.263 --> 01:29:21.263
these days is the proliferation
of so-called non-alcoholic

01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:22.823
fatty liver disease,

01:29:22.823 --> 01:29:26.500
30 years or so non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease was

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.372
exceedingly rare to see in the
clinic, except in alcoholics,

01:29:29.372 --> 01:29:32.640
fatty deposits in the liver are bad.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.542
It is essentially liver disease.

01:29:34.542 --> 01:29:37.641
Nowadays children and
adults are showing up with

01:29:37.641 --> 01:29:40.200
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.291
Some of these people are
obese, others are not,

01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:44.750
but it's a serious health concern.

01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:47.316
And it's growing in numbers all the time.

01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:51.020
A recent study that was
published in Cell Reports

01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.890
Medicine just a couple of weeks
ago, tested the hypothesis,

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:58.365
whether or not the gut
microbiome or so-called brown fat

01:29:58.365 --> 01:30:01.810
tissue is impacting the liver health.

01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:05.519
And in particular nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease.

01:30:05.519 --> 01:30:08.840
The short takeaway from this
study is that contrary to what

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.111
was previously thought,
the gut microbiome,

01:30:11.111 --> 01:30:14.650
while very important for a
number of other processes in the

01:30:14.650 --> 01:30:18.230
body doesn't seem to be related
to this non-alcoholic fatty

01:30:18.230 --> 01:30:19.063
liver disease.

01:30:19.063 --> 01:30:21.480
This is surprising to people
or should be to those of you

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.700
that have been following the
gut microbiome literature,

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.469
however, brown fat,

01:30:25.469 --> 01:30:29.687
which is a healthy fat that we
have between our two scapulae

01:30:29.687 --> 01:30:30.780
and in our upper neck,

01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.890
it doesn't tend to be
blubbery type fat pads,

01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:34.610
but it sits deep to the skin,

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:38.710
but creates a thermogenic effect
in the body that is helpful

01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:41.510
for reducing the amount of other fat,

01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:43.950
the type of fat that we're
more typically used to thinking

01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:46.160
about and talking about
white fat and pink fat that's

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.843
subcutaneous fat around
the abdomen and so forth.

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:53.843
Brown fat seems to have a
direct correlation with the lack

01:30:53.890 --> 01:30:55.610
of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:58.496
What this study showed was
that in people that have

01:30:58.496 --> 01:31:01.951
diminished concentrations of brown fat,

01:31:01.951 --> 01:31:06.847
there is a higher probability
of having non-alcoholic fatty

01:31:06.847 --> 01:31:07.850
liver disease.

01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:10.710
Now the good news is brown
fat stores can be increased.

01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:13.290
And again, this isn't going to
create blubber of brown fat.

01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:15.510
This is going to create increased
thermogenesis and actually

01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:18.186
make people leaner and brown
fat has a number of other

01:31:18.186 --> 01:31:19.464
important positive effects.

01:31:19.464 --> 01:31:20.720
Now,

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.236
this is interesting because
cold exposure of anywhere from

01:31:23.236 --> 01:31:26.770
one to three minutes, two
or four times per week,

01:31:26.770 --> 01:31:27.710
or maybe even 10 minutes,

01:31:27.710 --> 01:31:30.192
two to four times per week
can increase brown fat stores.

01:31:30.192 --> 01:31:34.599
Also time-restricted feeding
has now been tied to the

01:31:34.599 --> 01:31:37.610
density of brown fat store.

01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:40.090
So time-restricted feeding also
seems to positively increase

01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:42.140
brown fat stores,

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.286
probably because of the way
that brown fat stores relate to

01:31:44.286 --> 01:31:45.850
epinephrin and adrenaline,

01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:47.752
which tend to go up when we're fasted.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.180
What does this all mean?

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.422
This means for sake of
liver health and for sake of

01:31:51.422 --> 01:31:55.434
reducing, or maybe preventing,
or even potentially,

01:31:55.434 --> 01:31:58.500
I want to underline potentially
reversing non-alcoholic

01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.333
fatty liver disease,

01:31:59.333 --> 01:32:03.059
time-restricted feeding also
appears to be beneficial.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:06.480
Many people out there are
interested in optimizing their

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.840
hormones, and as we mentioned earlier,

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.064
insulin is a hormone and
time-restricted feeding seems to

01:32:11.064 --> 01:32:14.395
have very positive effects on
overall insulin profiles and

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:18.005
so forth, but anytime
you mentioned hormones,

01:32:18.005 --> 01:32:21.430
people immediately seem to leap
to the sex steroid hormones,

01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:22.740
testosterone, and estrogen,

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.930
because indeed they have powerful effects,

01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:28.280
both in the short-term and
the long-term in terms of our

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.781
mental and physical
health and performance.

01:32:30.781 --> 01:32:33.790
There's at least one study
that's explored the effects of

01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:35.800
time, restricted eating on performance,

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.853
athletic performance, immune
function, and body composition.

01:32:39.853 --> 01:32:43.090
This was a study by Mauro, et al,

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.110
that was performed on elite cyclists.

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:46.690
So I want to point that out.

01:32:46.690 --> 01:32:48.565
I was a randomized control trial,

01:32:48.565 --> 01:32:53.565
but what's really nice about
this study is that it explored

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.230
a number of different hormonal
parameters in people that

01:32:58.230 --> 01:32:59.690
were using time restricted eating,

01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:01.471
or that had a more extended eating window.

01:33:01.471 --> 01:33:03.891
And they tracked
everything very carefully.

01:33:03.891 --> 01:33:07.235
And the amount of food they
were eating was actually pretty

01:33:07.235 --> 01:33:11.870
considerable, 4,800 calories,
so that's a lot of calories,

01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:12.703
but then again,

01:33:12.703 --> 01:33:16.040
they were very active and
they've measured a number of

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:19.559
different things related
to VO2 max, et cetera,

01:33:19.559 --> 01:33:23.794
performance and overall performance
at what they did cycling

01:33:23.794 --> 01:33:26.910
is not the point that I
want to emphasize here.

01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:29.220
Although there were some
positive effects on their

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:33.420
performance related to
time-restricted eating, the point

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.253
I want to talk about relates
to things that presumably

01:33:36.253 --> 01:33:38.370
relate to most, everybody,

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:42.410
which are the effects on
things like glucose, thyroid,

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:45.910
hormone, testosterone, sex,
hormone, binding globulin,

01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:48.725
which can bind up testosterone
and prevent the so-called

01:33:48.725 --> 01:33:51.000
free form of testosterone,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.567
which is the one that has most
of the actions in the brain

01:33:53.567 --> 01:33:54.631
and body.

01:33:54.631 --> 01:33:57.849
And the major takeaway
from this study was that

01:33:57.849 --> 01:34:01.720
time-restricted feeding of
the same amount of calories as

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.530
the so-called control
condition, okay, same calories,

01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:08.304
but either compact throughout
the 24 hour cycle to an eight

01:34:08.304 --> 01:34:12.243
hour feeding window or allowing
them to eat over a larger

01:34:12.243 --> 01:34:15.935
feeding window did lead to
significant decreases in free

01:34:15.935 --> 01:34:17.499
testosterone.

01:34:17.499 --> 01:34:20.670
And I think a number of people
will raise their eyebrows to

01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:21.770
that and think, oh,

01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:24.140
well then maybe time-restricted
feeding is not for me.

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:26.160
There are a number of important
considerations, of course,

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.846
one is while they decrease
in free testosterone was

01:34:29.846 --> 01:34:31.122
significant.

01:34:31.122 --> 01:34:34.000
It's also going to depend
on where people start out.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.180
So if somebody has already
lower modest levels of

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:39.920
testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.230
that could lead them into a
state of poor performance and

01:34:43.230 --> 01:34:45.409
wellbeing, whereas if somebody
has higher testosterone,

01:34:45.409 --> 01:34:47.930
a decrease will necessarily do that.

01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:50.120
So it's important to take
that into consideration.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.080
This is why I'm always such
a fan of people doing their

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.440
blood work and knowing what's
going on under the hood for

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.769
them, a very change in
hormonal profile was cortisol.

01:34:59.769 --> 01:35:02.700
So-called stress, hormone cortisol,

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.370
of course is also naturally
released early in the day in a

01:35:05.370 --> 01:35:07.620
healthy way to wake you
up and promote alertness,

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:10.839
but you don't want its levels
to be too high or to have

01:35:10.839 --> 01:35:13.630
peaks in cortisol late in the day,

01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:15.650
that's actually correlated
with depression and a number of

01:35:15.650 --> 01:35:17.823
other untoured things.

01:35:19.181 --> 01:35:21.931
I would have thought that by
restricting a feeding window to

01:35:21.931 --> 01:35:23.691
a particular time each day,

01:35:23.691 --> 01:35:27.000
that these hard training
cyclists would have undergone

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.060
increases in serum cortisol and in fact,

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.408
the opposite was true.

01:35:31.408 --> 01:35:35.061
They had significant reductions
in serum cortisol as a

01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:37.313
consequence of time, restricted feeding.

01:35:37.313 --> 01:35:39.757
I should mention there were
significant reductions in serum

01:35:39.757 --> 01:35:42.720
cortisol also in the control group,

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.061
but not to the same extent.

01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:47.030
And the two groups did
differ significantly from one

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:48.090
another.

01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:50.733
Now this is important because
if you just look at one

01:35:50.733 --> 01:35:53.903
hormone testosterone, you'd
say, okay, based on these data,

01:35:53.903 --> 01:35:57.179
time-restricted feeding is
reducing testosterone levels

01:35:57.179 --> 01:35:58.185
significantly,

01:35:58.185 --> 01:36:01.000
even though the number of
calories is quite high and is held

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.280
constant across the study, but in fact,

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.388
because cortisol is lower,

01:36:05.388 --> 01:36:08.370
it may mean that the effects
of testosterone or the

01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:10.300
reduction in testosterone is offset.

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:13.090
And that's because cortisol
and testosterone are always in

01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:16.089
this somewhat of a dance
in terms of cortisol,

01:36:16.089 --> 01:36:18.465
inhibiting the effects of
testosterone largely and vice

01:36:18.465 --> 01:36:20.190
versa.

01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:22.853
So it is interesting and
important to look at the total

01:36:22.853 --> 01:36:24.450
gallery of hormones.

01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:25.880
And they did look at a number of hormones.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.071
They looked at other inflammatory markers.

01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:29.409
Those were not increased.

01:36:29.409 --> 01:36:31.708
That's not surprising if you
remember back to the 2012

01:36:31.708 --> 01:36:35.379
Satchin Panda study this
early pioneering study on time

01:36:35.379 --> 01:36:37.020
restricted feeding.

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.959
They saw reductions in stress
hormones and in inflammatory

01:36:39.959 --> 01:36:42.655
markers in time, restricted feeding mice.

01:36:42.655 --> 01:36:45.373
And here, this also seems
to be the case in humans.

01:36:45.373 --> 01:36:50.214
So the takeaway is for sake
of hormone health, time

01:36:50.214 --> 01:36:55.214
restricted feeding is
compatible with quality hormone

01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:57.256
health, even in high-performing athletes,

01:36:57.256 --> 01:36:59.930
based on everything we know,
and that we've discussed,

01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:02.240
I would not suggest that
people restrict their feeding

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.770
window to less than eight hours,

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.803
especially if they're training
hard on a regular basis.

01:37:05.803 --> 01:37:08.700
And it's not just athletes

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:09.993
that should pay attention to this,

01:37:09.993 --> 01:37:13.480
when we are working very hard,
when we are psychologically

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.010
stressed, when we are studying for exams,

01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:20.207
or we are in conflict with
somebody on a regular basis,

01:37:20.207 --> 01:37:22.920
that creates a stress in the body

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.470
that's very similar to
that of physical training,

01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:27.890
the body and brain don't
distinguish between physical stress

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:29.750
and mental stress, it's
all nervous system.

01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:32.060
Remember that it's just
cortisol and adrenaline.

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:35.292
There's no special hormone
just for physical stress versus

01:37:35.292 --> 01:37:38.001
psychological stress, so again,

01:37:38.001 --> 01:37:40.450
in thinking about what sort of
feeding window will be right

01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:41.283
for you,

01:37:41.283 --> 01:37:44.215
we arrive back at this eight
hour time been that seems more

01:37:44.215 --> 01:37:47.045
or less flexible for most conditions,

01:37:47.045 --> 01:37:49.730
even high-performing elite athletes.

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:52.263
And I would say just by logical extension,

01:37:52.263 --> 01:37:55.120
even for people that have a
lot of stress in their life.

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.231
And I personally wouldn't suggest
that people who have a lot

01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:00.530
of stress in their life where
the potential for stress in

01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:04.890
their life shorten their
feeding window much shorter than

01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:05.723
eight hours,

01:38:05.723 --> 01:38:08.240
because then you would expect
that you would start to

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.430
increase some of the inflammatory markers.

01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.797
You would increase the stress hormones,

01:38:11.797 --> 01:38:15.980
and you would be decreasing
things like testosterone and

01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:17.750
estrogen, some of the
sex steroid hormones.

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:19.791
So again, it's all about context
and the eight hour window,

01:38:19.791 --> 01:38:21.330
it isn't holy,

01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:24.637
but seems to be a really useful
guide to extract the great

01:38:24.637 --> 01:38:28.450
health benefits of
which there are many in,

01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:31.419
of which we've discussed from
intermittent fasting time,

01:38:31.419 --> 01:38:33.218
restricted feeding.

01:38:33.218 --> 01:38:36.329
And yet that it could still be
compatible with decent social

01:38:36.329 --> 01:38:39.373
schedules and for maintaining
hormone health in keeping with

01:38:39.373 --> 01:38:40.375
this,

01:38:40.375 --> 01:38:43.884
for women that are trying to
maintain ovulatory cycles or

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:45.906
for couples that are
trying to get pregnant.

01:38:45.906 --> 01:38:49.898
I think it's also important
to not create a feeding window

01:38:49.898 --> 01:38:51.576
that's too short.

01:38:51.576 --> 01:38:56.191
The relationship between
feeding and body fat stores and

01:38:56.191 --> 01:39:00.710
glucose and leptin and hormones
is a well-established one.

01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:02.330
And we can summarize it very easily here,

01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:04.240
although I've done several
episodes related to this

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.590
previously on optimizing hormone health.

01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:11.084
But basically we undergo
puberty when there's enough food

01:39:11.084 --> 01:39:14.970
and there's enough body fat
that the body fat sends a signal

01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:16.350
to the brain called leptin.

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:18.470
That's a hormone that comes
from body fat signals to the

01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:20.535
brain to turn on puberty that's puberty,

01:39:20.535 --> 01:39:24.689
but even as adults for
women that are menstruating,

01:39:24.689 --> 01:39:27.990
there needs to be sufficient
leptin signaling to the brain

01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:30.090
in order to maintain ovulation
because of the way that the

01:39:30.090 --> 01:39:32.840
brain communicates with the
pituitary and the ovaries.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.840
Similarly for men fasting
or extreme exercise plus

01:39:39.086 --> 01:39:40.070
fasting,

01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:43.977
we now know reduces testosterone
it's impacts are not

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:47.725
exactly clear, however,
if you reduce food intake,

01:39:47.725 --> 01:39:52.120
either in total calories
or in duration too much,

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.760
you will suffer a drop in sperm
counts, fertility will drop.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.593
And this makes sense.

01:39:56.593 --> 01:39:58.180
The body is communicating to the brain,

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:01.163
whether or not conditions
are sufficient in the body to

01:40:01.163 --> 01:40:04.390
reproduce and to presumably,

01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:07.390
and hopefully support the
health and wellbeing of those

01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:08.223
offspring.

01:40:08.223 --> 01:40:10.350
So there's a logical link
between body fat and eating and

01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:13.784
how much food is available
to you and how long it's

01:40:13.784 --> 01:40:16.711
available to you and the signals
in the brain that allow for

01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:18.490
reproductive success.

01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:21.086
There are some data that pointed
differences in the effects

01:40:21.086 --> 01:40:25.030
of intermittent fasting
for males versus females.

01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:27.441
Those data right now only come from mice,

01:40:27.441 --> 01:40:30.470
that study was published
by Satchin Panda recently,

01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:32.757
we still await the studies in humans.

01:40:32.757 --> 01:40:36.790
Some people do not do well on
intermittent fasting either in

01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:38.870
terms of mood or hormone health.

01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:40.960
And so everyone needs to determine
for themselves whether or

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.050
not having a time restricted
feeding window is good for

01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:44.883
them.

01:40:44.883 --> 01:40:47.110
How long that time-restricted
feeding window should be.

01:40:47.110 --> 01:40:50.310
I think eight hours is kind
of a nice minimum to adhere to

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.270
based on everything that
we've covered today.

01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:55.851
And for some people time-restricted
feeding is not going to

01:40:55.851 --> 01:40:58.180
be compatible with
hormone health, for them,

01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:01.014
for them eating more meals
spread throughout the day,

01:41:01.014 --> 01:41:02.615
presumably smaller meals,

01:41:02.615 --> 01:41:06.300
same caloric intake is going
to be more beneficial for their

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.133
hormones.

01:41:07.133 --> 01:41:08.860
This is something that is
going to be individual and is

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:11.970
going to have to be determined
on an individual basis.

01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:14.338
However, if you're going to
try time restricted feeding,

01:41:14.338 --> 01:41:17.050
I do want to remind you that
taking a period of three to

01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:20.090
seven or ideally 10 days
to transition into it,

01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:21.080
not just going,

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.515
flipping from eating to three
meals a day that span from

01:41:23.515 --> 01:41:26.420
6:00 AM to 10:00 PM and
suddenly going to an eight hour

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:27.253
feeding window,

01:41:27.253 --> 01:41:30.457
but rather winnowing down that
feeding window about an hour

01:41:30.457 --> 01:41:33.683
or so per day is going to allow
the hormone systems of your

01:41:33.683 --> 01:41:37.460
body, including leptin the
hypocretin orexin system,

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.570
which are systems within the
body, that signal to the brain,

01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:43.270
that food is about to come
allowing those systems to adjust

01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:45.766
so that you're not
overwhelmingly hungry, irritable,

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:48.259
and you're not throwing your
whole hormone system out of

01:41:48.259 --> 01:41:49.295
whack.

01:41:49.295 --> 01:41:51.910
I keep coming back to this
eight hour feeding window,

01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:54.240
and I want to provide a
little more basis for it.

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.243
And just to encourage that
it's not completely arbitrary.

01:41:58.243 --> 01:42:00.835
The lengthy review that
I mentioned earlier,

01:42:00.835 --> 01:42:03.460
features a number of studies
that have used this eight hour

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:04.422
feeding window,

01:42:04.422 --> 01:42:08.280
but there's a particular study
that I'd like to highlight

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.072
mainly because I don't expect
people to delve into the full

01:42:10.072 --> 01:42:12.056
reference list of the other review.

01:42:12.056 --> 01:42:14.331
And this is a study that was carried out

01:42:14.331 --> 01:42:15.991
between Satchi Panda's lab

01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:18.440
and Krista Varady's labs.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.760
This is a collaboration.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.750
The study was carried out in
humans and is entitled effects

01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:25.590
of eight hour time restricted
feeding on body weight and

01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:29.653
metabolic disease, risk factors
in obese adults, excuse me.

01:42:29.653 --> 01:42:32.700
And this study essentially showed,

01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:36.560
I'll just read the conclusions
that an eight hour time

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.862
restricted feeding produces a
mild caloric restriction and

01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:44.862
weight loss without calorie
counting, so that's key, right?

01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:47.140
These people aren't calorie
counting somehow just by

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:49.013
adhering to an eight hour window.

01:42:49.013 --> 01:42:53.862
They are taking in fewer
calories than they're burning off

01:42:53.862 --> 01:42:57.900
and clinically it reduced blood pressure.

01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:58.880
So I mentioned the study,

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.070
not because there aren't many
others involving the eight

01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:02.435
hour feeding window also in humans,

01:43:02.435 --> 01:43:05.636
but because the eight hour
feeding window has been tested in

01:43:05.636 --> 01:43:07.860
obese adults and non obese adults.

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:09.901
And there are even a
few studies in children.

01:43:09.901 --> 01:43:13.330
So this eight hour window seems
to be a really good rule of

01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:16.562
thumb and a kind of anchor
around which we can each think

01:43:16.562 --> 01:43:19.940
about incorporating
time restricted feeding.

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:22.210
There are of course,
other patterns of feeding.

01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:26.961
And while some people have
engaged in longer fasts of 24

01:43:26.961 --> 01:43:31.961
hours, 36 hours or more
alternate day fasting,

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.240
meaning eating one day,

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:38.020
not eating the next day or in
some cases eating one day and

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:40.690
eating very few calories,
500 or 600 calories

01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:43.450
the next day has been tested.

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.474
A few studies have also
looked at eating a sort of

01:43:45.474 --> 01:43:48.450
maintenance level of
calories for five days,

01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:51.561
and then taking two days
and fast clear through,

01:43:51.561 --> 01:43:55.910
or eating very few calories,
you know, 300 or 500 calories.

01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:56.743
In fact,

01:43:56.743 --> 01:44:00.090
there's a sort of a community
online of people that are

01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:00.923
exploring longer,

01:44:00.923 --> 01:44:03.199
fast for sake of trying to
offset dementia or reverse

01:44:03.199 --> 01:44:08.199
effects of dementia, thus
far, at least in my awareness,

01:44:08.314 --> 01:44:12.670
there isn't any quality clinical
peer reviewed study on that

01:44:12.670 --> 01:44:15.827
yet for sake of dementia,
although I await those studies,

01:44:15.827 --> 01:44:17.570
and if anyone's aware of them,

01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:19.110
please send me a link in the comments.

01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:24.030
But alternate day fasting has
gotten the so-called safe bill

01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.863
of health.

01:44:24.863 --> 01:44:26.541
This has been written up meaning
that people didn't suffer

01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:30.393
bone loss, they didn't suffer
any major detrimental effects.

01:44:30.393 --> 01:44:35.382
It does seem that it can create
significant weight loss and

01:44:35.382 --> 01:44:39.228
can help with obese individuals
that it can reduce resting

01:44:39.228 --> 01:44:40.228
blood glucose,

01:44:40.228 --> 01:44:43.331
and every other day fasting
in many cases can produce more

01:44:43.331 --> 01:44:47.455
rapid effects on weight loss
and reductions in blood glucose

01:44:47.455 --> 01:44:49.850
than time restricted feeding, however,

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:54.344
every other day type fasting
for most people is not going to

01:44:54.344 --> 01:44:56.140
be feasible.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.960
They're just not going to be
able to do that for a long

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.793
period of time.

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:00.482
And what hasn't really been
done is the follow-up to see

01:45:00.482 --> 01:45:03.225
whether or not people who do
every other day fasting or five

01:45:03.225 --> 01:45:06.150
days of eating followed
by two days of fasting,

01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:08.790
whether or not that leads
to a rebound in weight gain,

01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:10.940
whether or not that leads to
a rebound in blood glucose,

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:11.773
et cetera.

01:45:11.773 --> 01:45:14.800
So for now the eight hour feeding
window and time restricted

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.715
feeding seems to be the most tested,

01:45:18.715 --> 01:45:22.594
supported in animal studies and
in human studies and the one

01:45:22.594 --> 01:45:25.670
around which I think
most people should orient

01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:28.270
if they're considering getting
into time-restricted feeding,

01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:31.534
it's also sort of hard to
imagine how one could include a

01:45:31.534 --> 01:45:36.250
significant exercise schedule
or work schedule on every

01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:37.120
other day fasting.

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.980
Remember, in any study, people
are often being compensated,

01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:43.346
or at least are incentivized
in some way to adhere to the

01:45:43.346 --> 01:45:44.348
study.

01:45:44.348 --> 01:45:46.910
This is one of the major issues
that I have with any study

01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:49.617
that says that three or four
different diets are essentially

01:45:49.617 --> 01:45:53.350
equal in terms of their
ability to produce weight loss.

01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:57.025
Adherence is very different
in the outside world where you

01:45:57.025 --> 01:45:59.400
don't have a researcher
monitoring you where you're not

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.583
logging all your food.

01:46:00.583 --> 01:46:02.514
Most people don't do that consistently.

01:46:02.514 --> 01:46:05.038
And we can take a little bit
of a neuroscience perspective

01:46:05.038 --> 01:46:07.727
on this to try and arrive
at what the best kind of

01:46:07.727 --> 01:46:10.160
organization of an eating plan,

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.640
or if we wanted to call it a diet,

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.065
we could would be for you.

01:46:14.065 --> 01:46:17.163
Many people find it easier
to just not eat for certain

01:46:17.163 --> 01:46:21.650
periods of each 24 hour cycle
than to eat smaller portions,

01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:24.327
portion control is very
hard for some people,

01:46:24.327 --> 01:46:28.570
for other people it's
manageable, but people like me.

01:46:28.570 --> 01:46:30.680
I don't eat half the croissant.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.109
I don't think it's a real thing, it's not,

01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:35.340
it's not available to me, I should say.

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.596
Now, of course I could
eat just half a croissant,

01:46:37.596 --> 01:46:39.770
but I noticed that when
I eat the croissant,

01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:42.810
because they're so delicious
that it creates a rise in blood

01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:46.760
glucose a rise in the other
hormones and chemicals that are

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:49.763
associated with ingesting
delicious, highly palatable food.

01:46:49.763 --> 01:46:52.611
And it's actually a lot of work
for me to just eat half the

01:46:52.611 --> 01:46:54.008
croissant.

01:46:54.008 --> 01:46:58.585
There's something that's much
more thoroughly satisfying

01:46:58.585 --> 01:47:00.690
about eating the entire croissant.

01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:03.390
And actually there's something
that somewhat satisfying

01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:05.140
about not eating the croissant at all.

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:07.430
And just knowing that later I
can eat the whole croissant.

01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:08.400
Now that's me.

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.380
Other people find that they
don't have any trouble with

01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:14.850
portion control that for them
just eating small bits of food

01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:16.790
throughout the day is what
sets them in the right

01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:19.440
psychological and physical
state for sake of work,

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.273
et cetera.

01:47:20.273 --> 01:47:22.193
And I mentioned work and
mental focus because one of the

01:47:22.193 --> 01:47:25.598
aspects of fasting that have
drawn a lot of people to time

01:47:25.598 --> 01:47:29.519
restricted feeding and fasting
is the clarity of mind that

01:47:29.519 --> 01:47:30.945
people get.

01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:32.900
When first of all,

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:34.780
they don't have to think about
when they're going to eat

01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:37.008
because they know when
their eating window begins.

01:47:37.008 --> 01:47:39.036
They also don't have to
think about regulating their

01:47:39.036 --> 01:47:42.743
behavior because they already
know when they're going to eat

01:47:42.743 --> 01:47:44.240
and when they're not going to eat.

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:45.655
Whereas when you're restricting portions,

01:47:45.655 --> 01:47:48.147
you actually have to make
decisions all the while.

01:47:48.147 --> 01:47:51.515
You know, and I think I like
many people decide, well,

01:47:51.515 --> 01:47:53.410
you know, is that exactly half?

01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:55.630
Or could I have like another
wrong on the croissant?

01:47:55.630 --> 01:47:57.730
This kind of thing. I
don't negotiate with food.

01:47:57.730 --> 01:47:59.841
That's why I like a time
restricted feeding window.

01:47:59.841 --> 01:48:01.950
I know I'm going to eat for, in my case,

01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:03.588
I use a 10 hour feeding window or so,

01:48:03.588 --> 01:48:05.820
and I'll eat the whole croissant.

01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.176
I just don't have to think about it, now,

01:48:08.176 --> 01:48:11.340
the food choices that you make
inside of that feeding window

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.963
are of course also going
to be very important.

01:48:12.963 --> 01:48:15.120
Certain foods will increase blood glucose,

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.910
such that you're going to
get hungrier and hungrier.

01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:20.370
Others will maintain lower
blood glucose and will allow you

01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:23.427
to be more controlled in
the foods that you pursue.

01:48:23.427 --> 01:48:26.094
Those are all individual
considerations that are deserving

01:48:26.094 --> 01:48:27.696
of their own entire episode.

01:48:27.696 --> 01:48:30.449
But I do want to point out
that the advantage of time

01:48:30.449 --> 01:48:34.260
restricted feeding is that
it involves a lot of the

01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.740
decision-making in the brain.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:39.380
The so-called go no-go
circuitries of our basal ganglia,

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.410
if you want to know this
areas that control them.

01:48:41.410 --> 01:48:43.680
Anytime we have to restrict a behavior,

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:44.918
that's called a no-go.

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:47.395
Anytime we engage in a
behavior, that's a go,

01:48:47.395 --> 01:48:50.800
no go behaviors require a
lot of what's called top-down

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.910
control, and it's very
metabolically demanding.

01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:57.110
And so time restricted feeding
allows you to depart from the

01:48:57.110 --> 01:49:00.129
whole no-go go negotiation that
you have to undergo when you

01:49:00.129 --> 01:49:03.610
have to restrict portions.

01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:05.178
And so I think this is a
reason why many people have

01:49:05.178 --> 01:49:08.260
gravitated towards time
restricted feeding and why for

01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:11.430
people that don't want to have
to think about all that it's

01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:13.010
just very straight forward.

01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:15.850
One of the more hot button
issues out there is whether or

01:49:15.850 --> 01:49:20.850
not given equal amounts of
caloric intake and equal amounts

01:49:21.232 --> 01:49:25.480
of activity and equal amounts
of nutrients, et cetera,

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.030
whether or not restricting
food to a particular window

01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:30.010
biases,

01:49:30.010 --> 01:49:32.839
more weight loss toward fat
loss versus loss of other

01:49:32.839 --> 01:49:34.562
tissues, because of course,
when we lose weight,

01:49:34.562 --> 01:49:38.340
we can lose that from any number
of different storage sites

01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:42.860
within the body, muscle
water, glycogen, or fat.

01:49:44.175 --> 01:49:47.760
Now this is such a hot button
issue that I almost don't want

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.400
to get into it, but I'm
going to get into it anyway,

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:52.287
because there are data
that are very interesting.

01:49:52.287 --> 01:49:55.812
This is covered in the review
that I mentioned earlier,

01:49:55.812 --> 01:50:00.259
that describes how if people
follow a time-restricted

01:50:00.259 --> 01:50:03.810
feeding schedule for long periods of time.

01:50:03.810 --> 01:50:05.202
So 60 days or longer,

01:50:05.202 --> 01:50:08.195
there's some metabolic
changes in the way that people

01:50:08.195 --> 01:50:12.638
metabolize energy that do seem
to shift the system toward

01:50:12.638 --> 01:50:17.012
more fat loss relative to burning
of other tissues when in a

01:50:17.012 --> 01:50:19.150
state of caloric restriction.

01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:21.680
And I want to say when in a
state of caloric restriction,

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:23.970
because there's really no
way to cheat the system,

01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:26.370
there's no way that you can
ingest far more calories than

01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:29.481
you burn or excrete, when
I say excrete, you know,

01:50:29.481 --> 01:50:32.279
I certainly don't suggest
this, but there, you know,

01:50:32.279 --> 01:50:35.060
bulimics and other people that
have eating disorders will

01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.497
use laxatives at a way to
eliminate food quickly from their

01:50:37.497 --> 01:50:38.330
system

01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:41.740
so it can't be converted into
fat or other forms of energy.

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.787
That's a very, in that case,
it's a pathological situation,

01:50:44.787 --> 01:50:47.743
but in general calories
in versus calories out,

01:50:47.743 --> 01:50:50.720
as I mentioned earlier as this
kind of foundational element,

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.675
but in states of caloric restriction,

01:50:52.675 --> 01:50:55.363
meaning sub maintenance intake,

01:50:57.374 --> 01:51:00.052
time-restricted feeding does
seem to buy us more of the

01:51:00.052 --> 01:51:04.999
energy burned to compensate
for that deficit from fat and

01:51:04.999 --> 01:51:08.022
the way it accomplishes
it is very interesting.

01:51:08.022 --> 01:51:11.930
It turns out that it drives
more fat loss by way of

01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:14.210
increasing a hepatic lipase.

01:51:14.210 --> 01:51:17.730
This is something called LAPC
hepatic means of the liver and

01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:22.350
lipase, which anytime you hear
ASC is means it's an enzyme.

01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:24.200
So it seems to increase hepatic lipase.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.605
So it increases the enzyme
that metabolizes fat for

01:51:27.605 --> 01:51:31.459
lipolysis and energy production
and reduces something called

01:51:31.459 --> 01:51:34.440
CIDEC, CIDEC.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.660
which is a lipid droplet
associated and lipolysis inhibitor.

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:41.290
Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended,

01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:45.651
but what CIDEC really is
this lipid droplet associated

01:51:45.651 --> 01:51:49.682
molecule is it can inhibit lipolysis.

01:51:49.682 --> 01:51:53.509
So extended periods of
time, restricted feeding,

01:51:53.509 --> 01:51:57.453
meaning eight hour feeding
window or 10 hour feeding window

01:51:57.453 --> 01:52:01.871
that's obeyed for several months
or more seems to allow the

01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:06.871
system to shift toward burning
more fat or rather using a

01:52:08.663 --> 01:52:12.718
higher percentage of fat
when in a caloric deficit.

01:52:12.718 --> 01:52:17.140
Now I doubt that this is going
to resolve the truly barbed

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:18.181
wire, almost hairball,

01:52:18.181 --> 01:52:20.880
ridiculous online debates
about whether or not

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.940
time-restricted feeding is
better than another feeding

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:23.773
schedule, look,

01:52:23.773 --> 01:52:26.180
I don't think any particular
feeding schedule is holy.

01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:27.330
If you are sub caloric,

01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:30.180
meaning fewer calories burned
than calories ingested,

01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.056
you're going to lose weight.

01:52:31.056 --> 01:52:33.810
But the data seemed to point
to the fact that if you do time

01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:37.680
restricted feeding for a
fairly long duration of time,

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.040
and you maintain that,

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.458
that you are increasing
these lipases that increase

01:52:41.458 --> 01:52:45.301
lipolysis energy use from fat,

01:52:45.301 --> 01:52:49.063
and you're decreasing the lipid
droplet associated lipolysis

01:52:49.063 --> 01:52:50.360
inhibitors.

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.740
So it's both a you're removing
the break and you're pressing

01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.506
on the accelerator of fat loss.

01:52:55.506 --> 01:53:00.328
I think that this logically
points to a case in which using

01:53:00.328 --> 01:53:05.328
time restricted feeding with
a sub caloric intake seems to

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.260
be at least to my mind,

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:10.048
the most scientifically
supported way to ensure that a

01:53:10.048 --> 01:53:12.946
significant portion of the
weight that one loses is from

01:53:12.946 --> 01:53:15.550
body fat stores.

01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:18.688
Any discussion about fasting
would be incomplete without a

01:53:18.688 --> 01:53:22.224
discussion about what does
and does not break a fast.

01:53:22.224 --> 01:53:23.840
However,

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.060
there is no black and white
answer to that question,

01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:30.855
and you should immediately
understand why it's because

01:53:30.855 --> 01:53:35.855
eating and not eating are not
equivalent to fed and fasted.

01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:41.690
It depends on when you ate
how much you ate and where you

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.810
are in your circadian cycle.

01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:47.360
We can actually arrive at a
simple answer to whether or not

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.180
something breaks the fast or not.

01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:51.102
Now the technical way to go
about this would be to wear a

01:53:51.102 --> 01:53:54.517
continuous glucose monitor
and to ingest little bits of

01:53:54.517 --> 01:53:57.250
food, of different kinds
or large amounts of food,

01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:59.850
of different kinds and
measure blood glucose,

01:53:59.850 --> 01:54:02.736
because ultimately blood glucose
is the readout of whether

01:54:02.736 --> 01:54:04.797
or not your system is in
a fed or fasted state.

01:54:04.797 --> 01:54:07.000
There are other parameters too, of course,

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.530
but that's the dominant one

01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:14.910
in so far as the scientific
literature says drinking water

01:54:15.442 --> 01:54:20.442
will not break your fast
drinking tea will not break your

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.520
fast drinking coffee,

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.230
provided it as black coffee
will not break your fast

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:30.850
ingesting caffeine in pill
form will not break your fast.

01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:32.670
There are other things
that won't break your fast.

01:54:32.670 --> 01:54:33.669
For instance,

01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:37.297
eating one peanut when deep in
a fasted state will not break

01:54:37.297 --> 01:54:40.840
your fast, eating a whole
handful of peanuts might not even

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.750
break your fast if you are
in a very low glucose state.

01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:45.583
However,

01:54:45.583 --> 01:54:48.010
if you just finished a meal
that included carbohydrates,

01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:51.638
or it was a very large meal
of any kind an hour ago, yes,

01:54:51.638 --> 01:54:55.840
indeed, eating one peanut
could break your fast.

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.160
So it's all contextual, that's

01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.379
what's really important to understand,

01:54:59.379 --> 01:55:02.020
unless you're going to wear
a continuous glucose monitor.

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:04.896
And unless you are going to
wear a continuous glucose

01:55:04.896 --> 01:55:09.390
monitor and set an absolute
numerical threshold for what it

01:55:09.390 --> 01:55:10.659
is to break your fast.

01:55:10.659 --> 01:55:14.034
I think there are some simple
rules that we can follow.

01:55:14.034 --> 01:55:19.034
First of all, anything that
involves sugar in particular,

01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:21.860
simple sugars can
potentially break your fast.

01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:23.440
And there's actually a study on this,

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.027
which shows that if
people ingest even one,

01:55:27.027 --> 01:55:31.310
one gram of sugar post dinner,

01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:34.940
if they had a full meal for
dinner that can actually disrupt

01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.201
the expression of some of the
circadian genes related to

01:55:38.201 --> 01:55:41.940
fasting and to sleep and
sleep related fasting.

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:43.000
Now that's pretty extreme,

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.120
almost kind of scary to think about,

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:47.580
but that's how sensitive our system is.

01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:50.702
If we already have somewhat
elevated blood glucose from a

01:55:50.702 --> 01:55:52.837
meal that we ate an hour or so ago,

01:55:52.837 --> 01:55:57.837
whereas if we have run
for an hour or train hard,

01:55:58.140 --> 01:55:59.354
high intensity training,

01:55:59.354 --> 01:56:02.770
and we haven't quite reached
the beginning of our so-called

01:56:02.770 --> 01:56:07.272
feeding window, will eating
a small amount of food

01:56:07.272 --> 01:56:09.400
take us out of that fast?

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:11.920
Well, depends on what the food is.

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.190
If it's mostly fat,

01:56:13.190 --> 01:56:15.990
probably not, a number of
people out there nowadays

01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:17.750
talk about so-called fat fasting,

01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:22.599
fat fasting as a way to kind
of regal past the stringency of

01:56:22.599 --> 01:56:26.792
either eating or not eating
as a black and white rule for

01:56:26.792 --> 01:56:29.640
feeding window versus non feeding window.

01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:32.488
So some people will ingest
medium chain triglycerides

01:56:32.488 --> 01:56:34.480
so-called MCTs,

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:37.159
or people will ingest fats only
until their official feeding

01:56:37.159 --> 01:56:38.970
window begins.

01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:41.082
So these are sort of how the
negotiations that people carry

01:56:41.082 --> 01:56:42.348
out tend to go.

01:56:42.348 --> 01:56:46.260
But that of course won't increase
blood glucose and insulin

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:47.920
as much as carbohydrates will,

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.230
protein will have sort of
an intermediate effect.

01:56:50.230 --> 01:56:52.090
And as I mentioned earlier,

01:56:52.090 --> 01:56:55.105
ingesting carbohydrates with
some fat will tend to blunt the

01:56:55.105 --> 01:56:59.040
rise in glucose and will
extend the duration over which

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.410
glucose is released.

01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:05.410
So we really can't say food X
or beverage X breaks a fast,

01:57:06.971 --> 01:57:10.105
however, at the extremes, we
can say that, for instance,

01:57:10.105 --> 01:57:13.384
if you drink a can of soda pop,

01:57:13.384 --> 01:57:15.624
unless you just ran an ultra marathon,

01:57:15.624 --> 01:57:18.690
you're breaking your fast,
okay, eat a piece of pizza,

01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:22.085
You're breaking your fast,
you eat purely fats, maybe,

01:57:22.085 --> 01:57:23.670
probably not.

01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:26.684
If you've been fasting for
five hours or more strictly

01:57:26.684 --> 01:57:29.150
fasting for five hours or more.

01:57:29.150 --> 01:57:32.070
So you can start to see where
there's a lot of wiggle room

01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:33.550
and it's very contextual.

01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:36.532
And this is why any posts that
you see or any information

01:57:36.532 --> 01:57:39.020
that you see that something
does or does not break your

01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.233
fast,

01:57:40.233 --> 01:57:41.583
that doesn't place it in the
context of when the last time

01:57:41.583 --> 01:57:46.576
you ate and what you ate and
your activity and your time

01:57:46.576 --> 01:57:50.510
within the circadian clock
schedule of 24 hours,

01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:53.410
it's a sort of meaningless
discussion, so in general,

01:57:53.410 --> 01:57:55.630
I think what's really useful
if you're not going to wear a

01:57:55.630 --> 01:57:59.192
continuous glucose monitor is
to try and be fairly strict

01:57:59.192 --> 01:58:02.100
about when you initiate your
feeding window and when you

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:04.711
stop your feeding window
and as time evolves and you

01:58:04.711 --> 01:58:07.860
establish a more regular routine
of eating certain kinds of

01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:09.845
foods and not others that are
right for you because as I've

01:58:09.845 --> 01:58:11.710
emphasized before on this podcast,

01:58:11.710 --> 01:58:14.410
and I will continue to emphasize
keto works great for some

01:58:14.410 --> 01:58:17.290
people, vegetarian keto
works great for some people,

01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:19.349
carnivore diet works
great for other people.

01:58:19.349 --> 01:58:22.304
Some people are omnivores,
some people are carnivores,

01:58:22.304 --> 01:58:23.854
some people are vegan.

01:58:23.854 --> 01:58:26.012
All of that is great and fine by me.

01:58:26.012 --> 01:58:28.300
Everyone has to establish
what's right for them, today,

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:32.910
we've really bypass the
discussion about foods of a

01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:36.290
particular origin or type
animal-based or plant-based.

01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:39.278
But all the same rules apply
within this thing that we're

01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:42.790
called intermittent fasting
or time restricted feeding.

01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:46.074
So what breaks a fast will
depend and what you want to eat

01:58:46.074 --> 01:58:48.250
or what you are willing to eat.

01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:50.576
That's a totally separate
manner from when you eat.

01:58:50.576 --> 01:58:54.749
But as we've established, when
you eat is vitally important,

01:58:54.749 --> 01:58:57.740
some of you are probably wondering
whether or not artificial

01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:02.210
sweeteners or non artificial
plant-based sweeteners like

01:59:02.210 --> 01:59:06.390
Stevia break a fast,
this will vary somewhat.

01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:10.382
And I have to say the data
on this are somewhat mixed.

01:59:10.382 --> 01:59:14.295
There is evidence that when
people ingest artificial

01:59:14.295 --> 01:59:15.560
sweeteners,

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.790
that it can create a transient
increase in blood glucose

01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:22.560
followed by a transient
decrease in blood glucose below

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.507
baseline.

01:59:23.507 --> 01:59:26.268
This is thought to explain the
increase in hunger caused by

01:59:26.268 --> 01:59:29.430
ingestion of things like
aspartame and sucralose and things

01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:30.390
of that sort.

01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:32.542
There are not a lot of
good studies exploring the

01:59:32.542 --> 01:59:37.204
plant-based non sugar
sweeteners, things like Stevia,

01:59:37.204 --> 01:59:39.390
even things like monk fruit,

01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:40.818
which is a separate category unto itself.

01:59:40.818 --> 01:59:43.090
There aren't a lot of studies on this.

01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:44.776
I think most people need to
establish this for themselves.

01:59:44.776 --> 01:59:46.040
The best way of course,

01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:48.357
would be to wear a continuous
glucose monitor to go into a

01:59:48.357 --> 01:59:51.310
fasted state of either
one hour or two hours,

01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:53.109
or maybe you've been fasting
all night and then ingest

01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:56.876
Stevia in whatever form you
want or coffee in whatever form

01:59:56.876 --> 01:59:59.680
you want with sucralose
or aspartame, et cetera,

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:03.160
setting aside the discussion
about the effects of these

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:04.162
things on the gut microbiome,

02:00:04.162 --> 02:00:06.422
which is a different topic entirely.

02:00:06.422 --> 02:00:09.179
I think it's fair to
say that in moderation,

02:00:09.179 --> 02:00:13.199
the plant-based non sugar
sweeteners like Stevia in

02:00:13.199 --> 02:00:14.470
particular,

02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:18.240
Stevia seemed to have a
minimal impact on overall blood

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:20.924
glucose when considered over
a fairly large time been

02:00:20.924 --> 02:00:23.314
aspartame, and sucralose, saccharin.

02:00:23.314 --> 02:00:26.110
I think we can say more or less the same,

02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:27.960
but as soon as you get into
a discussion about those,

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.990
you also have to get into a
discussion about some of the

02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:34.220
evidence published in nature
and other excellent journals

02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:37.960
now pointing to the fact
that when consumed in excess,

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:40.020
not when consumed in moderation,

02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:42.070
but when consumed in excess
that those might have some

02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:43.946
detrimental effects on the gut microbiome.

02:00:43.946 --> 02:00:47.387
So do artificial sweeteners break a fast?

02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:50.380
It depends on the amount
depends on the type.

02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.213
And in general,

02:00:51.213 --> 02:00:53.481
I think you're probably okay
provided that you're not

02:00:53.481 --> 02:00:56.720
indulging in them too often, however,

02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:59.554
some people just by virtue
of tasting something sweet,

02:00:59.554 --> 02:01:03.100
feel a spike in their appetite
that makes it harder for them

02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:04.750
to adhere to the feeding window.

02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:07.043
And so this is why you can
imagine that a really well

02:01:07.043 --> 02:01:10.310
controlled study on this would
be very hard to carry out.

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:12.615
And I'm not really sure that
it's worth our tax dollars to

02:01:12.615 --> 02:01:15.329
actually design and carry
out a study like that because

02:01:15.329 --> 02:01:18.730
there would be so much
individual variation in terms of

02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:20.930
discipline in adhering
to the feeding window,

02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:23.850
whether or not people experience
increases and drops in

02:01:23.850 --> 02:01:24.944
blood glucose, how that impacts them,

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.370
whether or not they're exercising.

02:01:26.370 --> 02:01:29.239
It just becomes an infinite
variable space, as we say,

02:01:29.239 --> 02:01:31.010
in experimental science.

02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:32.792
So you really have to
determine that for you,

02:01:32.792 --> 02:01:36.450
but I don't think that we can
fairly say that artificial

02:01:36.450 --> 02:01:38.670
sweeteners break a fast.

02:01:38.670 --> 02:01:40.439
I think that would be
incorrect to say earlier,

02:01:40.439 --> 02:01:43.157
we were talking about
glucose disposal agents,

02:01:43.157 --> 02:01:47.720
both behavioral and compound
based things like Metformin and

02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:49.340
berberine, and in fact,

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:52.120
cinnamon is even a mild
glucose disposal agent.

02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:56.050
It can actually reduce blood
glucose, lemon and lime juice,

02:01:56.050 --> 02:01:58.055
believe it or not, can
lower blood glucose.

02:01:58.055 --> 02:02:00.460
You may have experienced this
before of eating something

02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.293
very,

02:02:01.293 --> 02:02:03.310
very sweet and almost feeling
kind of overwhelming on a

02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:04.830
poisoned by how sweet it is,

02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:07.490
especially if you're not
accustomed to eating a lot of

02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:09.080
sugary things.

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.128
One quick remedy for that is
actually a half lime or half

02:02:12.128 --> 02:02:14.597
lemon squeezed into juice and
drinking that just by virtue

02:02:14.597 --> 02:02:18.993
of the taste and by virtue of
the fact that it will reduce

02:02:18.993 --> 02:02:20.587
blood glucose.

02:02:20.587 --> 02:02:23.040
You'll notice that that
effect almost immediately

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:24.625
disappears, that's not magic.

02:02:24.625 --> 02:02:28.566
That's the effects of acidity
on blood glucose levels.

02:02:28.566 --> 02:02:31.650
So there are a number of
things that can adjust blood

02:02:31.650 --> 02:02:34.110
glucose, they're not
necessarily disposal agents,

02:02:34.110 --> 02:02:36.450
they're not sweeping it out
of the bloodstream in the same

02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:38.160
way that berberine or Metformin would,

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:40.910
or that high intensity exercise
at the appropriate times of

02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:41.743
day would.

02:02:41.743 --> 02:02:44.978
But there is one particular
thing that one can ingest that

02:02:44.978 --> 02:02:49.978
can help manage psychologically
and performance wise through

02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:55.069
the fasting portion of the
intermittent fasting and get you

02:02:55.069 --> 02:02:56.671
to your feeding window.

02:02:56.671 --> 02:02:58.576
And that's salt.

02:02:58.576 --> 02:03:01.500
I've talked a little bit about
this on the podcast before,

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:04.760
but because neurons use salt,

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.190
sodium and potassium and magnesium,

02:03:07.190 --> 02:03:10.540
the so-called electrolytes in
order to perform their magic

02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:12.180
of chemical and electrical signaling,

02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:13.600
everything you do depends on chemical,

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:16.060
electrical signaling and all
that chemical and electrical

02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:19.860
signaling requires electrolytes
in some form or another

02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:24.860
neurons run on the passage of
ions like sodium in and out of

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:28.260
their cell membranes are, I should say,

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:31.280
across their cell
membranes to be accurate.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.070
Many people find that the
kind of lightheadedness,

02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:38.170
the shakiness that's accustomed
with having slightly low

02:03:38.170 --> 02:03:43.170
blood sugar can be offset by
taking a half teaspoon or so of

02:03:43.227 --> 02:03:44.660
sea salt,

02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:47.010
or even just a tiny pinch of
salt and putting into some

02:03:47.010 --> 02:03:49.801
water and drinking it.

02:03:49.801 --> 02:03:54.540
Some people find because of
the glucose lowering effects of

02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.980
acidity, that if they're feeling
kind of shaky and not well,

02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:59.860
and they put some lemon juice
into water and drink that it

02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.404
drops their blood glucose further.

02:04:01.404 --> 02:04:05.110
So there's a common practice
nowadays that's discussed on

02:04:05.110 --> 02:04:07.970
the internet of waking up
drinking some water with some lime

02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:10.000
or lemon juice in it with
a little pinch of salt.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.751
I think that little pinch
of salt is a good idea.

02:04:11.751 --> 02:04:14.150
What is it doing, how is
it offsetting all this?

02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:15.180
Well,

02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:19.295
salt water actually has a mild
effect as a glucose disposal

02:04:19.295 --> 02:04:23.470
agent, but it has a stabilizing
effect on blood volume.

02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:24.400
And so,

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:27.725
because sodium brings with
it water and the so-called

02:04:27.725 --> 02:04:31.690
osmolarity of your blood in
your body depends on the salt

02:04:31.690 --> 02:04:35.456
levels in your blood and brain and body.

02:04:35.456 --> 02:04:38.080
Many people find that
they're feeling shaky.

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.830
They're feeling lightheaded.
They can't concentrate.

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:41.440
They think they need sugar or food,

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.560
but what will actually
remedy that is some salt.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.680
And I know a number of people
that have incorporated this

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.450
practice and have written to
me and saying, oh, you know,

02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:50.810
if I just take a little
bit of salt in some water,

02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:52.530
they may or may not include
the lemon or lime juice.

02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:54.435
They immediately feel better
and find that it's actually

02:04:54.435 --> 02:04:56.999
quite straightforward to get out to that,

02:04:56.999 --> 02:05:00.193
to wait until the feeding window kicks in.

02:05:00.193 --> 02:05:03.219
This is especially true for
people that are using caffeine

02:05:03.219 --> 02:05:05.230
because when you ingest caffeine,

02:05:05.230 --> 02:05:06.980
you actually excrete a lot of water,

02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:08.310
it has a diarrhetic effect.

02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:10.210
And with that water goes salt.

02:05:10.210 --> 02:05:11.886
So it actually causes
you to excrete sodium.

02:05:11.886 --> 02:05:15.983
Now the role of sodium in
blood pressure and hypertension

02:05:15.983 --> 02:05:19.311
is, you know, quite
controversial science magazine,

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:22.884
one of the premier scientific
journals out there had a

02:05:22.884 --> 02:05:26.090
special issue all about
salt some years ago,

02:05:26.090 --> 02:05:28.097
talking about the research
around hypertension,

02:05:28.097 --> 02:05:31.040
indeed people with chronic
hypertension or high blood

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.590
pressure or very high blood
pressure in particular should be

02:05:33.590 --> 02:05:35.520
wary of ingesting too much sodium.

02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:38.881
But for most people ingesting
sodium provided they drink

02:05:38.881 --> 02:05:42.530
enough water and they don't
have chronic hypertension or

02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:45.640
high blood pressure is
actually beneficial.

02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:47.270
Now that doesn't mean you
should be drinking seawater

02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:49.605
doesn't mean you should
be overindulging in salt,

02:05:49.605 --> 02:05:53.840
but many people find that they
can manage their mental and

02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:55.684
physical state and even
feel really terrific,

02:05:55.684 --> 02:05:58.050
real clarity of mind,

02:05:58.050 --> 02:06:00.910
and really enjoy their
fast when they're ingesting

02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:01.743
sufficient salt.

02:06:01.743 --> 02:06:03.680
And all it requires really
is a small pinch of salt,

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.060
ideally Himalayan or sea salt.

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:06.190
If you want to get fancy about it,

02:06:06.190 --> 02:06:08.090
but table salt would be fine.

02:06:08.090 --> 02:06:10.298
And just drinking that in some water,

02:06:10.298 --> 02:06:14.050
maybe with lemon or lime juice
to offset the taste a little

02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:17.392
bit can really stabilize one's
jitters and can stabilize the

02:06:17.392 --> 02:06:22.392
mind, and you might also notice
can offset that churning and

02:06:22.768 --> 02:06:26.789
yearning and appetite where
you can't imagine going another

02:06:26.789 --> 02:06:29.530
five minutes before eating
something suddenly you feel okay.

02:06:29.530 --> 02:06:31.881
And that has to do with a lot
of the effects of blood volume

02:06:31.881 --> 02:06:35.400
caused by ingesting salt
in the appropriate amounts.

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.833
In other words, sometimes
you think you need food,

02:06:37.833 --> 02:06:40.560
but what you really need to
salt and salt can make you feel

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:41.607
better immediately.

02:06:41.607 --> 02:06:44.718
I'd like to mention too
excellent zero cost resources.

02:06:44.718 --> 02:06:47.660
If you're going to explore
time restricted feeding,

02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:50.850
or maybe if you already are
doing time restricted feeding,

02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:53.312
I have no affiliation to either of these.

02:06:53.312 --> 02:06:55.690
The first is the website
that I mentioned before, My

02:06:55.690 --> 02:06:57.020
Circadian Clock,

02:06:57.020 --> 02:07:00.450
which is the website hosted by
Satchin Panda and colleagues.

02:07:00.450 --> 02:07:02.493
There are a lot of resources
there where you can log your

02:07:02.493 --> 02:07:03.490
food intake,

02:07:03.490 --> 02:07:05.600
get information about
time-restricted feeding all the

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.520
science, the ongoing studies, et cetera.

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:10.015
The other is the so-called Zero app.

02:07:10.015 --> 02:07:15.015
That makes it very easy to
mark when you're beginning your

02:07:16.393 --> 02:07:19.480
feeding window and when you're
ending your feeding window

02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:20.313
and in,

02:07:20.313 --> 02:07:22.180
so doing marking when you are
beginning your fast and ending

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:23.380
or fast,

02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:27.620
where at least initiating the
beginning of the unfed state,

02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:30.259
as we could more accurately
call it, it's a terrific app.

02:07:30.259 --> 02:07:32.010
I've used it from time to time.

02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:34.027
I don't tend to use it in an
ongoing basis because I'm just

02:07:34.027 --> 02:07:37.847
sort of used to eating at a
particular time of day now.

02:07:37.847 --> 02:07:40.702
But anytime I've shifted
that window, for instance,

02:07:40.702 --> 02:07:42.022
a few weeks ago,

02:07:42.022 --> 02:07:45.510
I started moving that protein
intake in my entire feeding

02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:46.539
window earlier in the day.

02:07:46.539 --> 02:07:49.565
And because that takes
some attention on my part,

02:07:49.565 --> 02:07:51.129
because I'm not used to doing that.

02:07:51.129 --> 02:07:54.130
I've been using the Zero app
and I like it quite a lot.

02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:56.390
It logs your progress and it
gives you averages and you can

02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:58.200
see how many other
people are fasting again,

02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.354
totally zero cost. I actually
don't know who owns that app,

02:08:00.354 --> 02:08:03.150
but I think they've done an excellent job.

02:08:03.150 --> 02:08:05.660
The interface is really
terrific, and as far as I know,

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:07.390
it's available for Apple and Android,

02:08:07.390 --> 02:08:09.360
but it's at least
available for Apple phones,

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.510
which is the type of
phone I happen to have.

02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:14.213
So check those out, My Circadian Clock.

02:08:14.213 --> 02:08:15.963
You just put that into
Google, you'll find it.

02:08:15.963 --> 02:08:19.840
And the Zero app, both
excellent zero cost resources.

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:24.155
In a moment I'd like to review
the parameters of a ideal

02:08:24.155 --> 02:08:28.360
feeding schedule for you and
give you the variables that you

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:30.769
can plug into your lifestyle
and your preferences.

02:08:30.769 --> 02:08:33.310
There are a couple of things
that I would place into the

02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:36.776
category of frequently asked somewhat odd,

02:08:36.776 --> 02:08:39.247
but still worthy of discussion.

02:08:39.247 --> 02:08:41.280
For instance,

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:44.600
people have asked will brushing
your teeth with toothpaste,

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:45.680
break your fast?

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:49.580
I think unless you're
swallowing the toothpaste, no.

02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:51.560
Now if you really want to
run out and get a continuous

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:53.060
glucose monitor and brush your teeth,

02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:54.280
and you can evaluate that,

02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:57.968
but no people have asked will
a half glass of wine after

02:08:57.968 --> 02:09:01.118
dinner a couple hours after
dinner break your fast.

02:09:01.118 --> 02:09:02.287
Absolutely.

02:09:02.287 --> 02:09:03.740
It absolutely will.

02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:07.870
And it's been demonstrated to
do that based on the one gram

02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:08.703
of sugar,

02:09:08.703 --> 02:09:11.850
kind of eerie or scary effect
that I talked about before,

02:09:11.850 --> 02:09:12.683
scary and eerie,

02:09:12.683 --> 02:09:15.180
because it just seems
like one gram of sugar.

02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:16.013
How could it do that?

02:09:16.013 --> 02:09:19.650
But these are metabolic
processes and they are very

02:09:19.650 --> 02:09:22.451
sensitive, post-meal, a few months back,

02:09:22.451 --> 02:09:26.081
I did an experiment wearing
a continuous glucose monitor.

02:09:26.081 --> 02:09:29.572
And I got a surprise when I
discovered that going into a

02:09:29.572 --> 02:09:32.960
sauna increases my blood
glucose quite a bit.

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.075
It actually spikes it as high as a meal.

02:09:35.075 --> 02:09:38.140
And then it tends to drop
back down to baseline or even

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.680
slightly below baseline afterwards,

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:44.160
when I talk to people about
this, somebody said, oh,

02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:46.529
it's got to be that the
continuous glucose monitor was

02:09:46.529 --> 02:09:48.880
getting disrupted by
the heat in the sauna.

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:49.982
That's actually not the case.

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:53.325
Turns out that when you go in a sauna,

02:09:53.325 --> 02:09:56.563
because you dehydrate,
you're losing water,

02:09:56.563 --> 02:09:59.935
I wasn't drinking water and
you're dropping a lot of water.

02:09:59.935 --> 02:10:02.944
The concentration of sugar in
your blood actually goes up.

02:10:02.944 --> 02:10:05.657
And I actually put these data
out in a social media post on

02:10:05.657 --> 02:10:07.670
Twitter,

02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:10.982
and people were kind of shocked
to see how much a sauna can

02:10:10.982 --> 02:10:14.020
spike your blood glucose,
now I do practice time,

02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:16.610
restricted feeding, intermittent fasting.

02:10:16.610 --> 02:10:17.940
I'm not super strict about it.

02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:20.362
I use a kind of eight to 10
hour ish window either early in

02:10:20.362 --> 02:10:23.439
the day or late in the day.

02:10:23.439 --> 02:10:26.034
I saw this effect of
the sauna, personally,

02:10:26.034 --> 02:10:30.611
the psychological and physical
health effects of the sauna

02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:34.427
are valuable enough to me
that I continue to use it.

02:10:34.427 --> 02:10:37.460
I'm just not concerned about
this increase in blood glucose,

02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:39.590
to the extent that I'm
going to eliminate sauna.

02:10:39.590 --> 02:10:42.188
I like to use the sauna three
or four times a week before

02:10:42.188 --> 02:10:44.880
sleep, so I'll use it an
hour or two before sleep.

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:45.713
And yes,

02:10:45.713 --> 02:10:48.000
indeed it creates this big
spike in blood glucose that then

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.411
drops based on change in the
concentration of blood sugar.

02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:53.220
I'm just not going to worry about it, now,

02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:55.420
if you're concerned about
blood glucose spikes,

02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:57.971
then you might be worried
about it, but in my case,

02:10:57.971 --> 02:11:00.297
it was one of those things
where it was interesting and it

02:11:00.297 --> 02:11:02.860
was worthy of discussion.

02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:04.620
I thought because it was
somewhat surprising to me,

02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:06.850
although it makes perfect sense
why this would be the case,

02:11:06.850 --> 02:11:08.620
but at the end of the day, literally,

02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:11.050
it just makes sense for
me to get in the sauna.

02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:13.334
Okay. So now you've
heard a lot of science.

02:11:13.334 --> 02:11:16.620
You've heard a lot of
examples, even a few anecdotes,

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:21.620
and let's come up with the
ideal intermittent fasting,

02:11:22.530 --> 02:11:26.520
AKA time, restricted
feeding schedule for you.

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:28.420
And when I say ideal, I mean,

02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:30.720
what are the variables
that are negotiable?

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:32.867
What are the ones that are non-negotiable?

02:11:32.867 --> 02:11:36.660
What is ideal for you will
depend on the context of your

02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:39.540
life and what you are
willing to do consistently.

02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:43.020
So, first of all,

02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.130
we established based on the
discussion with Satchin,

02:11:46.130 --> 02:11:49.440
who is truly the premier
world expert in this area,

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:53.860
who knows the animal and human
scientific literature better

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.844
than anybody has written
this incredible review.

02:11:55.844 --> 02:11:58.090
And for whom I consulted that

02:11:59.049 --> 02:12:03.370
you do not want to ingest
food for at least I want to

02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:07.440
emphasize at least 60 minutes
post waking up, second,

02:12:08.395 --> 02:12:13.246
you want to avoid ingesting
any food of any kind,

02:12:13.246 --> 02:12:15.560
even one gram of sugar, remember,

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:18.766
this is the ideal one gram of
sugar even would be too much

02:12:18.766 --> 02:12:23.473
for the two to three
hours prior to bedtime.

02:12:23.473 --> 02:12:25.586
He also mentioned, ideally,

02:12:25.586 --> 02:12:28.500
you are spending eight hours in bed.

02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:30.028
I didn't tell you that
earlier. I saved that for now,

02:12:30.028 --> 02:12:33.936
but ideally you are sleeping
that entire eight hours,

02:12:33.936 --> 02:12:36.826
but simply by being in bed for
that eight hours and avoiding

02:12:36.826 --> 02:12:41.250
food after waking for an hour
and before bed for two to

02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:42.083
three hours,

02:12:42.083 --> 02:12:44.644
you're starting to build out
the duration of this fasted

02:12:44.644 --> 02:12:46.043
period.

02:12:47.335 --> 02:12:52.335
Remember that the sleep
related fasting is particularly

02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:55.500
important for the health
benefits of time-restricted

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:56.512
feeding.

02:12:56.512 --> 02:12:57.345
Again,

02:12:57.345 --> 02:13:00.456
the sleep-related fasting is
especially important because of

02:13:00.456 --> 02:13:04.582
all the cellar repair processes
that occur in the liver and

02:13:04.582 --> 02:13:08.391
the gut in the microbiome, in
the brain all over the body.

02:13:08.391 --> 02:13:11.100
And because of the way that
that coordinates the expression

02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:14.730
of the clock genes that are
then going to wick out and have

02:13:14.730 --> 02:13:17.720
many other positive effects on health,

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.600
including weight and fat loss.

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:23.856
But in addition to that
liver health, et cetera,

02:13:23.856 --> 02:13:28.856
an eight hour feeding window
as a target seems to be the

02:13:28.969 --> 02:13:33.700
best target feeding, at least
by my read of the literature.

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:36.780
And in discussing it with
shuts such in shorter feeding

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:38.320
windows of four to six hours,

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:41.587
tend to lead to overeating
and potentially increases in

02:13:41.587 --> 02:13:42.453
weight.

02:13:43.553 --> 02:13:47.854
One meal per day type eating
do not seem to do that,

02:13:47.854 --> 02:13:52.345
but those are special cases in
that most people can't adhere

02:13:52.345 --> 02:13:54.775
to a one meal per day type schedule,

02:13:54.775 --> 02:13:57.160
at least not on a regular basis.

02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:00.130
And it's not very compatible
with most social schedules.

02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:02.083
Although some people may be
able to adhere to that in a

02:14:02.083 --> 02:14:03.340
straightforward way,

02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:06.637
but there aren't any robust
studies exploring the advantages

02:14:06.637 --> 02:14:08.902
of one meal per day.

02:14:08.902 --> 02:14:12.106
So if you feel there are
advantages of one meal per day for

02:14:12.106 --> 02:14:15.773
you as opposed to an
eight hour feeding window,

02:14:15.773 --> 02:14:16.973
well then by all means,

02:14:16.973 --> 02:14:20.202
use a one meal per day approach
or use a four to six hour

02:14:20.202 --> 02:14:24.210
feeding window and just make
sure you don't overeat in that

02:14:24.210 --> 02:14:25.605
window.

02:14:25.605 --> 02:14:30.605
Remember that most people tend
to not adhere to the eight

02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:32.385
hour feeding window, they say eight hours,

02:14:32.385 --> 02:14:36.010
but they tend to eat outside
of the eight hours a little bit

02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:40.945
on each side, so if your goal
is a 10 hour feeding window,

02:14:40.945 --> 02:14:43.655
you might want to set it to
nine hours or eight hours.

02:14:43.655 --> 02:14:45.540
If your goal is six hours,

02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:47.620
you might want to set it
to seven or eight hours.

02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:48.640
And this is simply based by,

02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:51.492
I shouldn't say simply
this is based on thousands,

02:14:51.492 --> 02:14:56.420
if not tens of thousands of
human subject data points that

02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:58.770
Satchin and colleagues have collected

02:14:59.881 --> 02:15:04.881
regular placement of the eating
window or feeding window,

02:15:05.770 --> 02:15:08.300
every 24 hours is important.

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:11.140
You don't have to be absolutely
rigid and neurotic about

02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:11.973
this,

02:15:11.973 --> 02:15:13.840
but you don't want it sliding
around on the weekends so that

02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:16.302
it starting two hours later
and ending two hours later,

02:15:16.302 --> 02:15:18.154
a couple days a week,

02:15:18.154 --> 02:15:22.695
because then you start to offset
many of the positive health

02:15:22.695 --> 02:15:25.700
effects that have been
demonstrated for time restricted

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:26.798
feeding.

02:15:26.798 --> 02:15:31.798
Remember if you eat your
food within a certain feeding

02:15:32.166 --> 02:15:35.599
window, but that feeding window
shifts by a couple of hours,

02:15:35.599 --> 02:15:38.926
it is effectively like
jet lagging your system.

02:15:38.926 --> 02:15:42.364
It is effectively like traveling
a couple times zones over

02:15:42.364 --> 02:15:45.698
eating there for a few days
and coming back when in fact

02:15:45.698 --> 02:15:48.421
you're not traveling,

02:15:48.421 --> 02:15:50.481
that's because of the
way that food adjusts,

02:15:50.481 --> 02:15:52.700
the circadian clock genes.

02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:55.520
Now you can offset some of
that through the use of light.

02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:58.140
And I've talked extensively
about how to use light in

02:15:58.140 --> 02:15:59.537
previous podcasts, but again,

02:15:59.537 --> 02:16:01.970
early morning and all day bright,

02:16:01.970 --> 02:16:04.510
light exposure as safely as
you can, ideally from sunlight,

02:16:04.510 --> 02:16:06.010
not through a window, et cetera,

02:16:06.010 --> 02:16:07.840
avoiding bright light in
the middle of the night,

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:10.610
extremely important for mood offsetting,

02:16:10.610 --> 02:16:12.404
metabolic dysfunction, et cetera,

02:16:12.404 --> 02:16:16.283
not incidentally Satchin's early work was,

02:16:16.283 --> 02:16:20.910
he was one of the three
co-discoverers of the cells in the

02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:23.390
eye, the so-called melanopsin
cells that set the central

02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:26.230
circadian clock. So he was
a pioneer in that field,

02:16:26.230 --> 02:16:28.930
which led him to be a pioneer
in this field and so on.

02:16:29.828 --> 02:16:34.337
When should that eight hour
window be placed within each 24

02:16:34.337 --> 02:16:37.107
hour cycle? Well, let's
talk about ideal ideal.

02:16:37.107 --> 02:16:42.107
If you really want to maximize
all the health benefits of

02:16:42.909 --> 02:16:45.563
time-restricted feeding,

02:16:45.563 --> 02:16:50.160
you need to extend the fast
around sleep on both sides.

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:52.332
You would place it smack dab
in the middle of the day.

02:16:52.332 --> 02:16:55.980
It would be a schedule in
which you started eating for

02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:00.412
instance at 10:00 AM. And you
stopped eating at 6:00 PM.

02:17:00.412 --> 02:17:03.830
An absolutely dreadful schedule
for anyone that wants to

02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:06.588
have some semblance of a
normal life. In my opinion,

02:17:06.588 --> 02:17:09.920
it's not really compatible
with most schedules.

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:11.800
Although some people
might be able to do it,

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.370
maybe you and your family or
your friends, your, you know,

02:17:15.370 --> 02:17:16.861
you're eating a late breakfast or a,

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:20.170
and then you're having a
late-ish lunch around 2:00 PM.

02:17:20.170 --> 02:17:21.480
And then you have dinner at six.

02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:25.110
And then assuming that you
go to bed around nine 30 or

02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:26.080
10:00 PM,

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.956
that is going to extract
the maximum amount of weight

02:17:30.956 --> 02:17:35.956
related body fat related metabolic
factor related aspects of

02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:39.600
time, restricted feeding.

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.261
Some people tend to fall into
a category where they do best

02:17:43.261 --> 02:17:47.436
placing that feeding window
later in the day and provided

02:17:47.436 --> 02:17:49.700
it. Doesn't run too close to your sleep.

02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:51.790
Remember you needed a two or
three hour buffer before your

02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:52.623
sleep,

02:17:52.623 --> 02:17:54.940
where you're not ingesting
anything that's in order to

02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:57.197
extract the benefits of
time-restricted feeding.

02:17:57.197 --> 02:18:02.090
Well then starting your
feeding window at 12:00 PM and

02:18:02.090 --> 02:18:06.237
ending at 8:00 PM plus or
minus half an hour or so day to

02:18:06.237 --> 02:18:09.720
day, it seems like a perfectly
reasonable schedule for some

02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:12.021
people starting at 2:00 PM
and ending at 10:00 PM will be

02:18:12.021 --> 02:18:13.641
that schedule.

02:18:13.641 --> 02:18:15.100
Of course,

02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:17.633
you have to take into
consideration when you exercise.

02:18:17.633 --> 02:18:19.197
If you exercise.

02:18:19.197 --> 02:18:22.451
For instance, I like to exercise
early in the day if I run,

02:18:22.451 --> 02:18:26.088
or if I do some moderate or
light intensity exercise,

02:18:26.088 --> 02:18:28.490
regardless of what type of exercise it is,

02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:31.976
I have no trouble waiting until
my feeding window kicks in

02:18:31.976 --> 02:18:33.957
around noon or even 2:00 PM.

02:18:33.957 --> 02:18:37.230
But if I do high intensity
weight training, for instance,

02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:38.063
early in the day,

02:18:38.063 --> 02:18:41.139
or if I run sprints and I do
that at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM by

02:18:41.139 --> 02:18:43.440
11:00 AM, I am very,

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.503
very hungry and it's hard
for me to do other things

02:18:46.503 --> 02:18:48.490
concentrate, et cetera.

02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:50.780
Now I'm not neurotic
about my feeding window.

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:51.630
As I mentioned before,

02:18:51.630 --> 02:18:54.047
I kind of let it expand and
contract a bit around the eight

02:18:54.047 --> 02:18:57.100
hour mark, and feel perfectly
free to do that too.

02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.920
We're talking here in, in ideals,

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:01.840
not in necessarily practicals,

02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:05.810
but other people find that
they're very hungry when they

02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:06.890
wake up early in the day.

02:19:06.890 --> 02:19:09.908
If you're one of these people
or you're somebody who really

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:14.670
is trying to emphasize hypertrophy
or maintenance of muscle,

02:19:14.670 --> 02:19:17.471
then it does seem that ingesting
protein early in the day is

02:19:17.471 --> 02:19:18.844
beneficial.

02:19:18.844 --> 02:19:23.155
That it can be more readily
converted into muscle tissue.

02:19:23.155 --> 02:19:26.520
And this has been demonstrated
in at least one study.

02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:27.750
There's another study underway.

02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:31.000
That's exploring this further
for people that are really,

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.150
really interested in hypertrophy
and building muscle will

02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:36.030
then time-restricted feeding
is usually not the way they go.

02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:37.550
I mean, let's be honest.

02:19:37.550 --> 02:19:40.254
There are many people out
there who are eating four more

02:19:40.254 --> 02:19:41.350
meals per day,

02:19:41.350 --> 02:19:43.904
and they're doing that
from 7:00 AM until 8:00 PM.

02:19:43.904 --> 02:19:46.410
I realized that not
everybody is overweight.

02:19:46.410 --> 02:19:47.632
There is an obesity crisis. Indeed.

02:19:47.632 --> 02:19:48.830
You know,

02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:52.080
the percentage of obesity
and non-alcoholic fatty liver

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.810
disease is just cosmic through the roof,

02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:56.023
at least in this country and
in other countries as well,

02:19:56.023 --> 02:19:59.113
this country meaning the US
but other countries as well.

02:20:01.098 --> 02:20:02.350
But there are of course,

02:20:02.350 --> 02:20:04.910
people that are trying to gain
weight through who don't want

02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:07.350
to lose weight or who are
trying to maximize physical

02:20:07.350 --> 02:20:09.480
performance or hypertrophy
or things of that sort.

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:12.251
And so of course time-restricted
feeding for them might be

02:20:12.251 --> 02:20:14.234
as long as I'm awake, I'm eating.

02:20:14.234 --> 02:20:18.470
And I, you know, I tip my hat
to those people and just say,

02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:19.303
you know,

02:20:19.303 --> 02:20:20.898
provided you understand what
you're doing and the burden

02:20:20.898 --> 02:20:21.731
that,

02:20:21.731 --> 02:20:23.630
that places on some of the
other processes in your body,

02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:26.380
if that's right for you, then
by all means pursue that.

02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:29.810
Another thing that we can add
to this summary or key points

02:20:29.810 --> 02:20:33.660
related to time restricted
feeding is the use of glucose,

02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:36.045
disposal, agents, and or behaviors.

02:20:36.045 --> 02:20:40.500
If you find that you've eaten
too close to a period of time

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:42.170
in which you would prefer to be fasting,

02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:46.242
that's when a 30 minute brisk
walk or even modest walk after

02:20:46.242 --> 02:20:49.039
eating can be beneficial,

02:20:49.039 --> 02:20:52.382
ingesting some lemon juice
or lime juice can help lower

02:20:52.382 --> 02:20:54.154
blood glucose somewhat.

02:20:54.154 --> 02:20:57.379
And then there are the things
like Metformin and berberine

02:20:57.379 --> 02:20:58.250
there,

02:20:58.250 --> 02:21:00.620
even some supplements out
there that combine things like

02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:01.764
berberine cinnamon,

02:21:01.764 --> 02:21:06.515
which can lower blood glucose
and things like chromium and

02:21:06.515 --> 02:21:09.160
things that have a mild
effect on blood glucose,

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:14.160
but berberine and Metformin
are very high potency glucose

02:21:14.708 --> 02:21:16.092
disposal agents.

02:21:16.092 --> 02:21:18.740
And I mentioned earlier why you
would want to approach those

02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:21.187
with the appropriate level
of caution and figure out the

02:21:21.187 --> 02:21:23.470
dosages for you, and, and for some people,

02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:26.307
the dosages will be zero
milligrams is going to be ideal.

02:21:26.307 --> 02:21:29.810
And then of course we discussed
how making sure that you're

02:21:29.810 --> 02:21:32.682
ingesting enough fluids in
particular water and salt,

02:21:32.682 --> 02:21:36.756
especially if you're using
caffeine in order to increase

02:21:36.756 --> 02:21:38.120
your levels of alertness,

02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:40.530
regardless of where that caffeine
source comes from coffee,

02:21:40.530 --> 02:21:41.699
tea, or otherwise,

02:21:41.699 --> 02:21:45.090
that can cause the excretion
of sodium and can lead to a

02:21:45.090 --> 02:21:46.000
kind of shakiness,

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.670
a lightheadedness and the
feelings of hunger that may or may

02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:52.968
not be related to blood glucose.

02:21:52.968 --> 02:21:55.030
Some people genuinely need to eat.

02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:56.830
I certainly would not
want to see people getting

02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:58.837
hypoglycemic to the point
where it's dangerous.

02:21:58.837 --> 02:22:02.091
Certainly if you are
diabetic, you, and in fact,

02:22:02.091 --> 02:22:03.180
for all people,

02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:07.450
you should consult with your
physician when exploring any

02:22:07.450 --> 02:22:09.706
major changes to diet or
additions or subtractions of

02:22:09.706 --> 02:22:11.088
anything, including supplementation,

02:22:11.088 --> 02:22:14.998
but for most people maintaining
relatively low to modest

02:22:14.998 --> 02:22:19.998
blood glucose levels is going
to be pretty healthy and will

02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:24.170
allow all the positive effects
of intermittent fasting to

02:22:24.170 --> 02:22:25.240
occur.

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:29.220
And when you find that reaching
that start to the feeding

02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:33.380
window is challenging that
ingesting sodium can often

02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:37.040
stabilize your system
mentally and physically,

02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:39.959
and allow you to reach that
window often painlessly.

02:22:39.959 --> 02:22:43.700
And then as a final point,
as I mentioned earlier,

02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:46.548
provided that they are consumed in low,

02:22:46.548 --> 02:22:51.299
no or modest amounts,
artificial sweeteners,

02:22:51.299 --> 02:22:53.540
or plant-based non sugar,

02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:57.220
non caloric sweeteners don't
seem to really impact blood

02:22:57.220 --> 02:22:59.550
glucose to the extent that
it would quote unquote,

02:22:59.550 --> 02:23:01.214
take you out of your fast,

02:23:01.214 --> 02:23:04.740
but that like fat fasting is
something that's going to be

02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:05.810
highly individual,

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.910
and that you're going to
have to experiment with for

02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:12.049
yourself and being able to
recognize when you're in a fast

02:23:12.049 --> 02:23:14.130
and when you're out of a fast,

02:23:14.130 --> 02:23:16.331
at a subjective level and not
constantly having to measure

02:23:16.331 --> 02:23:19.318
your blood glucose or do
things of that sort can be

02:23:19.318 --> 02:23:20.700
beneficial.

02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:23.257
And I think if you watch for
the feelings associated with

02:23:23.257 --> 02:23:26.830
eating and post eating foods
of different kinds in different

02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:27.690
amounts,

02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:30.837
and you watch for the feelings
associated with being fasted

02:23:30.837 --> 02:23:34.202
for long periods of time or
short periods of time of having

02:23:34.202 --> 02:23:37.470
gotten sufficient sunlight
of having trained harder,

02:23:37.470 --> 02:23:39.625
not trained hard earlier
that day, et cetera,

02:23:39.625 --> 02:23:41.500
you can do the most important thing,

02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:44.339
which is to start to learn,
to evaluate your own system,

02:23:44.339 --> 02:23:45.920
to run simple,

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:48.746
safe experiments on your system
in a way that allows you to

02:23:48.746 --> 02:23:52.720
really establish the ideal
nutrition schedule for you,

02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:54.720
whether it be time restricted, feeding,

02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:58.596
AKA intermittent fasting, or
some other nutritional plan.

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:01.647

there,

02:24:28.071 --> 02:24:31.522
I do brief posts about science
that often are not covered on

02:24:31.522 --> 02:24:34.580
the podcast. So that's
Huberman Lab on Instagram.

02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:36.256
We're also on Twitter also @hubermanlab.

02:24:36.256 --> 02:24:39.697
Recently we launched a clips
channel Huberman Lab Clips.

that we mentioned at the

02:24:48.367 --> 02:24:50.023
beginning of this episode,

02:24:50.023 --> 02:24:52.197
that's a terrific way
to support the podcast.

02:24:52.197 --> 02:24:57.197

And there you can support the
podcast at any level that you

02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:01.240
like, during this episode.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:04.063
And in many other previous episodes,

02:25:04.063 --> 02:25:05.910
I discussed supplements.

02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:08.530
One issue with supplements and
the supplement industry as a

02:25:08.530 --> 02:25:09.400
whole,

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:12.508
is that the quality and amounts
of supplements often varies

02:25:12.508 --> 02:25:14.320
tremendously.

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:17.010
Therefore we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

02:25:17.010 --> 02:25:18.786
because Thorne has the
absolute highest levels

02:25:18.786 --> 02:25:19.870
of stringency with

02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:22.610
respect to the quality of
ingredients and the amount of the

02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:24.983
ingredients matching what's on the label.

02:25:24.983 --> 02:25:29.070
If you want to see what I take
and get 20% off any of Thorne

02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.910
supplements,

02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:34.910
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

02:25:35.108 --> 02:25:37.120
You'll see the list of
supplements that I take.

02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:38.120
You can get 20% off those.

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:40.666
And if you enter the thorn
site through that portal,

02:25:40.666 --> 02:25:43.903
you can get 20% off
anything that Thorne makes.

02:25:43.903 --> 02:25:45.574
I know we covered a lot
of information today.

02:25:45.574 --> 02:25:48.659
I hope you learned a lot about
time, restricted feeding.

02:25:48.659 --> 02:25:52.826
I hope you learned a lot about
metabolism and energy and

02:25:52.826 --> 02:25:56.949
health and how when you eat is
as important as what you eat,

02:25:56.949 --> 02:25:58.450
and last,

02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:01.110
but certainly not least thank
you for your interest in

02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:02.017
science.
