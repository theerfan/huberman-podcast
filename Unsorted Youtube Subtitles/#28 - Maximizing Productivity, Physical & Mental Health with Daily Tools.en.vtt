00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.760
where we discuss science

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.104
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:09.370
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.946
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.360
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.500
Today, we're going to talk
about science-based protocols

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.200
for sleep, mood, learning,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
nutrition, exercise of various kinds,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.040
strength and endurance, and hypertrophy,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.120
and we are going to talk
about some protocols

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.320
that relate to creativity.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.310
We're going to talk about
behavioral protocols,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.060
supplement based protocols,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.460
all science backed by quality,
peer-reviewed literature.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.280
The reason that we're
holding this episode now is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400
that in the recent previous episodes,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.420
we've covered some pretty
intense and in-depth topics.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.880
We've talked about vision and how we see

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.460
and how to get better at seeing
and how to maintain vision.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.690
We've talked about hearing and balance.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.710
We've talked about chemical sensing.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.890
And we had a guest episode

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.350
that covered a lot of
information about new

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.140
and emerging technologies in neuroscience,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.640
as well as mental health.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.260
That was the interview episode
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.300
So given that we've covered
so much detailed information

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.400
in the previous 27 episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.240
I decided that we would hold office hours.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.160
Office hours in the university setting are

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.860
when students come to
the professor's office

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.480
or you meet outdoors on
campus or in the classroom

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.650
to review the material and questions

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.410
from lecture in more detail.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.370
Now, unfortunately, we
don't have the opportunity

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.780
to meet face to face in
real life, but nonetheless,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.310
you've been sending your questions,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.880
putting them in the comment
section on YouTube, et cetera,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.650
and I prepared a number of answers

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.620
to the questions that have
shown up most frequently.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.810
Now, in order to provide context

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.550
and structure to the way

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.290
that we will address these questions,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.070
I've arranged the science
and science-based protocols

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.690
that relate to various aspects of life-

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.610
such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.630
anxiety, creativity, et cetera-

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.640
into the context of a day.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.230
Selecting the unit of a day in order

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.910
to deliver this science information

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.490
and protocols is not a
haphazard decision on my part.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.610
It's actually the case that
every cell in our body,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.880
every organ in our body,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.170
and our brain is modulating or changes

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.710
across the 24 hour a day

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.060
in a very regular and predictable rhythm.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.035
And it's no coincidence
that the Earth spins once

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:31.653
on its axis every 24 hours.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.520
These two things are
coordinated by virtue of genes

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.030
and different proteins and things

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.660
that are expressed in
every cell of your body.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.750
And so selecting the unit of the day

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.190
is not just a practical one,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.403
but it's one that's related
to our deeper biology.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.980
You may have heard in my interview episode

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.210
in order to juggle a tremendous workload,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.440
a full-time clinical practice,
a lab of 40 plus people,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.443
a family of five children, et cetera,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.510
breaks up his life into units of days.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.060
And so today we are going
to further dissect the day

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.400
as a unit that one can manage
and manage extremely well,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.380
and, in fact, can optimize.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.270
So we're basically going to talk about

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.180
how to leverage science-based protocols.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.310
And when I say science, I mean,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.770
quality, peer-reviewed science published

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.560
in excellent journals.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.540
We're going to talk about
how to take that science,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.400
convert it into specific
protocols that break up

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.550
along the course of a single day

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.170
and direct certain types of behaviors

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.330
in order to optimize the
various features of life.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.760
I will couch this in
the context of what I do

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.960
across a daily 24-hour rhythm.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.290
That doesn't mean that you
have to follow this schedule

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.310
at all or even in part.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.680
It's just by way of example.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.010
Any number of the different things

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.970
that I describe could
be applied to any number

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.360
of different schedules or frameworks.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.890
But if there's one truth
that applies to all of us,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.360
is that we all have to exist

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.020
within the context of this 24 hour rhythm

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.210
that we all possess.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.150
So that's what we'll focus on.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.090
Before we begin,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.180
I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.560
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.810
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.600
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.560
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.690
In keeping with that theme,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.550
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.790
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.070
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.370
that I believe are the very
highest quality possible.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.030
Developed by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.460
ROKA sunglasses and
eyeglasses were developed

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.450
with their intention to create sunglasses

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.210
and eyeglasses that
could be worn anywhere.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.250
So while exercising or while working,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.360
at home, while driving.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.920
The reason I like ROKA glasses

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.480
so much is that first of all,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.150
they're extremely lightweight.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.950
The optical clarity of
the lenses is excellent,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.400
and so I often just forget
that I have even have them on.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.810
When I'm outside and
I'm wearing sunglasses,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.070
they have this really terrific feature

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.940
which is that I can move
in and out of shadows

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.360
or the cloud cover can change

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.000
and I can see perfectly
well the entire time.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.230
You know, many eyeglasses and
sunglasses that I've tried,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.910
depending on what we call the
"ambient lighting conditions,"

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.800
the local lighting conditions outside,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.480
I have to take them off
or put them back on.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.620
It's really annoying for me.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.720
But with ROKA glasses, somehow,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.340
I'm assuming because they
really understand the science

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.940
of the visual system,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.450
the eyeglasses and
sunglasses work seamlessly

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.850
with whatever environment you're in.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.470
So that's absolutely terrific.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.340
Another thing about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses is

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.710
that their aesthetic is really terrific.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.150
You know, I don't think
I'm alone in saying

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.370
that many performance
glasses as they're called end

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.040
up making people look like a cyborg,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.970
but the sunglasses are of
the sort that, you know,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.810
you can wear while running or biking

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.330
or driving or out to dinner.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.480
I don't typically wear
sunglasses while out to dinner,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.313
but you get the idea.

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:49.930
You can wear them anywhere
and they look very natural.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.960
They have a huge number of
different styles to select from.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.560
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.660

and enter the code huberman at checkout.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.305
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:11.640
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.300
that analyzes data from your blood

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.780
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.000
and help you reach your health goals.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.940
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.510
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.600
that impact your immediate

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.010
and long-term health can only be analyzed

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.860
from a quality blood test.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.980
With InsideTracker, it
alleviates a specific problem

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.810
that's associated with most, if not all,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.460
of the other blood tests
and DNA tests out there.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.400
And that problem is you get information

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.100
back about the levels of various things,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.650
metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.660
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.950
With InsideTracker, they
have this terrific dashboard

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.850
that allows you to both see
your levels of hormones,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.710
metabolic factors, and the rest,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.770
but also, it suggests specific
things that you can do

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.530
with your nutrition, your
exercise, and lifestyle,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.339
and so forth in order
to bring those levels

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.880
into the ranges that are
best for your immediate

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.510
and long-term health.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.970
In addition, they make the whole process

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.040
of getting your blood
and DNA taken very easy.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.540
They'll even come to your
home to take the sample.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.300
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.270

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.590
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.900
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.820
that are ideally matched your sleep needs.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.610
I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.300
about eight months ago,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.590
and I can honestly say it's the best sleep

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.830
that I've ever had in my entire life.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.890
And that's because the mattress

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.860
was actually designed for me.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.930
And you can have a
mattress designed for you.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.680
If you go to helixsleep.com,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.600
they have this free, very
brief, two-minute quiz

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.170
that asks you a number of questions

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.990
like do you sleep on
your side or your back?

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.550
Do you tend to run warm while you sleep

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.900
or do you tend to get cold
in the middle of the night?

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.550
Maybe you don't know the
answers to those questions,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.310
and that's fine too.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.310
After taking that quiz,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.920
they will match you to a specific mattress

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.200
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.270
I matched to the
so-called "Dusk Mattress,"

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.610
D-U-S-K, because I wanted a
mattress that was not too firm,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.600
not too soft.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.463
As I mentioned, I absolutely love it.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.210
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.270
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.740
take their two-minute sleep quiz,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.940
and they'll match you
to a customized mattress

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.580
and you'll get up to $200
off your mattress order

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.750
and two free pillows.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.870
They also make these terrific pillows.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.130
They have a 10-year warranty

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.510
and you get to try out the mattress

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.673
for 100 nights risk free.

00:08:38.673 --> 00:08:39.770
If you don't like it,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.024
they'll come pick it up
and they'll take it away,

00:08:42.024 --> 00:08:43.140
but I think you'll love it.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.380
I certainly love mine.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.330
Again, if you're interested,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.290
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.390
for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.210
So let's talk about how to apply quality,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.190
peer-reviewed science to your day

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.530
and how to optimize everything
from sleep to learning,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.623
creativity, meal timing, et cetera.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.680
As I mentioned earlier,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.050
I'm going to do this in
the context of my day

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.920
and what I typically do.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.230
However, the specific protocols

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.010
for any number of different things,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.313
sleep, relaxation, meal
timing, exercise, et cetera,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.590
any one or all of those
could be rearranged

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.950
to suit your specific needs.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.130
I'm going to tell you what I
do from morning until waking

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.420
and even what I do while I sleep in order

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.310
to optimize my sleep.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.550
So let's start with
getting up in the morning.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.700
Now, for me, I tend to wake
up sometime around 6:00 AM,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.240
6:30, sometimes as late as 7:00 AM.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.530
I don't typically sleep
much later than 7:00 AM.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.090
The first thing I do after
I wake up is I take the pen

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.270
that's on my nightstand

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.170
and the pad of paper on my nightstand

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.260
and I write down the
time in which I woke up.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.740
Now, I do sleep with my phone in my room.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.910
I realized this is considered a sin

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.930
and has certain hazards
associated with it,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.680
but I put my phone on airplane mode

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.070
about an hour before I go to sleep.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.400
And then I set my alarm
typically for 6:30 AM.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.340
And some days the alarm wakes me up;

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.760
other days I wake up before the alarm.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.560
And yes, some days the alarm goes off

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.150
and I hit snooze a few times,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.990
and then usually by 7:00
AM, I am up and out of bed.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.340
The reason for writing
down what time I wake up is

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.283
because I want to know
that average wake up time.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.950
That average wake up time informs

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.900
what's called my "temperature minimum."

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.920
It tells me when my body
temperature was lowest.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.510
The temperature minimum is the time

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:40.340
in each 24-hour cycle that your
body temperature is lowest.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.320
I don't sleep with a thermometer
in my mouth or elsewhere,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.310
and I don't think you should either.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.158
Instead, I know that
the lowest temperature

00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:53.158
that my body will be at
across the 24-hour cycle tends

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.120
to be two hours before
my typical wake up time.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.870
And I want to know that number.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.250
It's called our "temperature minimum."

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.630
So if you're somebody that
typically wakes up at 8:00 AM,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.310
then your temperature minimum
is sometime around 6:00 AM.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.070
Remember, the temperature
minimum is a time

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.740
in the 24-hour cycle.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.680
I don't care what my
actual temperature is;

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.240
I care when my lowest temperature is.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.960
And I know that that lowest temperature

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.053
is approximately two hours
before my average wake-up time.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.900
So I highly recommend that you write down

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.550
when you wake up or track that in some way

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.130
that works for you and use
that as a reference point

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.480
to determine your temperature minimum.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.820
We will return to the temperature minimum

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.270
and how you can leverage
the temperature minimum

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.750
for several things:

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.892
shifting your clock,

00:11:44.892 --> 00:11:48.090
shifting your circadian sleep
schedule and wake schedule.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.170
Also for shifting your
eating schedule, et cetera,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.440
We will return to that.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.005
But even if you don't travel,

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.940
even if you don't care
about things like jet lag,

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.880
even if you sleep
fabulously all year round,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.570
never have a poor night's sleep,

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.000
knowing your temperature minimum,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.360
that time when your temperature
is at its lowest point,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.030
is a valuable thing to know.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.330
The second thing I do after I wake up is

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.560
to get into forward ambulation,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.620
which is just nerd
speak for taking a walk.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.450
I have a dog, and as many of you know,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.460
he's a bulldog and he
doesn't really like to walk,

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.130
especially not in the morning.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.440
But for humans and for animals,

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.230
there's a phenomenon whereby

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.110
when we generate our own forward motion,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.423
forward ambulation,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.400
visual images pass by us on our eyes,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.430
so-called "optic flow."

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.800
And for those of you that
are low vision or no vision,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.320
the same phenomenon occurs
in the auditory system.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.357
Sounds pass by us in
so-called "auditory flow."

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.290
Getting into a mode of forward ambulation,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.250
and especially experiencing visual flow,

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.920
has a powerful effect
on the nervous system.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.415
The effect it has is essentially

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:07.310
to quiet or reduce the
amount of neural activity

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.240
in this brain structure
called the "amygdala."

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.690
Amygdala means "almond,"

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.480
and many of you have probably
heard about the amygdala

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.680
for its role in anxiety and
fear and threat detection.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.220
And indeed, the amygdala
is part of the network

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.850
in the brain that
generates feelings of fear

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.010
and threat and anxiety.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.280
It does a bunch of other things too,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.400
but that's one of its primary functions.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.950
There are now at least half a
dozen quality papers published

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.360
in quality, peer-reviewed
journals that show

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.270
that forward ambulation,
walking or biking or running,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.130
in generating optic flow in particular

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.220
has this incredible property
of lowering activity

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.760
in the amygdala and thereby
reducing levels of anxiety.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.960
There are two papers that I'd like

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.530
to highlight in particular
that relate to this phenomenon.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.650
The first one was published
in the journal Neuron

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.610
and the title of this paper

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.790
is "Whole-Brain Functional
Ultrasound Imaging,"

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.410
that just means they have a cool technique

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.700
to evaluate the activity
of structures in the brain

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.260
across the entire brain,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.363
reveals brain modules for
visual motor integration.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.020
What they found in this study,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.740
and I should mention the
first author is Mace,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.340
this comes from Botond Roska's group,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.220
this was work done in mice,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.440
but I'll talk about other
species in a moment.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.560
What they found was essentially that

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.060
when these mice walk forward

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.680
and their eyes move from side to side,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.910
which is a natural
consequence of moving forward,

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.930
so-called "optic flow" is
flowing past their eyes,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.850
many brain areas are activated,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.690
increase in their level of firing,

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.803
but the amygdala in particular
reduced its levels of firing.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.250
That's a very interesting
finding, but it is in mice.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.447
However, another paper,

00:14:44.447 --> 00:14:46.730
"Eye-Movement Intervention
Enhances Extinction

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.110
via Amygdala Deactivation,"

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.850
was published in The
Journal of Neuroscience,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.290
a strong journal, and shows that, again,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.370
these eye movements, these
lateral eye movements

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.830
from side to side reduce activity levels

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.390
in this fear/threat/anxiety center

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.740
in the brain, the amygdala.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.750
Now, those are eye movements.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.680
They didn't specifically
look at forward ambulation.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.010
And yet other papers have
looked at forward ambulation

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.880
and we know that forward
ambulation, walking forward,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.040
generates the sorts of eye movements

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.040
that cause optic flow and
reductions in amygdala activation.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.653
So for me, this process of taking

00:15:25.653 --> 00:15:28.610
a walk each morning isn't about exercise.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.090
It's not about burning calories.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.580
It's not about any of that.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.480
It's really about getting into optic flow

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.150
and reducing the levels
of amygdala activation.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.950
Now, I don't have anxiety,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.630
at least I don't have chronic anxiety

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.150
or generalized anxiety.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.610
I tend to have a lot of energy,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.270
but at these points in the morning,

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.630
I'm not very energetic.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.440
Sometimes I'm sort of shuffling more

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.500
than I'm walking in fact.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.977
And Costello is almost always shuffling

00:15:52.977 --> 00:15:55.380
and I'm almost always trying
to drag him first thing

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.560
in the morning.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.080
But that walk is a particularly
important protocol each day

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.750
because it really serves
to push my neurology

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.380
in the direction that I'd like it to go,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.320
which is alert, but not anxious.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.880
And it's kind of a fine line sometimes,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.400
especially as events
surface throughout the day,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.730
emails come in, text messages come in,

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.300
get bombarded with a number of things.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.930
I want to be alert and responsive.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.050
I want to be able to focus,

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.720
but I don't want to. feel anxious

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.670
or reactive to these things.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.850
So the forward ambulation and
this optic flow is the way

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.320
that I ensure, based on
quality, peer-reviewed data,

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.480
that my amygdala activation
is slightly suppressed.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.570
Now, at the same time, I
also want the alertness.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.200
I want alert and focused.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.050
I don't just want to be sleepy
or super, super relaxed.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.660
I want to have a high degree
of focus and alertness

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.140
because I'm soon going to
move into a about of work.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.030
I need to lean into the day.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.503
So in order to do that,

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.010
I make sure that the
walking is done outdoors.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.490
That might be sort of a duh,

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.480
but many people get up and
start moving around their house,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.370
their apartment, and
they don't go anywhere.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.680
And just walking around inside,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.360
it will generate some optic flow,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.120
but nothing like the sort of optic flow

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.700
that you can generate
in larger environments

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.260
like out of doors environments.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.370
If you can't get outdoors,

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.750
doing it indoors is perfectly fine,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.170
but it's not going to
have the same magnitude

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.890
of positive effect.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.630
Now, in order to get the alertness,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.870
I do it outdoors because I
also want sunlight in my eyes.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.940
I know many of you have heard
me talk about this ad nauseam

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.350
on various podcasts, in this podcast,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.050
but getting sunlight in
your eyes first thing

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.160
in the morning is absolutely vital

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.010
to mental and physical health.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.490
It is perhaps the most
important thing that any

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.830
and all of us can and should do in order

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.520
to promote metabolic well-being,

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.530
promote the positive functioning
of your hormone system,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.880
get your mental health steering
in the right direction.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.170
There are a number of reasons for this,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.820
but before I get into those reasons,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.590
let me just emphasize
what the protocol is.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.240
The protocol is get outdoors,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.970
ideally with no sunglasses
if you can do that safely,

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.800
even if there's cloud cover.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.640
More photons, light information are coming

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.320
through that cloud cover
than would be coming

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.760
from a very bright indoor bulb.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.580
So getting outdoors is absolutely key.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.950
How long should you do this?

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.930
It's going to depend on the
brightness of the environment.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.540
It's going to depend on a
number of different factors.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.630
Two minutes would be a minimum,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.610
10 minutes would be even better,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.470
and if you can, 30 minutes
would be fantastic.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.680
Now, it's a very bright day or, you know,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.450
you live in a place where
there's bright sunlight,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.010
clear day on a snowfield,

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.250
you would only need
something like 60 seconds.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.400
But most people aren't living
in those sorts of conditions.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.320
So getting outside for a 10-minute walk

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.650
or a 15-minute walk will basically ensure

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.910
that you're getting adequate
stimulation of these neurons

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.750
in the eye that are
called the "melanopsin,"

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.710
intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.850
I know that's a mouthful.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.130
These are neurons that don't
care about shapes of objects

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.470
or the motion of objects.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.140
These are neurons that convey to the brain

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.560
that it's daytime and
it's time to be alert.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.640
And it sets in motion a huge
number of biological cascades

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.130
within every cell and organ of your body

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.370
from your liver to your gut,

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.700
to your heart, to your brain.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.800
It really sets things down the right path.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.030
Early in the day,

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.640
we experience a natural and healthy bump

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.390
in a hormone called "cortisol."

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.780
Cortisol comes from the amygdala.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.090
That cortisol, as I mentioned,

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.950
is healthy and normal
and promotes wakefulness.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.780
It actually promotes a
healthy immune system.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.230
So I know you've heard that stress

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.760
and cortisol disrupt the immune system,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.330
but not the short little pulse of cortisol

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.590
that you get each morning.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.400
It's very important that that pulse

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.183
of cortisol arrive early in the day.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.480
I want to emphasize this again.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.040
It's very important that that pulse

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.410
of cortisol arrive early in the day

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.470
And that pulse of cortisol
is going to happen

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.560
once every 24 hours no matter what.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.470
It's going to happen
and you get to time it.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.640
How do you time it?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.950
Primarily by when you view bright sunlight

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.310
or bright light of another kind,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.000
and we'll talk about that in a moment.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.330
So you want that cortisol pushed early.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.200
If you wake up before the sun comes out,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.110
it's fine to turn on artificial lights,

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.640
but then you would want to get outside

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.710
as soon as you can to get this, excuse me,

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.950
natural light stimulation of your eyes.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.750
And it does have to be to your eyes.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.523
Just to really drill down
into the details for a moment,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.120
you don't want to stare
directly at the sun

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.360
or any light that's so
bright that it feels painful.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.193
If you feel like you have

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:30.380
to close your eyes or blink, please do.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.610
You don't want to damage your retinas.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.920
The point here is to get
the sunlight indirectly.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.800
It's going to essentially
be scattered everywhere

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.100
through the cloud cover,

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.770
but you know from looking at
us at a flashlight directly

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.760
into that flashlight
versus looking at the beam

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.000
that flashlight generates on the ground

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.280
that if you're standing in the shade,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.960
you're going to. get less of that sunlight

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.600
than you are if you're
out in an open field.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.410
So this is why the time outside,

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.558
it's going to need to vary depending

00:20:57.558 --> 00:21:00.130
on your particular environment.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.010
But do your best to do this every day.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.240
If you miss a day, no big deal,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.430
but try not to miss more than one day.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.920
Otherwise your mental

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.160
and physical health will start to suffer.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.260
And doing this each day costs nothing.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.093
It's just time

00:21:13.093 --> 00:21:15.970
You can combine it with the
forward ambulation with the walk

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.870
and the optic flow that
I talked about before.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.860
And that's what I do each morning

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.660
to generate a sense of
alertness in my body

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.950
and brain to generate a
sense of calm, yet alert.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.130
And that's also what I do with
Costello, with my bulldog.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.963
People have asked me,

00:21:30.963 --> 00:21:33.500
do the same mechanisms apply to animals?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.260
Well, the reality is
many of these mechanisms

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.250
were actually discovered in animals,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.360
and then were tested in humans

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.760
and verified that they
also exist in humans.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.593
Not always.

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:44.740
Sometimes it was the reverse,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.490
where they were tested first in humans,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.150
and then brought to animals.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.880
But indeed, your dog, your horse,

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.380
you know, I don't know what
other animals are out there,

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.550
they need this.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.590
Now, if you have a hamster
or a nocturnal animal,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.020
the reason why they like to
run on their wheels at night is

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.400
because they're nocturnal.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.470
They don't like being in the light.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.940
Light actually causes
them to freeze, right?

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.310
Actually, if you are into
aquaria, you like fish,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.220
they always say, "Don't
overfeed your fish.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.053
You'll kill the fish."

00:22:12.053 --> 00:22:13.730
That's true, but guess
what the fastest way

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.820
to kill a fish is?

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.060
To keep the lights on 24 hours a day

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:21.310
They also need circadian
rhythms, these 24-hour rhythms.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.750
So we'll do an entire month at
some point about pet health,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.780
but meanwhile, get that morning sunlight.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.530
So now we have a first protocol,

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.480
which is to write down the
time of day that you wake up,

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.590
the second protocol is to
take a walk first thing

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.423
in the morning,

00:22:35.423 --> 00:22:38.440
and the third protocol is
woven in with that walk,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.360
at least for me, which is to
get that sunlight exposure.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.960
Now, if you can't get sunlight exposure,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.830
you absolutely can't,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.790
I don't necessarily recommend buying one

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.893
of these dawn alarm lights.

00:22:51.754 --> 00:22:53.190
And I'm sorry to say this,

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.230
but they're just vastly
overpriced relative

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.063
to what they are.

00:22:57.063 --> 00:22:58.750
They're basically a bright LED.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.031
I instead use, I have a pad
that's a 930-lux LightPad.

00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:05.170
I think it was designed for drawing.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.730
Those are available at
a fraction of the cost

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.410
that a morning light
simulator would provide,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.580
and yet it's really bright
enough, at least for me.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.670
I tend to put it on my desk
while I work each morning.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.950
So here's a principle
that you can leverage.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.580
If you want to be alert,
view bright lights

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.250
and make those lights above
you or in front of you.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.080
If you want to go to sleep soon

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.110
or you don't want to be
awake for whatever reason,

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.010
try and eliminate your exposure to light.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.000
And this, again, is not about
exposure of the skin to light;

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.870
this is about exposure of your eyes,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.230
of your neural retinas to light.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.350
For those of you that are
concerned about blue light,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.310
I want to that blue light
is precisely the wavelength

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.820
of light that is optimal for
stimulating these neurons

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.010
in your eye, which set your
circadian rhythms properly.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.070
So you don't want to shield yourself

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.610
from blue light early in the
day or throughout the day

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.810
or anytime you want to be awake.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.010
In fact, that could have a number

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.940
of detrimental consequences.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.590
Fortunately, all those
consequences are going

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.870
to be reversible after a short
period of time of making sure

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.280
that you don't wear your blue blockers

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.750
during the day, please.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.943
The time to wear blue blockers, if you do,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.680
is at night and in the evening

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.510
when you're headed towards sleep.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.330
My colleague Samer Hattar,

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.230
who is head of the chronobiology unit

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.420
at the National Institute
of Mental Health,

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.180
has spoken about this
before on my Instagram.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.767
We held an Instagram Live and I said,

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.920
"Samer, what do you think
about blue blockers?"

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.510
And he said, "I don't think
that's a good idea at all,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.010
unless it's really late at night

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.560
and you're in a bright environment

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.740
and you're trying to limit
the amount of bright light

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.107
that impacts the eyes."

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.700
Eliminating specific wavelengths of light,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.530
in Samer's opinion and also in my opinion,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.077
is not a natural thing
for the visual system

00:24:49.077 --> 00:24:50.880
and the brain to experience.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.150
Some people get headaches while they work

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.920
on the computer all day
or staring at screens,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.370
and so they get blue blockers
thinking that's going

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.340
to protect them from their headaches.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.570
However, any protection
that you get from headaches

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.990
from blue blockers is going to be minimal

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.480
in comparison to what's
really going on there,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.330
which is that people are viewing devices

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.000
and screens up close for too many hours

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.743
throughout the 24-hour cycle.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.640
A better remedy would be to step away

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.770
from that computer from time to time,

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.580
and to make sure that you can look far off

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.413
into the distance.

00:25:22.413 --> 00:25:24.550
Ideally, a distance longer than 20 feet

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.580
like view a horizon, go out on a balcony,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.413
things of that sort.

00:25:27.413 --> 00:25:29.460
Take a walk around, get into optic flow

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.260
So if you're into blue blockers,

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.690
make sure you're only wearing
them in the late evening

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.560
and at night.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.410
I personally don't wear
blue blockers at all.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.980
I prefer to just control
my light viewing behavior

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.360
by doing this, I do the other
form of circadian control,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.250
which is to dim the lights.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.850
And I do that because dimming the lights

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.260
and setting them lower in the
environment sets up the brain

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.700
and body for sleep much better

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.790
than simply just wearing some
blue light blue blockers,

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.623
excuse me.

00:25:56.623 --> 00:25:59.150
And please know if you
do wear blue blockers

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.920
that if the light in your
environment is bright enough,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.230
it doesn't matter if you're
blocking out the blues.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.900
The cells in the eye will respond

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.910
to other wavelengths of light.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.890
So I have no vendetta
against the blue blockers,

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.110
and, you know, I fully
expect the blue block-anistas

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.700
to come after me with,
I guess, blue blockers,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.950
but as you do that,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.400
please understand that the biology points

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.210
in the direction of get
a lot of bright light

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.710
throughout the day, including blue light,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.620
and at night, just limit the
total amount of overall light

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.800
that you're exposed to,
including from screens.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.100
So then Costello and I
get back from our walk.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.540
Sometimes that walk was 10 minutes,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.140
sometimes it was 60 minutes,

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.080
depending on how slowly
Costello is walking that day.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.330
Indeed, many mornings I'm
the guy carrying his bulldog

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.640
back up the hill.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.860
My neighbors know me so well,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.050
they know Costello so well

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.270
that they've since stopped pulling over

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.140
and asking if the dog is okay.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.840
Sometimes they'll ask if I'm okay.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:53.460
Nonetheless, we get back,
I give him his food,

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.033
I give him his water,
and I give me my water.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.640
I'm a big believer, based on
quality, peer-reviewed data,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.270
that hydration is essential
for mental performance.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.380
Now, I confess I don't really
like drinking big glasses

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.180
or big jugs of water first
thing in the morning.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.013
I don't know why,

00:27:11.013 --> 00:27:13.200
but my thirst doesn't tend
to kick in first thing.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.250
You may be different.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.170
Either way, I force myself, essentially,

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:23.170
to drink at least 16 and,
most days, 32 ounces of water.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.890
I also put a little bit
of sea salt in the water.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.640
As many of you know,
neurons require ionic flow.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.260
What that means is neurons need sodium,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.100
they need magnesium,
and they need potassium

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.840
in order to function.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.020
We do tend to get dehydrated at night.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.840
Even if the day is not very hot,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.040
I try and top off or I try and make sure

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.560
that I'm hydrated early in the
day before I begin any work.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.490
So I make myself drink this water

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.670
with a little bit of sea salt.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.503
How much sea salt?

00:27:52.503 --> 00:27:53.930
If you really want to get detailed,

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.700
I suppose it's about half a teaspoon.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.470
It's not much, That's what I do.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.170
And I drink that more or
less room temperature.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.080
I find that drinking really
cold water first thing

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.410
in the day kind of like
cramps up my insides,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.443
so I don't do that.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.350
At that point, I start thinking about

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.870
and fantasizing about
and craving caffeine,

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.350
but I don't drink that caffeine yet.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.640
I purposely delay my caffeine intake

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.410
to 90 minutes to 120
minutes after I wake up.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.340
Of course, I know when I wake
up 'cause I wrote it down,

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.400
although it's pretty
easy to commit to memory.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.170
The reason I delay caffeine is

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.290
because one of the factors

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.380
that induces a sense of
sleepiness is the buildup

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.967
of adenosine or, as some people call it,

00:28:36.967 --> 00:28:39.690
adenosine in our system.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.830
The buildup of adenosine accumulates

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.700
the longer we are awake.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.250
So when I wake up in the morning,

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.580
when you wake up in the morning,

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.480
your adenosine levels are
likely to be very low.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.880
However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.090
It's actually a competitive
antagonist for you aficionados.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.570
It sort of parks in the receptor

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.140
that adenosine normally would park at

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.380
and prevents adenosine from
acting on that receptor.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.620
That's why you feel more alert,

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.430
because it's essentially
blocking the effect

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.190
of this sleepiness factor

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.290
that we all create called the "adenosine."

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.660
The reason for delaying
caffeine intake 90 minutes

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.330
to two hours after waking
is I want to make sure

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.700
that I don't have a late afternoon

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.950
or even early afternoon
crash from caffeine.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.660
One of the best ways to
ensure a caffeine crash is

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.390
to drink a bunch of caffeine,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.200
block all those adenosine receptors,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.830
and then by early or late afternoon,

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.760
when that caffeine starts to wear off

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.630
and gets dislodged from the receptors,

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.820
a lower level of adenosine is able

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.010
to create a greater level of sleepiness.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.620
It took me years to figure this out.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.683
I used to wake up and I'd think,

00:29:49.683 --> 00:29:51.980
"Oh, I don't want to drink
caffeine too close to bedtime,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.100
so I'm going to start drinking
my caffeine really early."

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.290
I let my cortisol naturally
come up in the morning.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.750
I avoid drinking caffeine
until about 90 minutes

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.850
or two hours after waking.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:03.810
And when I do that,

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.750
I find that I don't experience
the afternoon crash.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.630
At least I don't experience that crash

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.070
unless I do something foolish,

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.180
like ingest far too much food at lunch

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.690
or I stay up all night the night before.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.010
But provided I don't do
anything foolish like that,

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.480
delaying caffeine to 90 minutes

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.120
to two hours optimizes this relationship

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.970
between adenosine and
wakefulness and sleepiness

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.170
in a way that really provides a nice,

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.200
consistent arc of energy
throughout the day

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.240
and brings energy down as
I'm headed toward sleep

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.820
and falling asleep.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.160
My primary objective early in the day is

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.150
to get into a mode of being focused,

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.313
yet alert so that I can get work done.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.160
I found that the best way for me

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.900
to achieve that state is through fasting.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.520
So I don't eat anything until
about 11:00 AM or 12:00 noon.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.480
I'm not absolutely religious about it.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.470
There are days when I'll
have a few Brazil nuts

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.390
or a spoonful or three of almond butter,

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.430
for instance, but most
days I'm not doing that.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.340
I'm just not eating anything.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.130
I'm drinking some caffeine caffeine source

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.590
for me is yerba mate, guayusa tea.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.040
Those are my preferred sources

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.740
I tend to avoid coffee these days.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.730
Occasionally I'll have a cup,

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.780
but most often I stick to the teas.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.774
I drink water as much as I
feel I need to and want to.

00:31:18.774 --> 00:31:21.590
And I also drink my athletic greens,

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.083
which is compatible at
least for me with fasting.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.750
Let's talk about why fasting works

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.150
to create this heightened
state of alertness,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.623
yet calm brain state.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.780
Fasting increases levels of adrenaline,

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.260
also called "epinephrin"
in the brain and body.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.030
And when our levels of epinephrin

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.000
and adrenaline are
increased, we learn better,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.010
we can focus better.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.470
There's terrific data supporting that.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.270
You don't want epinephrine,
aka adrenaline, too high.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.270
That feels like stress and panic.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.350
You get jittery, you can't focus.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.490
But in its optimal range,

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.890
adrenaline really provides
a heightened sense of focus

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.830
and the ability to
encode, meaning bring in,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.280
and retain, remember information.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.000
And so since my job is
mainly a cerebral one

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.470
where I'm writing grants and
working on papers, et cetera,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.960
I fast in the early part of the day.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.860
I mentioned ingesting things
like guayusa or yerba mate

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.560
or, in my case, athletic greens.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.160
Many people ask, in fact
there's a whole community

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.650
and discussion boards, et cetera,

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.460
and YouTube comments on the internet,

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.470
about what breaks a fast and what doesn't.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.110
The fact of the matter is that's going

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.460
to be highly individual because it's going

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.600
to depend on how sensitive
your blood sugar.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.790
And more accurately,

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.850
it's going to depend on things

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.800
like your insulin sensitivity.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.470
So for instance,

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.590
if you're somebody who
gets up in the morning,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.940
hydrates, and goes out for a six-mile run,

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.750
you could probably eat
a jar of almond butter

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.719
and still be what's called fat-fasted.

00:32:54.719 --> 00:32:56.950
Your insulin levels will still be very low

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.700
because even though that is a
large volume of almond butter,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.330
even to me and Costello,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.680
that large number of calories comes

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.550
from a source that doesn't
increase blood sugar very much

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.560
and insulin very much.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.490
Now, I'm not suggesting you do that,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.290
but what I just described as
a vastly different situation

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.110
than somebody that ate
their last meal at 2:00 AM,

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.620
and that meal was essentially a feast.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.313
And for that person,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.090
fasting until 10:00 or 11:00 AM,

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.830
their blood sugar might
still actually be pretty high

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.730
or even lowish such that
they might eat one almond

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.720
and it would bump them out of fasting.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.553
So you get the idea.

00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:36.570
It's going to depend on
your recent eating history,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.320
your blood sugar history, your
glycogen stores, et cetera.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.960
So if anyone tells you that
breaks a fast or that doesn't,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.793
that's kind of silly.

00:33:44.793 --> 00:33:47.530
Would one grain of sugar
break your fast? No.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.430
Would an entire tablespoon of
sugar break your fast? Yes.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.580
You'll get a big blip in blood
sugar and insulin from that.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.200
However, how long that lasts,

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.080
how long it breaks your fast will depend

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.120
on how glycogen-depleted you are

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.820
and a number of other factors.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.230
So for me, I just keep it fairly simple:

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:07.160
I ingest water, caffeine from
your yerba mate and guayusa,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.700
and I drink my athletic greens
with some lemon juice in it.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.990
That constitutes my fasting.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:15.050
And there are days when
I do all those things.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.150
There are days when I
do none of those things.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.110
Although most days,

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.880
I would say about 355
days out of the year,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.150
I'm ingesting water, caffeine,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.520
and athletic greens during this period

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.760
of fasting early in the day,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.470
and that's the period of
time when I do my work.

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.727
One interesting fact about yerba mate

00:34:31.727 --> 00:34:34.770
and guayusa teas is that
they increase release

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.890
of something called "GLP-1."

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:40.020
GLP-1 is related to glucagon.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.620
Glucagon is a hormone
that you can sort of think

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.250
about as opposite to
insulin and blood sugar.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.400
It's more complex than that,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.270
but GLP-1 has a couple
of positive properties.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.907
One is it increases lipolysis

00:34:51.907 --> 00:34:54.300
and mobilization of body fat stores,

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.830
so burning of fat.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.280
In fact, there are now a
number of clinical trials

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.860
that are achieving good success

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.750
and there are drugs out
there only available

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.650
by prescription which mimic GLP-1

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:07.323
and are being used to
treat, quite successfully,

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.760
certain types of diabetes and obesity.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.720
Now, I'm not diabetic,

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.970
nor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.850
but I figure as long as I'm fasting

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.190
and as long as I like
yerba mate and guayusa,

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.800
which I do, they're delicious,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.340
I'll tell you which
type I use in a moment,

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.330
I might as well increase my GLP-1

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.510
because it's probably not
as good as getting out

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.780
and doing some cardio work.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.680
But nonetheless, if I'm fasted,

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.600
increasing GLP-1 in my system,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.870
I'm going to be alert from
the caffeine, the adrenaline,

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.990
et cetera, and I'm going
to burning body fat

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.960
while I'm doing my work.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.360
So for me, it's just an
efficient, biochemically rational,

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.840
or I should say grounded

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.150
in quality biochemistry sort of approach.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.480
Yerba mate comes in a
lot of different forms.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.170
There are a lot of different
brands out there, et cetera.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.890
I don't have any relationship whatsoever

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.420
in a business sense to
any of these brands.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.780
Some of them are very smoky.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.810
I, just because of something
in my genetic makeup,

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.360
or I don't know, maybe it was some sort

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.510
of Y chromosome-associated
lesion early in life,

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.070
but I don't like smoky flavors.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.240
So I'm not a Gouda cheese guy.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.450
I don't like smoky stuff.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.570
You may love it,

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.313
but I tend to avoid smoky-tasting mates.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.840
Instead, there's a particular
brand that I just found

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.490
on the internet called Anna Park.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.370
I don't know Anna, I don't
know if she has a park,

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.130
and I certainly don't
know what Anna Park is,

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.270
but for me, that's the
best-tasting yerba mate.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.370
Again, I don't have any
relationship to them,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.960
but it's affordable in
the context of yerba mate

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.590
and it's the one that I use.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.740
And I should mention along
the lines of affordability

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.840
and GLP-1 is there's a
nice feature of yerba mate

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.450
which is if you put it in a filter

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.720
or a metal strainer and
you pour hot water over it,

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.240
and then drink it, keep the leaves.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.300
The yerba mate leaves can
be used over and over again.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.230
It seems that the GLP-1
stimulating aspects of yerba mate

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:02.680
actually are enhanced with
subsequent pour overs.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.700
So there's something
interesting about these teas

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.650
that my tea aficionado
friends tell me allows the tea

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.940
to release more of some of
the beneficial compounds

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.660
by reusing the tea leaves.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.930
Now, eventually it'll grow mold

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.100
and other sorts of disgusting things.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.500
You don't really want
to run that experiment.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.450
I would say you can
use it for a day or two

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.740
before it starts to go bad,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.570
but that's a feature
that will extend the life

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.080
of whatever yerba mate you happen to use

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:27.960
if you decide to use it,

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.870
and that's certainly what I do.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.550
Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.800
while I'm drinking all this yerba mate.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.380
'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.140
about all the GLP-1
circulating in my system.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.620
I'm working.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.960
A couple of things for
optimizing workspace

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.490
that are grounded in
neuroscience and physiology.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.860
I've talked before about the fact that

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.960
when our eyes are directed upward,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.770
literally when our eyelids are open,

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.780
no surprise there, and when
our eyes are directed upward,

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.760
it creates a state of
heightened alertness.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.970
And this has a relationship
to the brainstem neurons

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:05.380
that create alertness and their control

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.940
over the muscles of the eye and,

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.940
believe it or not, the eyelids.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.030
Now, it's not the case that if
you are absolutely exhausted

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.590
and you need to feel more alert

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.070
that looking upward is going
to make you feel wide awake,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.963
although it will help support
your levels of alertness.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.960
The point here is that you
can optimize your workstation

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.450
in a physical way that
leverages this aspect

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.770
of the visual system and
your level of alertness.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.370
Since most of us want to be
awake while we're working,

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.560
try and position your
screen or your tablet,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.980
whatever device you
happen to be working on,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.090
at least at eye level and
ideally slightly higher.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.150
Now, if you think about it,
most people are not doing this.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.780
Most people are looking down
at their computer or tablet

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.660
or are angling their eyes at their screen

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.253
at about 30 degrees.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.960
That is not going to support
heightened states of alertness

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.530
and optimal attention.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.910
In fact, the opposite relationship

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.610
between eye position and
alertness is also true.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.130
When we look down, when our
eyelids are slightly closed,

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.200
it tends to decrease
our levels of alertness

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.183
and increase our levels of sleepiness.

00:39:11.183 --> 00:39:12.640
I really want to emphasize this,

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.344
that there's a bi-directional
or reciprocal relationship

00:39:15.344 --> 00:39:17.860
between the brainstem areas

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.840
that control alertness and the eyes,

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.320
meaning how alert you are controls

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.100
how open or closed your
eyes are, no surprise there,

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.580
but also the how open and
upward directed your eyes are

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.820
will increase your levels of alertness

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.360
And if your eyes are pointed downward

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.300
and your eyelids are hooded,

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.830
like they're slowly closing,

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.500
like Costello's are always are,

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.430
you'll feel more sleepy,

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.730
especially if you're somebody

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.140
who tends to have that
mid-morning sleepiness

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.800
or mid-morning crash.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.870
So what I do is I have a standing desk,

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.130
but I also prop the computer up

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.790
such that it's at least at eye level.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.260
And I haven't figured out yet

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.220
how to develop a workstation
where the computer is above me.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.480
I think the only way to really do

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.940
that is actually to tilt one's body back,

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.363
but actually that's
not a good idea either.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.780
They have done studies
recording from areas

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.260
of the brain associated with alertness.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.760
Areas like locus coeruleus

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.513
in the so-called reticular
activating system.

00:40:12.513 --> 00:40:14.300
What they found is that depending

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.300
on how reclined you
are or upright you are,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.590
you will decrease with reclining

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.820
and increase with sitting
forward your levels of alertness.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.960
So body posture and
whether or not your upright

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.830
or reclining will impact
your levels of alertness

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.860
in the predictable ways.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.690
And where you position your eyes,

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.110
whether or not your eyes
are upright, so to speak,

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.290
looking up or directly
forward or looking down,

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:43.950
will dictate whether or not
you are feeling more alert

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.030
or more sleepy, respectively.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.070
So try and arrange a workstation

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.860
or a position of your body in your chair

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.690
or your standing desk, whatever it is,

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.100
that allows you to work

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.400
with a heightened state of alertness.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.720
This is really, really key for me

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.490
because I found that
when I would sit down,

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.150
not only would my hip
flexors start to get sore,

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.110
I feel tight in the back, et cetera,

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.670
but if I was staring
down at my screen all day

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.140
or even for short periods of the day,

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.460
I would start to feel sleepy

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.730
and I couldn't figure
out what was going on.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.130
I also thought maybe I needed glasses.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:15.210
I do wear readers at night,

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.320
but it was really a problem.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.660
And simply by getting the screen directly

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.290
in front of me at eye level,

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.270
it's been completely transformative.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.460
So we're now at the description of my day

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.330
in these protocols in which I would do

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.990
a 90-minute about of work.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.170
Now, why 90 minutes?

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.940
Well, the brain is going

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.530
through these 90 minutes
so-called "ultradian cycles"

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.250
throughout the entire day and night.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:42.390
Every 90 minutes, we shift
over from being very alert

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.150
to being less alert, and
then back to alert again.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.680
Here's how it works.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.370
At the start of one of these
90 minute ultradian cycles,

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.350
my brain is not quite engaged

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.930
in whatever it is I'm trying to do.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.940
Oftentimes I have things
jumping into my mind,

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.880
I've got distractions, et cetera.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.510
I'll talk about how to deal
with those distractions

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.790
in a moment.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.300
But I set a timer for 90 minutes

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.040
and I try and get a strong
about of work done inside

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.990
of that 90 minutes with
the full understanding

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.940
that the entire 90 minutes is not going

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.480
to be uniform in terms
of my ability to focus.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.310
There will be kind of peaks
and valleys within that,

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:22.070
but that 90 minutes is about
what the brain can handle

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:26.340
in terms of a dedicated effort
for high degree of focus.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.200
Some people can push out
a little bit further,

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.320
some people can't handle
more than 10 minutes,

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.870
but that's what I'm striving toward.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.990
You'd be amazed how much you
can get done in 90 minutes

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.823
if you are focused.

00:42:35.823 --> 00:42:37.270
So how do you increase that focus

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.090
and how do you use the timer feature?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.610
Well, you can combine those.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.310
I use a program called Freedom.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.130
It shuts me out of the
internet completely.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.750
So that means no checking the markets,

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.340
no checking social media, no checking,

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.350
you know, the news, no
checking email, none of that.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.103
I get a dedicated about of work done.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.330
I confess, I don't allow
myself to go to the restroom

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.230
in that period of time.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.510
Here's an interesting little tip

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.950
that's grounded in physiology.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:11.720
You have a direct neural
connection from your bladder

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.330
to your brainstem areas
that increase alertness.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.980
This is why when you have
to go to the bathroom,

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.690
when you have to urinate, it
is extremely agitating, right?

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:23.940
It can be very, very agitating.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.140
I'm not encouraging you to get

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.740
so agitated by filling
your bladder so much

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.080
and resisting going to the bathroom

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.400
that you are uncomfortable
and can't focus,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.420
but I generally will just drink liquids

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.560
and work away and work away,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.610
and I won't walk away
to go use the bathroom

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.770
unless I absolutely have to.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.000
Sort of odd that we're talking about this,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
but this is one way in which I've learned

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.430
to funnel my attention into
whatever it is I'm doing.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.263
Because as you all know,

00:43:48.263 --> 00:43:50.040
the moment you sit down
to do some serious work

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.450
and you flip off the internet,

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.720
all of a sudden it's as
if the phone has a voice,

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.553
it starts calling you..

00:43:54.553 --> 00:43:57.020
It's almost as if the
restroom has a voice.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.950
But we all are familiar with the fact

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.970
that if we are focused on something

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.840
that all that just kind of melts away.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.980
So the goal is to get into
what I call the tunnel,

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.650
to really get into a
tunnel of quality work.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.660
The brain loves that state,

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.480
but it's very hard for
many of us to access.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.770
My phone is absolutely off.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.930
It's not on airplane mode.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.660
It's absolutely off during this time.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.770
If I've been struggling with that and,

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.990
I confess, you know, there are times when,

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.080
for whatever reason,
something going on in life,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.120
it's been harder to put away the phone.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.920
I will sometimes put it in my car.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.330
I used to joke that I used
to throw it up on the roof

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.410
or something like that.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:35.270
Look, I've done and I suggest
people do whatever they need

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:38.340
to in order to
self-regulate that activity.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.860
And if you're somebody that
feels that you absolutely need

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.870
to be on your phone and on the
computer for this work about

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:45.130
or the work that you do,

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.470
well, that's a different
matter altogether.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.040
This is just simply how I work.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.280
So I will do 90 minutes
and I do set a timer

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.410
and I turn on the program,

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.670
Freedom locks me out of the internet.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.723
If someone rings the doorbell,

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.757
I will often shout,

00:44:58.757 --> 00:45:00.470
"Not coming to the
doorbell. Leave it there."

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.750
I mean, unless there's a real emergency,

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.850
I'm not going to step away from that work.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.320
I learned how to do this
when I was a graduate student

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.640
under different conditions
where I used to slice brains

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.177
on what's called a microtome.

00:45:11.177 --> 00:45:12.010
So I used to spend time,

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.430
just cutting very thin slices,

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.540
it's like a deli slicer, but for a brain,

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.240
of various types of brains.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.010
And I've sectioned
through a lot of brains.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.080
And we had a rule,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.470
which is that when the
blade hits the brain,

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.930
you don't stop pulling, even
though it's very, very slow

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.440
even if a nuclear bomb goes off,

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.810
even if a fire alarm goes off.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.910
Now, I don't want anyone,
you know, burning to a crisp

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.520
because they didn't step
away from their workflow.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.353
That would be foolish,

00:45:39.353 --> 00:45:41.970
but that's the mentality
that I've embedded in myself,

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.680
that there's nothing more important

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.970
than what I'm doing in
that 90-minute block.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:47.880
And that's what works for me.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.450
You can try various other things.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.080
That's what works for me.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.920
In addition, I use low level white noise.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.670
This is something that is supported

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.880
by quality, peer-reviewed data.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.370
We covered this on the episode
on hearing and balance,

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.610
but it turns out that white noise,

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.143
which is essentially all
frequencies of sound,

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.600
or all frequencies of
sound that we can perceive,

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.860
mixed up kind of randomly,

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.250
there's no structure to it,

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.170
turned on at a low volume,

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.510
not with headphones most of the time,

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.170
puts the brain into a state that's optimal

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:22.740
for learning and workflow.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.900
And I covered two papers
during that episode.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.603
One that showed that, indeed,

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.470
brain areas involved in attention,

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.360
brain areas involved in focus
and cognition and memory,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.790
those are engaged to a greater degree

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.700
when there is low levels
of white noise playing

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.730
in the background.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.470
The other paper that's really
interesting did brain imaging

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.780
and showed the areas of the
brain that are associated

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.480
with dopamine release are increased

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.640
by low levels of white noise.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.680
Dopamine release is associated
not just with pleasure,

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.960
but with motivation and craving.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.830
So everything about this 90-minute block

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.250
from the low levels of white noise

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.030
to the position of my computer,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:02.960
how I'm standing, where
my eyes are positioned,

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.810
is geared towards putting
me in this tunnel of work.

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.790
And I have to say that
while it can be a challenge

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.320
to try and achieve this state

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.880
in this tunnel of work some days,

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.520
you start to get kind of addicted to it.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.940
It feels really good.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.400
It's like a workout for the mind.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.960
And it is something that as
you exit that 90 minutes,

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.110
you really feel like
you've accomplished a lot

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:23.810
because often you have,

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.060
and it just feels deeply satisfying.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:26.990
And I'm convinced that that's

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.010
because of the release of
neuromodulators like dopamine

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.770
and the norepinephrine that's
circulating in your system.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.930
And I want to be clear
that I'm not perfect

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:36.850
about this 90 minutes.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.530
Occasionally I get drawn away.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.900
Occasionally something will happen

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.220
or I'll go use the restroom
or Costello will have a need

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:46.210
or somebody will have a need

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.260
that I will have to respond to,

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.560
but I really try and achieve
this most, if not every day

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.610
that I'm alive because for me,

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.610
that work session is kind of holy.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.710
It's where I set up a relationship,

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:00.430
not just between me and
the work that I'm doing,

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.750
but between me and my ability

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:06.910
to control my own state of mind
using these various supports

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.160
of the white noise, et cetera.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.810
But really those supports are peripheral

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.620
to the fact that I'm creating this space.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.610
I'm funneling my brain into a state

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.640
rather than allowing
whatever events and contexts

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.050
on social media and
elsewhere might be occurring

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.310
in the world that would
yank me out of what

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.560
for me is my purpose
and my mission in life,

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.450
which is to do the
sorts of work that I do.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.130
There's a powerful way in
which you can place the timing

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.423
of this 90-minute work
about in an optimal way.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.290
You have access to a very
important piece of data

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:43.620
that dictates when this about
should start more or less

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.770
and when it should end.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.710
That piece of data is
your temperature minimum.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:51.860
If you're somebody who wakes
up on average at 7:00 AM,

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.730
well, then your temperature
minimum is 5:00 AM.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.440
And you can be reasonably sure,

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.490
I want to underscore reasonably,

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.430
but you can be reasonably sure

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.280
that your best work is
going to be done anywhere

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.350
from four to six hours after
your temperature minimum.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.980
So for me, I tend to
wake up around 6:30 AM,

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.000
that means my temperature
minimum is at 4:30 AM.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.100
You can add five hours to that.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.280
So that means that a 90
minute work about could fall

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.460
at 9:30 AM and it would
be fairly optimized.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.750
Or I could do it at 10:30 AM,
or I could do it at 8:30 AM.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.470
Somewhere in there, all right?

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:30.730
That we can't say that
it's exactly six hours

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:31.760
after your temperature minimum.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.260
You will find it, however.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.970
There is a precise and best time

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:38.690
for you to do this 90-minute work about.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.050
Whether or not it's five or six hours

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.380
after your temperature minimum is going

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.150
to vary from person to person.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.983
How do I know this?

00:49:44.983 --> 00:49:46.160
How do I know this relationship

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.950
between temperature minimum
and focus cognition?

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.373
Well, temperature minimum
defines the trough,

00:49:52.373 --> 00:49:54.366
the nadir, as they say,

00:49:54.366 --> 00:49:57.770
of your temperature
across the 24-hour cycle.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.550
And immediately after that,

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.950
your temperature will start to rise.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.620
That temperature rise is
actually what triggers

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.450
the initial cortisol
release that you experience

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:08.730
and wakes you up further.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.720
And then, of course, that
sunlight that you're getting

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.900
is going to further enhance

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.160
that healthy release of cortisol.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.430
That cortisol will then
provide fuel, if you will,

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.870
for that increase in temperature.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.450
And your body will continue
to increase in temperature

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.970
throughout the day toward the afternoon.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:27.250
What you're trying to do in this idea

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.780
of optimizing this 90-minute work about

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.010
to a particular time of day

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.730
is catch the portion of the steepest slope

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.340
of that temperature rise.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.890
Now, again, you're not walking
around with a thermocouple

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.950
or a thermometer in some
orifice of your body.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.670
So you don't have accurate
information about temperature,

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.570
but you can make very good guesses

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:52.020
about when your body
temperature is rising fastest

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:53.590
by virtue of that temperature minimum.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:54.970
So again, just to be clear,

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.580
it's a 90-minute work about.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.080
That's about what the brain can handle

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.813
for a very intense work about.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.160
Do you understand, again,

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.930
that they're going to be
portions of that 90 minute

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.860
that your brain is flickering
in and out of focus,

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.760
other portions, where you're
going to be entirely focused.

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.070
That's entirely normal.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.350
But when to place that
90-minute work about,

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.880
when to start it, and when
to end it will depend on

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.810
that temperature minimum.

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:19.330
So if you're somebody who wakes
up at 8:00 AM each morning,

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.220
your temperature minimum is 6:00 AM,

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.600
chances are you're going to

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.010
want to start this work about
somewhere around 10:00 AM

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.370
or 11:00 AM.

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.480
Now, some people wake up and
feel very alert first thing

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.313
in the morning.

00:51:32.313 --> 00:51:33.880
They can really do their
best work first thing

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.810
in the morning.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.530
Please, if that's you continue to do that.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.050
Leverage that time. Use that time.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.410
But if you're somebody who
struggles to find focus,

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:45.024
definitely let your physiology

00:51:45.024 --> 00:51:48.750
and this rise in your body
temperature support your efforts

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.790
to focus rather than
trying to do your best work

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.880
at times of day when your physiology

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.217
is actually directing your body

00:51:57.217 --> 00:51:59.020
and your brain toward de-focus

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.480
and towards being more lethargic.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.980
It just is setting yourself up for success

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.130
when you try and capture this rising phase

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:07.130
of your temperature.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:08.150
So up until now,

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:10.120
we've been emphasizing practices

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.520
that allow you to optimize
your level of alertness

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.563
and your levels of mental focus.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.300
Data going back to the
1990s supports the idea

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.150
that physical movement of particular kinds

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.293
can support brain health
and brain function both

00:52:25.293 --> 00:52:27.793
in the immediate term
and in the long term.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:30.650
Now, this is has had a profound impact

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.120
on the field of neuroscience, but frankly,

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.510
it's also had a profound impact on

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.180
how I structure my day.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.340
So after I've finished a about of work,

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.150
this 90-minute about of work,
I force myself some days,

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.983
other days I want to,

00:52:43.983 --> 00:52:47.270
but I force myself to do some
sort of physical exercise

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.830
that is going to be
supportive of my brain health

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.850
and brain function and organ health

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:53.940
and bodily function in general.

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.210
So I just briefly want to touch

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:58.670
on what the structure of
that exercise looks like,

00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:59.980
how it's structured within the day

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.363
and how it's structured
across the weeks in fact,

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.200
based on the scientific data

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.810
and what the scientific data say is best

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:12.260
or optimal in order to promote
longevity of the brain,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.557
ability to focus, as well
as cardiovascular health

00:53:14.557 --> 00:53:17.570
and all the other things that
we know exercise supports.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:20.010
Now, there are various
forms of physical activity

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.800
or what we call exercise,

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.260
but those can generally be
batched into two categories.

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.240
First is strength and hypertrophy work.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.500
So physical movements that are designed

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.683
to make you stronger and/or
make your muscles larger.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.220
There's also endurance work.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.620
Physical exercise and
movements that are designed

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.980
to allow you to do more work over time

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.000
or to extend the amount of
time that you can do work

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.370
of any kind, both physical and mental.

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:52.750
And we did two full podcast
episodes on the details

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.890
and the science and the protocols
related to these topics.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:59.470
We did an episode on
the science of strength

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:03.100
and hypertrophy, of building
strength and muscle building.

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.010
And that included a lot of protocols.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.440
And we did an episode on endurance.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.300
How to build any one or all of
the four types of endurance,

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.920
which are muscular endurance,
anaerobic, aerobic,

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.760
long-distance endurance, et cetera.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.190
So if you're interested in the
specifics of those protocols,

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:19.543
please see those episodes.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.970
However, right now I
just want to emphasize

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.150
how the data impact my day

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:27.840
and how I structure my day in a way

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.050
that I can incorporate physical movement

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:32.390
in a way that supports
my brain and health.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:35.650
Basically, after I finished
that cognitive work about,

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.340
that 90-minute work about,

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.150
I do some form of physical
exercise for about an hour.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.740
The data all point to the
fact that working out hard

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.700
for longer than an hour
can actually be detrimental

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.190
because of the way that
it raises cortisol.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.610
And cortisol can be a good thing

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.870
if it's appropriately timed

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:53.520
and in the appropriate low levels,

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.220
but you don't want to have
your cortisol levels up

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.000
throughout the day or have big spikes

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.120
of cortisol repeatedly.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.060
So keeping workouts relatively short

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.720
can definitely help with that

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.400
And certainly if you're training hard,

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.000
60 minutes or less should
be more than sufficient.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.400
And for many people, including myself,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.563
45 minutes or 50 minutes is
probably even more optimal.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.130
The basic design of this
physical exercise is

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.530
that it be approximately 60 minutes.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.620
So maybe 60 plus or minus
15 minutes should be well

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.560
within the margins of keeping
hormonal health proper

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.140
and not going too long
nor making the workout

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.600
so short that it's not beneficial.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.880
And essentially what the data tell us is

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.860
that in order to optimize cardiovascular

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.260
and brain health and
other systems of the body,

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.920
we want to exercise at
least five days per week.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.700
I know that seems like a lot.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.690
It certainly is a lot for certain people.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.730
Some of you, you compulsive exercisers,

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.930
might gasp at the idea
of taking two days off.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:52.890
I personally find that taking
two full days off per week

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.180
is actually both beneficial

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.750
to my exercise training performance,

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.680
as well as pleasant.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.933
I like those rest days.

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.100
But essentially the structure
of the exercise regimen

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.880
that works for sake of
supporting health is going

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.690
to be one in which there's a 3:2 ratio.

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:14.580
Where for a 12-week period
or so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks,

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.520
three of those five workouts
per week emphasize strength

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.030
and hypertrophy and the other
two emphasize endurance.

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.640
Then, after 10 or 12 weeks,

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.640
one over to a 10- or 12-week
regimen of doing a 3:2 ratio

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.880
where you're prioritizing endurance work.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.640
So primarily the sorts of
workouts that are described

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.760
in the endurance episode
and those protocols.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.593
And the other two days,

00:56:35.593 --> 00:56:38.250
you're focusing on strength
and hypertrophy work merely

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.800
to maintain strength and hypertrophy,

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.030
to not lose the strength and hypertrophy

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:44.250
that you've created.

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:46.620
And there a lot of data
now supporting the fact

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:48.830
that maintaining muscular health

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:51.540
and bone health is supported
by resistance training,

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.770
weight training of various kinds.

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.540
It can also be done with body weight

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.300
if you don't have access to equipment.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.620
And, of course, that doing
cardiovascular endurance work

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.540
is very beneficial both to
the muscles of the body,

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.340
the organs of the body,
but also to the brain.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.790
Many of you have probably heard

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.500
that doing physical exercise

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.010
of various kinds can
support the production

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:13.740
of new neurons in the brain.

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:18.210
Frankly, those data are
specific to research animals.

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:19.920
As far as we know,

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.120
increases in neuron
number are not supported

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.460
by exercise in humans.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.170
There is a little bit
of data that supports

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:29.890
that maybe a few neurons
might get created by running

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.820
or weightlifting or things
of that sort in human beings,

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.740
but there's still a host of other reasons

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.230
to have this hour or so per day

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:40.010
where one is doing physical exercise.

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:43.350
And those include increased
blood flow to the brain.

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:44.920
Remember, the brain is an organ too.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.960
It's the most metabolically
demanding organ in your body

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.360
and it's receiving
those metabolic factors,

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.150
it's receiving its fuels
by way of vasculature,

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:56.000
of blood vessels and capillaries and veins

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.330
and things of that sort.

00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:00.100
So movement is very crucial

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.050
to get your brain to function properly.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.120
Movement of various
kinds is very important

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.080
to get your brain to function properly.

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.690
Resistance training turns
out to be as important

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.220
as endurance training because of the way

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.430
that it stimulates the release

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:15.910
of particular hormones
actually from bones,

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.620
things like osteocalcin,

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.120
which can positively impact brain function

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.590
and can support the
health of existing neurons

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.560
as opposed to increasing
the number of neurons.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.670
It turns out increasing the number

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:28.020
of neurons may not actually
be as beneficial as we think.

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:30.310
It all sounds great. More
neurons, more neurons.

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.410
Certainly more neurons is
better than fewer neurons

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:34.770
and losing neurons,

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:36.280
but incorporating new neurons

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.690
into existing brain circuitry
is actually very challenging

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:39.693
for the brain to do.

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.030
I make sure that after that workout,

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.250
I get this one hour or so of
exercise five days per week

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.930
because of the ways that it
supports my general health.

00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:53.370
And there are now hundreds of
studies supporting the fact

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:58.040
that both endurance work
and strength training

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.380
or hypertrophy training
done in combination,

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.370
meaning not necessarily
in the same workout,

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:07.080
but done across the week
is immensely beneficial

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.160
for the production of things

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.250
like brain-derived neurotrophic factor,

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:14.370
for limiting inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6,

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:17.700
for promoting anti-inflammatory
cytokines like IL-10,

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.900
provided that exercise
is of the proper duration

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.160
and that it's not so intense

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.070
that you're actually creating damage

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:26.990
to the various systems of the body.

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:29.883
Now, where is the
threshold between optimal,

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.487
sub-threshold and detrimental?

00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:36.060
This is a complicated theme

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.700
if we don't put some structure around it.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.070
So let's put a little bit
of structure around it.

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:41.090
We already said that about 60 minutes,

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.990
so 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes,

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:47.053
is going to be optimal for
all these health benefits.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.010
What about the structure
of the actual workouts?

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:53.393
Well, we need to address
this issue of intensity.

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:56.980
A good rule of thumb
based on the literature,

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:59.100
and I discussed this with
Dr. Andy Galpin prior

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.520
to this strength and hypertrophy
and endurance episodes,

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.520
and the literature that's published in

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.300
quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.710
to the fact that approximately 80%

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.570
of the resistance training you do

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:11.870
should be resistance training

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.570
that doesn't go to what they call failure,

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:18.040
where you can't actually
move the resistance anymore.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.740
The other 20% can be
of the higher intensity

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.620
to failure type training.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.563
Now, with respect to endurance work,

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:29.230
one can build up endurance
without having to log long,

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:33.610
long mileage or extensive mileage
in the pool or by running.

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:34.950
And that's because there
are these other forms

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.810
of endurance that can build up,

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.960
for instance, the capillary
beds within the muscles.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.250
Building up the capillary beds

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:43.100
within the muscles will
allow more oxygen utilization

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.150
within the muscles,

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:46.410
and thereby will increase your endurance

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.243
both of the muscles,

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:50.090
but also will improve brain metabolism

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.150
and the way that the heart functions,

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.543
so cardiovascular function.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.400
That 80/20 rule of less than failure

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.790
and work to failure in the
resistance exercise regime

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.070
can be transported or translated

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.330
to the endurance exercise portion

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.490
by focusing on that thing
that we're familiar with,

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:11.070
which is the burn when we're
running hard or cycling hard,

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.860
we'll experience a kind
of burning of the muscles

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.030
that's associated with the lactate system.

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:18.337
During the episode on endurance,

01:01:18.337 --> 01:01:22.050
I pointed out that that
burn is not lactic acid.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:25.590
Contrary to common belief,
it is not lactic acid.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.660
It's associated with lactate metabolism.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:31.130
And again, about 80% of the endurance work

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:34.050
should not incorporate
that so-called "burn,"

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:36.690
but if 20% of that work or so,

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:39.170
I should say approximately
20% of that work,

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:42.157
does include the so-called
"burning sensation,"

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.480
that burning sensation actually
triggers the activation

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.890
of release of certain compounds
and molecules from glia,

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.910
this brain cell type that
supports neuron health.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:57.500
And actually, the lactate
system is its own form of fuel

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.460
for the brain.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:03.460
And so there's increasing
interest in generating the lactate

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.500
or pushing past that lactate
threshold for small portion,

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.770
20% or so, of endurance work in order

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.590
to support brain health and function.

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:14.140
So what does all this all
look like as a protocol?

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.700
Well, as I mentioned
before, this 3:2 ratio.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.250
So maybe you spend 10 weeks or so

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.500
or 12 weeks or so focusing
mainly on endurance,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.820
where three workouts per
week on endurance work,

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.890
80% of those workouts,

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.070
meaning 80% of the time you're
below that burn threshold,

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:32.140
you are not experiencing
a burning sensation,

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.880
but that for 20% of it, you are.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.250
That, based on the scientific data,

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.900
should support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera,

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.420
as well as cardiovascular
health and oxygen utilization.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.580
All the forms of endurance
that we're aware of.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.100
And then the other two workouts

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.690
would involve resistance training,

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.920
again, with this 80/20 split,

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.470
where 80% of the work is
not to failure and 20% is.

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.030
And then maybe after 10,
12 weeks, you switch,

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.870
where you start emphasizing
strength and hypertrophy work

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:00.900
for three of the workouts

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.740
and endurance work for
two of the workouts.

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.160
Now, of course, some of you will be able

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.680
to train six days a week
or you'll compulsively need

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.730
to train seven days a week.

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.053
If you decide to do that,

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.990
please be aware that
this cortisol threshold

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.823
is a real thing.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:16.860
So for me, the 3:2 ratio
works out perfectly

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.630
'cause I like two full days off a week.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:19.940
When I take those really depends

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.260
on my schedule and how I'm feeling.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.480
Sometimes it's two days in a row.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.520
Sometimes they're interspersed
throughout the week.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.670
But in reviewing the scientific literature

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.620
for those two episodes of the podcast

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.610
and in talking to people
who are really informed

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.290
in the world of resistance training

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:36.220
and endurance training

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.070
and how that relates to
brain health and body health,

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:41.520
this seems to be the most
rational and grounded protocol,

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.020
so that's the one that I follow.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.890
So on any given day,

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:47.110
I finish that work block and I train.

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:49.430
I do some sort of resistance
or endurance training.

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:52.980
I put those on alternate days
or different days, rather.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.510
So we've now talked about the arc

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.090
that spans all the way from waking

01:03:57.090 --> 01:04:00.940
to a morning about of focused work

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.333
to physical training.

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:06.870
I have not mentioned ingesting
anything or nutrients.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.210
One of the most common questions I get

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:10.260
are what should I eat for my brain?

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.270
Well, ironically enough,

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:13.210
one of the best things you can do

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.800
for your brain is to not eat,

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.020
but, of course, we all
have to eat sooner or later

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.200
and eating is wonderful.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.500
I absolutely love eating.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.160
I even enjoy the mere act of chewing.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.300
But the question of what
to eat is an important one

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.520
as it relates to brain
health and brain function.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.010
Before we talk about that,

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:33.670
I want to emphasize that
training fasted actually

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:37.110
has some immediate and long-term benefits.

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:39.090
Prior to having my lab at Stanford,

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:41.710
I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:42.670
and had an appointment

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.020
at the Salk Institute
of Biological Studies.

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.220
I had a colleague there by
the name of Satchin Panda.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.710
He wrote a wonderful book
called "The Circadian Code."

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:53.980
He runs a serious biology
laboratory focusing on metabolism,

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.320
circadian rhythms, and so forth,

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.383
as well as the effects of fasting.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.760
Satchin and his book "The
Circadian Code" describe

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.410
how engaging in physical exercise

01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:08.700
while fasted can amplify the
effects of that exercise,

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.560
not just for sake of increasing
the percentage of things

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.880
like body fat burned, et
cetera, but for cellular health,

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.860
liver health, and the
health of other organs.

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:22.830
So where possible, I do
strive to do my workout

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:24.870
without eating anything first.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.110
However, some days I'm very, very hungry,

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:31.900
and so I do ingest water,
which contains electrolytes,

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.140
so that means sodium,
magnesium, potassium,

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.840
for the simple reason
that sodium, magnesium,

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.860
potassium are required for
neurons to function properly.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.903
It's part of the way they
generate electrical activity.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.190
As well, Ingesting electrolytes
for me can quell hunger.

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:51.270
And this points to a whole other topic

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.180
we could do another
episode on at some point,

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.070
which is many times people will think

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:56.380
that their blood sugar is low

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.423
and actually that's not the case.

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.420
And frankly, one wouldn't want
their blood sugar to be high.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.240
You don't want your blood sugar too low,

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.070
but you also don't want it too high.

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:08.220
Very low blood sugar is terrible,

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.820
but lowish blood sugar tends

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.240
to give us a sense of
mental clarity and focus,

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.560
related to this adrenaline phenomenon

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.330
that we talked about earlier.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.590
In order to be able to focus on exercise

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.900
or work or anything else, you
need sufficient electrolytes.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.130
And so many people find that

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:26.170
if they simply ingest
some water with salt,

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.500
maybe a 99-milligram potassium tablet,

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.800
all of a sudden they
feel very mentally clear

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.700
and able to do physical
work and mental work.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:37.390
So what I do is, prior
to this morning exercise,

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.900
although it's now late morning
in this way I'm describing it

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.970
and typically it does occur late morning,

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.100
I'll have some water with

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.910
either maybe half a teaspoon of sea salt

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:50.600
with a 99-milligram potassium tablet

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.667
or these days I'm fond of
taking what's called "LMNT."

01:06:53.667 --> 01:06:54.570
L-M-N-T. LMNT.

01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:56.700
I learned about this from
Lex Friedman's podcasts.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.170
I know many of you are familiar with Lex,

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:00.453
has a excellent podcast,
excellent scientist.

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:03.680
I don't have any business
relationship to LMNT.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.320
They're not a sponsor of the podcast,

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.220
but LMNT is a product

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.920
that essentially contains electrolytes:

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.430
sodium, potassium, as
well as magnesium malate,

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.250
which has been shown to offset things

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:16.200
like delayed onset muscle soreness.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.560
That form of magnesium
doesn't make people drowsy.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.270
It's not an anxiolytic like
some other forms of magnesium.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.360
An anxiolytic is just
one that reduces anxiety.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.380
So whether or not it's LMNT

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.500
or whether or not you're
just putting a little bit

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.580
of salt into some water
and ingesting that prior

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.490
to training, that can be
an excellent way to ensure

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:35.433
that you're able to complete
the physical exercise,

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:37.980
even though you haven't eaten anything.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.840
And I confess, some days
I will eat a little bit

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.490
before my workout,

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.640
just because I can't
seem to resist eating.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.570
I want to mention the use of stimulants

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.853
before physical training.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.160
This has certain benefits
and certain drawbacks.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.580
The benefits are sometimes
it can facilitate motivation

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.340
because things like caffeine can increase

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.350
the release of dopamine,

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.260
can increase the release of epinephrin,

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.510
can reduce that adenosine
level in the bloodstream.

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:06.160
So some people use
caffeine before training

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.370
in ways that benefit them.

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.530
It can also increase fat oxidation

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.430
and kind of fat metabolism and
things if that's your goal.

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:16.060
I'm not a particular fan
of ingesting stimulants

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.360
before training because of a whole set

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.710
of problems associated with
most forms of stimulants

01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:24.410
in the form of energy drinks, et cetera.

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.790
I am not a fan of energy drinks.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.940
I did a decent portion
of a previous episode

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.650
on food and mood on energy drinks

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:34.020
and some of the detrimental
things they contain.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.760
Rather, I try and train simply

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.350
by ingesting the caffeine
sources I mentioned before,

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:43.560
guayusa, mate, some
electrolytes, some water.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.990
Occasionally I'll have an espresso

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.780
or a cup of coffee before I train.

01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:49.680
And on rare occasions,

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.480
I should emphasize rare occasions,

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.180
if I really need help
increasing my motivation

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.300
or I decide I want to push extremely hard,

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.620
I will ingest something like alpha-GPC.

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.040
Alpha-GPC supports the release

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.060
of a neuromodulator called acetylcholine.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.640
So 300 milligrams of
alpha-GPC has been shown

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.490
to increase physical performance,

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.320
but also cognitive performance.

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.870
Some people might not be
interested in ingesting anything

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.120
to improve their physical
performance or anything at all,

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.830
but they might be addressing

01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:18.410
how they can improve cognitive
performance and focus.

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.370
And alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant
way to approach that.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.040
Again, definitely check with your doctor

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.630
before taking anything or
stopping to take anything,

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.470
but alpha-GPC has been
shown in various studies

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.050
to improve cognitive performance.

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:33.510
And in people who have
age-related cognitive decline,

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:36.470
there have been some
positive benefits reported

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:38.790
in quality, peer-reviewed journals.

01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:40.820
If you want to explore those references,

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.310
please go to examine.com,

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:44.190
go please put in alpha-GPC,

01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:45.690
go to the Human Effect Matrix,

01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:48.730
and there you can find
details of those studies,

01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:50.650
references to PubMed, et cetera.

01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:53.010
So let's talk about food timing first.

01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:55.070
As I mentioned, I eat
my first meal sometime

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.610
around noon plus or minus an hour

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.210
for the reasons we've discussed.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.813
The volume of food is also important.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.530
If you eat a large volume of anything,

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:09.320
because it diverts blood to your gut,

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.820
you will feel lethargic

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.600
and you will have less
blood going to your brain.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.430
That seems like a simple and trivial fact,

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:17.530
but if you want be able to think,

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:20.850
you can't ingest large volumes
of anything into your gut.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:22.870
So the discussion about
what foods give you energy

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:26.530
is kind of moot if you eat
enormous volumes of that food.

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:28.806
Now, the volumes are
going to depend on you

01:10:28.806 --> 01:10:31.830
and your needs and your activity levels.

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:36.310
I'm going to discuss what I
do in terms of food content,

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:38.030
but I'm not going to discuss food volume.

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:40.870
I sort of know where that mostly full,

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.700
like 80% full line is,

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.140
and I usually eat a little
bit past that, frankly.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.990
And I'm able to maintain a decent degree

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:49.480
of alertness into the afternoon.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.313
And that's my goal

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:51.830
and I think that's the
goal of most people,

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.670
to not work out in the
morning or do some work,

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.300
and then just collapse into a slumber

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.370
that lasts all afternoon,

01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:01.750
but to be able to generate alert, calm,

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:04.070
focus states throughout the day.

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:08.330
So for lunch, I do emphasize
slightly lower carbohydrate

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.620
or low carbohydrate intake
for the simple reason

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.500
that adrenaline and dopamine

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.310
and their associated
neuromodulators are going

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:19.000
to support alertness.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.780
So for me, I fast up until about noon.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.980
Then I eat a lunch that consists

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.680
of some sort of protein thing,

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.840
like some meat or some
chicken or some salmon

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.760
and some vegetables, et cetera.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.730
And if I've exercised previously,

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:37.180
which I do, as I mentioned,
five days a week,

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.090
then I will ingest some starches.

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:41.700
I'll in just some red
or, bread, excuse me,

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.050
or rice or oatmeal and butter
and nuts and things like that.

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:49.380
I will consume the various
food groups, as they say,

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.400
but I will keep the total amount

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.150
of carbohydrate a little
bit on the low side,

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:55.170
or if I haven't trained,

01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:58.010
I won't have any carbohydrate at all.

01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:59.710
Not because I'm ketogenic,

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.670
not because I'm inter carbohydrate,

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:04.640
not because I'm on a pure
carnivore diet, far from it,

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.640
but because starches cause
the release of serotonin

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:13.020
in the brain and lend themselves
to a state of sleepiness.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.880
Now, I should mention that
about 25% of individuals

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.420
have genes that encode for enzymes

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.210
that allow them to eat large
amounts of carbohydrate

01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.270
and not suffer from this lethargy,

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:26.530
this kind of sedation from carbohydrates.

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:31.210
But I don't have that gene, and so for me,

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:35.530
eating a noonish meal
that is not enormous,

01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:38.810
but is decent in size, but
that is mainly protein,

01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:41.150
healthy fats, and lowish carbohydrates

01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:43.310
or no carbohydrates is what allows me

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:45.620
to achieve heightened states of alertness

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.840
throughout the day, which is
what I need for my purposes.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.340
So just knowing that meats
and nuts support alertness,

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.010
provided you don't eat too much of them,

01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:55.920
that vegetables are healthy for us

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.410
and therefore we should eat them,

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:58.900
and I happen to like them as well,

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.120
and that carbohydrates tend
to have a kind of sedative

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120
like quality to them,

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.320
that should help you and
guide your food choices

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.000
in an intelligent way that's grounded

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.900
in the scientific literature
as it relates to alertness.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.940
Now, what about components of foods

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.540
that are not about alertness,

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.510
but are about mood?

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:19.860
We did an entire episode on mood and food,

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:23.500
and it's very clear, based
on now dozens of studies,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.500
that ingesting sufficient
levels of omega-3 fatty acids

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.930
is going to support healthy mood

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.850
and even can act as an antidepressant.

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:35.930
More than a dozen studies have shown

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:39.240
that ingesting at least
1,000 milligrams per day

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.720
of the EPA form of essential fatty acid

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.560
is as effective as
prescription antidepressants

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.240
in relieving depression.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.140
And if you're somebody

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.550
who requires prescription antidepressants,

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:53.430
Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera,

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.990
it can allow people to take lower doses

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:58.010
of those medications,

01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:00.680
which in many cases is a positive thing

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.250
or a good thing to do because
of the side effect profiles

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:04.920
that many of those drugs carry.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.390
So I find these data
remarkably compelling.

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:12.690
I mean, here we have a food
or a substance from food

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:15.770
that can improve our mood
and our sense of wellbeing,

01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:17.640
and it does that by way

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.650
of increasing certain
neuromodulators in the brain,

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:20.800
in particular dopamine,

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.023
but also some other
related neuromodulators.

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:26.490
So if you're eating
fatty salmon regularly,

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:28.870
if you're eating krill regularly,

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.590
meaning if you're a whale,

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:35.100
if you're ingesting foods that tend

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.270
to have a lot of omega-3s,

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:39.030
you probably don't need to
supplement with omega-3.

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:41.210
Most people are not
ingesting sufficient levels

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:44.910
of omega-3, and I'm certainly
one of those people.

01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:47.110
Despite an effort to eat
good foods and whole foods,

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:49.150
et cetera, and unprocessed foods,

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:51.500
I've made the choice to ingest

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.820
at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA.

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.130
I do that in the form of fish oil

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:57.639
and the EPA-DHA combination fish oil,

01:14:57.639 --> 01:15:00.200
but the threshold of 1,000 milligrams

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.300
is not 1,000 milligrams of fish oil;

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.710
it's 1,000 milligrams of EPA.

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:07.530
Now, for those of you that
don't want to consume fish oils

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:11.110
and prefer to get your omega-3s
from non-animal sources,

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:13.540
there are non-animal sources,

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.030
various forms of algae, et cetera.

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:16.850
You can just look that up online

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:18.060
and you should be able to find that.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.510
There are also a number of foods

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.690
that include these essential omega-3s.

01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:23.290
We did an episode on food and mood

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.670
where I go into more detail

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.560
than you could ever want on that,

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.490
as well as some additional
recommendations.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.620
We also did an episode
on thyroid function,

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:34.030
this hormone that's
important for metabolism,

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.210
and that pointed to the importance

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.730
of getting sufficient iodine,

01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:39.240
which you should naturally get

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.570
from the salts you're ingesting,

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.270
provided you're ingesting enough salt.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:44.270
I'm not somebody who eats a lot of kelp,

01:15:45.753 --> 01:15:48.420
but, or seaweed, although I
don't mind the taste of seaweed,

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.040
I don't ingest it regularly,

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.370
but ingesting sufficient selenium

01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:55.120
or selenium has been shown to be important

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.340
for proper thyroid production
and thyroid function,

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.180
which is why I tend to eat
a few Brazil nuts each day

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.760
typically with my lunch or
sometimes before my workout.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.010
It doesn't really matter.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.330
The point is that the volume, the amount,

01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:13.380
the content, and indeed the
ratios of protein to fat

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.960
to carbohydrates are going
to impact how you feel

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.300
and they're going to
impact your brain health.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.630
And, of course, the timing.

01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:22.300
We know that allowing periods of 12 hours

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.670
or more each 24-hour cycle

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.690
where you're not ingesting
anything is beneficial

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:26.720
for your brain and body health.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.170
That's what Satchin Panda

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:31.460
and his colleagues' work has
shown over and over again

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.070
in these quality studies.

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:34.807
So when people ask me, you know,

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:37.010
"What should I eat for my brain?"

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.440
More often than not,

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.190
it's really a question of how
you're structuring your day,

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:42.700
when you're eating for the first time,

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:43.990
how long you're allowing yourself

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.893
to fast each 24-hour cycle,

01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:50.440
and also whether or not you're
getting sufficient omega-3s,

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.950
whether or not you're
getting sufficient selenium

01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:55.470
to support things like thyroid function,

01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:58.680
which has an impact both on
the metabolism of the body,

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.450
but also the metabolism in the brain.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:01.750
And when I say metabolism,

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.340
I don't just mean burning energy;

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.480
I actually mean the rebuilding of things.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.410
So in the episode on growth
hormone and thyroid hormone,

01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:11.950
we talked about how metabolism means,

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:15.010
not just the breakdown of
fats and carbohydrates,

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.360
but also the building up,
the repair of muscle tissue,

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.507
the repair of bone,
the reinforcing of bone

01:17:20.507 --> 01:17:23.950
and the repair and the
buildup of brain tissue.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.270
And so those are the
things that I emphasize

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:28.120
because they are so strongly supported

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.220
by the scientific data
done in mice studies,

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.630
done in humans.

01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:37.410
And basically there's a
lot of biochemical evidence

01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.640
that supports everything
that I just described.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.240
Along the lines of health and wellbeing,

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.130
I'd be remiss if I
didn't mention hormones.

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.370
Hormones have broad effects
on the body and brain.

01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:50.330
We did an entire month on hormones

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:52.780
if you want to hear about any
of those hormones in detail.

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.150
We talked about testosterone
and optimizing testosterone,

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:56.363
estrogen, et cetera.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.100
The sex steroid hormones,

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.550
which include testosterone and estrogen,

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:05.540
which, of course, are
present in varying ratios,

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:09.930
but in both men and women and in kids,

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:12.540
they are manufactured from cholesterol.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.400
We hear about cholesterol
as this terrible thing,

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.200
but they are actually
made from cholesterol.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.860
And so if you don't get
sufficient levels of cholesterol,

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.337
that can be problematic for your hormones

01:18:21.337 --> 01:18:23.717
and that can be problematic for your brain

01:18:23.717 --> 01:18:25.560
and your body health.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.390
So without going into too much detail,

01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:29.930
I'll just point to a couple of things

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:33.340
that I do that, at
least from my blood work

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.780
and from my subjective experience,

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.180
have been very beneficial for me

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.080
that some of you might want to consider.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.840
First of all, I am not shy
about my love for butter.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.870
I will eat packs of butter directly.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.170
I believe if people
are going to eat cheese

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:48.890
without a cracker, I will
eat butter without a cracker.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.960
Butter is high in cholesterol,

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.100
so I don't eat a ton of it,

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.253
but at least for me and for
my lipid profiles, it's fine.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.530
Butter has cholesterol,

01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:59.660
which is a precursor to
the sex steroid hormones,

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.360
and men and women need
testosterone and estrogen

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.730
in order to feel good
and to be able to think.

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:08.210
You do not want your estrogen too low

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.840
or your testosterone too low.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.890
So I eat butter in order to ensure

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:13.150
that I get sufficient cholesterol.

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:15.970
Butter also has some other
things that are beneficial,

01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:18.190
various small fatty acids that are

01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:20.790
that are interesting in
terms of their effects

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.800
on metabolism, et cetera.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.920
You can look those up, benefits of butter.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.460
But again, volume is important
and you can't overdo it.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.610
Costello incidentally
loves butter as well.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.420
Along the lines of
hormones and testosterone,

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.240
I get a lot of questions
about this I think

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.100
because a lot of online communities

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.890
are sort of obsessed with testosterone,

01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:43.570
and I just want to emphasize that, yes,

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:46.070
having sufficient levels of testosterone

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:48.410
is vitally important for brain function

01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:49.970
and having sufficient levels

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:53.150
of estrogen will allow your
brain to actually function.

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.390
It turns out that estrogen
is one of the main ways

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:59.470
in which the brain maintains longevity

01:19:59.470 --> 01:20:01.590
and maintains its ability to think.

01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:04.840
So we should all be seeking
optimal testosterone levels

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.290
for ourselves, both
testosterone and estrogen.

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:11.470
And many of the things that
we've discussed up until now,

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:15.490
morning sunlight, exercise, fasting,

01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:18.670
those can support
testosterone and estrogen

01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:21.740
in meaningful and positive ways.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.480
I get a lot of questions
about hormone optimization.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.810
We did an entire month on this topic.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:29.300
We did an entire episode on testosterone

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.460
and estrogen optimization.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.240
I just want to briefly
highlight two things

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.620
that could be relevant,

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.820
and then if you want more details,

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:37.980
please go see that episode.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.740
The first is that testosterone

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.030
can exert its various functions only

01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:46.460
in its unbound form, free testosterone.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.500
We all make a particular binding protein

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.890
called "sex hormone binding globulin"

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.720
that essentially binds up testosterone,

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.360
prevents it from being free.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.490
This sounds like a terrible thing,

01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:57.340
but actually it's a good thing

01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.102
because it allows
testosterone be transported

01:20:59.102 --> 01:21:01.340
to the various tissues,
including the brain,

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:04.003
where it can exert its various functions.

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:08.620
For those that have lower

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:10.470
than desired levels of testosterone

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:12.930
or too much sex hormone binding globulin,

01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:15.150
it turns out that 400 milligrams per day

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.930
of something called "tongkat ali,"

01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:18.010
which is a form of ginseng,

01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:21.170
can actually help increase
levels of free testosterone.

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:23.757
Many people experience a
positive subjective effect

01:21:23.757 --> 01:21:26.230
and some objective affects as well,

01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:28.200
meaning increases in free testosterone

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.020
when they do blood analysis.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.160
There are some data on that,

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.100
not a ton in the
peer-reviewed literatures,

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.830
and again, always approach
these with a sense of caution

01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:39.920
and definitely talked to your doctor.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.130
If you want to learn more about that,

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:42.470
you can go to examine.com.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:45.100
There's a lot of information
there listed about that.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.210
The other compound that's
relevant both to men and women,

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:49.360
or I should say people that are trying

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.663
to optimize testosterone
and/or estrogen, is Fadogia.

01:21:52.663 --> 01:21:56.090
Fadogia agrestis is actually an herb

01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:57.390
that increases the levels

01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.760
of what's called "luteinizing hormone."

01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.990
Luteinizing hormone is a hormone

01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:01.590
that's released from the hypothalamus

01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:06.270
within the brain that
travels to the gonads,

01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:08.030
either the ovaries or the testes,

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:12.400
to stimulate the release of
estrogen or testosterone.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.970
And Fadogia agrestis has been shown,

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:16.550
albeit in a limited number of studies,

01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:18.310
to increase levels of luteinizing hormone

01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:20.310
and thereby levels of
testosterone and estrogen

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.030
in ways that some people find beneficial.

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:24.200
So I just want to mention those two.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.950
And again, if you want
a lot more information

01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:27.760
about hormone optimization,

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.263
please see the episodes
on hormone optimization.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.600
A key aspect to the mid-day meal,

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.010
if you want that meal to benefit you,

01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:39.540
is to take a brief walk afterwards.

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.410
It turns out that brief
walks of five to 30 minutes

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:45.340
after ingesting food can
accelerate metabolism

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.160
and actually can accelerate

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.400
and improve nutrient utilization,

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.110
which is essentially
the same as metabolism.

01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:53.890
But nonetheless, that's
something that I do

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:55.840
after I finish my noon meal.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.710
I do force myself to
stand up and go outside

01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:00.670
and take a brief walk.

01:23:00.670 --> 01:23:02.640
That also gets me, again, into optic flow.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.860
It also has another benefit,

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.300
which is that I am giving my brain

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.360
and thereby my body more information

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.590
about light and time of day,

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:12.790
which is always better
than less information

01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:14.253
about light and time of day.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.960
Much of our circadian rhythm
and our health rhythms

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.538
and all of our cognitive
rhythms, et cetera,

01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:25.120
are supported by our cells
knowing where they are in time,

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.200
and light is the primary zeitgeber,

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.230
that's German for "timekeeper,"

01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:34.020
is the primary way in which
the body learns information

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.417
or about what function should be turned on

01:23:36.417 --> 01:23:38.260
and what functions should be turned off.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.560
So getting that morning light pulse,

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.010
but then also leaving the house

01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:42.910
or apartment or workplace and getting out

01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:45.640
for a few minutes after lunch
is beneficial for metabolism,

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.760
beneficial for nutrient utilization,

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.510
and beneficial for all the
organs and tissues of the body

01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:54.270
because you're getting that
outside light exposure.

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:55.540
Now I'd like to shift our attention

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:57.950
towards science supported-protocols

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.170
that increase the effectiveness

01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.500
and our performance in everything.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.350
And by everything I mean sleep,

01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:08.180
I mean physical performance,
I mean mental performance,

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.920
I mean less anxiety, all the things.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.790
Truly all the things.

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:17.020
And that is something called
"non-sleep deep rest."

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:21.410
Non-sleep deep rest or NSDR
is an acronym that I coined

01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:25.800
as an umbrella term to
encompass many protocols

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.130
that all have been shown,
in one form or another,

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:32.350
to support better brain and body function.

01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:34.940
Now, these protocols have
names that you've heard before.

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:38.490
Things like meditation,
things like yoga nidra,

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:41.290
and things like hypnosis.

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:44.200
All of these protocols and
these activities, however,

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.410
share something in common,

01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:48.870
which is they involve a deliberate

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:51.760
and directed shift in one's state,

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.520
and the shift tends to be

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.193
toward a state of deeper relaxation.

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:58.570
We certainly don't have time now

01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:01.050
to dissect out the
literature on all of these.

01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:02.850
There is ample literature,

01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:05.510
I should say there is
robust and ample literature,

01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:06.620
supporting the fact that

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.250
a regular meditation
practice is beneficial.

01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.990
But meditation itself has many forms:

01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:14.430
transcendental meditation,
loving kindness meditation,

01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:16.810
third eye meditation, walking meditation.

01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:18.420
Yoga nidra is a practice I've talked

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.080
about many times before,

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.620
which involves simply lying down.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.650
It doesn't involve any movement.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.230
No down dogs or up dogs or anything.

01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:26.110
It just involves lying on your back

01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:28.470
and doing some specific
long exhale breathing.

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:30.080
There are a lot of yoga
nidra scripts out there

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.820
that are quite good.

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:36.010
But there's one NSDR type protocol

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:39.500
that has been shown by the greatest number

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.260
of scientific studies to promote

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:43.660
not just states of deep relaxation,

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.410
not just states of heightened focus,

01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:49.170
but also to accelerate plasticity

01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:52.140
and learning within the
brain, and that's hypnosis.

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.930
And I've become increasingly excited

01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:57.240
and interested in hypnosis as a tool,

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.740
and not just a tool of any kind,

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.630
but a tool that really can be directed

01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:03.810
toward particular goals and outcomes.

01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:06.340
And I think that's really
what sets hypnosis apart

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:08.940
as an NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, protocol

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.130
from things like naps or
things like yoga nidra

01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:14.010
or things like meditation.

01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:16.430
And I certainly believe and understand

01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:19.660
that meditation naps and
yoga nidra can be directed

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.780
toward less anxiety, et cetera,

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:25.210
but hypnosis is unique in

01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:27.860
that it's very directed.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.950
The essence of hypnosis
is for the person, you,

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:35.060
to guide your brain toward a
particular outcome or change.

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.970
So I'd like to point out
a particular resource.

01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:39.220
It's a completely zero-cost resource,

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.760
which is reveri.com.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.470
That's R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:46.620
reveri.com obviously is a website

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.930
where there are links to
an app that's available

01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:50.310
in Apple and Android.

01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:51.660
This is a hypnosis app,

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.250
but this isn't just any hypnosis app.

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:54.770
This is a hypnosis app

01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:58.200
that contains multiple hypnosis protocols

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.090
that are all backed by
very high-quality science.

01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:02.947
The science was done by my colleague

01:27:02.947 --> 01:27:04.750
and our associate chair of psychiatry

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:05.960
at Stanford School of Medicine,

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.510
that David Spiegel is
responsible for that work.

01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:11.763
I'm not associated with
that scientific work.

01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:14.480
They've examined what brain areas

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.300
get activated during hypnosis,

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:19.560
what the outcomes are for
various hypnosis protocols.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.393
And within Reveri,

01:27:20.393 --> 01:27:23.340
you will find hypnosis protocols
for enhancing your focus,

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:25.940
enhancing creativity, reducing pain,

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.650
getting better at
sleeping, reducing anxiety.

01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:31.700
Most of these are about
10 or 15 minutes long.

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.240
Some of them are extremely brief.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.110
One minute long.

01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:36.630
They have a one-minute
hypnosis that you can do.

01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:38.940
Those one minute hypnosis
scripts work best

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:40.167
if you've been doing the 10

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:43.960
and 15 minute ones
regularly or semi-regularly.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.600
It's a really wonderful resource

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.023
for which there is a lot of
peer-reviewed published data.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.640
One study I'd like to emphasize

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.550
in particular is Jiang et al.

01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:55.400
J-I-A-N-G.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.550
That is a reference you can find

01:27:57.550 --> 01:28:00.640
on the reveri.com website
under Our Research.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.640
And the title of this
paper is "Brain Activity

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.840
and Functional Connectivity
Associated with Hypnosis,"

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.970
and it was published in the
journal Cerebral Cortex.

01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:12.320
What this paper essentially
shows is that specific areas

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.880
of our brain that are involved
in executive function,

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.860
which is associated with
our ability to focus,

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.450
as well as what's called
the "default mode network,"

01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:21.340
which is sort of the way
that your brain idles,

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:22.970
does your brain tend to idle

01:28:24.202 --> 01:28:26.820
at a level of high anxiety or calm,

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.130
as well as activation of

01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:29.860
a brain area called the "insula."

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.420
That's I-N-S-U-L-A.

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.290
The insula is extremely interesting.

01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:35.920
Hypnosis has been shown
to activate the insula,

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.410
which can enhance our
sense of interoception,

01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:40.370
our sense of internal state,

01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:42.290
which might sound like a annoying thing.

01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:44.520
You don't want to be
thinking about your heartbeat

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.510
or your breathing.

01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:48.060
But what's really
interesting about hypnosis is

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.523
that it increases areas of the brain

01:28:49.523 --> 01:28:52.810
that are responsible for
deep relaxation, focus,

01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:56.800
and self-awareness, this
interoception, simultaneously.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.220
And that's very unusual
compared to other states,

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.240
any other states of any kind.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:05.530
So I've made it a practice,
a daily practice in fact,

01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:08.020
that after lunch and after this walk,

01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:11.000
I do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
because what I've found is
that in contrast to naps

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.260
and in contrast to other forms of NSDR,

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:20.520
it really allows me to enter
a state of deep relaxation,

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.250
but also to then exit that state

01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:25.050
in a very focused and deliberate way

01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:28.090
that allows me to lean into
my afternoon in an alert way,

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:30.990
in a way that I can
function and do mental work

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:33.440
and interact with people, et cetera.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.930
So there's no brain fog,
there's no grogginess.

01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:37.630
And I want to emphasize that the hypnosis

01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.210
that I'm referring to here

01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:43.190
and that Reveri provides
is not stage hypnosis.

01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:45.295
This isn't you being programmed
to squawk like a chicken

01:29:45.295 --> 01:29:46.840
or do anything against your will.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.050
This is you teaching your brain
how to access these focused,

01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:52.530
relaxed, interoceptive states.

01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:56.090
This is also an extremely
valuable aspect to hypnosis

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:58.790
because it can increase plasticity,

01:29:58.790 --> 01:30:01.170
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:03.980
It's essentially opening
up pathways that allow you

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.520
to change your brain in
the ways that you want.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.920
And it's very directed
toward particular outcomes

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.180
So I am an, as you can probably tell,

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:15.410
I'm very enthusiastic about hypnosis

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:17.520
as an optimal NSDR protocol,

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.510
and so I do that every single day.

01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:21.310
There are days that I
don't manage to do it

01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:22.260
for whatever reason.

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.580
I forget or interference
from email or et cetera.

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:28.760
But that is essentially how
I enter my early afternoon.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.590
I do this post-lunch, post-walk NSDR

01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:35.580
in the form of a Reveri hypnosis.

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:39.490
Again, a completely
zero-cost resource to you.

01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:40.980
There are excellent data.

01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.860
All those data can be
found on the Reveri site,

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.980
and you can also learn a
lot more about hypnosis

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.080
and what sorts of hypnosis protocols

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.660
might be optimal for you.

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.840
So if you are looking for a
science-backed, zero-cost,

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:56.150
very effective tool for
getting better at focusing,

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.300
better at sleeping,
better at all the things

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.150
that I believe people want,

01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.910
I do believe that is the best tool

01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:04.030
that one can access at this point in time.

01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:06.880
So then after I exit hypnosis,

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.170
I usually give Costello a
little scratch behind the ear,

01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:11.083
and then I make sure that I hydrate.

01:31:12.190 --> 01:31:15.840
Hydration, again, is vitally
important for brain function.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.150
It's vitally important
for all bodily functions.

01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:19.760
And I often forget to do it,

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.260
so I've just sort of linked
the drinking of water

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:25.020
to my hypnosis practice.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.730
As soon as I'm done, I hydrate.

01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:30.490
And then I tend to focus
on another work about.

01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:33.220
So this would be, for
me, sometime around 2:30

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.650
or 3:00 in the afternoon

01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:37.550
when normally I would be
quite sleepy and passing out.

01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:41.120
However, the protocol of
shifting my morning caffeine

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.530
to 90 minutes to two hours after waking,

01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:46.310
as well as the use of
this hypnosis protocol

01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:49.070
has really allowed me to
move through the afternoon

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:51.360
in a way that I don't
experience that dip in.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.960
Energy every once in a while
I'll feel kind of sleepy

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:54.793
or kind of out of it,

01:31:54.793 --> 01:31:59.690
but I've been really pleasantly surprised

01:31:59.690 --> 01:32:02.040
at the extent to which one
can avoid that afternoon dip.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.350
If you do certain things properly prior

01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:06.910
to the arrival of 2:00 or 3:00 PM.

01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:09.923
Now, if you're a napper and
you want to nap, no big deal.

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:12.790
Naps can be wonderfully beneficial.

01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:14.350
Here are the rules around napping

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:15.580
according to the sleep science.

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.150
Stanford has an excellent sleep clinic.

01:32:17.150 --> 01:32:19.170
I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer,

01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:22.450
my colleague in the
Stanford Sleep Laboratory,

01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:24.660
as well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.690
whose name I'm sure most
of you are familiar with.

01:32:26.690 --> 01:32:29.060
He wrote this wonderful
book, "Why We Sleep."

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:32.260
Naps should be 90 minutes or less,

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:34.500
and 20-minute naps are fine,

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.160
but not longer than 90 minutes.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.610
And there are essentially
two varieties of people:

01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:40.750
people for whom napping interferes

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:44.990
with falling asleep later
that night and staying asleep

01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:47.580
and people for whom the
nap does not interfere.

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.210
You have to decide who you are.

01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:51.700
And if you're somebody who can nap

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.350
and not have any trouble falling asleep

01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:55.460
and staying asleep later that night,

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.660
well, by all means, nap.

01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:57.890
Just make it 90 minutes or less.

01:32:57.890 --> 01:33:00.623
Again, these 90-minute cycles
are really a vital constraint

01:33:00.623 --> 01:33:02.500
that we should all obey.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.360
If it's 91 minutes, don't worry.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.970
You won't dissolve into a puddle of tears.

01:33:05.970 --> 01:33:07.560
But if you're starting
to sleep for an hour

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.170
or more in the afternoon,
that can be problematic.

01:33:10.170 --> 01:33:14.270
If you're somebody who can
nap for 10, 20 minutes,

01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:17.410
that's probably better than
getting a full 90-minute cycle,

01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:19.980
unless you didn't get enough
sleep the night before.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.830
But you really have to figure
out what's right for you.

01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:22.900
There's a lot of variety there.

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.330
But that's essentially
what the science says.

01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:26.840
Now, whether or not you nap or whether

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.930
or not you do not nap,

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:31.840
a key protocol for sleep
health and wakefulness

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:36.320
and metabolism and hormone
health is viewing light

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.560
in the afternoon.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.360
So here's the reason for doing this.

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:43.620
As we progress into the evening hours,

01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:47.200
there's a phenomenon where
our retina, our eyes,

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.400
become very sensitive to light,

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.600
such that if we view bright lights

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.820
or even not so bright lights

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.640
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM,

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.020
that is strongly disruptive,

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:04.880
very disruptive for our
dopamine production.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.000
It can really screw up our sleep,

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.090
and it's actually been shown in data

01:34:09.090 --> 01:34:11.880
from David Berson's lab
at Brown University,

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:14.590
one of the foremost circadian
biology laboratories,

01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:16.580
as well as Samer Hattar's laboratory

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.270
at the National Institute of Mental Health

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:22.920
that viewing bright light,
or even not so bright light,

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.660
between these hours of
11:00 PM and 4:00 AM

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.910
or even 10:00 PM and 4:00
AM can disrupt learning

01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:31.160
and memory, can disrupt the immune system

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.193
and can disrupt mood in
very long-lasting ways.

01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:38.200
There are ways to offset that, however.

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.210
What I call your "Netflix inoculation."

01:34:41.210 --> 01:34:43.410
For those of you that like
to stay up late on the tablet

01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:45.750
or computer or watching Netflix,

01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:49.130
getting a little bit of
afternoon light in your eyes,

01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:51.170
somewhat counter-intuitively,

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:54.240
can prevent this disruption

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:57.820
of bright light later in the
evening, at least somewhat.

01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.190
What do I mean by that?

01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:03.520
Well, if you view light as the
sun is starting to go down,

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.130
so if you step outside
around 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM,

01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:08.960
again, what time exactly
will depend on time of year

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.490
and where you are located on our planet,

01:35:11.490 --> 01:35:14.170
but as the sun starts to head down,

01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:16.040
you don't necessarily
have to see the sunset,

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.350
it'd be lovely if you could,
sunsets are beautiful,

01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:23.270
but if you can get outside and
see the sun as it arcs down,

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:24.750
or if you can't see the sun directly,

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:28.450
get some sunlight in your
eyes in the afternoon hours,

01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:32.180
so maybe 4:00 PMish, and
do that for 20, 30 minutes,

01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.840
maybe reading outside or taking a walk,

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.210
I walk the dog again, that's my protocol,

01:35:37.210 --> 01:35:38.400
in order to get that evening light,

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.060
what it does is it lowers the sensitivity

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.840
of your retina in the late evening hours,

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.640
which allows you to buffer yourself

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.770
against the negative effects
of bright light later at night.

01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:53.470
Now, it won't allow you to blast your eyes

01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:54.303
with bright light;

01:35:54.303 --> 01:35:56.580
you still need to dim the
lights in the evening.

01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.000
But there's a very nice
study that was published

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.210
in scientific reports that illustrates

01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:03.780
that if one does this,

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:07.310
if you go outside and view
sunlight in the evening hours

01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:10.350
for anywhere from five to 30 minutes,

01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:12.355
and I realized that people have a range

01:36:12.355 --> 01:36:14.680
of constraints on their schedule,

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.240
but from five to 30
minutes, what happens is

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:21.030
that your melatonin
rhythm stays appropriate.

01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:22.700
Now, we haven't talked
too much about melatonin,

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:27.180
but melatonin is a hormone
that is inhibited by light.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.120
It's actually prevented by light.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.640
And melatonin is the hormone

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.010
that allows you to fall asleep easily.

01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:36.300
Now, I'm not talking about
supplementing melatonin;

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.110
I'm talking about melatonin

01:36:38.110 --> 01:36:40.590
that you naturally
produce from your pineal.

01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:42.690
So the protocol is very simple:

01:36:42.690 --> 01:36:45.090
get outside in the afternoon or evening

01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:48.150
for 10 to 30 minutes,
take your sunglasses off,

01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:50.890
get some bright light, get some
natural light in your eyes.

01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:52.740
If you can't do that,

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.810
probably better to just stay

01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:57.480
with standard artificial lights inside.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.840
Don't crank them up, but
just start to dim them.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.770
Again, this would be a time
to avoid blue blockers.

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.670
People are popping on blue
blockers at four o'clock

01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:06.830
in the afternoon 'cause you're worried

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:08.560
that blue light is going
to disrupt your sleep.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.180
Well, you're making
your eyes more sensitive

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.540
to any light that you might
see later in the evening,

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:15.150
blue light or otherwise.

01:37:15.150 --> 01:37:16.980
So get that afternoon light.

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:20.470
So what you'll probably notice
is that the optimal protocols

01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:23.100
for optimizing your brain and body health

01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.200
and performance and sleep, et cetera,

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.310
are actually really simple.

01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:29.550
But just because they're
simple does not mean

01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:30.950
that they are not powerful;

01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:32.220
in fact, they are very powerful

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:35.410
because they leverage the
most powerful technology

01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:37.520
that exists, which is your nervous system.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.370
You know, we always think
about technologies as devices,

01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:42.670
and indeed there are some
wonderful devices out there.

01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:44.427
Some people are really
into tracking their sleep

01:37:44.427 --> 01:37:45.600
and their sleep time.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.470
If you're into that, great.

01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:48.270
That's not something that I personally do,

01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:51.610
although I keep telling
myself that I should do that.

01:37:51.610 --> 01:37:54.530
There are devices that
can control brainwaves

01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:55.363
and things of that sort.

01:37:55.363 --> 01:37:58.960
But what we are talking about
today are really basic things

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.997
that we can all do that
can steer our neurology

01:38:01.997 --> 01:38:04.380
and our biology in the directions

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.493
that are going to support workflow,

01:38:06.493 --> 01:38:08.090
that are going to support hormones,

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:10.520
that are going to support brain function.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.670
So this afternoon light
viewing is yet another example

01:38:13.670 --> 01:38:16.800
of leveraging a technology
that you were born with

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.810
and that you will die with

01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:20.410
and that you will have
every day in between

01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:24.350
in order to tweak the
hormones of your system,

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:26.120
in this case, the hormone melatonin,

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.040
so that it's released
at the appropriate times

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.600
and not at the wrong times.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.500
Because we know that when hormones

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.820
and systems of the body are well aligned

01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:36.040
with the 24-hour schedule,

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.280
beautiful things happen.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.870
And when they are misaligned,
terrible things happen.

01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:42.670
Sometimes those terrible
things are subtle at first,

01:38:42.670 --> 01:38:45.970
but disrupting your circadian
rhythms is really bad

01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:48.170
for every system in your body.

01:38:48.170 --> 01:38:50.150
Getting it right, and as you can tell,

01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:52.180
getting it right doesn't take much,

01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:55.060
can really serve to "optimize" you.

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.000
When I say "optimize,"

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.190
I mean it puts you into
a better mood overall,

01:38:58.190 --> 01:39:00.940
better state for learning, et cetera.

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:03.110
So get that afternoon light as well.

01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:05.170
So at some point in the evening,

01:39:05.170 --> 01:39:07.460
I eat that thing that we call dinner.

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:11.380
And while it feels sort of
strange to talk about my dinner,

01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:13.300
the reason I want to talk about my dinner

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.790
and what I eat for dinner is that for me,

01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:18.340
dinner, of course, is about eating-

01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.750
I'll mention again I love eating-

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:22.590
but also about optimizing the transition

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:24.580
to sleep and sleep.

01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:27.140
So obviously I eat foods that I enjoy.

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.430
I'm not one of these people
that will eat anything

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:34.410
or avoid eating anything
simply to benefit from that.

01:39:34.410 --> 01:39:36.400
I do enjoy food very, very much.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.170
And so my dinner generally
is comprised of things

01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:43.230
that are going to support
rest and deep sleep.

01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:46.280
And that means starchy carbohydrates.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.170
It's absolutely clear
that one of the major ways

01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:51.000
that we can increase serotonin,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.003
which helps in the transition to sleep,

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:56.170
is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates.

01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:58.500
Now, I realized that starchy
carbohydrates are kind

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.500
of a demonized term nowadays
and everyone's anti-carbs,

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.560
but, you know, we really
should distinguish

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.260
between refined sugars
and complex carbohydrates.

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:08.630
And we did an episode about this.

01:40:08.630 --> 01:40:11.150
We talked about how
refined sugars disrupt,

01:40:11.150 --> 01:40:12.294
not just metabolism,

01:40:12.294 --> 01:40:15.640
but they actually disrupt
some of the neurons in the gut

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.870
that sense fatty acids and amino acids

01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:19.240
from fats and proteins.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:22.240
But those same neurons can
actually respond to sugar

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.110
and create a situation

01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:26.140
where you actually
start craving more sugar

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:29.240
because those neurons
in your gut communicate

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.017
via a nerve pathway for
you aficionados called

01:40:32.017 --> 01:40:34.410
"the vagus nerve" and a little cluster

01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:36.180
of neurons called the "nodose ganglia."

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.087
N-O-D-O-S-E.

01:40:38.087 --> 01:40:41.590
Nodose ganglias are right
next to the corner of your jaw

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:43.060
and can trigger the activation

01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.570
and the release of dopamine in your brain,

01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:47.430
which basically makes
you crave more sugar,

01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:49.310
independent of how something tastes.

01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:50.450
So when I say carbohydrates,

01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:53.390
what I really mean is
starchy carbohydrates,

01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:54.790
non-refined sugars.

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:59.150
And in the episode about food and mood

01:40:59.150 --> 01:41:00.740
and metabolism as well,

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:03.030
I referenced a really spectacular lecture

01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:05.810
by Dr. Robert Lustig who's
a pediatric endocrinologist

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:07.550
at UCSF, UC San Francisco,

01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:09.990
absolutely spectacular talk,

01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:11.690
you can find it on YouTube easily,

01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:14.940
where he talks about the
science of refined sugars.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:18.130
And this isn't in any kind of
conspiracy or paranoid way.

01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:21.200
This is really the medical
and scientific literature.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.670
So my dinner is carbohydrates
and some protein.

01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:26.570
So maybe some chicken or
fish or something like that,

01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:28.930
maybe some eggs, or sometimes just pasta

01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:30.840
or just rice and vegetables.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.250
And that's because I enjoy those foods,

01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:37.520
but also because I want to
increase the amount of serotonin

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.950
in my brain so that I can
actually fall asleep that night.

01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:42.590
Many people who are on
low-carbohydrate diets struggle

01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:44.420
with falling and staying asleep,

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.180
and that's because it's hard
to achieve heightened levels

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:51.160
of serotonin which are
necessary to enter sleep.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.820
I should also mention that melatonin

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.310
and serotonin fall in the same pathway.

01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:58.070
They are related hormones
and neuromodulators.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:00.990
We won't go into their biosynthesis now,

01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:03.720
but essentially what we're
talking about is a system

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.240
that's biasing us towards
rest and relaxation

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.250
as opposed to wakefulness.

01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:10.450
You might ask, "Well, can't
I just take serotonin?

01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:11.830
Can't I just take 5-HTP

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:13.960
or a precursor to
serotonin or tryptophan?"

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.170
And indeed you can, however,

01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:17.530
many people including myself,

01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:19.420
find that when they
supplement with serotonin

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:20.770
in the evening or at night,

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.210
that can cause problems
in the architecture

01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:26.030
or the structure of sleep.

01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:27.940
It can cause a lot of
people, including me,

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.700
to fall asleep very fast,

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.440
sleep very deeply for three or four hours,

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.320
and then wake up

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.830
and have a terrible time
falling back asleep.

01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:38.590
And that effect, at least for
me, can last several days.

01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:39.650
It's really disruptive.

01:42:39.650 --> 01:42:41.910
So I don't like to
supplement with anything

01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:45.600
that is directly dopamine
or a precursor to dopamine

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.110
at any time or directly serotonin

01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:49.480
or a precursor to serotonin.

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.490
Rather, there are other things

01:42:50.490 --> 01:42:53.050
that can enhance the
transition to sleep safely,

01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:54.730
which we will talk about in a few minutes.

01:42:54.730 --> 01:42:57.620
But the evening meal consists
largely of carbohydrates

01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:02.600
for that specific purpose of
generating a sense of calm.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.430
And, of course,
carbohydrates are delicious.

01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:07.020
And because I'm doing
some physical training

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.170
and presumably you are as
well, or I hope you are,

01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:12.040
'cause it's so beneficial to one's health,

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.800
that's also going to
replenish my glycogen stores,

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.100
which is one of the primary fuel sources

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:18.560
for moving one's muscles

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.970
and moving around and doing exercise,

01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:22.660
as well as for the brain
and for cognitive function.

01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:26.360
So low carbohydrates
throughout the 24-hour period

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.430
are not something that
are attractive to me.

01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:30.810
I realized that some
people will do much better

01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:32.960
on a low-carbohydrate
or even ketogenic diet,

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.490
but for me, and I do
believe for most people,

01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:40.150
creating a situation of maybe fasting,

01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:42.530
and then low-carb or no-carb diets

01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:45.210
for states of alertness and focus

01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:46.700
at one portion of the day,

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:49.640
and then ingesting starchy carbohydrates

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.140
for sake of inducing
rest and relaxation is a

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:57.350
at least scientifically,
rationally-based protocol.

01:43:57.350 --> 01:44:00.030
It's grounded in real neurochemistry.

01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:03.097
It's grounded in things that
we can point to and say,

01:44:03.097 --> 01:44:08.097
"Ah, this food substance, this
thing can support my brain,

01:44:08.170 --> 01:44:10.370
not directly because
it's some magic substance

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:12.820
that's going to make all
my neurons, you know,

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.110
extremely robust, but rather
it's going to support sleep,"

01:44:16.110 --> 01:44:19.180
which is perhaps the
foundation of all mental

01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:20.013
and physical health.

01:44:20.013 --> 01:44:23.530
In fact, we can point to
sleep as the primary way

01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:25.430
in which we can ensure our overall health,

01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:27.130
including our brain health.

01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:30.360
So let's talk about sleep
and how to access sleep,

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.830
how to fall asleep easily,

01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:33.780
and how to make sure
that the sleep we have is

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.770
of sufficient duration and quality.

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:39.930
One way to do that is to
leverage the drop in temperature

01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:43.030
that's necessary to fall and stay asleep.

01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:46.470
So I mentioned earlier in the early parts

01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:48.400
of the day after waking,

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.000
our body temperature is rising,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.190
and that continues throughout the day.

01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:52.920
And then sometime late in the afternoon,

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.410
our temperature peaks,

01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:56.780
and then it starts to drop.

01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:00.140
That drop in temperature
of one to three degrees

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.900
is vitally important for us to be able

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.343
to fall asleep easily.

01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:06.700
One way that we can
decrease our transition time

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:10.730
into sleep is to accelerate
that drop in temperature.

01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:12.440
And one way to accelerate that drop

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.810
in temperature somewhat
counter-intuitively is

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:18.890
to use hot baths, hot showers,

01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:21.200
or if you have access to one, a sauna.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.947
Now, this is counterintuitive
because you'd say,

01:45:22.947 --> 01:45:25.410
"Well, hot bath, so it's
going to heat me up."

01:45:25.410 --> 01:45:28.060
But actually, if you
are to get into a sauna

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:30.730
or a hot shower or hot
bath, and then get out,

01:45:30.730 --> 01:45:33.700
your body is going to
engage particular mechanisms

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.849
for cooling itself off that are going

01:45:35.849 --> 01:45:38.810
to allow you to drop your
temperature more quickly

01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:40.377
and fall asleep more easily.

01:45:40.377 --> 01:45:41.990
And this is why many people find

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:44.220
that falling asleep after
a nice hot shower, bath,

01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:49.110
or sauna is really, really
easy and really terrific.

01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:50.680
It's sort of a natural state

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.740
that follows hot baths,
saunas, and showers.

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:54.780
So how would you do this?

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:58.070
Well, we did an entire
episode on this topic as well.

01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:00.210
The use of sauna for sake
of growth hormone release.

01:46:00.210 --> 01:46:02.140
If you want to check that
out in all the details,

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.980
you can look at the
episode on growth hormone.

01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:09.110
You will experience a growth
hormone release from sauna,

01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:10.280
hot bath, and hot shower,

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.600
provided they're done
for sufficient duration

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.900
and sufficiently high temperature.

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:16.040
For all the details of that,

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:17.270
please go to that episode.

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:19.120
It's all laid out there,
it's all timestamped,

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.890
it's all captioned in English
and Spanish, et cetera.

01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:23.040
But basically what we're talking

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.400
about is 20 minutes in the sauna,

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.160
or if you're one of those folks

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.080
who's really chasing
growth hormone release,

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.320
you could do 20 minutes,

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.010
then get out of the sauna for 10 minutes,

01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:33.700
and just cool off at room temperature,

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.950
and then get back into
the sauna, then get out,

01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:39.403
and then shower, dry off, and head to bed.

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.710
Shorter bouts of sauna will work also.

01:46:43.710 --> 01:46:45.930
The longer bouts of sauna, cooling, sauna,

01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:48.120
cooling have been shown
to lead to huge increases

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:48.953
in growth hormone.

01:46:48.953 --> 01:46:49.790
And growth hormone, of course,

01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:51.760
is involved both in muscle growth,

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.060
but also growth and
metabolism of all tissues,

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:57.670
fat metabolism, and
repair of various tissues.

01:46:57.670 --> 01:46:58.900
So it's not just about growth.

01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:00.820
You hear growth hormone,
you think hypertrophy,

01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:03.030
but the enhancement of
metabolism and health

01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.080
and repair in a number of tissues.

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.690
So that's one way you can leverage heat

01:47:07.690 --> 01:47:10.700
toward the transition to sleep by the ways

01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:14.070
in which exposure to heat
actually cools off your body.

01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:16.020
Now let's talk about
actually getting to sleep.

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.838
And let's talk about
behavioral protocols first.

01:47:18.838 --> 01:47:20.380
It is absolutely true that keeping

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:22.660
the room very dark is beneficial.

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.900
Some people, including myself,

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.670
have thin eyelids and it
doesn't take much light

01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:28.830
to wake up the brain and body.

01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:31.300
So keeping a room very dark is essential.

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:33.260
The other thing is keeping the room cool.

01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:34.490
You've probably heard this before.

01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:36.883
Keep the room cool, get
under warm blankets,

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.980
but rarely is it discussed why keeping

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:41.730
the room cool is useful.

01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:44.550
The reason keeping the room cool is useful

01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:47.420
for getting into and
staying asleep is that

01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:48.960
throughout the night,

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.250
there are phases of sleep
where you are paralyzed,

01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:53.840
so-called REM sleep,
that's a healthy paralysis,

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.010
presumably so you can't
act out your dreams,

01:47:56.010 --> 01:47:57.870
but there are portions of
the night where you can move.

01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.260
And one of the more important movements

01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:02.350
that you do in the middle of
the night is put your hand

01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:05.500
out or your foot out or
you take your face out

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:08.610
from under the covers as
a means to cool yourself,

01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:10.470
and you do this while you are asleep.

01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:13.090
If you are in a cool room,

01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:15.890
you can put yourself under
the blankets to stay warm,

01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:17.890
and then if you want to cool off,

01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:19.660
you can simply remove a limb

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.683
or you can toss the covers off entirely.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:25.850
However, if you are in
a room that's too warm,

01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:28.020
it's very hard to cool off.

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:29.860
You would need a bucket of ice water

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:32.210
or to get up and turn
on the air conditioning

01:48:32.210 --> 01:48:34.330
or something of that
sort or turn on the fan.

01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:37.080
So it's a simple but non-trivial way

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.870
in which we can improve our entrance

01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:41.800
to sleep and staying asleep.

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.970
So keep the room cool or cold
and get under warm blankets.

01:48:45.970 --> 01:48:48.160
And if you want to understand more

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.000
about why putting a hand out

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.560
or a foot out is valuable for cooling,

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.970
I did an episode on the role of cooling

01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:59.020
in something called "heat dumping"

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:02.757
or bringing he into the body
through the palms, the face,

01:49:02.757 --> 01:49:03.810
and the bottoms of the feet.

01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:08.270
You've got these portals,
these radiators, if you will,

01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:11.450
that allow us to bring heat
into the body and to dump heat.

01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:12.700
I don't want to go into the details now,

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.087
but that episode is entitled

01:49:14.087 --> 01:49:16.530
"Supercharge Your Exercise With Cold,"

01:49:16.530 --> 01:49:17.810
is based on work that was done

01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:20.580
by Craig Heller's lab
at Stanford University.

01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:23.060
Absolutely incredible data showing

01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:25.390
that the proper use of palmar cooling,

01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:27.080
so the palms or the upper half of the face

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:28.470
or the bottoms of the feet,

01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:32.390
can vastly, I mean vastly
increase the volume

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:34.480
of exercise that one can do

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.560
and still recover from that exercise

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.150
and derive benefits from it.

01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:41.190
But this method of cooling
for exercise is grounded

01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:43.910
in a basic physiological
function of our palms,

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.690
the bottoms of our feet, and our face,

01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:47.690
which is to dump heat

01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:50.230
or to allow cool to pass into the body.

01:49:50.230 --> 01:49:52.280
So that's why in the middle of the night,

01:49:53.130 --> 01:49:55.460
as long as you're not in REM
sleep, if you get too warm,

01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:58.570
you put your foot out or
you put your arms out.

01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:01.390
You're actually allowing
cooling of the body

01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:04.027
through what are called "AVAs,"

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.380
arteriovenous anastomosis
is the technical name,

01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:10.427
that are in the palms, the
upper half of the face,

01:50:10.427 --> 01:50:11.800
and the bottoms of the feet.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.100
And that's a very efficient
way to cool off your body,

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.000
so you do that subconsciously.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.870
Now, there are things that one can take

01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:21.350
to enhance the transition to sleep.

01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:24.900
I am not a fan of melatonin
for enhancing the transition

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:26.140
to sleep for a couple of reasons.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:28.460
One, dosages of melatonin are far too high

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:30.180
in most supplements.

01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:32.190
Melatonin can have some negative effects

01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:35.010
on the sex steroid hormones
testosterone and estrogen.

01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:37.180
That's a serious concern.

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.290
Third, melatonin's role during puberty

01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:42.170
or around puberty is to
suppress the onset of puberty.

01:50:42.170 --> 01:50:44.210
So that's concerning.

01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:45.880
I don't know that people
should be taking this hormone

01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.210
that has all these other effects.

01:50:48.210 --> 01:50:50.930
The other reason is that
melatonin will aid the transition

01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:52.087
to sleep, but it won't keep you asleep.

01:50:52.087 --> 01:50:53.860
And many people that take melatonin find

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.440
that they fall asleep more quickly,

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.640
but then they wake up
unable to fall back asleep.

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.690
Three compounds that
can be very beneficial

01:51:00.690 --> 01:51:02.580
for aiding the transition to sleep

01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:05.550
and for which there are
wide safety margins,

01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:07.140
although please do check
with your physician

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:11.120
before taking anything, are
specific forms of magnesium,

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.150
something called
"apigenin" and "theanine."

01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:15.790
Magnesium comes in many forms.

01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:18.050
Magnesium malate has been shown

01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:21.444
to improve recovery from
sore muscles, for instance.

01:51:21.444 --> 01:51:25.940
Magnesium citrate is an
excellent laxative, for instance,

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:29.193
Magnesium threonate,
that's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,

01:51:29.193 --> 01:51:34.100
threonate, and magnesium
bisglycinate have transporters

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.380
that allow them to cross

01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:36.790
the blood-brain barrier more readily

01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:38.320
than other forms of magnesium.

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:40.120
And there within the brain,

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:42.980
they promote the release of a
neurotransmitter called GABA,

01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:44.720
which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:47.610
which shuts off the
forebrain to some extent.

01:51:47.610 --> 01:51:48.640
It doesn't shut it off completely,

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.240
but it essentially shuts
down thinking, rumination,

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.880
planning, and in what we
call "executive function."

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.230
So for many people,

01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:59.870
taking 300 to 400 milligrams
of magnesium bisglycinate

01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:00.777
or magnesium threonate,

01:52:00.777 --> 01:52:03.560
and there I'm referring
to the elemental magnesium

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.510
for you aficionados,

01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:08.280
many people find that
doing that 30 to 60 minutes

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:11.250
before sleep can aid
them in falling asleep,

01:52:11.250 --> 01:52:14.100
can really help them fall
asleep faster and stay asleep.

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.490
Some people, however,

01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:18.600
achieve some gastrointestinal discomfort

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.630
from magnesium and
therefore should avoid it.

01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:24.290
Magnesium threonate and
magnesium bisglycinate

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.200
for many people work, however,

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.460
and when coupled with
apigenin and theanine,

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.880
provide a sort of synergy
or a sleep cocktail

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.430
that seems to be very effective

01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:38.730
in aiding the transition to sleep.

01:52:38.730 --> 01:52:42.670
So apigenin is the substance
that's found in chamomile.

01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:45.440
And 50 milligrams of
apigenin taken 30 minutes

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:48.240
before sleep can act as another way

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:51.530
to shut off the forebrain
and reduce rumination,

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:55.400
reduce anxiety, and allow
people to fall and stay asleep.

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.320
I did a podcast with Dr. Darya Rose.

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.080
She's got an excellent podcast

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:01.420
that I highly recommend you check out.

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.420
Covers a number of different
health, scientific,

01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:04.770
and other subjects.

01:53:04.770 --> 01:53:06.680
And she's a PhD in neuroscience,

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.320
terrific scientist, et cetera.

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.100
She's a big fan of apigenin, as am I.

01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:14.993
And then the third compound
is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.960
Theanine is a compound that
can also increase GABA,

01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:23.240
but also increases activation

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:24.970
of something called "chloride channels."

01:53:24.970 --> 01:53:26.350
Chloride channels are another way

01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:30.490
in which neurons turn themselves
off or turn each other off.

01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:32.020
Not turn each other off in the way

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:33.610
that we typically hear
like that turns me off,

01:53:33.610 --> 01:53:34.850
but turn them off and then shut them down.

01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:36.900
Lower their levels of activity.

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.990
So magnesium threonate or bisglycinate,

01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:43.480
apigenin, and theanine in
combination can be very effective

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.110
for aiding the transition to sleep.

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:47.750
And I realized that not everyone
wants to take supplements.

01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:49.650
I certainly am not pushing any of these.

01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:52.690
I would hope that everybody
be able to fall asleep easily

01:53:52.690 --> 01:53:54.710
and stay asleep for the duration of time

01:53:54.710 --> 01:53:57.110
that they want without
any supplemental help,

01:53:57.110 --> 01:53:59.450
but I do think it's important
to point out some things

01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:01.350
that lie somewhere between doing nothing

01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:02.880
and taking prescription drugs,

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.270
because many of the
prescription drugs associated

01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:08.520
with sleep, and you all
know what those are,

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:10.390
carry other side effects.

01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:13.500
They can create bad dreams,

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.150
often very disturbing dreams.

01:54:15.150 --> 01:54:17.700
They can be addictive or
at least habit forming.

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.680
They can create grogginess in the morning.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.810
Some are safer than others.

01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:22.530
There's a variety of them out there.

01:54:22.530 --> 01:54:25.530
But for those that want
to explore supplements

01:54:25.530 --> 01:54:26.680
and how they can impact sleep,

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.357
this combination of about 300,

01:54:28.357 --> 01:54:31.880
400 milligrams of magnesium
threonate or bisglycinate,

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.600
50 milligrams of apigenin,

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:36.310
and 100 to 200 milligrams
of theanine alone

01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:39.710
or in combination have been
beneficial to many people.

01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:41.290
And there are excellent studies

01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:42.590
to support those statements.

01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:44.950
Again, I suggest you go to examine.com

01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:47.000
and look up the Human Effect Matrix

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.180
for each of those compounds,

01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:49.490
and you can explore them.

01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:52.900
One of the more interesting
aspects to magnesium threonate

01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.790
and bisglycinate is that it seems

01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:57.090
to have some neuroprotective
effects as well.

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:58.240
There aren't many studies on it,

01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.830
but the few studies that are there point

01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:01.287
to the fact that magnesium threonate

01:55:01.287 --> 01:55:02.840
and magnesium bisglycinate can

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.840
also support neuron health
and neuron longevity,

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.000
which is just an added
bonus, in my opinion.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.330
Now, what if you wake up
in the middle of the night?

01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:12.530
This is a very common occurrence.

01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:15.650
And there are two general
themes around waking up

01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:16.760
in the middle of the night

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:20.410
that one can use tools to counteract.

01:55:20.410 --> 01:55:22.490
The first theme is if you're somebody

01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:24.640
who is tired in the evenings

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:27.350
and you're kind of pushing
yourself to stay awake,

01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:29.770
so you're going to the party
or you're pushing yourself

01:55:29.770 --> 01:55:32.280
to study or work when in fact you'd like

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.940
to get into bed at 8:30 or 9:00,

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:36.190
and then you're falling
asleep around 10:30, 11:00,

01:55:36.190 --> 01:55:37.777
and waking up at 2:30
or 3:00 in the morning

01:55:37.777 --> 01:55:39.890
and you can't fall back asleep,

01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:42.680
chances are that your melatonin pulse

01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:45.130
was initiated early in the night.

01:55:45.130 --> 01:55:48.040
So that melatonin pulse started probably

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.180
around 8:30 or 9:00,
but you're staying up,

01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:53.000
you're battling that melatonin.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.190
And then sometime around
2:30 or 3:00 in the morning,

01:55:57.190 --> 01:55:59.280
that melatonin is no longer present

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:01.150
at sufficiently high
levels in your bloodstream

01:56:01.150 --> 01:56:02.230
and you're waking up,

01:56:02.230 --> 01:56:04.373
you're getting your morning
cortisol pulse shifted

01:56:04.373 --> 01:56:07.343
into those wee hours of the morning.

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:09.940
You may not like this advice,

01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:11.460
but one of the things
that you can do to offset

01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.890
that is to simply go to bed earlier.

01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:15.290
By going to bed earlier,

01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:17.500
you're going to get the
longer duration of sleep.

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.160
But I realized that
there are social reasons

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.220
and work-related reasons why going

01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:24.180
to bed at 8:30 or 9:00 is
not necessarily beneficial

01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:25.640
to your life.

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:26.803
So in that case,

01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:29.540
you might be one of the rare individuals

01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:31.720
for whom getting a little
bit more bright light

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:33.640
in the evening could be a good thing.

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:37.010
So this would be around the
hours of 7:00 or 8:00 PM.

01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:40.810
And in that way, causing
that pulse in melatonin

01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:45.810
to be delayed because, again,
light inhibits melatonin.

01:56:45.810 --> 01:56:48.100
Now, the other thing
is many people wake up

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:50.250
in the middle of the
night because of anxiety

01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:52.540
or because they have to use the restroom.

01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.240
It's perfectly fine to flip on the lights,

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.440
but keep the lights dim.

01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:57.790
But if you flip on those lights,

01:56:57.790 --> 01:57:00.240
try and flip them off as soon as possible

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.020
and try and get back into bed.

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:03.767
And if you have trouble
falling asleep again

01:57:03.767 --> 01:57:05.470
and you absolutely need to sleep,

01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:07.100
that's where these NSDR,

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:08.760
these non-sleep deep rest protocols,

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.130
can really be beneficial,

01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:13.330
even though the NS, the non-sleep part,

01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:15.980
might make you think that
they will prevent you

01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:17.300
from falling asleep.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.990
Rather than trying to fight your mind,

01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:21.840
trying to fight anxiety,

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.390
which is always a terrible thing to do,

01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:24.310
I always say it's very hard

01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:26.440
to control the mind with
the mind, look to the body.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.510
And that's what NSDR scripts do.

01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:29.640
Things like yoga nidra,

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.460
even the sleep hypnosis done
in the middle of the night

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:35.190
if you wake up and want
to fall back asleep

01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:39.210
oftentimes will help you
fall back asleep immediately.

01:57:39.210 --> 01:57:40.240
And if they don't,

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.050
they will at least put your brain and body

01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:43.950
into a state of deep relaxation

01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:46.210
that more closely mimics the sleep state

01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:47.043
that you ought to be in

01:57:47.043 --> 01:57:48.970
than the awake, ruminating,

01:57:48.970 --> 01:57:51.530
stressing about the fact that
you're not sleeping state.

01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:53.280
So if you wake up in
the middle of the night,

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.040
really try and get back to sleep.

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:57.960
And if you can't do that
by doing, for instance,

01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.350
long exhale breathing, which can work,

01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:04.060
use some other tool of the
body to shift the mind.

01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:06.130
And the tools that I'm recommending are

01:58:06.130 --> 01:58:08.490
of the non-sleep deep rest variety.

01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:11.530
So now we've essentially
traveled around the clock,

01:58:11.530 --> 01:58:14.440
so to speak, from the
time where one wakes up

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.010
until the time they start working,

01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:20.440
until the time they exercise, eat lunch,

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:24.580
do an NSDR, head to sleep,
get to sleep, maybe wake up,

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:27.130
get back to sleep, et cetera.

01:58:27.130 --> 01:58:28.990
I want to emphasize that,

01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:30.450
although people's schedules vary,

01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:33.130
most people are doing more than one

01:58:33.130 --> 01:58:34.570
or two work bouts per day.

01:58:34.570 --> 01:58:36.640
And indeed, I'm doing more than one

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.170
or two work bouts per day.

01:58:38.170 --> 01:58:41.160
I really emphasize that
morning, 90-minute work block

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.180
because I think most people would agree

01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:46.490
that there's a portion of each day

01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:48.660
in which we need to do the hardest thing

01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.410
or the most important thing

01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:53.993
or the thing that demands the
most of our cognitive self.

01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:56.390
I position that early in the day

01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:58.680
and I position everything around that

01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.720
in order to ensure that it happens

01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:03.650
and that it happens with the
highest degree of efficiency,

01:59:03.650 --> 01:59:06.030
and yes, I make sure that
it happens every day.

01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:08.880
And that brings about two
other important points.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:12.420
First of all, we do have
this thing called weekends,

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:16.100
and I tend to take one day
off per week, not both,

01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:20.000
much to the dismay of people
in my life and Costello.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.050
But nonetheless, there is
something called weekend drift,

01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:26.550
which is that we can be very regimented

01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:28.030
on a Monday or a Tuesday,

01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:29.980
and then even if we're good

01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:32.050
about maintaining a schedule
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:35.450
et cetera, most of us, I would hope,

01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:37.830
would alter their schedule
somewhat on the weekends

01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:40.930
in order to recover and
get some additional rest.

01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:43.520
And I want to emphasize
I absolutely do that.

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:46.560
I take one day per week
where I go full Costello,

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:49.170
where I essentially do
nothing in a structured way.

01:59:49.170 --> 01:59:52.180
At least if I have my way,
I'm not making any plans,

01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:55.240
I'm completely free to
explore what I want to do

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.540
and when I want to do it.

01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:57.830
That's not the way life works out.

01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:59.450
Oftentimes there are social engagements

01:59:59.450 --> 02:00:01.530
and other things that get in the way

02:00:01.530 --> 02:00:04.390
or that I enjoy and
that breaks up the day,

02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:06.290
but I do take rest.

02:00:06.290 --> 02:00:07.790
I don't think that one has

02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:09.880
to follow the same
schedule every single day;

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:11.640
however, I do think there are a few things

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:15.290
that people should do every
single day, if possible,

02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:18.330
and those are get morning sunlight,

02:00:18.330 --> 02:00:20.150
because if you don't
your circadian rhythms

02:00:20.150 --> 02:00:21.110
and your health, et cetera,

02:00:21.110 --> 02:00:23.480
and your mood are going to start to drift,

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.870
and to try and get sleep
on a regular basis.

02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:29.080
And, of course, some of
the greatest of things

02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:31.360
in life happen after 10:00 PM

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.980
and some of those even
involve sleepless nights

02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:36.040
of various kinds.

02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.750
I certainly don't want
to discourage people

02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:39.140
from having a social life

02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:41.610
or from having a robust party life,

02:00:41.610 --> 02:00:44.770
if that's your thing, or for enjoying life

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:47.400
because that's certainly
one of the main things

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:49.850
that we should all be
pursuing, is to enjoy life.

02:00:50.970 --> 02:00:53.040
The only point I want
to make about sleep is

02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.400
that if you happen to stay up late,

02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.210
it's still best to get up at
your regular wake-up time.

02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:01.330
It's a very simple solution to a problem

02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:02.560
that a lot of people have,

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.370
which is they stay up till
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,

02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:05.770
and then they tend to sleep late,

02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:07.810
and then it tends to disrupt their rhythm.

02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:11.090
Try on most days and most nights

02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:13.150
to wake up at more or less the same time

02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:15.970
and try to go to sleep at
more or less the same time.

02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:18.900
In fact, I was talking to Matt
Walker about this recently,

02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:21.340
and he was also surprised
to see these new data

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.910
and I was surprised to see these new data

02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:25.900
that emphasize that if you
get a poor night's sleep

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:29.120
or if you're up late the
previous night for good reasons,

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:30.240
many people feel like they just

02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.070
want to go to bed early the next night,

02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:34.520
but it turns out that's
not the best thing to do

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.590
for your immediate and long-term health.

02:01:36.590 --> 02:01:37.880
Try and stay up to the point

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.570
where you would normally stay up,

02:01:39.570 --> 02:01:40.420
and then get to sleep.

02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:42.170
If you go to bed a couple hours earlier,

02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:43.420
it's probably not going to kill you,

02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:46.930
but try to not go to bed,
for instance, at 6:00 PM,

02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:48.600
because you were up the
entire night before.

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:50.870
That can really be disruptive.

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:52.250
The other thing I want to emphasize is

02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:55.900
that even though that morning,
90-minute work block is

02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:59.480
so vital, of course,
there's a second work block.

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.680
And in fact, I described one

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.660
in the afternoon after the NSDR.

02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:04.840
For me, that's Reveri hypnosis.

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.660
There's a 90-minute work block

02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:11.350
in which I drop in again in
a no internet connection,

02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:14.500
no phone kind of way to complete some work

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:15.690
that's important to me.

02:02:15.690 --> 02:02:18.210
So combined, that's just
three hours of focused work,

02:02:18.210 --> 02:02:20.220
which may not seem like a lot,

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:22.180
but if you were to dissect your day

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:24.800
and kind of look at the arc
and structure of your day,

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.810
I'd be willing to bet that

02:02:27.690 --> 02:02:30.100
if we added up the total period of time

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:33.800
in which you were in what Cal
Newport would call deep work,

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.620
really focused, dedicated work,

02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:39.100
that it would probably amount
to about three or four hours.

02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.100
If you can squeeze in
another 90-minute work block

02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:44.750
or if you can get four
90-minute work blocks,

02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:45.860
well, then more power to you,

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.690
but I think most people find that one

02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:51.600
or two of these really deep
focus, 90-minute work blocks are

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:55.410
about what one's schedule
and even mind can handle.

02:02:55.410 --> 02:02:56.970
And, of course, throughout the day,

02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:58.470
there are other things happening.

02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:00.870
Outside of those 90-minute work blocks,

02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:03.390
I'm checking my text messages,
I'm checking my email,

02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:05.100
I'm responding to various demands.

02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:08.040
I'm working and tending to life.

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:11.100
So while I've carved some boundaries

02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.610
or delineated some boundaries
around those work blocks,

02:03:13.610 --> 02:03:15.550
and I'm certain that if you do too,

02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:16.850
you will benefit from them,

02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:19.670
they are certainly not the
only periods of time each day

02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:22.350
in which I or I believe
other people should be trying

02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:24.270
to learn or trying to focus.

02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:26.740
And I want to emphasize
that even though my job is

02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:29.660
to discover knowledge
and distribute knowledge

02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:30.700
because I'm a scientist,

02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:33.410
I realized that 90-minute
work blocks of the sort

02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:37.010
that I'm describing may
not apply specifically

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:37.960
to the kinds of work you do.

02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.580
If you're an artist or a sculptor

02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:41.230
or you build furniture,

02:03:41.230 --> 02:03:42.230
whatever it is that you happen to,

02:03:42.230 --> 02:03:44.180
you teach children or they teach you,

02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:45.930
whatever it happens to be,

02:03:45.930 --> 02:03:50.390
of course, please adapt and
modify what I've described today

02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:52.820
in ways that best serve
you and your schedule.

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:55.610
What I've tried to do
is provide you a picture

02:03:55.610 --> 02:03:58.530
of the 24- hour schedule that I follow

02:03:58.530 --> 02:04:01.760
and why I do certain
things at particular times

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.690
and why I do those particular things.

02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:06.530
And I've really tried to
emphasize the scientific rationale

02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:09.320
behind those things,
the peer-reviewed data.

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.460
In some cases, I pointed
out the specific papers.

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.290
In other cases, I've referred
to large bodies of work

02:04:14.290 --> 02:04:16.110
that support these practices.

02:04:16.110 --> 02:04:17.990
When I say "large bodies of work,"

02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:21.080
I'm a big fan of looking to
the scientific literature

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:23.970
and asking, "Where is the center of mass

02:04:23.970 --> 02:04:25.760
for a particular topic?"

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:30.760
For instance, where is there
50 or 100 or 1,000 papers

02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:34.220
that, for instance, support
morning light viewing

02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:38.930
in order to optimize melatonin
secretion in the day,

02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:41.000
cortisol secretion early in the day,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.180
mood, metabolism, et cetera?

02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:46.990
If one were to put into
PubMed "light, metabolism,

02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:50.590
and mood," you would literally
get tens of thousands,

02:04:50.590 --> 02:04:52.410
maybe even hundreds of
thousands of studies.

02:04:52.410 --> 02:04:53.750
So when I say the center of mass,

02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:57.000
what I've really tried to
do is examine the literature

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.970
and figure out where there's
sort of a directive protocol

02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:02.970
that emerges from all
these various studies

02:05:02.970 --> 02:05:05.160
that used, you know,
in some cases, animals,

02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.870
in many cases, humans
and explored different,

02:05:07.870 --> 02:05:09.880
what we call, "dependent variables."

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.960
Some studies were looking
at effects on blood sugar,

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:13.370
other on mood.

02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:16.580
So I hope that makes
clear why the rationale

02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:18.320
behind what I provided today.

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.700

During today's episode,

02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:04.860
I described various supplements

02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:07.000
that one might want to consider taking.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.360
We've partnered with Thorne,

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.820
that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com,

02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:12.570
because Thorne supplements are known

02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:15.760
to be of the very highest
stringency and quality.

02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:17.210
When I say stringency and quality,

02:06:17.210 --> 02:06:20.110
that means the quality of
the individual ingredients,

02:06:20.110 --> 02:06:23.380
as well as the amounts of those
ingredients match precisely

02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.320
with what's listed on the packaging.

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.900
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I personally take,

02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:32.650
you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman.

02:06:32.650 --> 02:06:34.850
And there, you'll see all of
the supplements that I take,

02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:37.750
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:40.700
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.
