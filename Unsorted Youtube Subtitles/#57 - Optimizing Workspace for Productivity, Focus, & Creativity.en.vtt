00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.387
for everyday life.

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:09.210
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.770
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.060
Today, we're going to talk
all about how to optimize

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.890
your workspace for maximum productivity.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.810
Indeed, that means to
heighten levels of focus,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.110
to increase levels of creativity,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.510
to improve your ability to task switch.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.020
And this could be for sake
of school or for work,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.290
creative endeavors, personal endeavors,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.120
this really extends to everybody.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.290
Most often when we hear about how to focus

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.060
or how to get the most
out of our work sessions,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.530
we hear about the biology
and the psychology of that.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.960
We hear about dopamine and
we hear about serotonin

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.420
and we hear about caffeine.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.470
And indeed, those are topics
that I've covered a lot

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.130
on The Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.770
Today, we will touch on each of those,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
but we are mainly going
to focus on how we arrange

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.070
our physical environment and
indeed how we arrange ourselves

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.600
in that physical environment,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.730
in order to bring out the
best in our neurobiology.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.510
That is how to put ourselves

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.240
into a heightened state of
focus by virtue of things,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.660
as simple as where we place our
screen, relative to our eyes

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.930
at a given time of day.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.150
Believe it or not, there's
excellent research on this,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.920
and there's excellent
research for instance,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.320
on whether or not you should
or should not listen to music,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.040
whether or not you should use
things like binaural beats,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.330
and if so, what frequency
of binaural beats.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.750
We are going to cover all
of that, and by the end,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.720
you'll have a checklist
of things that you can do

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.922
to optimize your workspace on any budget.

00:01:30.922 --> 00:01:33.030
I will mention various products and apps

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.470
that some of you might find useful

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.540
for optimizing your workspace.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.450
But I want to emphasize at
the outset that none of those

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.970
that I mentioned are any products or apps

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.920
that we have a financial relationship to.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.400
And more importantly, you don't need them.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.190
I'm going to explain how for zero cost,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.090
you can arrange your workspace in ways

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.380
that makes you maximally
productive, maximally focus

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.670
and allows you to adapt your workspace

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.600
to different environments,
whether or not you're traveling,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.190
working with others,
working alone, et cetera.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.430
Just to give you a little
hint of where we are going,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.150
I will mention a zero
cost app that will deliver

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.380
binaural beats at a particular frequency

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.260
that peer-reviewed research
has shown can enhance

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.920
certain types of learning and memory.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.450
However, peer-reviewed research also shows

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.010
that it can diminish performance
in other types of tasks.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.090
So stay tuned, we'll
go into all the details

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.250
so that you can optimize
your workspace for zero cost

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.940
and get the most out of
your efforts and endeavors.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.530
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.320
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.400
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.950
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.570
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.500
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.720
Our first sponsor is LMNT.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.490
LMNT is an electrolyte drink

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.380
that has everything you need

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.710
and none of the things you don't.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.980
And when we say everything you
need, the main one is salt.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.800
Now, salt, aka sodium
has kind of a bad rap.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.360
We've all heard that too
much salt is bad for us.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.100
However, if you look into
the research on salt,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.290
and in fact, if you go to
one of the highest level,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.540
peer-reviewed scientific
publications, Science Magazine,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.820
you can find a review article
in science some years ago

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.060
that shows that most of
what we think and understand

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.430
about the science of
salt is completely wrong.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.260
And in fact, salt does a number of things

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.430
that's extremely important.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.640
For instance, our neurons,
which signal to one another

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.240
through electricity and
through chemical signaling,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.210
critically rely on having enough sodium

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.350
in order to generate what
we call action potentials

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.900
or electrical firing of neurons.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.370
If your sodium levels are too low,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.330
your neurons simply won't work.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.160
One of the main deficits
from being dehydrated

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.560
is lack of sodium, not just lack of water.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.370
Getting sufficient sodium
does a number of things

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.860
that's very important, it
can raise your blood volume,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.810
it can help you retain
water in a healthy way,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.920
not excess amounts.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.300
It allows neurons to fire
for sake of thinking,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.580
for sake of athletic
performance, and so on.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.400
Other electrolytes that are in LMNT

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.440
are things like magnesium and potassium,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.510
which are also essential
for neuronal function,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.970
and indeed all organ function.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.280
LMNT has a lot of salt, some magnesium

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.310
and some potassium, so
unless you're somebody

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.090
who really has chronic hypertension,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.070
elevating your level of salt
intake can often be beneficial.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.290
You should check with your doctor,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.670
but indeed it can often be beneficial.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.350
LMNT contains a science-backed
electrolyte ratio

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.060
of a 1,000 milligrams,
that's one gram of sodium,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.620
200 milligrams of potassium
and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.840
It tastes delicious, I
happen to like the raspberry

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.250
or citrus flavors, in fact,
I like all of the flavors.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.600
Put in some water, you
can make it as dense,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.800
meaning as high concentration as you like.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.690
So some people will put it
in eight ounces of water.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.420
I like mine in about 16 ounces of water

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.540
and I'll drink that
before and after exercise.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.490
And I usually will have
another one throughout the day,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.910
just sip on it as I'm
doing work and so forth.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.130

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.030
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.340
now referred to as AG1.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.410
I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.770
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.157
The reason I started taking AG1

00:05:15.157 --> 00:05:18.180
and the reason I still take
AG1 once or twice a day

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.650
is that it helps me meet all
of my foundational vitamin,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.250
mineral and probiotic needs.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.360
And when people ask me,
what's the one supplement

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.840
I should take, if they were
to only take one supplement,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.810
I always recommend AG1.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.550
For the simple reason that the vitamins,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.510
the minerals and the probiotic
support metabolic health,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.420
they support endocrine health,
they support brain health

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.430
and the probiotics and prebiotics
in there in particular,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.760
support the so-called gut-brain axis.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.810
There is now a plethora of
data supporting the fact

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.010
that when we have a
healthy gut microbiome,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.470
that has little microbes
that live in our gut,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.230
that are good for us, our
gut signals to our brain

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.390
and our brain signals back to
our gut, in ways that support

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.580
our immune system, our
digestion, even our mood.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.140
They can even support healthy
levels of dopamine signaling,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.300
an important molecule for motivation

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.800
and high levels of mood or positive mood.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.160
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.020

to claim a special offer.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.490
They'll give you five free
travel packs plus a year supply

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.470
of vitamin D3 K2.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.350
Vitamin D3 K2 has been
shown to be important

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.180
for metabolic health, endocrine health

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.030
and K2 in particular for heart health

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.640
and regulating appropriate
amounts of calcium in your bones.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.170

to claim the special offer.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.203
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Theragun.

00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:35.190
Theragun is a handheld percussive device

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.590
that releases deep muscle tension.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.420
I was first introduced to
Theragun on a shark diving trip.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.960
We were way out in the Pacific,
filming great white sharks

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.660
for my laboratory where we study fear,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.580
and everyone was diving all day,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.430
carrying what are called Pelican cases,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.200
which aren't actual pelicans with wings,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.570
but cases for these cameras.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.970
They're very heavy,
removing things all day,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.780
we're working really hard,
and we got really sore.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.510
I got particularly sore from
all that physical labor.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.880
Someone brought a Theragun along,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.160
I'd never seen one of these
things before or tried one

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.190
and I spent the rest of the
trip trying to get as much time

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.490
with the Theragun as I could,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.740
at least when I was on board the boat.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.870
With Theragun, you can
get what is effectively

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.720
a deep tissue massage to
any area of your body,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.380
and you can just do that
for minutes or hours

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.250
for as long as you like,
it's really wonderful.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.140
If you have someone else there,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.180
who's willing to use the
Theragun on hard to reach places

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.270
like your back, that's even better.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.710
Whether or not you want
to treat muscle tension

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.500
from working out and injury
or just deal with daily stress

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.710
from everyday life, there's
really no substitute

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.543
for the Theragun.

00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:34.230
You know, professional
massage is wonderful,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.190
but a professional
massage of course involves

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.519

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.080
Let's talk about workspace optimization.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.490
This is a topic that's intrigued
me for a very long time

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.670
because my undergraduate
advisor, my graduate advisor

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.050
and my postdoc advisor
had many things in common,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.700
including being great
scientists, being kind people

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.300
and terrific mentors, but they
had another thing in common,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.130
which always perplexed me,
which is that their offices

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.220
were a complete disaster.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.560
They had mountains of
books, mountains of papers,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.410
mountains of all sorts of stuff.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.420
And yet all of them were
extremely productive

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.280
and could remain extremely focused

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.760
in that incredibly cluttered environment.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.420
Now I'm somebody who doesn't like clutter,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.090
I find it very hard to focus
in cluttered environments.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.040
And indeed there's tremendous
variation among people

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.760
as to whether or not
they can remain focused

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.180
or whether or not they struggle to focus

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.540
in physically cluttered environments.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.220
There's no right or wrong to this,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.480
but the question we should ask ourselves

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.170
is why were they all
able to be so focused?

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.650
And it turns out that
the reason they were able

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.560
to be so focused is that
they all captured one single

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.120
and yet fundamental variable
of workspace optimization.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.260
And we'll talk about
what that variable is.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.080
In fact, where you're to talk
about what all the variables

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.320
of optimizing a workspace
are things like vision,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.810
things like light, things
like noise in the room,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.380
whether or not you listen to music or not,

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.870
whether or not you use noise
canceling headphones or not.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.890
We're going to talk about all of that

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.010
and we're going to do that in a way

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.670
that you can optimize your workspace,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.670
regardless of whether
or not you are at home,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.810
whether or not you're
on the road, et cetera.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.210
Because the last thing
I would ever want to do

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.610
is to create a situation where you find

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.410
the optimal workspace,
and then you are a slave

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.640
to that optimal workspace.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.110
That's just not the way the world works.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.950
What you want to do or
my goal for you rather,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.870
is that you will have a
short checklist of things

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.860
that you can look to, anytime
you sit down to do work,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.350
and you can think about
the underlying variables

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.500
that impact your brain and your body

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.380
and allow your brain and body
to get into the optimal state

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.200
in order to learn, in
order to be productive

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.570
and indeed to move through your
work bouts in a very relaxed

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.750
and pleasureful way
while maintaining focus

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.623
and while pursuing any
of the number of things

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:02.730
that you're doing.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.900
The first variable we want to think about

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.340
in terms of workspace
optimization is vision and light.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.410
On a previous episode of
The Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.600
devoted all to habits, I
talked about the importance

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.170
of dividing your 24 hour day
into three different phases.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.370
And for those of you that
haven't heard that episode,

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.423
I'm just going to briefly
summarize what I described.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.040
From the time you wake up in
the morning until about six

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.290
or seven or eight,
sometimes nine hours later,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.200
your brain is in a unique state.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.260
It is in a state of
high levels of dopamine,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.150
a neuromodulator, and
high levels of epinephrin,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.860
as well as hormones like
cortisol and so forth.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.130
Without going into the
biology of those things,

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.960
they set your brain into
a state of high alertness.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.570
And this is true, whether or not

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.760
you indulge in caffeine or not.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.840
I know some of you say, oh,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.490
I really don't wake up
until the afternoon,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.310
I'm much more alert and
focused in the afternoon.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.810
We will talk about that phase

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.400
of the 24 hour day in a moment.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.150
But that early part of
the day is a time of day

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.083
in which for sake of
workspace optimization,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.560
being in a brightly lit
environment can lend itself

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.780
to optimal work throughout the day,

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.620
not just during that early phase.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.470
And so while on many
episodes of this podcast,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.300
I've also emphasized the
importance of getting

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.670
morning sunlight in your eyes

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.533
within 30 to 60 minutes of waking,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.530
not as often, but now, and
again, I will also mention

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.170
that it's important to light
your daytime environment

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.550
as brightly as you safely can.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.270
So if you are going to be
doing work in this early,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.670
what I call phase one portion of your day,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.820
you want to have as much light and indeed

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.657
as much overhead light shining
on you as safely possible.

00:11:42.657 --> 00:11:45.700
And of course you don't want
it so bright that it's glaring

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.240
and you have to squint, et cetera,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.070
but you want as much light
as is safely possible.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.050
And you can do that a
couple of simple ways.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.570
One is if do own or
you're in an environment,

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.550
we have overhead lights, turn
on those overhead lights.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.820
What's special about overhead
lights for setting alertness

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.370
is that the neurons in
our eyes, which are called

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.230
melanopsin ganglion cells,
that's the fancy name.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.490
Melanopsin ganglion
cells are mainly enriched

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.212
in the lower half of
our retinas in our eyes

00:12:13.212 --> 00:12:15.780
and view the upper visual field.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.310
Those neurons send little wires to an area

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.730
of our hypothalamus, right
above the roof of our mouth,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.330
that creates a state of alertness.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.230
Now, early in the day, we want
to be as alert as possible.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.430
And this phase one of our circadian cycle

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.440
is when we are best at doing
analytic detailed type work.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.760
So we're going to go into other aspects

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.890
of workspace optimization that
are important for phase one,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.500
but during phase one, again,
within zero to about eight

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.880
or nine hours after waking, bright lights

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.670
in your environment, in
particular overhead lights,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.650
are going to facilitate focus,
they're going to facilitate

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.000
further release of things like
dopamine and norepinephrine

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.940
and healthy amounts of cortisol.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.060
And we want that to
happen early in the day

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.460
for a variety of reasons.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.180
For instance, we don't
want that cortisol peak

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.050
to happen too late in the day.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.300
That's actually associated
with depression and insomnia

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.380
and a number of things
that we just don't want.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.980
So one of the things that
I've done for my workspace

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.130
is to make sure that when
I wake up in the morning,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.660
I do go get my sunlight.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.370
If the sun isn't out, I turn on

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.660
as many bright artificial
lights as I can manage

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.370
or tolerate, and then I go
get my sunlight exposure.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.500
But once I set out to do some work

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.920
that all the overhead
lights in that room are on,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.120
as well as lights in front of me.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.220
And that's again to stimulate
heightened levels of focus

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.351
and further release of
these neuromodulators

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.040
that I mentioned before, dopamine,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.950
norepinephrine and epinephrine.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.300
Now the way that one could do that

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.430
could be a very low cost
way of having, for instance,

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.560
a desk lamp and those overhead lights.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.540
If you're somebody that wants to take this

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.930
to the next level, you can
purchase a ring light, which is,

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.880
I think those are mainly made for people

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.780
doing selfie type videos,
for Instagram posts

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.810
and things of that sort.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.730
Ring lights can be pretty cost-effective,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.310
and yet they're very bright and
they have the sort of bright

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.000
blue light that is going
to optimally stimulate

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.940
those melanopsin ganglion cells.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.210
So some people I know
will have a blue light

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.740
or a bright LED on their
desk in front of them.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.830
And indeed I have one of these,
I don't use a ring light,

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.520
I use a light pad.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.915
The particular light pad
I use, I bought on Amazon.

00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:13.560
I can mention the brand, but again,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.350
I have no financial affiliation to them,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.230
this is the Artograph Lightpad
is designed for drawing.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.060
And it says on it 930 lux,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.200
Lux is just a measure of brightness.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.050
So I place that on the desk in
front of me and I turn it on

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.430
essentially throughout
this phase one of the day.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.490
Even if I walk away from the
desk, I tend to keep it on,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.990
it doesn't consume that much energy.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.080
And in that way, I'm constantly
being bombarded with photons

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.080
that keep my levels of alertness up

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.280
because the early part of the day

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.750
is when I do the majority
of that focused work.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.240
Again, you don't need the light pad,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.160
you can use a ring light,
or you can simply use

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.390
any kind of other lights

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.570
that you might happen to
have artificial lights.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.150
For those of you that can
place your desk near a window,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.880
and even better to open the window,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.370
that would be really fantastic.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.340
I don't have access to that.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.910
Why would I say open the window?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.200
Well, it turns out that sunlight

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.580
is going to be the best stimulus
for waking up your brain

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.640
and body through this
melanopsin hypothalamus system.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.140
And by looking at
sunlight through a window,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.270
it's 50 times less effective
than if that window

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.900
were to be open, mostly because
those windows filter out

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.590
a lot of the wavelengths of blue light

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.020
that are essential for
stimulating the eyes

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.740
and this wake-up signal.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.490
So all of this has rests on the premise

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.200
that we need to be alert
in order to do our work,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.400
in particular focused work.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.350
And I've talked about before
in the Habits episode,

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.910
and I'm saying again now,
that first phase of the day,

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.640
that first seven or eight
or nine hours of the day

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.630
is really the time in
which our neurochemistry

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.750
is primed for getting the most amount

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.140
of focused kind of challenging work done

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.380
where a lot of precision
and detail is required.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.880
So you want to brightly
light your work environment

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.600
during that first phase, again,
from the time you wake up,

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.270
try and get sunlight, but
then even if you're going

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.630
to get exercise or do other things,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.150
you want to get as much
bright light in your eyes

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.300
as you safely can

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.960
and then you want to light
your work environment.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.630
Now in the afternoon,
starting at about nine

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.270
and continuing until about
16 hours after waking,

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.280
you want to start dimming the
lights in that environment.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.820
Now you don't want to make it dark

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.940
because you don't want to get sleepy

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.170
at two o'clock in the afternoon,

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.480
unless you're going to take a brief nap,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.000
which I do and is perfectly fine,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.700
as long as it doesn't interfere
with your nighttime sleep.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.890
But the idea is that in
this so-called phase two

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.050
of the 24 hour cycle from
about nine to 16 hours

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.100
after waking, you want to bring

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.890
the level of lights down a bit.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.960
And when I say down,
I literally mean down.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.700
Having lights that are
in front of you is fine,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.880
but overhead lights at that
time are not going to be optimal

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.760
for the sorts of neurochemical states

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.140
that your brain wants to be in.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.790
The states that I'm
referring to are a shift

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.510
from the dopamine and norepinephrine

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.210
that's highest early
in the day to increases

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.300
in things like serotonin
and other neuromodulators

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.670
that put your brain into
a state that's better

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.940
for creative endeavors or
for more abstract thinking.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.090
Now, as we'll soon see, there
are other things you can do

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.670
to improve creative thinking
and abstract thinking.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.476
And in fact, there are things you can do

00:17:08.476 --> 00:17:10.120
to improve analytic thing,
and we will talk about those,

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.490
things that are distinct from light,

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.300
but right now we're
just focusing on light.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.010
So what I recommend doing,
and what I personally do

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.820
is I will turn off overhead
lights in the afternoon.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.230
It's not completely dim,
it's not completely dark,

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.070
but I will start to reduce
the amount of overhead light

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.810
and just simply keep the light pad on

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.450
and whatever other lamps
I happen to be using.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.380
Now, one thing we haven't talked
about is screen brightness.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.990
This is highly individual,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.320
people have different
retinal sensitivities.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.690
What I mean by that is everybody differs

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.240
in terms of how bright they can tolerate

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.350
their visual environment and their screen.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.200
And whether or not you are
sensitive to light or not,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.470
will depend on a lot of factors.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.530
Some of it is eye color,

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.570
indeed people with darker color eyes

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.980
generally can tolerate more
bright light than others.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.540
I have green eyes, I am very,
very sensitive to light.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.380
If I'm outdoors at a cafe or something,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.450
and the table has any kind
of reflective properties

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.570
and it's a sunny day, I
can barely see the person

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.320
across the table from me,
unless I'm wearing sunglasses.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.120
Some people, other members
of my family for instance,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.130
have dark brown eyes
and can just sit there

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.930
and have a conversation without the need

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.630
for sunglasses at all.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.370
So that's, there's
tremendous variation there,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.470
one or the other isn't healthy
or advantageous necessarily,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.780
just understand that you never
want to be in an environment

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.280
where it's painful to maintain
looking at whatever it is

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.113
that you're looking at.

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.210
If something's painful to look at,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.460
it could be damaging to your eyes,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.470
so you do want to protect your eyes.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.350
Now, in this second phase of the day,

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.950
since most of us are working indoors,

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.770
but even if you're working outdoors,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.620
you want to try and get the
amount of light reduced overall,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.400
but in particular, that overhead light,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.400
and you also want to start reducing

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.650
the amount of blue light
that you're being exposed to.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.710
So somewhere around four or 5:00 pm,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.650
which for me is about 12
hours after I've been awake

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.530
or 14 hours after I've been awake,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.720
I will turn off that light
pad and start to transition

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.080
the lights in my environment
to more yellows and reds.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.490
Now, I can't always do this,
I have friends that actually

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.250
have converted their entire
homes from blue light

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.210
early in the day to red
light late in the day,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.809
that's really cool and
fantastic, I haven't done that.

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:15.300
There's a cost to doing
that and it is optimal

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.100
in terms of optimizing productivity
and sleep and so forth,

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.430
but it's not feasible for a lot of people.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.734
But what I do is I simply
switch to using yellow lamps.

00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:26.470
I will turn off that LED
in the later afternoon,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.990
again, around four or 5:00
pm, and I tend to wake up

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.930
around 6:00 am or so, I'll turn those off.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.720
And what I'll try and do also
is I'll try and dim the screen

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.790
that I'm working on so
that I can still manage

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.420
to see everything that I need to see,

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.500
but it's quite a bit dimmer
than it was early in the day.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.040
So that's phase two of the day,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.050
and that's how we want
to think about light.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.030
And then I'll just mention,
because I know there are people

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.700
who are working in the
middle of the night,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.533
there's phase three,

00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:53.860
which is about 17 to
24 hours after waking.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.480
And I realize that for
shift workers or for people

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.430
that are pulling all
nighters or for students,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.520
oftentimes you need to
be awake and studying

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.353
in the middle of the night.

00:20:01.353 --> 00:20:04.400
I, myself am somebody who
for years would pull anywhere

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.010
from five to 10 all-nighters per year.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.850
I still pull an all
nighter now, and again,

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.360
because of deadlines and so forth.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.320
I don't recommend it, if
you can avoid it, great,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.860
but many people just
simply have to do this

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.740
for sake of shift work or
because of impending deadlines

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.170
or procrastination or all of the above.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.380
If you are going to be doing
work in that third phase

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.760
of your circadian cycle,
you really want to limit

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.530
the amount of bright light that
you're getting in your eyes

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.130
to just the amount that
allows you to do the work

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.963
that you're doing.

00:20:31.963 --> 00:20:33.640
Because if you get light in your eyes,

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.300
that's any brighter than that,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.010
you're going to severely
deplete your melatonin levels.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.620
You're going to severely
shift your circadian clock

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.430
and it's effectively like
traveling to another time zone.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.580
So if you stay up from
3:00 am until 6:00 am

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.750
or 2:00 am until 4:00 am
working on a term paper

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.680
or something of that sort,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.620
and you're getting bright
light in your eyes,

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.480
you are effectively flying six hours

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.620
to a different time zone,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.560
or at least that's what
your body registers it as.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.497
And it can really throw your
sleep and your metabolism

00:21:00.497 --> 00:21:03.150
and a number of other things out of whack.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.250
Now there's an exception to this,

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.170
which is if you really want to be awake,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.700
it can often be beneficial
to flipping on all the lights

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.520
in the room and keeping
them really bright.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.900
One of the hardest things to
do is to stay up all night

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.670
studying when you're in a dim environment.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.630
So you have to determine the trade off

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.060
between whether or not you
want to shift your clock

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.870
or whether or not you
want to get the work done.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.310
And I would say the ideal
situation is to sleep at night

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.920
and to do your work during
the day and in the afternoon,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.600
but if you do have to be awake
in the middle of the night,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.770
do understand that you want
to dim those lights overall.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.400
You would not want to use that LED,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.200
you would not want to
have overhead lights on,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.360
unless you're really
struggling to stay awake,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.270
in which case you want to get

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.010
as many bright lights on as possible.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.720
So there are a couple of
tricks to all-nighters,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.350
I don't really want people
pulling all-nighters

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.223
unless they have to, but
there are a few things

00:21:46.223 --> 00:21:48.890
that you can do without taking stimulants

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.470
in order to stay up all
night, that can be beneficial

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.600
that maximize on your biology.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.830
One of them that's a
little less commonly known

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.180
is you can drink 32
ounces of water and commit

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.470
to not going to the bathroom
for 90 minutes, at least.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.900
It turns out that there is a circuit

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.150
that goes from your
bladder, literally neurons

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.290
that go from your
bladder to your brainstem

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.367
and when you have to urinate,
it makes you very alert.

00:22:11.367 --> 00:22:13.250
And as many of you have
probably experienced,

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.250
this is actually what wakes us up

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.430
in the middle of the night when
we have to use the bathroom

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.090
is this circuit for alertness
that goes from full bladder,

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.810
it's signaled by the bladder
being full to the brainstem.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.840
And this is the circuit that is disrupted

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.720
in kids that have bedwetting issues.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.600
And there are a number of
cognitive behavioral approaches

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.200
to that, sometimes
bedwetting in very young kids

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.320
is because the circuit
hasn't developed yet.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.130
Most adults fortunately
are not bedwetting,

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.970
but you can increase the amount
of alertness in your system

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.400
and remain awake in the
middle of the night,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.080
by drinking a little bit more
water than you normally would

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.820
and then refraining from
going to the restroom,

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.530
that certainly will lend
itself to alertness.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.630
You know how difficult
it is to fall asleep

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.810
when you have to use the
restroom for instance.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:51.680
So that's one tool.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.870
The other thing is again, to
flip on as many bright lights

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.670
in the environment as possible.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.200
And then of course, people
will rely on stimulants

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.700
like caffeine or even more
aggressive stimulants.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.140
That's not something I
necessarily recommend,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.860
you'll each have to
determine that for you.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.370
But if you do in fact,
have to use all-nighters

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.280
for any reason, you can maximize

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.740
this bladder to brain approach
and the right light approach.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.900
So that more or less
covers how bright to keep

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.790
your overall environment and
how bright to keep your screen.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.540
If you really want to
get nerdy about this,

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.600
there is a free app called
Light Meter where you can start

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.110
measuring how many lux, how many photons

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.650
are in a given environment.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.420
It's actually measuring
reflectance of photons and so on,

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.760
if you can look up what a
Lux Meter does, if you like,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.350
I don't necessarily recommend doing that.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.840
I don't want to set a
critical threshold by which,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.580
for instance, we say,
once your environment

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.980
is more than 1,500 lux,
then it's too bright

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.710
or not bright enough, et cetera.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.600
Everyone has different
retinal sensitivities,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.730
everyone will find that
different levels of brightness

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.200
will cause them to be alert,
different levels of dimness,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.200
if you will, in the room will
cause them to feel sleepy.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.010
You really want to just modulate
across the 24 hour cycle

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.820
where it's very bright,
as bright as safely can be

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.410
early in the day so that you are alert.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.090
You can do your focus detailed
work in that first phase,

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.240
and then in the afternoon, as you move

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.130
into more creative type
works or abstract thinking,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.360
or working with other people
in kind of a brainstorming mode

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.860
that you would shift to
dimmer lights, yellow lights,

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.070
eliminate the blue lights
as much as possible.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.770
Now that's light, but there's
another aspect of vision

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.990
that has been shown to
be critically important

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.440
for how alert we are going to be

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.400
and how well we can
maintain that alertness.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.790
And that has to do with
where our visual focus is

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.210
in a given environment.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.700
So I'm not talking about
overall brightness,

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.630
what I'm referring to now is simply

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.740
where you place your phone or your tablet

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.500
or computer screen or book,

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.560
whatever it is that you
happen to be looking at.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.150
There's a very underappreciated
and yet incredible aspect

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.630
of our neurology that has
to do with the relationship

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.220
between where we look and
our level of alertness.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.900
And it works in a very logical way,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.020
we have clusters of
neurons in our brain stem

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.980
and those clusters of neurons
control our eyelid muscles

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.460
and they control our eye
movements up and down

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.293
into the sides.

00:25:04.293 --> 00:25:06.320
And indeed, if you were
to look at an eyeball,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.880
I looked at a lot of eyeballs in my lab

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.490
and I teach neural anatomy, so
we do this from time to time,

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.170
we would see that there are six muscles

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.990
attached to your eyeball.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.830
Now four of them are located
at the top, the bottom

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.430
and the two sides of your eyeball,

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.770
sort of at the 12 o'clock,
six o'clock, three o'clock

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.580
and nine o'clock of your eyeball.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.510
And those muscles can move
your eye in the socket

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.180
from side to side and up and down.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.970
And then we also have some muscles

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.640
that can actually pull
the eyeballs at angles.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.650
So we have different muscles
that can move the eyes

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.450
at different angles as well,
and that's why we can look

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.010
up into the side or down into the side,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.230
not just from side to side or up or down.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.560
Now, the neurons that
control those muscles

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.690
have a very interesting feature,

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:53.550
which is that when we are
looking down toward the ground

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:58.323
or anywhere below, basically
the central region of our face,

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.190
the neurons that control that eye movement

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.780
are intimately related
to areas of the brainstem

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.050
that release certain
types of neuromodulators

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.690
and neurotransmitters.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.640
And they activate areas of
the brain that are associated

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.810
with calm and indeed, even with sleepiness

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.087
and there's an active
inhibition or prevention

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.690
of neurons that increase alertness.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.370
Now the opposite is also
true, we have neurons

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.960
that place our eyes into an upward gaze

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.160
above the sort of level of our nose

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.970
and up above our forehead.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.400
Literally looking up while
keeping the head stationary,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.210
or if you tilt your head
back and you look up,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.010
these neurons are still active.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.870
Those neurons don't just
control the position of the eyes

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.480
and cause them to move up, they
also trigger the activation

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.590
of brain circuits that are
associated with alertness.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:53.180
Now, this is a fundamental
feature of the way that our eyes

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.440
and brain are wired
together and how they relate

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.340
to what we call autonomic arousal.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.410
And there are a bunch of details there.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.510
We will actually have a guest
in a few weeks who has learned

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.640
to exploit these neurons and
the fact that they control

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.390
these different states
of calm or alertness

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.350
in order to generate hypnotic
states, to place people

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.010
into very atypical states
in which they are both

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.309
very alert and very calm.

00:27:15.309 --> 00:27:17.680
We'll save that for a future episode.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.870
But the important thing to understand

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.170
is when you are looking down
below the level of your nose,

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.150
you are essentially
decelerating your alertness.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.000
You're reducing your amount of alertness,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.210
it might be subtle, but it's happening.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.350
Whereas when you look straight
ahead or in particular,

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.230
when you look up, you're
increasing your level of alertness.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.280
Now this has some obvious implications.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.450
When we get sleepy, our
eyelids tend to close

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.930
and we tend to nod down,
when we're wide awake,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.540
we tend to be wide-eyed, we
don't tend to blink as often.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.850
And we tend to be chin up
and kind of on vigilance

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:50.683
and alertness.

00:27:50.683 --> 00:27:52.420
So this has a evolutionary,

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.983
or at least an adaptive component to it.

00:27:55.994 --> 00:27:59.330
This can be exploited, and
indeed it's been researched

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.150
in terms of how it can be used

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.983
to optimize work environments.

00:28:03.983 --> 00:28:06.410
Contrary to what most people do,

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.220
which is to look down at their
laptop, tablet, or phone,

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.540
if you want to be alert
and you want to maintain

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.970
the maximum amount of
focus for whatever it is

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.250
that you're reading or
doing, you want that screen

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.740
or whatever it is that you're looking at

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.950
to at least be at eye level
and ideally slightly above it.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.870
Now, I haven't seen many
workspaces that take advantage

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.730
of this very hardwired
neuro-biological fact.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.270
So what should you do
with this information?

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.560
Well, if you're somebody
who sits down to do work

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.700
and starts to feel sleepy,
or simply unfocused,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.000
unable to attend to whatever
it is that you're doing,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.380
I highly recommend that you
take your laptop or tablet.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.980
I do hope that most people
aren't doing serious work

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.160
on their phones because it's
such a small visual window,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.280
and we can talk about why
that's an issue later.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.870
And the idea would be to place
that screen of your tablet

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.800
or your laptop or other computer,

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.840
and try and get it elevated
at least to nose level,

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.040
your nose level, or even higher.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.080
Now I realize that can
be complicated to do,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.830
I've long, just used a stack of books,

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.950
or I'll sometimes take a
box and turn upside down

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:10.850
and set it there.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.870
I do use a mixed standing-seated desk,

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.000
I'll talk about that in a few minutes.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.320
There are a number of different
ways that you could do this,

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.810
you could wall mount a monitor.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.560
I think many people are
working with laptops,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.410
it's a little bit harder
to do that with a laptop,

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.750
some people though will
configure a second screen.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.210
You have to decide what's
right for you in your budget.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.030
But again, in addition to
having a brightly lit room,

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.590
to be able to focus and
attend to whatever it is

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.580
you're working on, you
want to have that screen

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.710
positioned high in your
visual environment.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.800
Now you wouldn't want it
on the ceiling necessarily,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.450
I know that would be pretty cool,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.270
but you do want it above you.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.440
Now, there are a couple solutions
to this that don't involve

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.020
a wall mount or stacking books or boxes.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.170
For instance, you could
be one of those people

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.170
that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.870
and get your screen up above you

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.610
by putting pillows on your knees.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.460
I used to actually do a
lot of my writing and work

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.120
in the middle of the night,
I don't do this anymore

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.500
and I don't recommend it, but I used to do

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.640
a lot of work from bed.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.790
Now I no longer bring electronics
for work into the bedroom.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.490
I just really try and keep
the bedroom for sleeping

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.540
or whatever else.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.360
But in terms of lying down on the couch,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.590
it is somewhat easier to get
that screen up above you,

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.950
you can kind of slide underneath
that screen and get typing,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.230
but there's a problem with that.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.470
And we'll talk about this a
little bit more in a moment,

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.780
but it turns out that your posture,

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.790
literally the position of
your body relative to gravity,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.690
also has important implications
for how alert you are.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.700
So ideally you would
be standing or seated.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.450
I would say the ideal would be standing,

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.720
second best will be seated
and your screen will be

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.110
either directly in front of
you or slightly above you.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.700
Or if you wanted to get really fancy,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.210
you could create a situation
where it was above you

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.360
and slightly tilted toward
you so that you actually

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.960
had to maintain kind
of proper neck posture.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.410
This accomplishes a number of things.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.000
In addition to making you more alert,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.100
you also get away from
the so-called text neck.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.760
You know, people are starting to look more

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.880
like C's nowadays, the
shape of the letter C

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.820
because we're constantly looking down.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.700
I do every once in a while,
see somebody who's texting

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.450
in public with it at eye level,
it always looks a little odd

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.500
that they're doing that, but
I always admire their posture

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.260
at the same time, so we
shouldn't give them a hard time.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.040
So this is another feature
that you can arrange

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.780
into your physical workspace.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.000
Again, whether or not you're
seated or you're standing

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.360
throughout the day, try and
get that screen elevated.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.530
Now with reference to posture,
there are beautiful data

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.600
illustrating that when we are standing up,

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.470
those same neurons in our brainstem,

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.550
locus coeruleus neurons,
which release I should mention

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.810
things like norepinephrin and epinephrin,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.550
those neurons become active
when we are standing.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.370
They become even more active
when we are ambulatory,

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.267
when we are moving and we
will talk about treadmilling

00:31:45.267 --> 00:31:48.250
and cycling at your desk and
so forth in a little bit.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.240
But when you sit, they
become a little less active

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.470
and when you lie down and
indeed, any time that you start

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.080
to get your feet up above your waist

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.800
or your head tilted back,
those neurons fire less

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.550
and neurons in your brain
that are involved in calming,

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.720
and indeed putting you to sleep,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.020
start increasing their level of firing.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.630
It's a really beautiful system.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.430
So beautiful, in fact,
that there are studies

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.590
that show that as you adjust
the angle of the body back,

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.530
you actually get a sort
of dose-dependent increase

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.450
in sleepiness and calmness

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.890
and a dose-dependent
decrease in alertness.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:26.130
And so, as we were all
told to sit up straight

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.120
or even better, just stand up straight,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.130
and now I'm also telling
you to get that visual thing

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.790
that you're attending
to, screen or otherwise,

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.800
up in front of you, or ideally above you,

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.690
those things combine to
generate maximum alertness.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.130
So you can think about
how you might work this

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.330
into various aspects of
your homework environment

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.010
or office work environment.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.550
But as I describe this, many
of you are probably thinking

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.010
what I'm thinking, which
is, gosh, most of what we do

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.340
is in complete opposite direction

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.310
to all of this neurobiologically
grounded advice.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.190
Most of us are looking down
at our laptop while seated,

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.140
or we are lying down, which is
going to make us more sleepy,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.230
or we are positioning our
computers in front of us,

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.070
but we really aren't an
environment that's bright enough

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.430
and so on and so forth.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.430
So as you can tell, we're
starting to layer in

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.910
the various things that you can do,

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.620
first brightness in the room,
second, get that screen up

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.030
and try and put yourself
into a posture for work

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.770
that lends itself or promotes alertness

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.320
if indeed, you want to
be alert for that work.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.690
If your goal is to take a
nap, get your feet elevated

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.650
about 10 to 15 degrees above your head,

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.690
maybe put a pillow underneath
it, lie down and take a nap,

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.930
but that's not what we're
talking about today,

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.880
we're talking about
workspace optimization.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.229
And I suppose you could also
exploit that all-nighter trick

00:33:36.229 --> 00:33:38.670
that I talked about earlier,
I actually did this,

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.270
when I was an undergraduate,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.480
I was a little bit
masochistic in this way.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.030
I would drink coffee and
water at fairly high volume.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.020
I wasn't forced drinking
or anything like that,

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.150
but I actually wouldn't
allow myself to get up

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.830
and use the bathroom except on a timer.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.810
So I think the longest ever
went was three and a half hours.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.787
It was kind of excruciating,
I actually don't think

00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:01.540
that's necessarily a
healthy advice, but again,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.410
you can use slight, I mentioned
slight over consumption

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.610
of fluids in order to generate alertness.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.600
That was just me really trying
to get as much work done

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.080
as I could, I had a very,
very demanding class schedule

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.310
and it was just the only way
that I could get work done.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.120
If I was getting up every few
minutes, use the restroom,

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.300
I found it hard to re-engage in that work

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.520
and maintain focus,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.430
which is what I just want
to briefly mention now.

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:24.990
I talked about this in
the episode on focus,

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.080
but one thing that is
completely unreasonable

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.030
and that you should
never ask yourself to do

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.620
is to sit down or stand
up and immediately focus

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.810
on something, unless you're stressed

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:35.760
about what you're looking at,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.320
or you're very, very excited by it.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.610
If you're very stressed about
some sort of information

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.520
or a deadline, or you're very,
very excited about something,

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.440
you'll find that you can focus instantly

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.610
just within a moment.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.710
And that's because of the
deployment of neurochemicals

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.980
like dopamine and norepinephrine

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.760
that bring about our levels of alertness.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.360
However, most of us, including myself,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.100
will go to begin to work out
and we'll find that our mind

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.970
doesn't quite engage at the
level of depth and focus

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.050
that we would like right off the bat.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.660
I've timed this and other
studies have timed this

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.820
in a more rigorous way, mine
is just what we call anecdata,

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.080
but so I've timed it for myself,

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.740
but there are studies
that have looked at this.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.140
And the data point to the fact

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:15.240
that even at our most
heightened levels of focus,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.270
most people can only maintain
focus before switching tasks

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.940
for about three minutes,

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.180
which is depressingly
short period of time.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.000
However, you can extend
that period of time,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.140
and I've talked about that
in the episode on focus,

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.660
but more importantly, when you
sit down to start a work about

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.770
of any kind, any kind
expect that it would take

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.490
about six minutes for you to
engage these neural circuits,

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.100
you wouldn't expect yourself
to walk into the gym

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.940
and do a PR lift or start
running and do your best sprint,

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.920
or just head out the door
without warming up at all.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.690
A little walk jog at first,
or a few warm up sets,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.970
I mean, we expect that,
we are not surprised

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.803
that we need that.

00:35:53.803 --> 00:35:55.290
And yet we sort of expect
that our brain should be able

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.230
to lock on and do work in a
very focused way immediately.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.630
And that's just a ridiculous assumption,

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.660
it's an unfair assumption, I should say.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.500
So assume that it will take
about six minutes to engage

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.220
in your work about and that
those neurochemical systems

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.760
will take some time to rev up and engage.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.530
The other things that I'm
describing about lighting

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.840
and screen positioning and posture,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.870
those will also help maximize your focus

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:20.010
and will limit that ramp
up time into a focus state.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.610
And I think what you'll
find is that as you maximize

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.960
your workspace, the time the latency,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.560
as we say to get into that
focus will start to shorten.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.680
It will especially start
to shorten if you use tools

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.610
to limit distraction, we
will talk about distraction,

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.080
but things like Freedom, which is an app,

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.040
a free app that allows
you to lock yourself

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.020
out of the internet or turning
off your phone for instance.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.470
But even if you're doing work
on your phone or that involves

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.360
your phone or the internet, as many of us

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.510
including myself do, expect
there to be a ramp up time

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.770
for you to focus.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.150
There's another aspect of our vision

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.149
that's absolutely critical
for optimizing our workspace.

00:36:55.149 --> 00:36:57.670
And that has to do with this
really interesting feature

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.249
of our visual pathways in that
it has two major channels.

00:37:01.249 --> 00:37:03.070
Those two major channels have names,

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.440
although you don't have
to remember the names.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.630
The first one is the so-called
parvocellular channel,

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.710
which is involved in looking
at things at specific points

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.950
in space and at high resolution or detail.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.920
And then there's the so-called
magnocellular channel,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.960
that's involved in looking
at big swaths of visual space

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.400
and at lower resolution.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.510
So you can think of the
parvocellular system

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.880
as kind of a high pixel density,

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.120
think about your most modern smartphone,

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.520
the recent smartphone with
the best, best camera.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.470
And think about the magnocellular system

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.540
as being lower resolution,
kind of an older smartphone,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.090
lower pixels, et cetera.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.640
You might ask, why would you want a system

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.100
that's low resolution.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.050
Well, the low resolution
system is better at things

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.340
like detecting motion
and not so much at detail

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.640
and vice versa.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.110
Now, again, you don't have
to remember the names,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.430
what you do have to remember, however,

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.080
is that you're going to
create the maximum amount

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.300
of alertness in your system.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:59.180
The maximum amount of ability
to focus when your system

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.150
is in that parvocellular mode,

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.990
when you're bringing your
eyes to a common point,

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.890
what we call a vergence eye
movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.610
I've said this before on the
podcast, and people said,

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.600
virgin eye movement, no,
vergence eye movement.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.560
As in convergence, bringing your eyes

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.020
to a single point in space,
will create a narrower aperture

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.080
of a visual window,
meaning your visual world

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.390
actually shrinks at least perceptually.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.980
Whereas when you relax your
eyes and dilate your gaze,

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.360
you can do this now by
whatever environment you're in,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.180
trying and see without moving
your head off to the side,

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.870
above, below you, as broadly as possible,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.830
maybe can dilate your gaze
so much that you can see

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.350
yourself, your body in
that visual environment.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.790
You'll notice that your
resolution of vision

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.310
isn't nearly as high as when you do

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.060
that vergence eye movement.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.530
Vergence eye movements
are incredibly powerful

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.020
for creating heightened
states of alertness and focus.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.140
And indeed they create
heightened states of cognition,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.140
of thinking, and that's because your brain

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.780
follows your vision in terms of focus.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.450
When we say I can't focus,
what we often are experiencing

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.080
is an ability, and inability, excuse me,

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.584
to not focus visually.

00:39:05.584 --> 00:39:07.720
Whereas when we are in
a very focused state,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.690
we are in a state often
where we can focus visually.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.600
Now we can also do this
with our auditory system

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.060
or to touch et cetera, but
right now we're just talking

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.750
about the visual system.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.420
Now, in terms of workspace optimization,

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.580
what this means is we never
really want to be looking

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.460
at a square or rectangle
or target area for our work

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.780
that is too far beyond our ears.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.100
How far is too far?

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.650
Really, you want to try
and keep the blinders on,

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.280
or I should say the invisible blinders

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.870
so that whatever you're looking at falls

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.610
within the region of visual
space in front of you,

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.670
that is present if you
were to cup your hands

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.200
and put them right next to your eyes.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.640
Now this is a rough estimation,
but I'm doing this now,

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.900
for those of you that
are watching on YouTube,

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.180
I'm doing this now, I'm trying
to simulate like a horse

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.930
with blinders on, for those
of you who are listening,

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.050
just imagine me looking
silly with my hands

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.350
cupped near my eyes.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:55.680
But if we are to, for
instance, look at a screen

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.950
that's very, very big and
we're too close to it,

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:00.440
or even if we're standing back from it,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.500
it's going to be hard for
us to attend to everything

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.340
within that screen space.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.520
So this is actually support
for the idea of using a phone

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.890
or a tablet or a laptop.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.890
My laptop is about 15 inches in diameter,

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.380
I think is the one that I
have, some are 13, some are 17.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.040
Some of you like to use big monitors,

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.930
make sure that whatever it
is that you're looking at,

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.100
if you want to remain focused,
it doesn't extend too far

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.330
beyond where your eyes are,
the size of your head that is,

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.910
so just think blinders on a horse.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.970
And actually that's the reason
they put blinders on a horse

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.000
so that they're not looking
off into the periphery.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.480
Horses, unlike humans don't
have the same shaped pupil,

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.570
they don't have a visual system

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.070
that's organized in quite the same way,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.060
they mostly see in Panorama,
in magnocellular vision.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.470
And so those blinders are designed

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.240
to keep their visual focus straight ahead,

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.060
so they physically restrict it.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.160
Now, some people will
actually go to lengths

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.750
to further restrict their visual focus.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.040
They will do things
like putting on a hoodie

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.320
or wearing a hat for instance,

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.000
to restrict their visual window.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.590
And indeed that works quite well,

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.320
but as we'll talk about in a moment

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.780
when you really restrict
your visual window,

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.100
down to a very, very narrow
portion of visual space,

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.480
that actually changes
the types of information

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.530
that you are best at processing.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.240
And we'll talk about that
in terms of something

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.810
that's called the cathedral
effect in a few moments,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.360
but for now here's the principle,

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.920
make sure that whatever you're looking at

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.980
is directly in front of
you and doesn't extend

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.630
too far out to the side.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.840
Once you get out to say six
or 12 or certainly 18 inches

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.160
on side of your eyes, you
are dilating your gaze

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.820
by definition, you're dilating your gaze,

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.330
it's completely subconscious,
and it becomes very hard

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:41.740
to maintain attention.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.060
Now, the caveat to this is
that if you are going to look

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.080
at a narrow space, a narrow
window for any period of time,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.710
whether or not it's a book or a laptop

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:54.400
or a tablet or a phone,
those vergence eye movements

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.920
not only create alertness,
but they also require energy.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.660
And they also can fatigue the
eyes because there's a process

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.850
called accommodation whereby
the shape of your eye

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.620
literally has to change
so that the lens can move

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.410
so that you can focus at that location.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.140
Accommodation's an incredible process,

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.200
but it is as demanding
one, and that's the reason

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.680
that your eyes get tired
when you focus on something

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.650
for too long.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.430
So here's a principle extracted
from the ophthalmology

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.480
and neuroscience literature
that you can adopt.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.734
For every 45 minutes in which
you are focusing on something

00:42:24.734 --> 00:42:29.440
like a phone or a tablet or
a book page or your computer,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.430
you want to get into
magnocellular panoramic vision

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.300
for at least five minutes.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.190
And the way that I suggest
to do this is actually

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.100
to take a walk, ideally outside.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.130
We're going to talk about
ambulation, about movement

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.740
and about how that can maintain alertness

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.810
throughout the day.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.860
So for every 45 minutes or
so, try and get five minutes

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.300
of relaxing your eyes.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.020
This is something that's not often done,

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.170
especially in today's homeschooling

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.140
and where kids are going to school by Zoom

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.090
and adults are working by Zoom,
this is a serious problem.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.200
People are getting eye fatigue,
they're getting headaches.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.640
Indeed, some people are getting migraines,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.460
they're having all sorts
of issues, neck pain.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.680
Much of that, if not all
of that, in some cases

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.280
can be alleviated by this 45 to five rule.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.760
For every 45 minutes of
focused work that you do,

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.250
get five minutes where you get outside,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.260
or if you have to be indoors
where you can dilate your gaze.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.820
Now some of you may be saying,

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.410
well, that spits in the
face of your 90 minute rule.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.120
You've told us before that we
should focus for 90 minutes.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.650
I would still want you to take breaks

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.610
within those 90 minutes, if
you're looking at a narrow piece

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.400
of visual world, meaning at a
phone or a laptop or so forth,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.310
and again, the best way to do
this would be to go outside,

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.730
just relax your eyes, look
off into the distance.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.040
Looking at a horizon will
automatically trigger

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.800
this panoramic gaze, which
is very relaxing to the eyes

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.572
and will allow you to go back
into a focused work about.

00:43:49.572 --> 00:43:52.790
The one thing you
absolutely do not want to do

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.423
is to go outside and check your phone,

00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:56.560
because if you're outside
checking your phone

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.830
or you're taking a break
and checking your phone,

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.540
you're still in that
vergence eye movement.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.250
So this is very, very important

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:06.920
because vergence eye movements
increase focus and attention,

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.817
and you can exploit that to increase focus

00:44:08.817 --> 00:44:11.950
and attention when you want
to, but you absolutely need

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.810
to relax the system,
again for every 45 minutes

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.570
in which you've been in that focused mode,

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:20.290
you want to get at least five
minutes of panoramic vision.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.020
If you can take a 15
minute walk, even better.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.650
Next, I'd like to talk about an aspect

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.930
of workspace optimization
that can actually bias

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:29.900
whether or not our
brain and nervous system

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.870
are better suited for
detailed analytic work

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.381
or more abstract work.

00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:38.450
In fact, there's a way
that you can arrange

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.650
your work environment, or
I should say there's a way

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.900
that you can place yourself
into certain environments

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.970
that will allow abstract
thinking, creative thinking,

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:51.140
and indeed expansive thinking to emerge.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.660
There are other environments
that you can put yourself in

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.010
that will make your brain shift
towards more analytic work,

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.100
toward more detailed and
precise types of work.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.770
Now, I just briefly want to
mention something that was covered

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.940
again on the Habits episode
that I did a few weeks ago,

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.640
but again, you don't
need to see that episode

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.840
in order to digest this information.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.490
It goes back to this issue of three phases

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.980
within the circadian 24 hour cycle.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.350
Phase one, which as I mentioned
is about zero to eight hours

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:21.430
after waking, phase two, nine
to 16 hours after waking,

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:24.550
and phase three 17 to
24 hours after waking.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:29.012
Phase one, being ideal
for analytic precise,

00:45:29.012 --> 00:45:32.440
detailed types of work,
phase two, better suited

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.700
for most people for creative,
kind of abstract thinking,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.070
expansive thinking,
brainstorming, et cetera.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.670
There are some exceptions to
that, but most people follow

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.570
that pattern because of the
different neuromodulators

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.430
and hormones and so
forth that are released

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.345
into the brain and body
at those different phases.

00:45:50.345 --> 00:45:54.590
What I'm about to tell you
is a way in which you can use

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.070
your physical environment
to further shift your brain

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.730
and nervous system into a
mode that's either prime

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:04.070
for analytic or abstract
and creative thinking.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.070
What I'm about to describe is
called the cathedral effect.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.860
The cathedral effect has
been discussed well really,

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.360
for many, many decades,
maybe even hundreds of years,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.610
but formally has been
discussed since the early 2000s

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.010
in which it seemed that people who were

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:23.730
in high ceilinged environments,
hence the phrase cathedral,

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:28.420
would shift their thinking and
their ideas to more abstract

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.530
and creative lofty type thinking.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.900
So literally higher
ceiling, loftier thinking,

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.370
higher aspirations that this was observed

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.940
in terms of the language that they use,

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.590
but also the sorts of ideas
that they would generate.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.210
And conversely, that people that were

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:49.210
in lower ceilinged environments
would be more oriented

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.290
toward using a language
that was more restricted,

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.940
literally more detailed,
analytic about things

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.630
in their immediate space.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.200
Now this seems kind of
wild on the one hand,

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.910
but actually if we go
back to our understanding

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.750
of the neurobiology of the visual system

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:07.150
and the way that our
brain and body is evolved

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:10.040
in different environments, it
actually makes a lot of sense.

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.570
We don't have time to
go into a long lecture

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:14.200
about evolutionary neurobiology,
but we have to remember

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.410
that our nervous system
has a number of features

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.080
that are adapted to
different environments.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.880
And indeed, we are able to
go from big open prairies

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.870
or mountaintops or large
cathedrals or concert halls

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:29.380
into small environments and
everything scales with it.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.350
When we're outdoors in
a big, expensive space,

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.970
our vision tends to go long,
we tend to be in panoramic,

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:35.560
magnocellular vision.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.320
Our hearing tends to extend long,

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.230
even if we're having a
conversation with somebody,

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:41.810
we tend to also be attending somewhat

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.880
to the screech of hawks
off in the distance

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.290
or to the rush of a river.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.510
Whereas when we were in
small spaces, everything,

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.910
our vision, our hearing, and indeed

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.960
even our physical movements
become more restrained.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.200
Even if we can still extend our
hands out as far as we want.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.140
What do I mean by that?

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.120
Let's say you're in an elevator,

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.520
that's a small space compared
to outside on a field.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.790
This has been measured
over and over again.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.420
The size or the amplitude of
people's spontaneous movements

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.710
actually scales down in
smaller environments,

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.630
even if they aren't completely
restricted from extending

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:15.000
their limbs all the way,
whereas when we are outdoors,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.940
we feel a natural impulse
to move further away

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.450
from our body, our torso with our limbs,

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.260
this just feels like more
appropriate behavior.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.991
And when I say appropriate,

00:48:26.991 --> 00:48:30.780
I don't mean in any kind of
social context necessarily.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.340
There's actually a reason
for this, the visual system

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.620
and the so-called vestibular motor system

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.090
are intimately linked.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.270
And I can just tell you briefly one way

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:40.780
in which you can test
this and observe this

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.470
and even use this, it's a little off topic

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.490
from today's episode, but let's say

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.450
you have a certain amount of flexibility.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.040
You can extend your arms off like wings

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.420
is what I'm doing for those
of you that are listening,

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.600
not watching off to your
side with arms straight,

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.600
and you reach a maximum
positioning of flexibility.

00:48:57.882 --> 00:49:02.845
You can do a quick experiment
where you sit still,

00:49:02.845 --> 00:49:04.810
you would bring your arms in for a moment.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:06.070
You can put them on
your knees, if you like,

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.240
or in front of you, and
you can move your eyes

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.070
very far off into the
periphery of your visual field.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:13.530
So you actually, I'm going to do this now.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.050
It looks kind of silly, but moving my eyes

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.350
without moving my head
off into the periphery,

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:20.770
all the way to the right,
then all the way to the left,

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.010
all the way up all the way down,

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.520
but especially all the way to the left,

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.170
almost looking over my shoulder
without turning my head

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.630
all the way to my right.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.360
And you will find that you
actually can extend your arms

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.110
further back subsequent to that.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.770
And that's not magic, it
has to do with the ways

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:39.540
in which your cerebellum,
which actually means mini brain

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.130
and your eyes, your visual
system are connected,

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.100
and the way in which
your cerebellum controls

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.780
some of the spindles and other aspects

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.740
of the neuromuscular architecture
of your nervous system,

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.120
'cause your nerves control your muscles

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.590
and allow those muscles
to move further out.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.330
So for those of you that lack flexibility,

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:56.510
you can actually explore
your visual system for this.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:59.110
Now that's again, a bit of a
tangent, but it's a fun one

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.240
that relates back to this
so-called cathedral effect.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.910
The cathedral effect is a
way in which our thinking

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.930
becomes more restricted
and restrained in tighter,

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.670
smaller, more confined
visual environments.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.140
Or if the ceiling is higher,
we are in expansive space

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.090
with a lot of distance
above us or space above us

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.920
and out to the sides,
maybe even out on a field,

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.730
our thinking goes into
these more broad abstract

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:29.514
and kind of loftier future
thinking in particular.

00:50:29.514 --> 00:50:31.540
This has actually been measured.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.090
There's a really nice paper,
I will post a link to this.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:37.310
The authors are Joan Meyers-Levy and Rui,

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.080
and then in parentheses Juliet Zhu,

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.110
I'm going to assume
that they go by Juliet.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:43.447
The title of the paper is "The
Influence of Ceiling Height:

00:50:43.447 --> 00:50:44.347
"The Effect of Priming

00:50:44.347 --> 00:50:46.330
"on the Type of Processing People Use."

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:47.810
And I won't go into all the details

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.870
of this paper, but what's
really cool about this paper

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.880
is they looked with
very rigorous statistics

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.080
and they have a fair number of subjects

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.530
and everything about this
paper looks solid to me.

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.760
The difference in cognitive processing,

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.920
and abstract thinking and
detailed analytic work

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.400
that people are able to
perform in environments

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.480
that have a 10 foot ceiling
versus an eight foot ceiling,

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.863
which is not that much of a difference,

00:51:11.863 --> 00:51:14.970
there's just two foot difference there.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.390
And what they found
were significant effects

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.890
whereby high ceilings, activate concepts

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:24.060
related to abstraction,
whereas low ceilings prime

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.740
confinement related
concepts, but, or promote

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.830
the kind of detailed thinking
that lends itself well

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.210
to sort of spreadsheet type
work or accounting type work.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:35.310
Whereas abstract creative
work was supported

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.750
by these higher ceilings.

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.850
And the way they analyze
this was really interesting.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.820
Again, we don't have time
to go into all the details,

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.722
but they ask people to
sort of generate word sets

00:51:44.722 --> 00:51:47.556
of related to particular
topics like sports.

00:51:47.556 --> 00:51:50.060
And so people will talk
about soccer, football,

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.420
baseball, golf, et cetera,

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.030
and talk about some of the
equipment and other things.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.730
And then they had a kind of a challenge,

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.650
a cognitive challenge
whereby people had to link

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:01.280
different concepts along
different dimensions

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.080
so that you depart from
the dimension of sport

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.660
and you start thinking about
sports that involve teams

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.670
or sports that involve a ball, et cetera.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.540
And so in the same conditions you can,

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.500
except for the fact that the
ceiling height is different

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.020
eight feet or 10 feet, what one finds

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.840
is that the kinds of language
and the kinds of associations

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.200
that people start to create
are vastly different.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.590
And there're actually two
experiments in this study,

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:23.950
you're welcome to go look at it,

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:26.123
so it wasn't just about sports,
there were some other things

00:52:26.123 --> 00:52:27.670
that were analyzed as well.

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:29.780
And in the references of this paper,

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.070
it also points to other examples
of the cathedral effect,

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.560
which I find very interesting
because as a vision scientist

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.380
and someone who spends
his life thinking about

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.990
and indeed talking about
the nervous system,

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.550
we know that our cognition
follows our vision.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:47.270
For low vision or blind
people will follow mostly

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.110
their hearing and to
some extent their touch.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.400
But for most people who are sighted,

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.700
as most people are cited,

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:56.630
our cognition follows
our visual environment.

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.650
So what does this mean for
workspace optimization?

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:03.090
Well, most of us have a fixed
ceiling level in our home,

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.150
but you might have rooms in
which the ceiling is higher

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.760
and rooms in which the ceiling is lower.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.590
If that were the case, I
recommend if you want to do

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:11.590
creative work during phase
two, the nine to 16 hours

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.815
of your circadian cycle,
nine to 16 hours after waking

00:53:14.815 --> 00:53:17.240
that is, that you do that
in the high ceiling room,

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.990
or maybe even outdoors out
on a deck or on a patio.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:22.450
Cause the highest ceiling
of courses is the sky.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.080
Whereas if you're going to
do detailed analytic work

00:53:26.206 --> 00:53:28.720
I would suggest doing that
during phase one of the day.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.490
But even if you're going
to do it during phase two

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:32.710
of the day, for whatever
reason, scheduling

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.960
or other sorts of
constraints that you do that

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.650
in the lower ceiling environment.

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.270
Now, if you are interested in controlling

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:41.700
the height of your visual world,
but you don't have control

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.333
over the ceiling height of the
environment that you're in,

00:53:44.333 --> 00:53:46.110
there's another way to do that.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.810
And I used to observe this in the cafes,

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:49.340
in and around Stanford, and the Bay area

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.380
where you would see somebody
who, despite the weather

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.800
would be in a hoodie,
maybe with a baseball cap

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.070
or other form of hat
or some sort of blinder

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.890
above their eyebrows, which
is actually another way

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:03.490
of just lowering the ceiling
height very, very low

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:04.790
and restricting your visual field.

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:06.880
Not unlike blinders that
we talked about before

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.690
that one would put on a horse
or one would put on themselves

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.470
by restricting their visual angle of focus

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.370
to directly in front of
them, but not too far out

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.000
beyond the sides of their head.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.920
So these cathedral effects,
I think can be leveraged

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.380
toward doing particular
types of work best.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.040
And again, the lower the ceiling

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.220
or the lower your visual environment,

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.960
the more that one tends to do
where I should say performs

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.440
detailed analytic work accurately.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.210
And the more that one's
thinking is oriented

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:38.523
towards detailed sort of
correct answer type work.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.610
Whereas when the ceiling is
higher or there's no ceiling,

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.060
the more that the brain and
the rest of the processing

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.010
that we call cognitive processing,

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:51.200
is related to abstract
reasoning, brainstorming,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.290
and indeed can pull from broader
swaths of memory resources,

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:57.470
because really what abstract reasoning is,

00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:00.640
is it's taking the existing
elements and maneuvering them,

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.550
arranging them into novel ways.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.090
So you can think about
like notes on a piano,

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:06.910
playing a particular
song, learning scales,

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.150
that's very analytic.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.590
There's a correct answer that
you're trying to arrive at

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.330
or generate, whereas writing
music or writing poetry

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:18.000
or generating new material of any kind,

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.830
involves taking existing elements, right?

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:21.760
You're not going to use
words that you don't have

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.170
committed to your memory or
that you're not aware of,

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:26.130
and arranging them in novel ways.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.460
So I think the cathedral
effect can be leveraged.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.500
And again, you don't need to
move into a different home

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.420
or build a slanted roof and
work at one side of the room

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.840
at one part of the day and
the other side of the room

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.360
at the other, although if that's
the way you want to swing it,

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.060
that's great, most of us
don't have that flexibility,

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.420
but it's very clear that
the height of the ceiling

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.840
of the visual environment that we're in,

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.760
has a profound effect on the
types of cognitive processes

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.430
that we are able to engage.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:51.900
Now, I'd like to shift our attention

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.280
to the auditory environment
or the noise in the room

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.030
or the music in the room or the music

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.460
or noise in the headphones,
because it turns out

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:03.690
that there is a lot of quality
scientific data out there

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:08.150
that speaks to whether or not
listening to particular sounds

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.310
can enhance our cognition.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:11.840
And indeed the answer is yes,

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.890
but there are very particular
types of things to listen to

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:17.160
under very particular types of conditions

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.721
that allow one to do that.

00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:22.950
First off, I want to say
that people vary tremendously

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.530
in the extent to which they can tolerate

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.830
background noise for work.

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:30.730
In fact, individuals will
vary tremendously from one day

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.480
to the next, or even within the same day

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.360
in the extent to which they
can tolerate background noise.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.520
I've experienced this
myself, there been times

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.030
in which I've been working at home

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.980
and I felt like for whatever reason,

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.860
I just could not engage in focus.

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:46.520
And what worked to
generate more focus for me

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.270
was to go to a cafe or to a library

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:51.490
or someplace where there's
actually more commotion,

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.460
more people moving about,
maybe even more noise,

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.140
maybe even music in the room.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.200
And we have to all be in
touch with when we want

00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.870
more background noise, or when we want

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.800
less background noise, there
is no hard and fast rule.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.800
If you look across the literature
for studies that involve

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:12.100
complete silence or white noise
or binaural beats, or music

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.010
or classical music or rock and roll,

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.740
you can find results to
support any type of environment

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.660
as being more beneficial.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.360
However, as we'll talk about in a moment,

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.720
there are a few types of
environments to really avoid

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.950
and a few types of sounds
that really can enhance

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.940
the cognition and your ability to focus

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.580
in your workspace
environment across the board,

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.570
that really seemed to work for all people.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.080
Let's talk about
background noise to avoid.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.020
And here we're talking about
background noise to avoid

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.020
because it actually can cause

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.810
some pretty severe deficits in cognition.

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:46.700
There's a paper first author,
Jordan Love, cool name,

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.350
last author Alexander Francis.

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:51.350
The, the title of the paper has to do

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:54.757
with "Psychophysiological
responses to potentially annoying

00:57:54.757 --> 00:57:56.817
"heating, ventilation and
air conditioning noise

00:57:56.817 --> 00:57:59.810
"during mentally demanding
work," which is a mouthful.

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:04.790
But basically what this paper
identifies is a large dataset

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:06.790
in which workplace and
environmental noise,

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:09.250
mostly the humming of air
conditioners that's very loud

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:11.540
or the humming of heaters,
that's very loud and ongoing,

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:15.060
just incessant doesn't let
up, can really increase

00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:18.010
mental fatigue and can vastly decrease

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.850
cognitive performance. And if
you're interested in looking

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.610
at the cognitive performance
data that authors

00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:26.500
are Banbury &amp; Berry 2005,
that paper is the one

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.210
that supports the fact that
cognitive performance is worse

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:31.290
when there's just the
hum of an air conditioner

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.750
in the background or the hum of a heater

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:35.412
and otherwise complete silence.

00:58:35.412 --> 00:58:38.520
There's also evidence which
I discussed on the episode

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.330
about hearing, which is
that in young children,

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.920
white noise can cause some impairments

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.660
in the development of the auditory system.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.820
Now I don't want parents to
freak out and if you're exposed

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.080
to white noise, as it as
a sleep aid as a child,

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.330
which I know many of you
were, don't freak out,

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.900
but it turns out that white
noise, especially if it's loud,

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.770
white noise can cause some
disruption in the auditory maps,

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.390
the representation of
different frequencies of sound

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:06.760
in the brain that can lead
to some deficits in auditory

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.310
and even language processing.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:11.800
So we really have to be careful
about long-term exposure,

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.170
extended exposure to white noise,

00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:16.130
or kind of an air conditioning noise

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:17.270
that's really at a high level.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:19.510
I wouldn't worry if it's in
the background and shutting off

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:23.760
and turning on again, as the
thermostat kicks off and on,

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.230
but really try and avoid
work in loud fan filled

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:32.610
or ventilation generating or
heat generating environments,

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:34.340
because it really can cause damage

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:38.350
to the auditory system
long-term and as we described,

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:39.690
it can impair cognitive performance

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:41.190
and overall increase fatigue.

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:43.300
I think we've all experienced
that when you're in a room

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.657
and there's some ongoing background noise

00:59:44.657 --> 00:59:46.540
and all of a sudden it
stops and you just feel

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.320
this enormous relief [sighs].

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.260
And the reason for this is
that our auditory system

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:53.910
has a parallel to our visual system.

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:56.240
In our visual system, that
light entering the eyes

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.310
triggers the activation
of those melanopsin cells,

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:00.320
which triggers activation
of the hypothalamus,

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.980
a particular area of the hypothalamus,

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.340
which generates alertness,
generates the release,

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.950
even of cortisol, a stress hormone.

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:09.980
In the auditory system,
when there's ongoing sound,

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.870
your auditory system hears that,

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.630
even if you're not paying attention to it,

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:14.870
if you're paying attention
to something else,

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.070
it's still registers.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.520
Those little hair cells, as
they're called in your inner ear

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.020
are fluttering, the eardrum is beating

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.560
and in concert to that sound frequency.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.227
And there's a brainstem mechanism
that generates alertness

01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:28.340
and a kind of vigilant.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.760
So when you have a sound that's
ongoing in the background,

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.630
it shuts off, all of a sudden
you experienced that peace,

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.780
which is the turning off
of those brainstem circuits

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.560
that are associated with
vigilance, the locus coeruleus,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.590
which we talked about earlier,
which release epinephrin

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.710
and norepinephrine and
generate the heightened state

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:45.220
of alertness in your brain and body,

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.952
those neurons then can turn off

01:00:46.952 --> 01:00:48.660
and you experience that as relaxation.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.050
So does that mean that we
shouldn't listen to white noise

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:53.530
or pink noise or brown
noise while we're working?

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:54.710
Certainly a lot of people do.

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.790
In fact, if you want to
know what white noise,

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.420
pink noise and brown noise are,

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.950
they're just different constellations

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.400
of auditory frequencies
that are played together.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.050
Most of us think of white noise

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.100
as the [shushing] on a screen,

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.710
all the black and white
pixels going all around,

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:13.890
like they call it visual
snow, but pink noise

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:17.790
has certain sound
frequencies, notched out,

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.620
taken out, brown noise has others.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.160
It has different frequencies
that are included

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.630
at higher amplitude, et cetera.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.930
You can look this stuff up on YouTube,

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:26.380
if you want, you to just put brown noise.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.490
None of it sounds terrific,
it doesn't sound like music.

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.520
It's literally just
noise, mixed frequencies

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.180
in no particular arrangement.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.750
There is some evidence
that playing white noise

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.980
in the background or on
headphones or pink noise

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.570
or brown noise can facilitate cognition,

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.640
but it's mainly through an increase

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.730
in this overall alertness as a consequence

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:48.310
of areas like locus coeruleus
and other brainstem areas

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.490
that are associated with autonomic arousal

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.360
from that noise.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.310
So it's a lot like the
air conditioner effect.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.570
And I think done in a restricted way,

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:59.030
meaning not for hours and
hours, but maybe if your focus

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:01.810
is waning and you're having
a hard time engaging in work,

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:03.750
you might put on some
brown noise or white noise

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.620
or pink noise and work that
way for 45 minutes or so

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.650
before you go to your
panoramic vision walk

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:11.360
and get some sunlight,
that should be fine.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.470
There's really no reason
to suspect, however,

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:15.740
that those particular patterns of noise

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.540
are going to optimize
particular mental functions.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.130
So what I'd like to turn to
next are particular patterns

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.270
of sounds that indeed have been shown

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.860
in peer-reviewed studies
to optimize certain types

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.370
of mental processing, because
you can incorporate these

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.590
into your optimized workspace environment,

01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:35.100
through headphones or through speakers,

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.820
whatever mechanism that you want,

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.610
in order to get more out
of your work efforts.

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:43.610
If you were to search for apps
or go online and try and find

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:47.630
sounds that can improve thinking
or change your emotions.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.840
You're generally going
to find three types.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.920
One are called isochronic tones,

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.070
these are tones usually
of a common frequency.

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:59.470
So it might be a beep and
then a pause, and then beep

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:01.250
of the same frequency, and then beep,

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.728
forgive my terrible beeping.

01:03:03.728 --> 01:03:05.670
I don't know what good
beeping would sound like,

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:10.380
but contrast isochronic
tones with monaural beats.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.460
Monaural beats would be repetitive,

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:16.088
almost percussive like beats
delivered to just one ear,

01:03:16.088 --> 01:03:19.510
[vocalizing], this kind of thing.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:21.780
You can find apps that can
deliver monaural beats,

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.550
you can find also apps that deliver

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:25.907
so-called binaural beats.

01:03:25.907 --> 01:03:28.580
You can also find YouTube
scripts or channels

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.040
that will deliver binaural beats.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.690
Binaural beats as the name suggests,

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:34.120
are beats delivered to the two ears,

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.670
one pattern of kind of
percussive beat to one ear

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:39.220
and a different pattern,
or at least a pattern

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.100
that's out of phase,
that's not synchronized,

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.230
delivered to the other ear.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.455
So on one ear you hear, [vocalizing]

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:48.511
and in the other ear,
you've got [vocalizing].

01:03:48.511 --> 01:03:50.720
And what happens is because of the way

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.770
that the auditory system
converges in the brainstem

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:57.280
and generates what are called
interaural time differences,

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.450
I'll explain what that means in a moment,

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:01.210
interaural time
differences, the difference

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:03.960
between the two patterns
of beats that are heard

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.960
by each of the two different
ears, leads to a third pattern

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.320
that the brain entrains
to, and kind of maps onto

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.400
and generates particular
types of brainwaves.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.870
So without going into a lot of detail,

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:19.820
interaural time differences are the ways

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.430
in which if you were to hear
something off to your right,

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:24.760
like I just snapped my
finger just to the right

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.760
of my right ear, that a
signal arrives in my right ear

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:32.930
before that's sound signal,
those sound waves arrive

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:33.763
in my left ear.

01:04:33.763 --> 01:04:36.690
So there's an interaural
between ears, time difference.

01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:41.570
And there's a brainstem area
in which signals from one ear

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.360
and signals from the other ear converge,

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.320
and there's literally a math
done by your nervous system

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.030
that says this signal arrived
before the other signal.

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:51.670
And the difference between those signals

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:53.160
is the interaural time difference.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.540
So if I were to snap my
fingers on both sides

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:58.600
on my left and on my right
side of the exact same time,

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.140
and they arrive at the same time,

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.630
the interaural time difference is zero.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:04.710
Whereas if one goes first on
the right and then the left,

01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.810
I'm terrible at snapping on
the left, it's a weak snap,

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.760
but it was there, then there's a delay

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.160
and the interaural time
difference has a particular value.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.850
Okay, you get it, it's
almost ridiculously simple.

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.360
Binaural beats have been generated in ways

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.320
that create a particular pattern

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.610
of interaural time
differences that then cascades

01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:26.670
up to the rest of the brain
and puts the forebrain

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:28.870
and other areas of the brain
that are involved in cognition

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:30.930
and action into a particular rhythm.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:34.620
And some of the rhythms or
waves of brain activity are ones

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.980
that you may have heard
of, things like alpha waves

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.310
or theta waves or gamma waves.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.070
Now I don't like to get too attached

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.050
to particular brain waves as excellent

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.760
for particular kinds of thinking.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.200
This is something that was really popular

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.150
in the 90s and 2000s, when ways
of measuring brain activity,

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:54.635
noninvasively with
electrodes on the outside,

01:05:54.635 --> 01:05:58.230
enabled people to identify
the indeed alpha brain waves

01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:59.870
are associated with alertness states.

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:01.620
And some are other brainwaves

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.970
that are kind of larger amplitudes,

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.720
slow waves like delta waves are associated

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.790
with kind of sleepiness or
relaxation, but in general,

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:12.000
the way that the brain works
is that different brain waves

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.980
are generated in different
structures at different times.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.140
And those combine to give us a
sense of happiness or give us

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.380
a sense of focus or give
us a sense of creativity.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.110
Nonetheless, if you look
across the board at the studies

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:29.330
of binaural beats and you ask
what sorts of binaural beats

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:32.410
appear to be useful for people to enhance

01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:35.010
their brain function for
particular kinds of tasks,

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:37.760
we arrive at some very
interesting answers.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.670
So we'll review what those are now.

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:43.080
The frequency of binaural beats
that appears to bring about

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.580
improved cognitive functioning
at the level of memory,

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:51.783
improved reaction times
and improved verbal recall,

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:55.420
seems to be 40 Hertz.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.500
Now, is it exactly 40 Hertz?

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.700
We don't know, but if one wants to look up

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.470
a great reference on this,
they reference Colzato,

01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:08.470
C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017
describes and here, I'm quoting,

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:10.043
so this is a direct quote.

01:07:10.043 --> 01:07:10.947
"The present findings are in line

01:07:10.947 --> 01:07:12.877
"with those of a recent
study, which also found

01:07:12.877 --> 01:07:14.617
"faster reaction times in participants

01:07:14.617 --> 01:07:16.320
"that listen to binaural
beats at 40 Hertz."

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.290
And you can find many examples
of this in the literature

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:23.320
where binaural beats have about 40 Hertz

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.513
or exactly 40 Hertz, in some cases,

01:07:26.467 --> 01:07:30.130
somehow brought the brain into
a state that made it optimal

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.820
for learning, for memory and
for certain types of recall,

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.430
including verbal recall,
math learning, et cetera.

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:38.037
So for those of you that are
interested in binaural beats,

01:07:38.037 --> 01:07:40.370
there are a number of free apps out there.

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:41.700
I'm not going to recommend
any in particular,

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.618
just have to search for one
that you happen to like.

01:07:44.618 --> 01:07:48.820
One thing that you will find
is that many of those apps

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:53.820
super-imposed binaural beats
onto raindrops or ocean sounds

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.700
or that rather they superimpose
ocean sounds and raindrops

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:59.050
onto the binaural beats,
that does not appear

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:02.197
to be as effective as pure binaural beats.

01:08:02.197 --> 01:08:03.830
There has been an exploration

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:06.240
of lower frequency binaural beats.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.720
So for instance, seven Hertz,
which is theta binaural beats

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.050
done for 30 minutes with
an overlay of rain sound

01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:15.490
or rain sounds only that's been analyzed

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:18.500
and believe it or not, that
showed immediate recall memory

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.890
was significantly decreased.

01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:23.560
So that's a negative effect
of binaural beats on memory.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.810
So the idea that binaural
beats are just great for us

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:28.540
across the board, I think is wrong.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.600
It does appear that the higher
frequency binaural beats

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.460
as one moves up toward 40 Hertz

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.640
are going to be the most beneficial.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.230
There are instances in which for instance,

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:41.460
15 Hertz binaural beats
increased response accuracy

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:44.500
on a spatial verbal memory task.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.430
This is a complicated working memory task.

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.050
Working memory is the kind of memory

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:49.470
of remembering a phone number.

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:53.750
So if I say for instance, 4932931,

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.570
and you have to remember that number,

01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:58.410
keeping it online is what
we call your working memory.

01:08:58.410 --> 01:08:59.620
It's likely that you would forget that

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.930
two or three days later.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:02.750
You can get improvements in working memory

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.260
with 15 Hertz binaural beats,

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.290
whereas the other control conditions,

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:09.050
five Hertz and 10 Hertz binaural beats,

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:11.825
all decreased accuracy of working memory.

01:09:11.825 --> 01:09:14.170
However, when I looked at the literature

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.030
and I examined a number
of different studies,

01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:21.530
what I always seem to come
back to was that 40 Hertz or so

01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:24.970
plus or minus five Hertz
seemed to be optimal

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:27.580
for generating improvements in cognition,

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.610
in math performance, and
even in various types

01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:33.360
of memory recall, and even
in musical performance.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.580
You might wonder, well, how can people do

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.060
musical performance, they're
listening to binaural beats.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.950
Here's another surprise,
many of the studies

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.090
that I looked at didn't
have people listening

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:44.310
to binaural beats while
they were doing the tasks,

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.450
the memory task, or the
music learning, et cetera,

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.850
they would do it
beforehand for 30 minutes.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.270
There were instances in
which people were listening

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.140
to binaural beats during the task.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.900
But if you decide to
employ binaural beats,

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.130
I recommend this 40 Hertz
as a great place to start.

01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:00.780
I don't recommend doing it
for all of your work bouts.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.810
I think there's a good reason to believe

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:04.600
that you can attenuate to it.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.810
But if you are going to try
it, you might try it both ways.

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:08.470
You might try listening to binaural beats

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.740
for about 30 minutes
while doing something else

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.860
and then maybe eating lunch
or something of that sort,

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.710
or taking a walk and then
going into the work about.

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.580
Because remember the moment
that you start listening

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.550
to these binaural beats, the
brain doesn't immediately

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.070
switch into a particular
pattern of oscillation

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:24.400
or brain waves, it takes some time.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.780
Neural circuits, again,
take time to engage.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:29.360
The only neural circuits that
are going to engage instantly

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.080
are going be the ones that are
of a sort of reflexive sort,

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.040
like you step on a sharp object

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.640
and you have to retract your limb,

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.960
or you suddenly are stressed
by a distressing text message,

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.130
or you're suddenly delighted

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:42.320
about a delightful text message.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.620
But when it comes to shifting
your whole brain state

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.800
toward optimizing work, it
takes a little bit of time.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.360
So again, 40 Hertz binaural
beats, many, many apps,

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.360
many YouTube scripts out
there, probably other resources

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.240
for binaural beats, hopefully zero cost,

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.460
so you can access those without any need

01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.970
to shell out any money.

01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:01.610
If you find one that
you particularly like,

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:02.840
maybe put in the comment section,

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.050
so other people can find it,

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:06.140
YouTube would be the
best place to do that.

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.400
Feel free to put a link
or just a description,

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.060
that will be wonderful.

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.270
And again, you don't need
to listen to binaural beats

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.960
at the exact same time
that you're doing the work,

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.970
although that could also
enhance your productivity.

01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:19.440
Some of you out there might be craving

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.880
a little bit more mechanism
by which binaural beats

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.400
can influence things like
focus or reduced reaction time.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.420
This has actually been explored,

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:32.030
this 40 Hertz binaural beats
pattern seems to have an effect

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:33.955
on what's called striatal dopamine.

01:11:33.955 --> 01:11:36.610
We have dopamine as a
neuromodulator of course,

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:38.580
involved in many things in motivation,

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:41.020
it's actually involved in
adaptation to light in the retina.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.850
Something that most people don't know,

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.390
but it's involved in
movement, which is why people

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:48.060
with Parkinson's who have a
depletion of dopamine neurons

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.140
actually have movement deficits and so on.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.560
But striatal dopamine is closely related

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.030
to motivation and focus.

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:59.930
And 40 Hertz binaural
beats appears to increase

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:01.400
striatal dopamine release.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.410
And this has actually
been measured indirectly

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:05.800
by what we call spontaneous blink rate.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.040
Now I've been accused on
various Instagram posts,

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.100
and even on this podcast
of being a non-blinker,

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.180
let's call it, or a minimal blinker.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:18.740
And as an important aside,
there is no evidence whatsoever

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.200
that people that don't blink very much

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.850
are sociopaths or lie.

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:25.300
Also, you will hear that
people who blink a lot

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.270
are sociopaths and are lying.

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:29.700
There's absolutely no
evidence that blink frequency

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:32.730
correlates with anything except alertness.

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:35.870
Now longer blinks are
associated with less alertness.

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:38.040
As we get tired, we tend
to blink longer and longer

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.220
until we take the long
blink that is sleep.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:42.810
I guess the long blink would be death,

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:46.360
but the longish blink would be sleep.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.820
But it turns out that the more
firing of striatal dopamine

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:54.220
neurons that's occurring,
the more frequently we blink.

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:57.240
And so it is associated with a resetting

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.360
of our visual window, that's
what happens when we blink

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.410
and there's a whole
relationship between blinking

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.630
and time perception that we covered

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:04.500
in the episode on time perception.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.310
But here's the bottom line
for sake of this discussion.

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:09.670
40 Hertz binaural beats
appears to increase

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.320
spontaneous blink rates
because it increases

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.290
dopamine transmission in the
brainstem and in the striatum

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.040
in several locations in fact.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.780
And so the way in which
these binaural beats

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.120
set a rhythm in the brain,
recruits dopamine release.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.460
That dopamine release
leads to heightened levels

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:29.760
of motivation and focus,
why motivation and focus?

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.930
Well, dopamine is actually the substrate

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:33.320
by which epinephrin is made.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.320
Dopamine, the molecule is
actually converted into epinephrin

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.010
adrenaline and they work
together like close cousins,

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.710
dopamine and epinephrin in
order to put us on a path

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.630
of movement or if we are doing work,

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.720
of mental movement toward a goal.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.940
So that's a little bit of
mechanistic meat to explain

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.280
at least part of the reason
why 40 Hertz binaural beats

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.920
can enhance our focus,
reduce our reaction times

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.780
and improve indeed learning and memory.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.100
Next I'd like to talk
about the role of movement

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.000
in optimizing our workspace
and whether or not standing,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.550
sitting, lying down, treadmilling
or even believe it or not,

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:10.570
cycling, can enhance our
work output and performance.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:12.850
Before we do that, I want
to touch on two aspects

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:16.780
of optimizing workspace that
will come up at some point

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.070
in your work or school life.

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:21.700
Alas, there isn't a lot
of science around this,

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.830
but I think they are worth mentioning.

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:25.900
And I think I can offer
a little bit of advice

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.360
in terms of how to navigate these

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.340
in a way that would be beneficial to you.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.000
The first one is interruptions.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.190
If you go online and you ask

01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:35.800
about how to avoid
interruptions, people will say,

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.110
okay, well, if you have kids
at home or even if you don't

01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:40.550
or at work, you'll have a
light, like a recording light

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:42.920
with recording is on
we're, we're busy now,

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.670
or have a sign on the door that says

01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:46.390
bother only in a case of emergency

01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:49.103
or find to knock or don't knock at all.

01:14:49.103 --> 01:14:51.270
I've used a different
policy throughout the years.

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.930
I am somebody who works
pretty hard to control my time

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:58.560
and focus, but of course,
as a laboratory director,

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.660
I have people coming by and
who want to talk about things.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.010
And of course we have
phones and we have computers

01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:06.120
and people's opportunity to reach us.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.860
Interruptions really are deadly

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.370
to our ability to generate focus.

01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:14.590
And it's not just about
the distraction that occurs

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:16.500
of say a minute or two
minutes or five minutes

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.470
when we were interrupted,

01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:19.630
it's also about the additional time

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:22.770
to get those brain circuits to
re-engage to a mode of focus.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.560
So it's really kind of a double whammy.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.380
Now, none of us, including
myself want to be harsh

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.130
or cruel or shut off from the world

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:32.760
and oftentimes interruptions
bring incredible insights

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.900
and people are providing
support and very useful things

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.870
that are essential to my
workday and presumably

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:40.460
to your workday in school day as well.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.680
But there's a simple method that I learned

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.930
from my graduate advisor
that works very, very well.

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.610
Again, no peer review data to support it,

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:50.170
this is just my experience,
but this is somebody

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.540
who had immense powers of focus,

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.800
had a very, very demanding life,
a long commute to children,

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.400
extensive laboratory, et cetera.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.730
And what she would do was if I
came by and asked a question,

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:03.890
or if anyone came by and asked a question,

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:05.570
she would acknowledge their presence,

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:07.490
but would not shift her body toward them.

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:10.010
So she purposely did not
position her computer

01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:13.650
facing the door, which I think
is a deadly or I should say,

01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:17.530
deadly to focus a way of
positioning your workspace.

01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:18.940
So her computer was facing the wall,

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.740
the door was perpendicular to that.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.030
And I would come by and
I say, I have a question.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:25.240
She would say yes, so she
would acknowledge my presence,

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.730
but she wouldn't actually
orient her body toward me,

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:29.280
which told me that this conversation

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.560
was not going to last very long.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.700
And no matter how long I
stood there or what I asked,

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.040
she would never orient toward me,

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.740
which generally kept these
conversations very, very short.

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:37.980
We had other designated meetings

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.580
where we would be face-to-face.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.020
The other approach, which I confess

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.380
colleagues of mine have used before,

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.380
not necessarily at Stanford,
but elsewhere is to simply say

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.450
no to everything that
somebody requests or comes by.

01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:52.920
So if someone would knock on the door,

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.120
they would just shout no through the door,

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.010
or if someone said, can I
bother you for a second?

01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:58.600
They would say, no, or if someone said,

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.480
I have something I want to tell
you, they would just say no.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.590
And they would just continue doing this

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:02.550
until the person went away.

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:04.100
That was actually very effective,

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.970
these were some of the most
productive people I know,

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:11.340
not always the kindest, but
some of them were very kind.

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.480
The other approach that I've seen

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.780
and actually this is an approach
that was used by someone

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.760
who has been a guest on
The Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.360
someone who's immensely
productive was that he,

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.170
so I'm constraining who
this might be by saying he,

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:29.180
he actually, despite having the option

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:32.510
to have a very large
office, would place himself

01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:35.930
in a workspace that was
literally a coat closet,

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:39.290
cleared out with a desk,
small lamp, completely dark.

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:42.228
So this violates everything
that I've talked about before

01:17:42.228 --> 01:17:45.070
or prior to this, everything
about high ceilings,

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:47.030
bright light, et cetera, and would work,

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:50.050
still works underneath a desk lamp

01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:53.090
in a completely dark
closet, minimal ventilation.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.260
This is my definition of hell.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.140
And yet is one of the most
productive people on the planet.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.300
Also very, very hard to
find, I actually know

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.550
where his closet is, turns
out he has several of them

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:05.410
that he migrates from in
order to avoid distractions.

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:07.050
So I mentioned these as kind of extremes,

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:09.700
I think that most of us
exist on the other extreme.

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.410
And that's why I mentioned
it, which is that most of us

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.360
like some social engagement and a welcome,

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.470
or at least set our work environment

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:19.170
in a way that welcomes interruption

01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:21.230
and we have to be very,
very careful about this.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.580
Now in the digital realm,
I already mentioned

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:27.050
a few of the things that we
can do as practical tools

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:28.760
to limit interruptions.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.320
One is use the program Freedom,

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.640
the other would be to
simply turn off the wifi.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.770
If you do need to be
online and navigating,

01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:36.310
you're doing research of any kind,

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.680
that's not going to be possible.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.090
Turning off one's phone, I've at times,

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:42.640
put my phone on airplane
mode, if that didn't work,

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.150
I've locked it in a safe, I've done that,

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:45.450
I'd left in the car outside.

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:47.370
It all depends on one's
levels of self-discipline,

01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:49.960
which as you probably know,
from your own experience,

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.360
tends to kind of wax and wane.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.900
Sometimes we are better

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.910
at avoiding these
distractions than others.

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:57.180
So if you find yourself in
a place where it's very hard

01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:59.270
to reduce those distractions,

01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:01.660
you may need you to go
to more elaborate lanes.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.820
I will say that a
graduate student in my lab

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:06.890
who was immensely productive and focused,

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.865
had the habit of coming in each day,

01:19:08.865 --> 01:19:11.970
she would take her phone, I
don't know if she turned it on,

01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:14.320
or off or not, and she would
just place it in a door,

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.150
excuse me, in a drawer

01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:18.750
and would then go start doing experiments.

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:20.476
We do experiments all day at 10 courses,

01:19:20.476 --> 01:19:23.140
engage in discussions
avidly with the rest of us,

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.260
and then would take her phone out

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.050
at the end of the day and leave.

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:29.860
And I don't think that
behavior was not correlated

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.700
with her immense productivity.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.840
I think the ability to untether
ourselves from the phone

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.340
is going to be the way in which many of us

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.420
are either going to succeed or
fail in our various pursuits.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.700
I'm somebody who engages on with the phone

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:46.370
on a regular basis throughout
the day for various reasons,

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:48.530
but I do try and have
large swaths of the day

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:50.110
in which it's either on airplane mode

01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:52.330
or it's completely
physically separated from me.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:55.320
When I'm in large swaths,
I might do every other hour

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.820
with the phone on airplane mode

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.770
or even a two or three hour
about where I just am simply

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:01.680
not engaged with the phone at all.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.410
So is it better to sit
or is it better to stand

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:06.250
when doing work, at least as it relates

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:07.860
to focus and productivity?

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.093
And the answer is both.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.800
There've been a number
of systematic studies

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.680
exploring what are called sit-stand desks.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.810
So these are desks that
can be set to a height

01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:22.270
that makes standing the best practice,

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:24.330
and then they can be lowered to a height

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:26.520
that makes sitting the best practice

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.550
or the easiest practice I should say.

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:33.500
And it turns out that just
sitting is terrible for us

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.120
and there's an enormous
number of studies out there

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.110
that have pointed the
fact that people who sit

01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:41.750
for five or six or seven
hours a day doing work,

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:45.260
have all sorts of issues
related to sleep, neck pain,

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.190
cognition suffers, their number
of cardiovascular effects,

01:20:48.190 --> 01:20:50.240
even digestion, there may even actually be

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.530
some almost pressure
effects on the pelvic floor

01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:55.300
and things of that sort,
depending on the chairs

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:56.820
that one uses.

01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:01.200
But that people who stand are
in a slightly better situation

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.190
where many of those
health metrics improve,

01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:06.170
but that people that do
a combination of sitting

01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.970
and standing at the same
desk throughout the day,

01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:09.840
or move from one desk to another,

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.640
if they don't have a
combination sit-stand desk,

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.840
that's going to be best.

01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:16.140
The good news is it's very
easy to convert a sit desk

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.010
into a stand desk, you
can just stack some boxes,

01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:19.930
I've done this at times or stack books.

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:21.190
There are also some pedestals

01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:24.070
and things that you can purchase
if that's your preference

01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:25.810
in order to set your computer
at a particular height.

01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:28.320
And of course there are
desks that have motors

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.460
and they're ones that have cranks,

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.060
and there are all sorts of variations,

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.470
both in terms of the
types and whether or not

01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:36.220
they have motors as well as
the cost to these things.

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.680
So they can go from very
low cost, like placing boxes

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.092
or books to create a standing desk,

01:21:41.092 --> 01:21:43.720
to very high cost in some cases.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.000
Now what's interesting,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.820
if you look at a scientific literature,

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.670
is that people who
decreased their sitting time

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:53.590
by about half each day.

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:55.730
So they took, let's say they were working

01:21:55.730 --> 01:21:59.530
for seven hours a day, three
and a half hours of that day,

01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:01.560
they decide to stand,
and it's not even clear

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.540
that it matters that they
do all those three hours

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.410
in one about, or they divide that up

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:07.010
into shorter bouts of a half an hour,

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:08.260
and then sit for half an hour, et cetera,

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.640
alternating back and forth
showed incredibly significant

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.880
effects on reduced neck and shoulder pain,

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.300
increase in subjective health,

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.820
vitality in a work-related environments.

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:22.625
And perhaps most importantly,
for sake of today's discussion

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:25.127
improvement in cognitive conditioning

01:22:25.127 --> 01:22:27.990
and the ability to embrace new tasks

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.870
and cognitive performance.

01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:32.050
There are several studies
that if one wanted to explore,

01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:34.220
they could explore this in more detail.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.560
I'll put a link to this as well.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.220
The article that I'm referring to

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.137
is called "Effects of a Workplace

01:22:40.137 --> 01:22:43.460
"Sit-Stand Desk Intervention
on Health and Productivity."

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.200
And I like this paper because
many of the papers out there

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.710
focus on the effects of
sit-stand desks on health

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:52.450
in trying to get people
to burn more calories,

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:54.140
improve their posture, relieve neck pain,

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.960
slumped over, et cetera,
but not on productivity.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.370
And this particular paper focuses

01:22:58.370 --> 01:23:00.500
also on the metrics of productivity,

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.340
it has its own study and also references

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.700
a number of important studies.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.910
What does this mean for you and me?

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:06.930
Well, I've long used a standing desk

01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:08.570
or some variation thereof.

01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:10.260
What this means is that
we should probably spend

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.167
about half of our work time standing

01:23:12.167 --> 01:23:14.460
and about half of it sitting,

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.830
but not all sitting or not all standing.

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:19.030
If you had to do all one or the other,

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:21.270
standing is going to
be better than sitting.

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:23.090
What happens if we just stand?

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:26.430
Well, that can also generate
some postural issues

01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:28.840
in terms of stabilization and fatigue.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.890
I have a good friend who's in the movement

01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:34.810
and physical rehabilitation
and physiology space,

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:37.700
his name is Kelly Starrett,
he's very impressive

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.530
in all those domains, and he always says,

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:41.870
we weren't designed to sit all day,

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:43.467
but we also weren't
designed to stand all day.

01:23:43.467 --> 01:23:45.490
And I think that's true,
if we were to look back

01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:49.010
at our species over tens or
hundreds of thousands of years,

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:52.060
we would find that indeed, we
did sit down, we did lie down.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.140
It wasn't that we were
standing all day long.

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:57.440
That said, almost everybody,
at least in the U.S.,

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.390
is not getting sufficient
cardiovascular exercise

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:02.690
or movement throughout the day.

01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:05.240
And standing at one's desk can improve

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.500
some of those health metrics, and again,

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.050
can improve productivity,
probably because of those

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.390
postural effects that
I talked about earlier,

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:15.420
that when we lie down, there
tends to be less alertness

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:18.400
in our brainstem, if you will
and there's less activation

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.480
of those brainstem circuits
involved in alertness.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.670
And indeed that circuits that involve

01:24:22.670 --> 01:24:26.150
a kind of a calming effect
on the body, get activated.

01:24:26.150 --> 01:24:30.260
And as we become upright,
standing or sitting,

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:33.490
but especially standing,
then those brainstem circuits

01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:35.580
for alertness kick on, which
are going to make it easier

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.055
to remain focused.

01:24:37.055 --> 01:24:39.260
If you are going to start standing

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.470
for half of your work time,

01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:42.460
you will notice that it
takes a few days to adapt.

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.930
You'll notice a lot of
shifting from side to side,

01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:46.330
definitely want to wear comfortable shoes.

01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.110
Some people do this on a wooden floor,

01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:50.270
other people feel uncomfortable
unless they're on carpet.

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.680
You have to figure out what works for you,

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.730
but it can take a little
bit of time to adapt.

01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:56.860
After say after now,
about 10 years of working

01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.508
at a sit-stand desk, I find
I can't sit for too long

01:24:59.508 --> 01:25:00.810
before I want to stand.

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.500
And my standing bouts can
be anywhere from 30 minutes

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.040
to two hours, although two hours
would be a little bit long.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.930
And then I catch myself
kind of leaning on the desk

01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:08.950
off to the side.

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.620
So again, the idea is to stand,

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:13.080
but not be leaning on the desk,

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.490
obviously, if you're
typing or you're writing,

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:15.730
there'll be some leaning involved,

01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:17.803
but that's what the literature support.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.960
There is also a literature
on whether or not

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.770
physical movement under your
desk, meaning treadmilling

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:26.730
or in fact, there are now bicycles

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.300
that allow people to peddle.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.060
It's kind of a unicycle like thing,

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:32.350
although not a unicycle under the desk,

01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:34.880
can be beneficial for
workplace performance.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.950
So let's take a look
at what those data say.

01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:39.350
The study that I'm referring
to has a first author,

01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:44.080
Frod Sham, F-R-O-D
S-H-A-M, Frod Sham et al.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.869
This is a research article
published in plus one,

01:25:47.869 --> 01:25:50.077
and the title of the article is,

01:25:50.077 --> 01:25:52.437
"Does Type of Active Workstation Matter:

01:25:52.437 --> 01:25:55.467
"A Randomized Comparison of
Cognitive and Typing Performance

01:25:55.467 --> 01:25:59.170
"Between Rest, Cycling and
Treadmill, Active Workstation."

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.420
It's amazing that people do this science,

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.770
I think it's great.

01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:04.090
Where else would we get peer-reviewed data

01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:05.960
on these types of questions?

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.030
First things first, there were
no significant differences

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.170
between cycling or treadmill workstations

01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:13.430
on any cognitive or typing outcomes.

01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:16.530
So it does not seem to
matter whether or not people

01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:18.300
are treadmilling under the desk.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:20.210
So these would be stationary treadmills,

01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:22.840
it's like a little conveyor
that people are walking on.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.790
Sometimes very slowly,
I'm guessing some people

01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:26.210
walk more quickly, the New Yorkers

01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:27.600
probably treadmill quicker.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.170
The California's probably
treadmill a little slower,

01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:33.270
I'm in Californian, so I can
make that quote unquote joke,

01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:35.900
but nonetheless, there were
no significant differences

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.250
between that and a cycling
station where people are sitting

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:41.450
and peddling as they type
away or as they work,

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:43.300
or as they're on phone calls, et cetera.

01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.410
So it really doesn't seem to matter.

01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:46.852
So if you're going to embrace
these active workstations,

01:26:46.852 --> 01:26:51.270
as they're called, just decide
what you would prefer to use.

01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:53.310
It doesn't seem to matter
in terms of outcomes.

01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:58.310
Now, this study involved
looking at 137 young adults.

01:27:00.483 --> 01:27:04.670
They had multiple sessions
where they at first completed

01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:06.380
cognitive and typing tests,

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.020
these tests have different
names, and you're welcome

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:11.200
to look those up if you like,
as well as flanker tasks,

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.880
so these are tasks of attention
and things of that sort.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.946
And then they either engaged
in treadmill or cycling

01:27:16.946 --> 01:27:19.070
and then there was a comparison.

01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:22.380
And the statistics were run,
and basically what they found

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.390
was there was a statistically
significant improvement

01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:27.880
in attention and cognitive control scores

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.590
during any kind of active session,

01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:32.320
as opposed to just a mere seated session.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.310
So they compared seated to
cycling to treadmilling.

01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:40.630
However, verbal memory
scores actually got worse

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:41.700
during active sessions.

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.150
So I'll repeat that, treadmilling

01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:47.830
or the cycling workstations,
improved attention

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:50.590
and cognitive control
scores as compared to people

01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:52.650
that were just seated and working.

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:55.550
However, verbal memory scores got worse

01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:57.810
during the active sessions,
and again, just to repeat,

01:27:57.810 --> 01:27:59.260
there was no difference between cycling

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.840
and treadmill workstations.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.163
So this is interesting, I
suggest that as the author say

01:28:03.163 --> 01:28:06.289
that active workstations,
whether walking or cycling

01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:09.100
are not only useful to
improve caloric output

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:12.210
and physical activity,
circulation and so on,

01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:15.420
but particularly when completing
tasks like cognitive tasks

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.710
or tasks that require
focus that do not require

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:18.830
verbal memory recall.

01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:23.070
Now why verbal memory recall
was negatively impacted,

01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:25.300
we don't know, it could be
because people were breathing

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.133
a little bit harder.

01:28:26.133 --> 01:28:27.800
It could be that there's
something about walking

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.900
and talking that seems
incompatible in the nervous system,

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:32.010
although I'm not aware of that.

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:33.760
I know a number of people
who can walk and talk

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.810
at the same time, but if
you are going to explore

01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:39.550
these treadmills or
you're going to explore

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:41.430
these cycling stations,
you probably wouldn't want

01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:43.640
to do that for highly verbal work,

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.410
maybe more for mathematical
work or for analytic work

01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:47.670
or even creative work.

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:50.650
But anything that involves
very precise or detailed

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:54.710
verbal recall, sitting or standing

01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:56.130
seems to be the better option.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:59.740
And if you're wondering
why cycling or treadmilling

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.970
would enhance various
aspects of cognition,

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.092
we can speculate.

01:29:04.092 --> 01:29:07.980
I've talked before about this,
but anytime we are generating

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:12.492
forward movement through our
own actions, our own efforts,

01:29:12.492 --> 01:29:15.160
typically, if we are outside,
we're not on a treadmill

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.150
or we're out on a bicycle or running,

01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:19.400
or even on a motorcycle or in a car,

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.010
we have what's called optic flow.

01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:24.392
And that optic flow is
known to quiet certain areas

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:27.130
of the brain that are
associated with vigilance

01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:27.963
and indeed fear.

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:30.670
This is the basis of things like EMDR,

01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:33.350
eye movement desensitization reprocessing.

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:37.250
However, the mere act of
engaging what are called

01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:38.680
our central pattern generators,

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.430
the neurons in our brain
stem and in our spinal cord

01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:45.170
that engage repetitive
movements also can reduce

01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:46.700
some of the areas of the
brain that are associated

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:47.860
with anxiety and vigilance.

01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:50.270
So one pure speculation, but nonetheless

01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.630
grounded speculation
would be that treadmilling

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:55.800
or cycling at a desk would reduce anxiety

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.770
that would allow performance to improve.

01:29:57.770 --> 01:30:00.780
The other, what I think
is more likely explanation

01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.890
is that anytime we are in ambulation,

01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:06.320
we recruit the release of
neuromodulators like epinephrin

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.390
dopamine and things of that
sort, that further increase

01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:10.700
overall levels of alertness.

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.310
I think that's the more likely explanation

01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:15.960
because it's hard to imagine
how just a reduction in anxiety

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.400
could lead to these
improvements in cognition

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.580
in a direct way.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.975
Whereas the subjects in
the study, I just mentioned

01:30:21.975 --> 01:30:24.930
on average experienced an increase

01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:27.930
in cognitive performance
merely by movement.

01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:30.420
And this does not include any optic flow

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.390
because it's stationary,

01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:33.320
the treadmill or the cycle is stationary.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.400
And so we can rule out that optic flow,

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.240
and that points to the idea
that when we are in movement,

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.920
we recruit neuromodulators
associated with the so-called

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.210
reticular activating system,

01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:45.040
the striatal system and so forth,

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.870
that would place the
brain into some pattern.

01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:50.160
We don't know, we only can
speculate some pattern,

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.790
perhaps it's gamma waves
or some other wave pattern

01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:55.600
that would engage heightened
levels of focus and attention.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.520
Nonetheless, treadmilling,
cycling at a desk,

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.980
does improve cognition.

01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.610
So we've been discussing
workspace optimization

01:31:03.610 --> 01:31:06.490
with the understanding that
you're not always going to work

01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:09.090
in the same place every day.

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.090
What I've tried to do is give you a set

01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:13.507
of high potency tools that
can improve your focus

01:31:13.507 --> 01:31:16.710
and cognition, and to place
that within a framework

01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:18.230
for particular kinds of work.

01:31:18.230 --> 01:31:20.330
Let's just review some
of the basic elements

01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:21.690
of what we've covered today.

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:24.270
First of all, in the
first part of your day,

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.380
that zero to nine hours after waking,

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.480
you want bright lights,
especially overhead lights,

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.840
as bright as you can keep them

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.330
without feeling uncomfortable,

01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:33.800
or certainly not without
feeling any pain in your eyes

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.320
or elsewhere in your body.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:39.900
Bright lights will make for
the maximum state of alertness.

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.103
In addition, try and place, whatever it is

01:31:42.103 --> 01:31:44.490
that you're focusing on
directly in front of you,

01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:45.960
but not have it extend too far out

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.380
to either side of your
eyes, try and generate

01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:51.490
a fairly restricted visual
window as we call it.

01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:54.900
And if you can, try and
place whatever it is

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.570
you're focusing on at least
at nose level or above,

01:31:57.570 --> 01:32:00.990
that it might take some
engineering or some ingenuity

01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:02.900
and creativity in order to
figure out how to do that,

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:05.030
but that's going to be most beneficial.

01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:07.670
Try and avoid reclining,
try and avoid sitting,

01:32:07.670 --> 01:32:11.040
try and stand for at least
half of your work day.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.790
That's a good goal, and
it may take some time

01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:14.510
to work up to that goal.

01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:16.990
In addition, if you're going to use sound

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:20.010
as a stimulus for increasing
focus and alertness,

01:32:20.010 --> 01:32:22.760
trying to avoid exposure
to white noise, pink noise

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.410
or brown noise for
extended periods of time,

01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:28.420
for more than an hour or so,
that might actually be damaging

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:29.930
to the auditory system.

01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:32.400
And at the very least,
is kind of stressful,

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.520
even though you might not notice it,

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.570
it's kind of a background
level of anxiety and stress

01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:37.210
that is not going to serve you well.

01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:39.900
Rather, if you're going
to pursue particular types

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:43.790
of sound frequencies consider
using 40 Hertz binaural beats,

01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:47.191
not monaural beats, but
40 Hertz binaural beats

01:32:47.191 --> 01:32:51.200
done during a particular
work about or for 30 minutes

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.200
prior to that work about.

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.010
I would not rely on binaural
beats all the time, every day,

01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:58.490
I think that could cause
them to lose their potency,

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:00.820
just because of the way the
auditory system attenuates.

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.550
And actually you've
experienced that attenuation,

01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:04.280
the mere fact that you
can go into an environment

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.370
where there's an air conditioner,
blowing, blowing, blowing,

01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:08.140
and then it stops, and
you feel that relaxation,

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.460
but you weren't thinking about
the air conditioner before,

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.820
it tells you that your auditory system

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.220
had kind of attenuated to it

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.360
and yet it was still
impacting your system.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.543
You were sensing it, we would
say, but not perceiving it.

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.650
There are other things that you can do

01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:23.510
to improve your workspace optimization

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:26.920
such as standing for half the
day, as I mentioned before,

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.800
but if you're interested in this

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.090
or you feel like it
suits you to treadmill,

01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:33.570
find a stationary treadmill
that you can walk on.

01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:36.310
I've never tried this before,
maybe after this episode,

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:38.320
given what I've read in
the peer-reviewed research,

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.840
and it's pretty compelling,
that treadmilling seems

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.317
like an interesting way
to increase alertness

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:45.516
and cognitive performance.

01:33:45.516 --> 01:33:47.740
I'm not sure that I would
do the cycling method

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.240
because I can't imagine just cycling

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.340
and typing at the same
time, that sort feels like,

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.040
like I actually can do the rub here,

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.930
tell me pat your head kind of thing.

01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:56.750
But it still feels like a little bit

01:33:56.750 --> 01:34:01.090
of a sort of a cognitive
motor collision for me

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:03.160
for whatever reason,
but that's just my bias.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.140
I do know how to ride
a bicycle, but anyway,

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.530
you pick your preference.

01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:07.810
Some other things that you could do

01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:10.670
in order to improve your
workplace performance

01:34:10.670 --> 01:34:13.100
would be to consider the cathedral effect.

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:16.210
If you're going to do analytic
work for any part of the day,

01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:18.200
phase one or phase two,
as I described them,

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.450
but really in any time of day,
that detailed analytic work

01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:23.310
for which there is a correct answer,

01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:25.380
learning scales of music,
learning mathematics,

01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:27.220
trying to figure out the
solution to a problem

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:28.720
where there is indeed a solution.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.110
It could be an interpersonal
problem as well,

01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:32.620
then try and get into an environment

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.140
with a relatively low ceiling.

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:36.120
If you don't have access to
a low ceiling environment,

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.070
you might consider using a
brimmed hat or even a hoodie,

01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:41.950
or even just facing down,
or even putting your hand

01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:46.142
above your eyes, as you will,
at the level of your eyebrows.

01:34:46.142 --> 01:34:48.300
In other words, lower the
ceiling, that's the basis

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:52.022
of the cathedral effects
on analytic performance.

01:34:52.022 --> 01:34:55.860
In contrast, if you're interested
in doing brainstorming,

01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.140
creative work, you're writing new things,

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.350
you're creating new things
of any kind, artwork,

01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:02.860
consider getting into a high ceiling

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.760
or no ceiling environment,
or if you're wearing

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.230
a brimmed hat or you're wearing a hoodie,

01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:08.960
maybe peel that back.

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.040
Again, the data within the
peer reviewed literature

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.920
are there to support
these sorts of practices.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.730
And if you'd like to start
layering these protocols,

01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:18.480
by all means, please do that.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.637
There's no reason why you couldn't do one

01:35:20.637 --> 01:35:22.980
or just two of these protocols.

01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.370
There's no reason why, for instance,

01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:26.980
you couldn't use binaural
beats and try and get

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.640
into a low ceiling environment
to do detailed work

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.760
a couple times a week,

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.040
but you could also employ all of these.

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.360
Now, of course, there are an
enormous number of other things

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.890
that you can do to
improve work performance

01:35:37.890 --> 01:35:39.680
and productivity, and
I've talked about those

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.120
in previous episodes, in particular,

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.620
in the episode on focus and
the episode on motivation,

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.560
there are supplements you can take

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.270
that can increase dopamine, for instance.

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:51.650
There are tools that you can
use to increase your focus,

01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:54.010
for instance, focusing
your visual attention

01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:56.750
on one location for 30 to 60 seconds

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.770
prior to entering a focused work about,

01:35:58.770 --> 01:36:00.600
this has been shown again and again.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:03.240
The work from Emily Bell, that's at NYU

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.710
in the episode on focus, I
cited a number of studies

01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:06.930
where this has actually been tested

01:36:06.930 --> 01:36:08.870
and deployed in various schools.

01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:11.540
Having kids do a focus
task where they look

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.770
at a particular visual
target for 30 to 60 seconds,

01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:15.950
then doing some mathematics and seeing

01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:18.380
pretty impressive improvement
in focus and attention,

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.470
even in people that
have attention deficit,

01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:22.830
hyperactivity disorder and so on.

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:26.300
So there's no reason why you
can't and shouldn't combine

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.500
the sort of practical workspace
optimization solutions

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.220
that we talked about today with the kind

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:34.260
of neural optimization
solutions that we talked about

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:36.607
in the episode on focus
and the episode on ADHD

01:36:36.607 --> 01:36:38.720
and the episode on motivation.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.400
By all means, layer those together,

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.410
that's how you're going to
achieve the optimal focus bouts,

01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:44.650
that's how you're going to achieve

01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:47.610
the optimal creativity bouts.

01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:50.350
I do want to acknowledge
again, the fact that I realized

01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:52.870
people are showing up to this challenge

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:54.950
of workspace optimization
with different budgets,

01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:55.940
with different constraints.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.130
Some people have kids at home,

01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:59.730
there are a lot of interruption,
some people do not.

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.410
Nonetheless, I hope that the information

01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:04.530
I was able to provide today will allow you

01:37:04.530 --> 01:37:07.660
to make subtle or maybe
even drastic rearrangements

01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.250
in your workspace environment.

01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:11.370
There's one other point related to that,

01:37:11.370 --> 01:37:13.470
that I did not cover and
that I'd like to cover

01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:16.160
just briefly, which is
that there's nothing to say

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.980
that you have to always
work in the same location

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:19.900
all the time.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.750
You can move from house to
cafe if that works for you,

01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:24.420
you can move from office to home,

01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:27.400
you can also move from different
locations within your home.

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.070
I have a brief anecdote about this.

01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:31.230
I used to attend a lot
of scientific meetings

01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:33.600
when a lot of scientific
meetings were in person,

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.395
and there were always a few individuals

01:37:35.395 --> 01:37:37.030
that seem to stay engaged

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:38.897
throughout these very long meetings.

01:37:38.897 --> 01:37:40.750
And we're talking seven, eight hour day,

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:44.410
sometimes evening sessions,
and sometimes these meetings

01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:47.530
would go on for, four or
five or even six days.

01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:49.970
These are long meetings
and the quality of talks

01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:52.610
vary tremendously, and I
always notice the individuals

01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:54.970
that manage to stay engaged and awake

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:57.410
for the entire meeting.

01:37:57.410 --> 01:38:00.560
And I noticed that people
that could maintain

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.770
high levels of alertness
in this one conference room

01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:06.590
had a habit of moving to a different seat

01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.200
after each session,
sometimes even between talks.

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.290
And I actually discussed this
with one of my colleagues

01:38:11.290 --> 01:38:13.690
who was doing this, I
said, is this conscious,

01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:14.730
are you always moving from place to place?

01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:16.450
And he said, yeah, if I
just stay in one place

01:38:16.450 --> 01:38:18.470
and I just look from this
one particular visual angle

01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:20.650
of the screen, I find
after one or two talks,

01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:23.170
regardless of how
interesting the talks are,

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:26.050
that I start take on of draft,
my mind isn't as engaged

01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:27.470
and indeed, sometimes can fall asleep.

01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:29.110
And so I started this practice of moving

01:38:29.110 --> 01:38:31.210
from space to space, or I should say,

01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:33.620
seat to seat within an auditorium
and it works quite well.

01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:35.930
And I think it works
quite well because again,

01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:38.630
of the relationship
between our visual system

01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:40.773
driving the majority of our cognition,

01:38:40.773 --> 01:38:43.017
our visual system drives our thinking

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:45.960
and that novel visual environments

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.070
are going to lend themselves

01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:49.340
to heightened levels of alertness.

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.570
Now, you don't want things
to be so novel and scary

01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:53.810
or threatening or
anxiety-provoking or loud

01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:55.790
that they draw your attention
away from your work.

01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:58.580
But I think this is part of
the reason why turning on music

01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:02.390
or moving to an office or a
cafe or an outdoor environment

01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:04.550
from an indoor environment or vice versa,

01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:06.910
maybe even within a single
day, can bring about

01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:09.010
more heightened levels of productivity.

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:11.066
I'd also like to acknowledge
that what I covered today

01:39:11.066 --> 01:39:14.240
is most certainly not exhaustive

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.780
for all the types of
workspace optimization tools

01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.323
that one could create.

01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:21.620
For that reason, I'd
love for you to suggest

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.390
any of your workspace optimization tools

01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.510
that you found useful.

01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:26.580
Please put those in the
comment section on YouTube,

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.960
that would be the best place
than other people can see them.

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.240
Also read through those, and
perhaps in a future episode,

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.020
I'll call about some of
the ones that I've tried

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.870
on the basis of your suggestions.

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:38.130

We also have an Instagram
and a Twitter account,

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.450
it's Huberman Lab, and
there I teach neuroscience

01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:23.320
and neuroscience related tools.

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.430
Oftentimes that information
and those tools overlap

01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.430
with themes on the podcast,
but sometimes they are distinct

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.550
from themes and topics
covered on the podcast.

So please follow us on
Instagram and Twitter.

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.390
This episode, we didn't talk
too much about supplements,

01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:39.200
but on many previous episodes
of The Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.210
we talk about supplementation
and while supplementation

01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:44.220
isn't required or great for everybody,

01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:47.690
some people do derive tremendous
benefit from supplements.

01:40:47.690 --> 01:40:50.200
We talked about supplements
for focus, for sleep,

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.241
for creativity, all sorts of things.

01:40:52.241 --> 01:40:54.240
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.240
you can go to Thorne, that's
T-H-O-R-N-E.com/U/Huberman,

01:40:59.450 --> 01:41:01.100
there, you can see the
supplements that I take,

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.200
you can get 20% off those supplements.

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.390
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site,

01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:10.340
through that portal, Thorne
thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.720
you can also get 20% off.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.340
Any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes.

01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.000
The reason we partner with Thorne

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.620
is because one of the major issues

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.270
in the supplement industry is
that many of the supplements

01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:23.550
out there don't contain
sufficient quantity,

01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:25.720
or they contain too much
of a given supplement.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.030
And the quality of the
ingredients can vary tremendously.

01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:31.560
With Thorne supplements,
there is immense stringency

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.470
in terms of the quality of the ingredients

01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:35.850
and the precision of the
amounts of those ingredients

01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:37.820
that they include in each product.

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.480
Once again, thank you for
joining me for this discussion

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.640
about the science and
peer-reviewed literature

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.290
on workspace optimization.

01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:46.570
I hope some, if not, all of the tools

01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:49.030
will be beneficial for you, and as always

01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:50.879
thank you for your interest in science.

01:41:50.879 --> 01:41:53.462
