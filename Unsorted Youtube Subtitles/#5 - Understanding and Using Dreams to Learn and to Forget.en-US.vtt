00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.320
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.780
where we discuss science

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.973
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:09.800
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.400
and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.950
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.150
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.700
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.370
It is however, part of my
desire to bring you zero cost

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.330
to consumer information about science

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.853
and science related tools.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.040
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.790
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.280
Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.130
Helix Sleep makes mattresses

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.890
that are ideally suited
to your sleep needs.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040
Helix mattresses are amazing.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.160
I can say this because
I've been sleeping on one

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.780
and I've been sleeping better
than I've ever slept before.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.410
The interesting thing
about Helix mattresses

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.520
is that they're tailored
to your unique body type

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.280
and sleeping style.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.290
What's a sleeping style?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.520
Well, if you go to the Helix site

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.430
you can take a quick quiz,
it takes about two minutes,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.910
as to whether or not you sleep on

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.740
your stomach, your side, your back,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.980
whether or not you flip back and forth,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.470
or whether or not you don't
know in what position you sleep,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.600
as well as whether or not you
tend to run hot or run cold,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.480
wake up cold, wake up hot, et cetera.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.560
If you do that then it will
match you to the mattress

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.860
that's perfect for your sleep needs.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.530
If you wanna try a Helix mattress,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.570
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.850
And if you do that, you'll
get $200 off your order

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.290
as well as two free pillows.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.900
That's helixsleep.com/huberman.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.510
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.250
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.150
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.950
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.440
and I started using it because
I had a lot of confusion

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.780
about what vitamins and
minerals I should take.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.980
And taking Athletic Greens

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.710
allowed me to get the foundation

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.220
or sort of the base of everything I need

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.280
in one easy to consume formula.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.320
It tastes great.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.210
I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.680
and I like drinking it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.430
And the probiotics in there
are important to me as well,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.720
because there are a lot
of data out there now

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840
identifying the gut microbiome

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.270
and the importance of the gut-brain axis

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.950
for immune function, metabolic
function and so forth.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.720
If you want to try Athletic Greens

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.320
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.440
And if you do that they'll
also send you a year supply

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.540
of liquid vitamin D3, K2.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.280
There are a lot of data
starting to surface

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.550
about the importance of vitamin D3

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.260
for immune function, metabolic
function, endocrine function,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.410
and so forth.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.950
In addition, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.860
you'll get the year supply of D3 and K2

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.520
as well as five free travel packs,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.180
which are a little
packets of Athletic Greens

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.850
in addition to your normal order.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.790
And those are great for
when you're on the plane,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.270
or you're otherwise traveling.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.144
They mix up really easily without any

00:02:50.144 --> 00:02:52.070
mess or the needs of spoon out powder

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.320
and things of that sort.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.160
So the things that are easy to do at home

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.300
are kind of harder on the road,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.750
those packets make it
easy while on the road.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.320
Today we're gonna talk about dreaming,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.250
learning during dreaming

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.550
and unlearning during dreaming.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.000
In particular unlearning of
troubling emotional events.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.490
Now my interest in dreaming goes way back.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.270
When I was a child I had a friend

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.920
and he came over one day and
he brought with him a mask

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.210
that had a little red light in the corner.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.160
He had purchased this thing through some

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.510
magazine ad that he had seen,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.280
and this mask was supposed
to trigger lucid dreaming.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.080
Lucid dreaming is the experience
of dreaming during sleep,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.180
but being aware that one is dreaming.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.570
And in some cases being
able to direct one's

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.803
dream activities.

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:43.870
So if you're in a lucid dream

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.590
and you wanna fly, for instance,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.340
some people report being able to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.730
initiate that experience of flying.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.200
Or to contort themselves into an animal,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.340
or to transport themselves
to wherever they want

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.630
within the dream.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.730
I tried this device.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.886
The way it worked is you put on the mask

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.680
during a waking state, I'm wide awake,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.830
and you look at the little
light flashing in the corner,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.830
and then you'd also wear it
when you went to sleep at night.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.180
And indeed, while I was asleep
I could see the red light

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.420
presumably through my eyelids.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.040
Although, for all I know
I had opened my eyes.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.460
I don't know I was asleep.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.280
And then, because I was dreaming

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.480
and I was experiencing
something very vivid,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.760
I was able to recognize
that I was dreaming

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.630
and then start to direct

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.480
some of the events within that dream.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.620
Now lucid dreaming occurs
in about 20% of people

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.900
and in a small percentage of those people

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.850
they lucid dream almost every night.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.940
So much so that many of them report

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.130
their sleep not being as restorative

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.410
as it would be otherwise.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.720
Now all of this is to say that,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.170
lucid dreaming and dreaming
are profound experiences.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.135
We tend to feel extremely

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:53.370
attached to our dream experience.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.029
This may explain the phenomenon of

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.950
people who have a very intense dream

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.120
they need to somehow tell
everybody about that dream,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.330
or tell someone about that dream.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.780
I don't really know what
that behavior is about,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.770
but sometimes we wake up and we feel

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.160
so attached to what happened

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.060
in this state that we call dreaming

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.500
that there seems to be an intense need

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.580
to share it with other people,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.300
presumably to process
it and make sense of it.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.820
Now numerous people throughout history

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.420
have tried to make sense of dreams

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.590
in some sort of organized way.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.960
The most famous of which of
course is a Sigmund Freud

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.650
who talked about symbolic
representations in dreams.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.740
A lot of that has been kind of debunked.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.195
Although, I think that

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:31.140
there's some interest in what
the symbols of dreaming are.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.540
And this is something
that we'll talk about

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.264
in more depth today, although not Freud

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:38.340
in theory, in particular.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.100
So I think in order to
really think about dreams

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.260
and what to do with them

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.010
and how to maximize the dream experience

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.490
for sake of learning and unlearning,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.980
the best way to address this

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.930
is to look at the physiology of sleep,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.800
to really address what do we
know concretely about sleep.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.080
So first of all, as we get sleepy

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.280
we tend to shut our eyes, and
that's 'cause there's some

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.680
autonomic centers in
the brain, some neurons

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.310
that control closing of the
eyelids when we get sleepy.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.120
And then we transitioned into sleep.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.930
And sleep, regardless of how long we sleep

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.360
is generally broken up into
a series of 90 minute cycles.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.840
These ultradian cycles.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.610
So early in the night
these 90 minute cycles

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.490
tend to be comprised more of shallow sleep

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.760
and slow wave sleep.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.470
So stage one, stage two, et cetera,

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.920
and what we call slow wave sleep.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.490
I'll go into detail about what
all this means in a moment.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.750
And we tend to have less
so-called REM sleep, R-E-M sleep,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.800
which stands for rapid eye movement sleep.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.380
And I'll talk about rapid
eye movement sleep in detail.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.220
So early in the night, a
lot more slow wave sleep

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.980
and less REM.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.409
For every 90 minute cycle that we have

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.825
during a night of sleep we tend to

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:55.240
start having more and more REM sleep.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.780
So more of that 90 minute cycle

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.490
is comprised of REM sleep
and less of slow wave sleep.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.350
Now this is true regardless
of whether or not

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.750
you wake up in the middle of
the night to use the restroom

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.253
or your sleep is broken.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.810
The more sleep you're
getting across the night,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.940
the more REM sleep you're going to have.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.730
And REM sleep and non
REM, as I'll refer to it,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.560
have distinctly different roles
in learning and unlearning,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.830
and they are responsible
for learning and unlearning

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.300
of distinctly different
types of information.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.610
And this has enormous implications

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.723
for learning of motor skills,

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:31.530
for unlearning of traumatic events,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.690
or for processing emotionally challenging

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.430
as well as emotionally pleasing events.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.240
And as we'll see, one
can actually leverage

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.330
their daytime activities
in order to access

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.010
more slow wave sleep or non
REM sleep as we'll call it,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.750
or more REM sleep depending
on your particular

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.680
emotional and physical needs.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.590
So it's really a remarkable stage of life

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.290
that we have a lot more
control and power over

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.950
then you might believe.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.550
We'll also talk about lucid dreaming.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.800
We're also gonna talk about hallucinations

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.120
and how drug induced hallucinations

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.140
have a surprising similarity
to a lot of dream states

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.573
and yet some really important differences.

00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.200
Okay. So let's start by
talking about slow wave sleep,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.467
or non REM sleep.

00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:17.550
And I realized that slow
wave sleep and non REM sleep

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.990
aren't exactly the same thing.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.100
So for you sleep aficionados out there,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.470
I am lumping right now.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.303
As we say in science,

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:26.370
there are lumpers and there
are splitters and I am both.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.500
Sometimes I lump, sometimes I split.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.840
For sake of clarity and ease
of conversation right now

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.520
I'm gonna be a lumper.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.010
When I say slow wave sleep, I
mean non REM sleep generally.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.740
Although, I acknowledge
there is a distinction.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.670
Slow wave sleep.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.642
So slow wave sleep is characterized

00:08:43.642 --> 00:08:47.208
by a particular pattern of brain activity

00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:50.470
in which the brain is
metabolically active,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.430
but that there's these big
sweeping waves of activity

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.850
that include a lot of the brain.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.810
If you wanna look this up
you can find evidence for

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.650
sweeping of waves of neural activity

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.870
across association cortex,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.710
across big swaths of the brainstem,

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.930
the so-called pons
geniculate occipital pathway.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.381
This is brainstem,
thalamus, and then cortex

00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:18.730
for those of you that are interested.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.820
Although, more of that is
going to occur in REM sleep.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.220
Now the interesting thing
about slow wave sleep

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.150
are the neuromodulators that
tend to be associated with it,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.110
that are most active and least active

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.940
during slow wave sleep and here's why.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.720
To remind you neuromodulators
are these chemicals

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.700
that act rather slowly but their main role

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.940
is to bias particular
brain circuits to be active

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.070
and other brain circuits to not be active.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.890
These are like the music playlist.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.150
So think of neuromodulators

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.460
and these come in the names of,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.360
acetylcholine, norepinephrine,
serotonin, and dopamine,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.020
think of them as suggesting
playlists on your audio device.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.550
So, you know, classical music is

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.130
distinctly different in feel and tone

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.770
and a number of other features
from like third wave punk,

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.300
or from, you know, hip hop, right?

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.620
So think of them as biasing

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.630
toward particular genres of
neural circuit activity, okay.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.070
Mellow music versus really
aggressive fast music,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.850
or rhythmic music that includes lyrics

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.690
versus rhythmic music that
doesn't include lyrics.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.680
It's more or less the way

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.000
to think about these neuromodulators.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.920
And they are associated as a consequence

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.520
with certain brain functions.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.660
So we know for instance
and just to review,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.160
acetylcholine in waking states

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.400
is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.720
the activity of brain circuits

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.320
associated with focus and attention.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.580
Norepinephrine is a
neuromodulator that tends to

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.960
amplify the brain circuits
associated with alertness,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.630
and the desire to move.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.591
Serotonin is the neuromodulator

00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:54.060
that's released intense to amplify the

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.690
circuits in the brain and body

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.410
that are associated with bliss

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.630
and the desire to remain still.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.902
And dopamine is the neuromodulator

00:11:01.902 --> 00:11:04.313
that's released and is associated with

00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:07.300
amplification of the neural
circuits in the brain and body

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.080
associated with pursuing
goals and pleasure and reward.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.330
Okay. So in slow wave sleep

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.110
something really interesting happens.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.770
There is essentially no acetylcholine.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.810
Acetylcholine production
and release and action

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.032
from the two major sites,
which are in the brainstem,

00:11:26.032 --> 00:11:29.540
which from a nucleus if it's
a parabigerminal nucleus,

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.458
if you really wanna know,
or from the forebrain,

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.550
which is nucleus basalis.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.750
And you don't need to know these names

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.380
but if you like, that's
why I put them out there.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.890
Acetylcholine production plummets.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.960
It's just almost to zero.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.930
And acetylcholine as I just mentioned,

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.860
is associated with focus.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.480
So you can think of slow wave sleep

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.210
as these big sweeping waves
of activity through the brain

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.680
and a kind of distortion
of space and time,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.770
so that we're not really
focusing on any one thing.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.500
Now the other molecules that
are very active at that time

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.980
are norepinephrine.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.610
Which is a little bit surprising 'cause

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.251
normally in waking states norepinephrine

00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:07.498
is gonna be associated with

00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:10.940
a lot of alertness and the desire to move.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.370
But there's not a ton of norepinephrine

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.450
around in slow wave
sleep, but it is around.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.380
So there's something associated
with the movement circuitry

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.310
going on in slow wave sleep.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.860
And remember, this is happening mostly

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.990
at the beginning of the night,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.480
your sleep is dominated
by slow wave sleep.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.060
So no acetylcholine, very
little norepinephrine,

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.820
although there is some
and a lot of serotonin.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.440
And serotonin again is
associated with this desire,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.380
this sensation of kind
of bliss or wellbeing,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.440
but not a lot of movement.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.170
And during sleep you tend not to move.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.160
Now in slow wave sleep you can
move, you're not paralyzed.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.640
So you can roll over.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.560
If people are going to sleep walk,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.350
typically it's going to
be during slow wave sleep.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.094
And what studies have shown through some

00:12:54.094 --> 00:12:56.430
kind of sadistic experiments

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.627
where people are deprived
specifically of slow wave sleep,

00:12:59.627 --> 00:13:02.170
and that can be done by waking them up

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.200
as soon as the electrode recording show

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.770
that they're in slow wave sleep

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.390
or by chemically altering their sleep

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.120
so that it biases them
away from slow wave sleep.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.660
What studies have shown
is that motor learning

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.120
is generally occurring in slow wave sleep.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.720
So let's say the day
before you go to sleep

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.650
you were learning some new dance move,

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.340
or you were learning some
specific motor skill,

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.380
either a fine motor skill
or a course motor skill.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.390
So let's say, it's a new form of exercise

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.680
or some new coordinated movements.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.280
This could be coordinate movement

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.570
at the level of the fingers,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.620
or it could be coordinated
movement the level of whole body

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.560
and large limb movements.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.490
It could involve other people,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.400
or it could be a solo activity.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.230
Learning of those skills

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.770
is happening primarily
during slow wave sleep

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.640
in the early part of the night.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.640
In addition, slow wave sleep

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.100
has been shown to be important

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.240
for the learning of detailed information.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.390
Now this isn't always
cognitive information.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.930
We're gonna talk about
cognitive information,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.830
but the studies that have been done

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.370
along these lines involve having people

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.890
learn very detailed information

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.410
about very specific rules

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.720
and the way that certain
words are spelled,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.410
they tend to be challenging words.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:20.410
So if people are tested and
in terms of their performance

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.931
on these types of exams

00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:24.480
and they're deprived of slow wave sleep,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.620
they tend to perform very poorly.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.450
So we can think of slow wave sleep

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.790
as important for motor learning,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.930
motor skill learning

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.410
and for the learning of specific details

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.430
about specific events.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.240
And this turns out to be
fundamentally important

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.699
because now we know that

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:45.080
slow wave sleep is primarily
in the early part of the night,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.320
and motor learning is occurring primarily

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.130
early in the night, and
detailed learning is

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.780
occurring early in the night.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.460
Now for those of you that are waking up

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.290
after only three, four hours of sleep,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.730
this might be informative.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.970
This might tell you a
little something about

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.350
what you are able to learn
and not able to learn

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.700
if that were to be the
only sleep that you get.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.490
Although, hopefully that's not
the only sleep that you get.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.635
But we're going to dive deep into

00:15:08.635 --> 00:15:11.984
how it is that one can
maximize motor learning

00:15:11.984 --> 00:15:14.900
in order to extract say,

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.820
more detail information
about coordinated movements

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.860
and how to make them faster or slower.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.720
So that might be important
for certain sports.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.873
It might be almost certainly
important for certain sports.

00:15:26.747 --> 00:15:28.990
It's gonna be important for

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.330
any kind of coordinated movement,

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.180
like say learning to play the piano,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.810
or for instance, how to

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.610
learn synchronized movements
with somebody else.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.473
So maybe I mentioned the
example of dance earlier.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.810
Like me a few years ago,

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.580
I set out to learn tango
because I have some Argentine

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.330
relatives and I was a Bismal.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.280
I need to return to that at some point.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.295
I was just a Bismal.

00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:55.128
And one of the worst things

00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:56.193
about being a bismal at
learning dance is that,

00:15:56.193 --> 00:15:59.170
that somebody else has to
suffer the consequences also.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.950
So I don't know maybe in the
month on neuroplasticity,

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.210
I'll explore that again
as a self experimentation.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.860
But, the key things to know are

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.320
slow wave sleep is
involved in motor learning

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.850
and detailed learning.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.360
There's no acetylcholine
around at that time,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.530
has these big amplitude activity

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.280
sweeping throughout the
brain and that there's

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.670
the release of these neuromodulators,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.090
norepinephrine and serotonin.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.760
And again, that's all
happening early in the night.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.680
So athletes, people that are
concerned about performance,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.250
if you happen to wake up
after just a couple hours of,

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.150
you know, three, four hours of sleep

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.160
because you're excited about
a competition the next day,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.360
presumably if you've already trained

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.510
the skills that you need for the event

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.430
you should be fine to engage
in that particular activity.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.310
Now it's always going to be better

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.230
to get a full night's sleep.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.890
And that, you know, a full night's sleep

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.100
for you is six hours then
it's always gonna be better

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.820
to get more sleep than it is to get less.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.886
However, I think some people

00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:02.910
get a little bit overly concerned

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.450
that if they didn't get
their full night's sleep

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.270
before some sort of physical event

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.880
that their performance
is going to plummet.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.180
Presumably, if you've already
learned what you need to do,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.740
and it's stored in your neural circuits

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.543
and you know how to make
those coordinated movements,

00:17:15.543 --> 00:17:18.230
what the literature on slow
wave sleep suggest is that

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.330
you would be replenished.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.820
That the motor learning and
the recovery from exercise

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.380
is going to happen early
in the night. Okay.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.090
So we'll just pause there,

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.847
and kind of shelve that for a moment

00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:28.950
and then we're gonna come back to it.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.660
But I wanna talk about REM sleep,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.800
or rapid eye movement sleep.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.570
REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.000
as I mentioned before,
occurs throughout the night,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.500
but you're gonna have more of it.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.040
A larger percentage of
these 90 minute sleep cycles

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.070
is going to be comprised of REM sleep

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.630
as you get toward morning.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.200
REM sleep is fascinating.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.010
It was discovered in '50s when

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.252
a sleep laboratory in Chicago,

00:17:52.252 --> 00:17:54.370
the researchers observed

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.870
that people's eyes were
moving under their eyelids.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.130
Now, something very important
that we're going to address

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.020
when we talk about trauma later is that,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.410
the eye movements are
not just side to side

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.070
they're very erratic in
all different directions.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.366
One thing that I don't think

00:18:09.366 --> 00:18:12.230
I've never heard anyone
really talk about publicly is,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.970
why eye movements during
sleep, right? Eyes are closed.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.960
And sometimes people's eyelids
will be a little bit open

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.980
and their eyes are darting around,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.250
especially in little kids.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.600
I don't suggest you do this.
I'm not even sure it's ethical.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.390
But, it has been done where you, you know,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.170
pull back the eyelids of a
kid while they're sleeping

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.010
and their eyes are kind of
darting all over the place.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.010
I think people do this to
their passed out friends

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.310
at parties and things like that.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.440
So again, I don't suggest you do it,

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.000
but I'm telling you it
because it's been done before

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.520
and therefore you don't
have to do it again.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.650
But rapid eye movement
sleep is fascinating

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.240
and occurs because there are connections

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.947
between the brainstem,
an area called the pons,

00:18:47.947 --> 00:18:52.910
and areas of the thalamus
and the top of the brain stem

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.460
that are involved in generating movements

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.540
in different directions,
sometimes called saccades.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.410
Although, sometimes during
rapid eye movement sleep

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.260
it's not just rapid,
it's kind of a jittery

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.550
side to side thing and then
the eyeballs kind of role.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.120
It's really pretty creepy
to look at if you see.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.970
So what's happening there is

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.420
the circuitry that is involved
in conscious eye movements

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.590
is kind of going haywire,
but it's not haywire.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.210
It's these waves of
activity from the brainstem

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.029
up to the so-called thalamus,
which is an area that

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:23.570
filter sensory information
and then up to the cortex.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.880
And the cortex of course,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.490
is involved in conscious perceptions.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.540
So in rapid eye movement sleep

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.536
there are a couple of things are happening

00:19:31.536 --> 00:19:33.360
besides rapid eye movements.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.480
The main ones are that
they're, I should say,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.210
in contrast to slow wave sleep.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.210
In REM sleep serotonin is
essentially absent. Okay?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.940
So this molecule, this neuromodulator

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.970
that tends to create the
feeling of bliss and wellbeing

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:54.620
and just calm placidity is absent.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.350
All right. So that's interesting.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.640
In addition to that,
norepinephrine this molecule

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.700
that's involved in movement and alertness

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.360
is absolutely absent.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.444
It's probably one of the few times

00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:10.713
in our life that epinephrin is essentially

00:20:10.713 --> 00:20:14.020
at zero activity within our system.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.070
And that has a number of
very important implications

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.875
for the sorts of dreaming that occur

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:23.200
during REM sleep and the sorts
of learning that can occur

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.560
in REM sleep and unlearning.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.235
First of all in REM
sleep, we are paralyzed.

00:20:27.235 --> 00:20:30.087
We are experiencing what's called atonia,

00:20:30.087 --> 00:20:31.160
which just means that

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.080
we're completely laid out and paralyzed.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.360
We also tend to experience

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.003
whatever it is that we're dreaming about

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:40.570
as a kind of hallucination,

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.683
or a hallucinatory activity.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.520
Long ago I looked into
hallucinations and dreaming

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.810
I was just fascinated
by this in high school.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.110
And there's some great books on this

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.269
if you're interested in

00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:54.080
exploring the relationship between

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.154
hallucinations and dreaming.

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.170
The most famous of which are from a guy,

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.591
a researcher at Harvard, Alan Hobson,

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.530
you know, wrote a book
called, Dream Drug Store.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.390
And talked all about
the similarities between

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.550
drugs that induce hallucinations
and dreaming in REM.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.480
So you can explore that if you like.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.510
So in REM our eyes are moving,

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.610
but the rest of our body is paralyzed

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.320
and we are hallucinating.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.150
There's no epinephrin around.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.520
Epinephrin doesn't just create

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.740
a desire to move and alertness.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.740
It is also the chemical
signature of fear and anxiety.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.522
It's what's released
from our adrenal glands

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:38.650
when we experience something
that's fearful or alerting.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.660
So if a car suddenly
screeches in front of us,

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.402
or we get a troubling text message,

00:21:42.402 --> 00:21:44.630
adrenaline is deployed into our system.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.490
Adrenaline is epinephrin,
those are equivalent molecules.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.230
And epinephrin isn't just
released from our adrenals

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.360
it's also released within our brain.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.022
So there's this weird stage of our life

00:21:56.022 --> 00:22:00.030
that happens more toward
morning, that we call REM sleep,

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.074
where we're hallucinating

00:22:02.074 --> 00:22:05.900
and having these outrageous
experiences in our mind,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.715
but the chemical that's
associated with fear and panic

00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:13.610
and anxiety is not available to us.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.800
And that turns out to be very important.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.756
And you can imagine why that's important.

00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:22.898
It's important because it
allows us to experience things,

00:22:22.898 --> 00:22:27.177
both replay of things
that did occur as well as

00:22:27.177 --> 00:22:31.100
elaborate contortions of
things that didn't occur.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.210
And it allows us to experience those

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.580
in the absence of fear and anxiety,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.419
and that it turns out is very important

00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:42.510
for adjusting our emotional relationship

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.010
to challenging things that happened to us

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.840
while we were awake.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.180
Those challenging things can
sometimes be in the form of

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.510
social anxiety, or just
having been working very hard

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.990
or concern about an upcoming event,

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.500
or sometimes people report for instance,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.610
dreams where they find
themselves late to an exam,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.594
or naked in public, or
in some sort of situation

00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:10.300
that would be very troubling to them.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.940
And that almost certainly
occurs during REM sleep.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.970
So we have this incredible period of sleep

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.460
in which our experience of
emotionally laid in events

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.680
is dissociated. It's chemically blocked

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.970
from us having the actual emotion.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.317
Now probably immediately
some of you are thinking,

00:23:31.317 --> 00:23:32.360
"Well, what about nightmares?

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.540
I have nightmares and those
carry a lot of emotion,

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.490
or sometimes I'll wake up in a panic."

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.560
Let's consider each of
those two things separately

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.333
because they are important
in understanding REM sleep.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.840
There's a good chance that nightmares

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.920
are occurring slow wave sleep.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.750
There are actually some drugs

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.130
that I don't suggest people take.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.280
In fact so much so I'm
not gonna mention them

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.593
that give people very

00:23:55.593 --> 00:23:59.280
kind of scary or eerie
dreams and this kind of

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.892
feeling that things are pursuing them,

00:24:02.892 --> 00:24:06.510
or that they can't move
when they are being chased.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.290
That's actually a common
dream that I've had.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.220
I guess, it's more or less a nightmare.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.030
The feeling that one is paralyzed

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.590
and can't move and is being chased.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.360
A lot of people have said, "Oh,
that must be in REM sleep."

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.860
Because you're paralyzed and so

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.620
you're dreaming about being
paralyzed and you can't move.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.100
I think that's probably false.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.830
The research says that
because no epinephrine

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.370
is absent during REM sleep,

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.030
it's very unlikely that you can have these

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.770
intense, fearful memories.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.290
So those are probably
occurring in slow wave sleep.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.560
Although, there might be instances

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.290
where people have nightmares in REM sleep.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.490
The other thing is some people experience,

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.030
certainly I've had this experience,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.170
of waking up and feeling very stressed

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.990
about whatever it was that I
happen to be thinking about,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.690
or dreaming about in the moments before.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.100
And that's an interesting
case of an invasion

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.760
of the dream state into the waking state

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.997
and the moment you wake up
epinephrine is available.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:02.680
So the research on this
isn't fully crystallized,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.850
but most of it points in the direction of

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:09.250
the experience of waking up
and feeling very panicked.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.600
Maybe, I wanna highlight may,

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.750
but maybe that you were
experiencing something

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.630
that was troubling in the daytime,

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.200
you're repeating that
experience in your sleep,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.750
epinephrine is not available,

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.210
and therefore the brain
circuits associated

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.210
with fear and anxiety are shut off.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.900
And so you're able to process those events

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.400
and then suddenly you wake up

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.280
and there's a surge of
adrenaline of epinephrin

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.410
that's now coupled to that experience.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.080
So nightmares very
likely in slow wave sleep

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.750
and that kind of panic
on waking from something

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.410
very likely to be an invasion
of the thoughts and ideas,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.950
however distorted in REM sleep
invading the waking state.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.300
In fact, that brings to mind something

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.820
that I've mentioned once before,
but I wanna mention again,

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.390
this atonia, this paralysis
that we experience during sleep

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.373
can invade the waking state.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.920
Many people report the
experience of waking up

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.161
and being paralyzed.

00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:07.930
They're legitimately waking
up, it's not a dream.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.750
Waking up and being paralyzed,
and it is terrifying.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.070
I've had this happen before.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.550
It is I can tell you
terrifying to be wide awake,

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.540
and as far as I could
tell fully conscious,

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.080
but unable to move.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.660
And then generally you can
jolt yourself out of it

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.670
in a few seconds, but
it is quite frightening.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.870
Now some people actually
experience waking up,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.360
being fully paralyzed and hallucinating.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.150
And there is a theory in the

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.470
academic and scientific
community at least,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.510
that what people report
as alien abductions

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.974
have a certain number of
core characteristics that map

00:26:45.974 --> 00:26:50.420
quite closely, yearly
similarly to these experiences.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.190
A lot of reports of
alien abduction involve

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.279
people being unable to move,
seeing particular faces,

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:59.730
hallucinating, extensively feeling

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.040
like their body is floating,
or they were transported.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.950
This is very similar to
the experience of invasion

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.560
of atonia into the waking state,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.480
waking up and still being paralyzed.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.590
As well as the hallucinations that

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.190
are characteristic of
dreaming and REM sleep.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.612
Now I'm not saying that people's

00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:20.500
alien abductions were not
legitimate alien abductions,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.516
how could I, I wasn't there.

00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:24.870
And if I was there I wouldn't tell you

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.520
'cause that would make me an alien,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.220
and I wouldn't want you to know.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.470
But it is quite possible

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.206
that people are experiencing these things

00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:36.010
and they are an invasion
of the sleep state

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.250
into the waking state

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.700
and they can last several
minutes or longer.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.690
And because in dreams, space
and time are distorted,

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.130
our perception of these events

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.080
could be that they lasted many hours

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.940
and we can really feel as
if they lasted many hours,

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.200
when in fact they took only moments.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.300
And we're gonna return to
distortion of space and time

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.520
in a little bit.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.303
So to just recap we've gone so far.

00:27:58.303 --> 00:28:00.960
Slow wave sleep early in the night.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.750
It's been shown to be
important for motor learning

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.670
and for detailed learning.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.530
REM sleep has a certain dream component

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.570
when which there's no epinephrin,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.380
therefore we can't experience anxiety,

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.830
we are paralyzed.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.320
Those dreams tend to be really vivid

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.560
and have a lot of detail to them.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.900
And yet in REM sleep what's very clear

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.400
is that the sorts of learning
that happened in REM sleep

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.770
are not motor events.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.150
It's more about unlearning
of emotional events.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.070
And now we know why,

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.113
because the chemicals available for

00:28:32.113 --> 00:28:36.720
really feeling those
emotions are not present.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.920
Now that has very important implications.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.600
So let's address those
implications from two sides.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.700
First of all we should ask,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.420
what happens if we don't
get enough REM sleep?

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.690
And a scenario that happens a lot

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.730
where people don't get enough
REM sleep is the following.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.060
I'll just explain the one
that I'm familiar with

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.660
'cause it happens to me a lot,

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.000
although I figured out ways to adjust.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.940
I go to sleep around 10:30, 11:00,

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.600
I fall asleep very easily

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.530
and then I wake up around 3:00 or 4:00 AM.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.990
I now know to use a NSDR, a
non sleep deep rest protocol

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.060
and that allows me to fall back asleep.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.720
Even though it's called
non sleep depressed

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.440
it's really allows me to
relax my body and brain,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.750
and I tend to fall back asleep
and sleep till about 7:00 AM.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.370
During which time I
get a lot of REM sleep.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.450
And I know this because I've measured it,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.300
and I know this because my
dreams tend to be very intense

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.610
of the sort that we know
is typical of REM sleep.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.733
In this scenario,

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.620
I've gotten my slow wave
sleep early in the night

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.670
and I've got my REM sleep toward morning.

00:29:44.434 --> 00:29:46.080
However, there are times when
I don't go back to sleep,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.020
maybe I have a flight to
catch, that's happened.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.380
Sometimes I've got a lot on my mind

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.830
and I don't go back to sleep.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.400
I can tell you, and you've
probably experienced that

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.880
the lack of REM sleep tends to make people

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.530
emotionally irritable.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.500
It tends to make us feel
as if the little things

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.870
are the big things.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.960
So it's very clear from laboratory studies

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.590
where people have been deprived
selectively of REM sleep,

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.990
that our emotionality tends
to get a little bit unhinged

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:16.080
and we tend to catastrophize small things.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.840
We tend to feel like the
world is really daunting,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.350
we're never gonna move forward
in the ways that we want.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.620
We can't unlearn the emotional components

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.560
of whatever it is that has been happening,

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.830
even if it's not traumatic.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.570
The other thing that happens in REM sleep

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.290
is a replay of certain
types of spatial information

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.400
about where we were and why
we were in those places.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.640
And this maps to some beautiful data

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.240
and studies that were initiated

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.500
by a guy named Matt
Wilson at MIT years ago.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.750
Showing that in rodents and it turns out

00:30:47.668 --> 00:30:49.390
in other non-human primates and in humans

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:53.030
there's a replay of spacial
information during REM sleep,

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.515
that almost precisely maps to the

00:30:55.515 --> 00:30:57.600
activity that we
experienced during the day

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.290
as we move from one place to another.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.720
So here's a common world
scenario, you go to a new place,

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.650
you navigate through that
city or that environment,

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.930
this place doesn't have to be,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.080
you know, at the scale of a city.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.320
It can be a new building.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.320
It could be finding particular rooms,

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.000
new social interaction.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.131
You experience that and
if it's important enough,

00:31:16.131 --> 00:31:19.400
that becomes solidified a few days later

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.360
and you won't forget it.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.510
If it's unimportant,
you'll probably forget it.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.720
During REM sleep there's a literal replay

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.950
of the exact firing of the neurons

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.760
that occurred while you were navigating

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.770
that same city you're building earlier.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.490
So REM sleep seems to be involved in

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:38.710
the generation of this
detailed spatial information.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.385
But, what is it that's actually
happening in REM sleep?

00:31:42.385 --> 00:31:44.910
So there's this uncoupling of emotion,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.020
but most of all what's
happening in REM sleep is that

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.020
we're forming a relationship with

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.770
particular rules or algorithms.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.480
We're starting to figure out

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.440
based on all the experience
that we had during the day,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.450
whether or not it's important
that we avoid certain people

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.980
or that we approach certain people,

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.409
whether or not it's important that,

00:32:04.409 --> 00:32:06.240
you know, when we enter a building

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.370
that we go into the elevator

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.190
and turn left where the
bathroom is, for instance.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.840
These general themes
of things and locations

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.440
and how they fit together
and that has a word

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.200
it's called meaning.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.640
During our day we're
experiencing all sorts of things.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.096
Meaning is how we each
individually piece together

00:32:25.096 --> 00:32:28.590
the relevance of one
thing to the next, right?

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.760
So if I suddenly told you that, you know,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.760
this pen was downloading all
the information to my brain

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.930
that was important to
deliver this information,

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.020
you'd probably think I was
a pretty strange character.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.740
Because typically we don't think of pens

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.090
as downloading information into brains.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.980
But if I told you that I
was getting information

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.360
from my computer that was allowing me to

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.557
say things to you, you'd say,

00:32:49.557 --> 00:32:51.925
"Well, that's perfectly reasonable."

00:32:51.925 --> 00:32:52.758
And that's because we have a clear

00:32:52.758 --> 00:32:54.810
and agreed upon association with computers

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.754
and information and memory,

00:32:56.754 --> 00:33:00.230
and we don't have that
same association with pens.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.866
You might say, "Well, duh."
But something in our brain

00:33:04.866 --> 00:33:07.070
needs to solidify those relationships

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.410
and make sure that the certain
relationships don't exist.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.620
And it appears that REM
sleep is important for that,

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.070
because when you deprive
yourself or people of REM

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.330
they start seeing odd associations,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.000
they tend to lump or batch things.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.650
I know this from my own experience

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.070
of I've ever been sleep deprived,

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.930
which unfortunately
happens too often because

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.690
I'm terrible with deadlines,
pull an all-nighter,

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.470
the word the starts to look
like it's spelled incorrectly.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.300
And the is a very simple word to spell,

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.010
but things start to
look a little distorted.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.080
And we know that if people
are deprived of REM sleep

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.870
for very long periods of time,
they start hallucinating.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.384
They literally start seeing relationships

00:33:47.384 --> 00:33:50.400
and movement of objects
that isn't happening.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.670
And so REM sleep is
really where we establish

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.950
the emotional load, but where we also,

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.310
start discarding of all the
meanings that are irrelevant.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.390
And if you think about emotionality,

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:05.078
a lot of over emotionality
or catastrophizing

00:34:05.078 --> 00:34:07.950
is about seeing problems everywhere.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.920
And you could imagine why
that might occur if you start

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.210
linking the web of your
experience too extensively.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.190
It's very important in order to have

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.500
healthy, emotional, and
cognitive functioning

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.440
that we have fairly narrow channels

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.610
between individual things.

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.310
If we see something on the
news that's very troubling,

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.610
well, then it makes sense
to be very troubled.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.160
But if we're troubled by everything

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.357
and we start just saying, you know,

00:34:29.357 --> 00:34:30.620
"Everything is bothering me

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.040
and I'm feeling highly irritable

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.870
and everything is just
distorting and troubling me."

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.964
Chances are we are not

00:34:36.964 --> 00:34:41.540
actively removing the
meaning, the connectivity

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.920
between life experiences
as well as we could

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.140
and that almost always maps
back to a deficit in REM sleep.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.230
So REM sleep is powerful and
has this amazing capacity

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:56.420
to eliminate the meanings
that don't matter.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.620
It's not that it exacerbates
the meanings that do matter,

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.940
but it eliminates the
meanings that don't matter.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.470
And that bears a striking resemblance

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.870
to what happens early in development.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.320
This isn't a discussion
about early in development,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.470
but early in development the reason a baby

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.660
can't generate coordinated movements,

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.232
and the reason why children

00:35:15.232 --> 00:35:19.050
can get very emotional about
what seems like trivial events,

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.820
or what adults know to be trivial events.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.493
Like, "Oh, the ice cream shop is closed."

00:35:23.493 --> 00:35:25.307
And then the kid just dissolves into,

00:35:25.307 --> 00:35:28.857
you know, a puddle of
tears and the parents say,

00:35:28.857 --> 00:35:31.030
"Okay, well, it'll be open
again in another time."

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.068
The children one of the
reasons that they can't

00:35:34.068 --> 00:35:36.150
generate coordinated movement,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.950
or place that of the ice
cream shop being closed

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.580
into a larger context,

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.000
is because they have
too much connectivity.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.750
And much of the maturation of
the brain and nervous system

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.280
that brings us to the point of being

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.486
emotionally stable, reasonable,
rational human beings

00:35:50.486 --> 00:35:54.080
is about elimination of
connections between things.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.646
So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple

00:35:56.646 --> 00:36:01.646
the potential for emotionality
between various experiences.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.890
And that brings us to

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.869
the absolutely fundamental relationship

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:10.020
and similarity of REM sleep

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.590
to some of the clinical practices

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.160
that have been designed
to eliminate emotionality

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.420
and help people move through trauma

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.280
and other troubling experiences,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.750
whether or not those
troubling experiences are

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.200
a death in the family
of a close loved one,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.780
something terrible that happened
to you or somebody else,

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.660
or, you know, an entire
childhood or some event

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.626
that in your mind and body is
felt as and experienced as,

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:37.490
bad, terrible, or concerning.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.740
Many of you perhaps have heard of

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.870
trauma treatment such as EMDR,

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.650
eye movement desensitization reprocessing,

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.740
or ketamine treatment for trauma.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.720
Something that recently became legal

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.483
and is in fairly widespread clinical use.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.263
Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine

00:36:59.263 --> 00:37:01.700
at kind of a core level,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.700
bear very similar features to REM sleep.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.165
So let's talk about EMDR first.

00:37:10.165 --> 00:37:12.841
EMDR, eye movement
desensitization reprocessing

00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:15.100
is something that was
developed by a psychologist,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.040
Francine Shapiro.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.173
She actually was in Palo Alto.

00:37:19.173 --> 00:37:23.807
And the story goes that she was walking,

00:37:23.807 --> 00:37:26.280
not so incidentally,

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.025
in the trees and forest behind Stanford,

00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:32.620
and she was recalling a
troubling event in her own mind.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.530
So this would be from her own life.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.730
And she realized that as she was walking,

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.740
the emotional load of that experience

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.253
was not as intense or severe.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.550
She extrapolated from
that experience of walking

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.100
and not feeling as stressed
about the stressful event

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.920
to a practice that she put into work in

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.200
with her clients, with her patients,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.710
and that now has become fairly widespread.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.300
It's actually one of the
few behavior treatments

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.970
that are approved by the American
Psychological Association

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.370
for the treatment of trauma.

00:38:07.942 --> 00:38:10.620
what she had her clients and patients do

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.160
was move their eyes from side to side

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.050
while recounting some
traumatic or troubling event.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.750
Now this was of course in the clinic.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.200
And I'm guessing that she
removed the walking component

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.700
and just took the eye movement component

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.803
to the clinic because

00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:28.000
while it would be nice
to go on therapy sessions

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.020
with your therapist and
take walks there are certain

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.010
boundaries to that such
as, confidentiality.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.670
You know, if there are
a lot of people around

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.400
a person might not feel as
open to discussing things,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.105
or weather barriers and things like that,

00:38:41.105 --> 00:38:42.380
you know, if it's raining
or hailing outside,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.483
it gets tough to do.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.450
Why eye movements?

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.120
Well, she never really
said why eye movements.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.930
But, soon I'll tell
you why the decision to

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.210
select these lateralized eye movements

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.330
for the work in the
clinic was the right one.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.010
So these eye movements, they look silly.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.511
I'll do them because that's why I'm here.

00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:07.410
They look silly, but
they basically involve

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.920
sitting in a chair and moving
one's eyes from side to side,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.290
not while talking. But,
you know, for it's...

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.160
And then recounting the events.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.760
So it's sometimes talking
while moving the eyes,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.847
but usually it was moving the
eyes from side to side for

00:39:21.847 --> 00:39:26.500
30, 60 seconds, then describing
this challenging procedure.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.404
Now as a vision scientist
who also works on stress

00:39:31.404 --> 00:39:36.404
when I first heard this, I
thought it was crazy, frankly.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.330
People would ask me about EMDR

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.100
and I just thought, "That's crazy."

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.672
I went and looked up some of the theories

00:39:42.672 --> 00:39:43.900
about why EMDR might work

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.337
and there were a bunch of theories.

00:39:46.337 --> 00:39:49.290
"Oh, it mimics the eye
movements during REM sleep."

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.210
That was one.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.120
It turns out that's not
true and I'll explain why.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.770
The other one was, "Oh, it
synchronizes the activity

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.510
on the two sides of the brain."

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.180
Well, sort of, I mean, when you look

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.640
into both sides of the
binocular visual field

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.925
you activate the visual cortex.

00:40:03.925 --> 00:40:05.540
But, this whole idea of synchrony

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.900
between the two sides of the brain

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.690
is something that I
think modern neuroscience

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.940
is starting to, let's just say,

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.190
gently or not so gently move away from.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.920
This whole right brain,
left brain business.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.127
It turns out however, that eye movements

00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:22.550
are the sort that I just did

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.460
and that Francine Shapiro
took from this walk experience

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.029
and brought to her clients in the clinic,

00:40:29.029 --> 00:40:31.390
are the sorts of eye
movements that you generate

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.210
whenever you're moving through space,

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.560
when you are self-generating
that movement.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.880
So not so much when you're driving a car,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.680
but certainly if you
were riding a bicycle,

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.710
or you were walking or you were running,

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.560
you don't realize it

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.830
but you have these reflexive
subconscious eye movements

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.650
that go from side to side,

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.290
and they are associated
with the motor system.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.690
So when you move forward
your eyes go like this.

00:40:52.553 --> 00:40:53.386
There've been a number of studies

00:40:53.386 --> 00:40:56.469
showing that these lateralized
eye movements helped people

00:40:56.469 --> 00:40:59.300
move through or dissociate

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.223
the emotional experience
of particular traumas

00:41:02.223 --> 00:41:04.880
with those experiences,
such that they could

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.130
recall those experiences
after the treatment

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.420
and not feel stressed about them,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.190
or they didn't report them
as traumatic any longer.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.811
Now the success rate wasn't 100%,

00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:15.700
but they were statistically significant

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.520
in a number of studies.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.616
And yet there are still
some critics of EMDR.

00:41:19.616 --> 00:41:22.987
And frankly, for a long
time I still thought,

00:41:22.987 --> 00:41:25.470
"Well, I don't know. This just
seems like kind of a hack."

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.160
It just seems like kind of

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.890
something that for which we
don't know the mechanism,

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.123
and we can't explain,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.455
But in the last five years,

00:41:33.455 --> 00:41:35.255
there have been no fewer than

00:41:35.255 --> 00:41:38.010
five and there's a sixth on the way,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.350
high quality peer reviewed manuscripts

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.294
published in Journal of
Neuroscience, Neuron,

00:41:43.294 --> 00:41:45.940
Cell Press Journal, Excellent Journal,

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.074
Nature Excellent Journal.

00:41:48.074 --> 00:41:51.560
These are very stringent
journals and papers

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.720
showing that lateralized eye movements

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.160
of the sort that I just did,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.717
and if you're just listening to this

00:41:56.717 --> 00:41:59.660
it's just moving the eyes from
side to side with eyes open.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.000
That those eye movements but
not vertical eye movements

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.610
suppress the activity of the amygdala,

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.431
which is this brain region

00:42:08.431 --> 00:42:11.810
that is involved in threat detection,

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.340
stress, anxiety, and fear.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.240
There are some forms of fear

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.570
that are not amygdala dependent,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.300
but the amygdala it's not a fear center,

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.590
but it is critical for the fear response

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.500
and for the experience of anxiety.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.410
So that's interesting.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.052
We've got a clinical tool now

00:42:29.052 --> 00:42:32.130
that indeed shows a lot of success

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.860
in a good number of people,

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.030
where eye movements from side to side

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.400
are suppressing the amygdala.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.150
And the general theme is to

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.220
use those eye movements to
suppress the fear response,

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:46.300
and then to recount or
repeat the experience

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.270
and over time uncouple
the heavy emotional load,

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.491
the sadness, the depression,
the anxiety, the fear

00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:56.340
from whatever it was that
happened that was traumatic.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.610
This is important to understand because,

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.450
you know, I'd love to
be able to tell somebody

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.750
who had a traumatic experience

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.670
that they would forget that experience,

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.690
but the truth is you never
forget the traumatic experience.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.090
What you do is you remove
the emotional load.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.296
Eventually it really
does lose its potency.

00:43:13.296 --> 00:43:16.640
The emotional potency is alleviated.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.709
Now EMDR I should just mention,

00:43:18.709 --> 00:43:21.820
tends to be most
successful for single event

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.380
or very specific kinds of trauma

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.050
that happened over and over,

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:29.434
as opposed to say an entire
childhood or an entire divorce.

00:43:29.434 --> 00:43:32.430
It tends to be most effective for

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.610
single event kinds of things,
car crashes, et cetera,

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.990
where people can really recall the events

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.970
in quite a lot of detail.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.880
So it's not for everybody
and it should be done...

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.430
If it's going to be done for trauma

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.160
it should be done in a clinical setting

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.090
with somebody who's certified to do this.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.160
But that bears a lot of
resemblance to REM sleep, right?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.664
This experience in our sleep where

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:57.472
our eyes are moving, excuse me,
although in a different way,

00:43:57.472 --> 00:44:00.620
but we don't have the chemical epinephrine

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.273
in order to generate the fear response,

00:44:02.273 --> 00:44:04.310
and yet we're remembering

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.370
the event from the previous day or days.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.720
Sometimes in REM sleep we
think about things happened

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:12.080
a long time ago. So that's interesting.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.140
And then now there's this new treatment,

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.187
this chemical treatment
with the drug ketamine,

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:20.329
which also bears a lot of resemblance to

00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:23.432
the sorts of things that
happen in REM sleep.

00:44:23.432 --> 00:44:25.793
Ketamine is getting a
lot of attention now.

00:44:25.793 --> 00:44:28.000
And I think a lot of people just

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.890
don't realize what ketamine is.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.490
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:38.128
It is remarkably similar
to the drug called PCP,

00:44:38.128 --> 00:44:42.260
which is certainly a hazardous drug

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.484
for people to use.

00:44:43.484 --> 00:44:48.484
Ketamine and PCP both function

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.210
to disrupt the activity
of a particular receptor

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.360
in the brain called the NMDA receptor,

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.860
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.190
This is a receptor that's
in the surface of neurons

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.674
or on the surface of neurons for which

00:45:02.674 --> 00:45:05.112
most of the time it's not active,

00:45:05.112 --> 00:45:08.612
but when something very extreme happens

00:45:08.612 --> 00:45:11.810
and there's a lot of activity
in the neural pathway

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:13.890
that impinges on that receptor,

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:17.534
it opens and it allows
the entry of molecules,

00:45:17.534 --> 00:45:22.046
ions that trigger a cellular process

00:45:22.046 --> 00:45:24.210
that we call long-term potentiation.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.212
And long-term potentiation translates to

00:45:27.212 --> 00:45:30.032
a change in connectivity so that later

00:45:30.032 --> 00:45:32.117
you don't need that intense event

00:45:32.117 --> 00:45:34.830
for the neuron to become active again.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.450
Let me clarify a little bit of this.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.310
The NMDA receptor is gated
by intense experience.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.360
One way you could think about this is,

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.800
typically I walk in my home,

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.250
I might make some food and
sit down at my kitchen table,

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.356
and I don't think
anything about explosions.

00:45:50.356 --> 00:45:52.650
But were I to come home one night,

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.356
sit down to a bowl of chicken soup

00:45:54.356 --> 00:45:56.736
and there was a massive explosion

00:45:56.736 --> 00:45:59.040
the neurons are associated with

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.980
chicken soup in my kitchen table

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.780
would be active in a way

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.670
that was different than
they were previously,

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.750
and will be coupled to this
experience of explosions

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:10.720
such that the next time,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.310
and perhaps every other time

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:13.860
that I go to sit down
at the kitchen table,

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.770
no matter how rational I am

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.520
about the origins of that explosion,

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.020
maybe it was a gas truck
that was down the road

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.460
and there's no reason to
think it's there today,

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.600
but I would have the same experience.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.820
Those neurons will become active

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.530
and I'd get an increase in heart rate.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.340
I'd get an increase in
sweating, et cetera.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.036
Ketamine blocks this NMDA
receptor and prevents

00:46:33.036 --> 00:46:36.770
that crossover and the addition of meaning

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.858
to the kitchen table, kitchen soup,

00:46:38.858 --> 00:46:41.760
excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.860
So how is ketamine being used?

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.890
Ketamine is being used to prevent learning

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.870
of emotions very soon after trauma.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.730
So ketamine is being stocked

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.260
in a number of different emergency rooms,

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.650
where if people are brought in quickly

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.840
and, you know, these are
hard to describe even

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.330
but, you know, a horrible experience of

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.960
somebody seeing a loved one next to them

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.280
killed in a car accident and
they were driving that car.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.920
This isn't for everybody,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.930
certainly and you need to
talk to your physician,

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.670
but ketamine is being used

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.900
so they might infuse
somebody with ketamine

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.530
so that their emotion it can still occur,

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.630
but that the plasticity,

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.649
the change in the wiring of their brain

00:47:20.649 --> 00:47:23.740
won't allow that intense emotion

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.440
to be attached to the experience.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.750
Now immediately you can imagine

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.250
the sort of ethical
implications of this, right?

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:32.730
Because certain emotions need
to be coupled to experiences.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.560
I'm not saying that people
should be using ketamine,

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.540
or shouldn't be using ketamine,

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.550
certainly not recreationally
it's quite dangerous.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.700
It can be lethal and like PCP it can cause

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.450
pretty dramatic changes in
perception and behavior.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:47.060
But in the clinical setting

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.747
the basis of ketamine assisted therapies

00:47:49.747 --> 00:47:52.540
is really to remove emotion.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.210
And I think the way I've been

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.650
hearing about it talked
about in the general public

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.890
is a lot of people think
it's a little bit more like

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:02.070
the kind of psilocybin
trials or the NMDA trials,

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.510
where it's about becoming more emotional

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.670
or getting in touch with
a certain experience.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:09.460
Ketamine is about becoming dissociative

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.470
or removed from the emotional
component of experience.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.430
So now we have ketamine, which
chemically blocks plasticity

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:18.860
and prevents the connection between

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.820
an emotion and an experience.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.180
That's a pharmacologic intervention.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.360
We have EMDR, which is
this eye movement thing

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.610
that is designed to suppress the amygdala,

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.850
and it's designed to remove emotionality

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:31.890
while somebody recounts an experience.

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:35.912
And we have REM sleep, where
the chemical epinephrin that

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:39.740
allows for signaling of intense emotion

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.180
and the experience of a tense
emotion in the brain and body

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.120
is not allowed.

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.790
So we're starting to see
a organizational logic,

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:50.930
which is that a certain
component of our sleeping life

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:52.800
is acting like therapy.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.930
And that's really what REM sleep is about.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.907
So we should really think about REM sleep

00:48:58.907 --> 00:49:01.390
and slow wave sleep as both critical.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.780
Slow wave sleep for motor
learning and detailed learning.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.810
REM sleep for attaching of emotions

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.169
to particular experiences.

00:49:07.169 --> 00:49:11.300
And then for making sure that the emotions

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.770
are not attached to the wrong experiences

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:16.360
and for unlearning emotional responses

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.630
if they're too intense or severe.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.494
And this all speaks to
the great importance of

00:49:21.494 --> 00:49:23.130
mastering one sleep,

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:25.160
something that we talked about in episode

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.680
two of the podcast.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.294
And making sure that if
life has disruptive events,

00:49:30.294 --> 00:49:33.200
either due to travel or stress,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.170
or changes in school
hours or food schedule,

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.640
something that we talked about
in episodes three and four,

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.550
that one can still grab a hold
and manage one sleep life.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.093
Because fundamentally the
unlearning of emotions

00:49:48.093 --> 00:49:50.900
that are troubling to us

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.680
is what allows us to move forward in life.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.540
And indeed the REM deprivation studies

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.010
show that people become hyperemotional.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.810
They start to catastrophize.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.893
And it's no surprise therefore,

00:50:00.893 --> 00:50:03.574
that sleep disturbances correlate

00:50:03.574 --> 00:50:08.445
with so many emotional and
psychological disturbances.

00:50:08.445 --> 00:50:12.580
By now it should just be obvious
why that will be the case.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.340
In fact, the other day
I was in a discussion

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.760
with a colleague of mine

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.380
who's down in Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.940
I've known her for two decades now

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.360
from the time she was at Oxford.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.060
And Sarah studies among other
things menopause in the brain.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.295
And she was saying that
a lot of the emotional

00:50:30.295 --> 00:50:32.174
effects of menopause,

00:50:32.174 --> 00:50:35.500
actually are not directly
related to the hormones.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.410
There've been some really
nice studies showing that

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.030
the disruptions in temperature
regulation in menopause

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.699
mapped to changes in sleep regulation

00:50:43.699 --> 00:50:48.296
that then impact emotionality
and an inability to

00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:52.250
correctly adjust the circuits
related to emotionality.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.070
And I encourage you to look at her work.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.730
We'll probably have her
as a guest on the podcast

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.730
at some point in the future,

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.640
'cause she's so knowledgeable
about those sorts of issues,

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.040
as well as issues related
to testosterone and

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.970
in people with all sorts of different

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.720
chromosomal backgrounds.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.720
So sleep deprivation isn't
just deprivation of energy.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.880
It's not just deprivation
of immune function.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.620
It is deprivation of self-induced therapy

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.530
every time we go to sleep.

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:23.230
Okay. So things like EMDR
and ketamine therapies

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.330
are in-clinic therapies,

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:27.660
but REM sleep is the one
that you're giving yourself

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.630
every night when you go to sleep.

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.590
Which raises, I think,

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.380
the other important question which is,

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.590
how to get and how to
know if you're getting

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.160
the appropriate amount of REM
sleep and slow wave sleep.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.950
So that's what we'll talk about next.

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:43.898
So how should one go about
getting the appropriate amount

00:51:43.898 --> 00:51:46.500
of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:49.766
and knowing that you're
getting the right amount.

00:51:49.766 --> 00:51:52.023
Well, short of hooking
yourself up to an EEG,

00:51:52.907 --> 00:51:55.670
it's gonna be tough to
get exact measurements

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.720
of brain states from night to night.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.700
Some people nowadays
are using things like,

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.610
the Oura Ring or a WHOOP
band, or some other device

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.810
to measure the quality
and depth and duration

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:06.643
of their sleep.

00:52:06.643 --> 00:52:09.953
And for many people those
devices can be quite useful.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.070
Some people are only gauging
their sleep by way of

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:15.910
whether or not they feel rested,

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:17.630
whether or not they feel
like they're learning

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.330
and they're getting better or not.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.870
There are some things
that one can really do.

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:25.330
And the first one might surprise you

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:26.470
in light of everything I've said,

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.470
and probably everything
you've heard about sleep.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:34.150
There was a study done by
a Harvard undergraduate,

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:38.630
Emily Hoagland, who was
in Robert Stickgold's lab

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:39.970
at the time.

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:43.980
And that's the study explored how

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.783
variations in total sleep
time related to learning,

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.510
as compared to total sleep time itself.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.190
And to summarize the study,
what they found was that

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.200
it was more important to have

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.740
a regular amount of sleep each night

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:08.340
as opposed to the total duration.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.950
In other words, and what
they showed was that

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.510
improvements in learning

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:17.100
or deficits in learning were
more related to whether or not

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.922
you got six hours, six
hours, five hours, six hours,

00:53:20.922 --> 00:53:25.040
that was better than if
somebody got for instance,

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.040
six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four or five hours.

00:53:30.643 --> 00:53:32.930
See you might say, "Well,
that's crazy because I thought

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:34.127
we were just all supposed
to get more sleep

00:53:34.127 --> 00:53:35.960
and there's more REM towards morning."

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.730
It turns out that forsake
of learning new information

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.480
and performance on exams in particular,

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.730
that's what was measured,

00:53:45.226 --> 00:53:48.810
limiting the variation in
the amount of your sleep

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:53.150
is at least as important
and perhaps more important

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:55.750
than just getting more sleep overall.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.510
And I think this will
bring people great relief,

00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:59.990
many people great relief

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.861
who are struggling to "get enough sleep."

00:54:02.861 --> 00:54:05.130
Remember, a few episodes ago

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.222
I talked about the difference between

00:54:07.222 --> 00:54:10.120
fatigue and insomnia.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.120
You know, fatigue tends
to be when we are tired.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.921
Insomnia tends to lead to a

00:54:14.921 --> 00:54:17.880
sleepiness during the day
when we're falling asleep.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.930
And you don't want that,

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:21.180
you don't want either
of those things really.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.410
But, I found it striking that

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.130
the data from this study
really point to the fact that

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.779
consistently getting about
the same amount of sleep

00:54:30.779 --> 00:54:33.980
is better than just getting more sleep.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.813
And I think nowadays

00:54:34.813 --> 00:54:36.780
so many people are just
aiming for more sleep,

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.830
and they're rather troubled
about the fact that

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:40.100
they're only getting five hours,

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:43.283
or they're only getting
six hours in some cases.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.570
It may be the case that
they are sleep deprived

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.000
and they need more sleep,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.220
but some people just
have a lower sleep need.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.780
And I find great relief,
personally, in the fact that

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.615
consistently getting,
for me, about six hours

00:54:56.615 --> 00:54:59.900
or six and a half hours is
going to be more beneficial

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:01.910
than constantly striving for eight or nine

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:03.730
and finding that some
nights I'm getting five

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:05.310
and sometimes I'm getting nine

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:06.650
and varying around the mean.

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:09.770
As I recall, and I think I'm
gonna get this precisely right,

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:12.040
but if not I know that I'm at least close.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.430
For every hour variation in sleep

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.204
regardless of whether
or not it was more sleep

00:55:18.204 --> 00:55:19.280
than one typically got,

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.844
there was a 17% reduction in performance

00:55:22.844 --> 00:55:25.646
on this particular exam type.

00:55:25.646 --> 00:55:27.700
So this is powerful.

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.550
This means that we should strive for

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:31.570
a regular amount of sleep.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:33.670
And for some of us that
means falling asleep

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:34.960
and waking up and going back to sleep.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.959
For some people means falling asleep and

00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:39.760
waking up and not getting back to sleep.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.010
Now ideally, you're getting

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:44.620
the full compliment of slow
wave sleep early at night

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.870
and sleep toward morning,
which is REM sleep.

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.610
Which brings us to, how
to get more REM sleep.

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:52.397
Well, there are a couple
of different ways but

00:55:52.397 --> 00:55:57.100
here's how to not get
more REM sleep. All right.

00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.610
First of all, drink a lot of fluid

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:00.920
right before going to sleep.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.340
One of the reasons why we wake up

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.240
in the middle of the
night to use the bathroom

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.618
is because when our bladder is full

00:56:06.618 --> 00:56:08.510
there is a neural connection,

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:10.870
literally a set of neurons
and a nerve circuit

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:13.193
that goes to the brain
stem that wakes us up.

00:56:14.514 --> 00:56:16.307
Actually some people

00:56:16.307 --> 00:56:18.830
that I know and won't be mentioned,

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:20.560
actually use this to try and adjust

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.360
for their jet lag when
they're trying to stay awake.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.610
Having to urinate is one of the most

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.610
anxiety evoking experiences
anyone can have.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.190
If you really have to go to the bathroom

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.580
it's very hard to fall
asleep or stay asleep.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.680
And bedwetting, which happens in kids

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.626
very early on is a failure
of those circuits to mature

00:56:40.626 --> 00:56:44.350
until, you know, I think
we all assume that babies

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.010
are gonna pee in their sleep,

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:48.945
but adults aren't supposed to do that.

00:56:48.945 --> 00:56:51.300
And the circuits take some time to develop

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.240
and in some kids they develop

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.960
a little bit later than others.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.740
So having a full bladder is
one way to disrupt your sleep.

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.440
You don't wanna go to bed
dehydrated, but that's one way.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.440
On the other hand there is evidence

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.000
that if you want to
remember your dreams more,

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.840
or remember more of your dreams

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.530
there is a tool that you can use.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.160
I don't necessarily recommend it,

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.510
which is to drink a bunch of
water before you go to sleep.

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:15.660
And then what happens is

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.950
you tend to break in and out of REM sleep.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.470
It tends to be fractured.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.443
And with a sleep journal

00:57:21.443 --> 00:57:23.180
and they've done these laboratory studies.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.050
Believe it or not, people will
recall more of their dreams

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:27.980
because they're in this
kind of semi-conscious state

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.310
because they're constantly
waking up throughout the night.

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:32.780
I suggest not having a full
bladder before you go to sleep.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.250
That one's kind of an
obvious one, but nonetheless.

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:39.970
The other one is if you
recall that during REM sleep

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.220
we have a shift in
neurotransmitter such that

00:57:45.255 --> 00:57:46.088
we have less

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.230
serotonin, right?

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:50.310
Just wanna make sure I got that right.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.863
Excuse me, less serotonin.

00:57:53.288 --> 00:57:55.860
There are a lot of supplements out there

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.230
geared toward improving sleep.

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:00.750
I've taken some of them and
I've taken many of them,

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.160
if not all of them at this point.

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.750
So I could report back to you.

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.430
And I think I mentioned
on a previous episode

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:08.152
that when I take tryptophan,

00:58:08.152 --> 00:58:10.207
or anything that contains 5-HTP, which is

00:58:10.207 --> 00:58:13.555
serotonin or a precursor to serotonin,

00:58:13.555 --> 00:58:15.260
serotonin is made from tryptophan,

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.470
I tend to fall very deeply asleep

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.057
and then wake up a few hours later.

00:58:19.057 --> 00:58:22.090
And that makes sense now
based on the fact that,

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.200
you just don't want a lot
of REM sleep early on.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.611
What was probably happening

00:58:25.611 --> 00:58:27.030
is that I was getting a
lot of REM sleep early on,

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:28.590
because low levels of serotonin

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:31.527
are typically associated
with slow wave sleep

00:58:31.527 --> 00:58:33.240
and that comes early in the night.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.360
So for some people those
supplements might work,

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.653
but be aware serotonin supplements

00:58:38.653 --> 00:58:42.425
could disrupt the timing of
REM sleep and slow wave sleep.

00:58:42.425 --> 00:58:44.700
And in my case led to waking up

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.250
very shortly after going to sleep

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:48.750
and not being able to get back to sleep.

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:52.380
Now if you want to increase
your slow wave sleep.

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.880
That's interesting. There
are ways to do that.

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.230
One of the most powerful ways
to increase slow wave sleep,

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.424
the percentage of slow wave sleep,

00:59:00.424 --> 00:59:02.410
apparently without any disruption

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:05.730
to the other components
of sleep and learning

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.440
is to engage in resistance exercise.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.640
It's pretty clear that resistance exercise

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.420
triggers a number of metabolic
and endocrine pathways

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.470
that lend themselves to
release of growth hormone,

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:18.740
which happens early in the night.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.806
And resistance exercise
therefore can induce

00:59:21.806 --> 00:59:24.670
a greater percentage of slow wave sleep.

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:27.430
It doesn't have to be done very
close to going to bed time.

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:28.770
In fact, for some people

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:30.130
the exercise could be disruptive,

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.730
for reasons I've talked
about in previous episodes.

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:35.430
But resistance exercise,
unlike aerobic exercise

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:38.280
does seem to increase the
amount of slow wave sleep,

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.650
which as we know is involved in

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:42.890
motor learning and the acquisition of

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:45.510
fine detailed information
not general rules,

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:48.143
or the emotional
components of experiences.

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.380
For those of you that are
interested in lucid dreaming

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.990
and would like to increase
the amount of lucid dreaming

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:56.510
that you're experiencing,

00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:58.590
I haven't been able to
track down that device

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.400
with the red light that I
described at the beginning,

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.150
but there are a number of just simple

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:07.750
zero technology tools that
one could use in principle.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.592
One is to set a queue.

01:00:09.592 --> 01:00:13.790
The way this works is you come
up with a simple statement

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:17.080
about something that you'd like to see,

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.181
or experience later in dreams.

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:24.379
You can, for instance,
write down, you know,

01:00:24.379 --> 01:00:29.060
something like, I want to
remember the red apple.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.010
I know it sounds silly and trivial,

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:34.220
and you look at that you would
probably wanna write it down

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.053
on a piece of paper.

01:00:35.053 --> 01:00:36.810
You might even want to draw a red apple,

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:39.530
and then before you go to
sleep you would look at it

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.820
and then you would just go to sleep.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.060
There are some reports that doing that

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.510
for several days in a row can
lead to a situation in which

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.450
you are suddenly in your dream

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.140
and you remember the red apple,

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.980
and that gives you a
sort of tether to reality

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.360
between the dream state and reality

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.270
that allows you to navigate and shape

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:59.110
and kind of adjust your dreams.

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:00.970
Lucid dreaming does not have to be,

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:05.264
or include the ability to
alter features of the dream,

01:01:05.264 --> 01:01:07.730
you know, to be able to
control things in the dream.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.330
Sometimes it's just the
awareness that you are dreaming,

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.650
but nonetheless some people
enjoy lucid dreaming.

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:15.930
And then for people that
have a lot of lucid dreams

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.940
that feel kind of overwhelmed by those,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.593
that's going to involve trying to

01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:26.593
embrace protocols that can set
the right duration of sleep.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.230
There's a little bit
of literature not a lot

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:31.510
that shows that keeping the

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:34.112
total amount of sleep per night

01:01:34.112 --> 01:01:38.620
to say six hours such that
you begin sleep and end

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.820
at the beginning and end of
one of these ultradian cycles,

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.120
can be better than waking up

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.470
in the middle of one of
these ultradian cycles.

01:01:46.943 --> 01:01:49.190
So try and find the right
amount of sleep that you need,

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:50.130
that's right for you,

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.370
and then try and get that
consistently night to night.

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.090
If you're a lucid dreamer
and you don't like it,

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.922
then you may want to start to

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:59.520
make sure that you're waking up

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.500
at the end of one of
these ultradian cycles.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.130
So in this case,

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:05.020
it would be better to
wake up after six hours

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.800
than after seven and if you did

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.760
sleep longer than six
hours, maybe you'd wanna get

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.940
to seven and a half hours.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.900
'Cause that's gonna reflect

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.670
the end of one of these 90 minute cycles,

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.570
as opposed to waking up in the middle.

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.020
Alcohol. Alcohol and marijuana

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.740
are well known to induce states that are

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.970
pseudo sleep like.

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:24.300
Especially, when people fall asleep

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.846
after having consumed alcohol or THC,

01:02:27.846 --> 01:02:30.643
one of the active components of marijuana.

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:33.900
Alcohol, THC

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.213
and most things like them,

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:41.740
meaning things that
increase serotonin, or GABA

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.760
are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.950
They're going to disrupt the depth.

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:46.859
They're going to disrupt

01:02:46.859 --> 01:02:48.280
the overall sequencing
of more slow wave sleep

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.540
early in the night and more
REM sleep later in the night.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.436
That's just the reality.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:55.079
There are some things that

01:02:55.079 --> 01:02:57.570
at least, in a few
studies that I could find

01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:59.580
seem to suggest that you could

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.770
increase the amount of slow wave sleep

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:04.960
using things like arginine,
the amino acid arginine.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.850
Although, you really wanna check.

01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:07.970
Arginine can have effects
on heart, et cetera

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.310
has other effects.

01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:11.887
But, alcohol, THC, not
gonna be great for sleep

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:13.720
and depth of sleep.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.590
You might feel like you
can fall asleep faster,

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.390
but the sleep that you're accessing

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:19.550
really isn't the kind of
deep restorative sleep

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.920
that you should be getting.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.170
Now, of course, if that's what you need

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:26.390
in order to sleep and that's
within your protocols,

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.223
I've said here before,

01:03:27.223 --> 01:03:28.470
I'm not suggesting people take anything.

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:29.890
I'm not a medical doctor.

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:30.723
I'm not a cop.

01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:33.201
So I'm not trying to
irregulate anyone's behavior.

01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:36.530
I'm just telling you
what the literature says.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.830
Some of you may want
to explore your dreams

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:40.762
and meaning of dreams, et cetera.

01:03:40.762 --> 01:03:43.130
You know, there's not a lot of hard data

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.980
about how to do this,

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.240
but a lot of people report
keeping a sleep journal,

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.320
where a dream journal can be very useful.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.360
So they mark when they
think they fell asleep

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.230
the night before, when they woke up

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.350
and if they wake up in
the middle of the night,

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.404
early in the morning
they'll just write down

01:03:57.404 --> 01:03:59.700
what they can recall of their dreams.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.910
And even if they recall nothing,

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:04.640
many people have the
experience of mid morning

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.210
or later afternoon that
suddenly comes to them

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:10.150
that they had a dream about
something and writing that down.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:11.860
I kept a dream journal for a while.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.340
It didn't really afford me much.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.950
I didn't really learn anything

01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:17.050
except that my dreams were very bizarre.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:20.345
But, there are some things
that happen in dreams

01:04:20.345 --> 01:04:22.880
that are associated with REM sleep

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.320
as compared to slow wave sleep,

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.640
which can tell you whether or not

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.980
your dream likely happened in
REM sleep or slow wave sleep.

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.900
And the distinguishing
feature it turns out

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.348
is something called theory of mind.

01:04:33.348 --> 01:04:35.020
Theory of mind is actually an idea

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.500
that was developed for the
study and assessment of autism.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.189
And it was initially that
phrase, theory of mind,

01:04:42.189 --> 01:04:47.070
was brought about by Simon Baron Cohen,

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:51.042
who is Sacha Baron Cohen,
the comedians brother.

01:04:51.042 --> 01:04:54.484
Simon Baron Cohen is a psychologist and

01:04:54.484 --> 01:04:58.510
to some extent an
neuroscientist at Oxford.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:01.334
And theory of mind tests
are done on children.

01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:05.240
And the theory of mind test is
some what like the following,

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.490
a child is brought into a laboratory

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:08.985
and watches a video of

01:05:08.985 --> 01:05:11.860
a child playing with some sort of toy.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.105
And then at the end of
playing with that toy

01:05:14.105 --> 01:05:17.140
they put the toy in a
drawer and they go away,

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.162
and then another child comes
in and is looking around

01:05:21.162 --> 01:05:24.840
and then the experimenter asks the child

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.507
who's in the experiment,
the real child and says,

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.620
"You know, what does the child think?

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.270
You know, what are they feeling?"

01:05:33.198 --> 01:05:35.520
And most children have a particular age,

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.723
five or six or older
will say, "Oh, you know,

01:05:37.723 --> 01:05:40.767
he or she is confused, they
don't know where the toy is."

01:05:40.767 --> 01:05:42.204
Or, they'll say something that implies

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:45.424
what we call theory of mind,
that they can put their

01:05:45.424 --> 01:05:49.985
ideas and their mind
into what the other child

01:05:49.985 --> 01:05:52.230
is likely to be feeling or experiencing.

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:53.780
That's theory of mind.

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:57.320
And it turns out that this is used

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.930
as one of the assessments for autism,

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:03.360
because some children,
not all, but some children

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.980
that have autism or that
go on to develop autism

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.660
don't have this theory of mind.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.250
They tend to fixate on the fact that

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.120
the first child put the toy in the drawer.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.710
They'll say it's in the drawer

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.610
as opposed to answering the question

01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:18.270
which is how does the
second child feel about it,

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.620
or what are they experiencing?

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.545
So theory of mind is something that

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:25.310
emerges early in life as a part of the

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:27.120
maturation of the circuits in the brain

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:31.950
associated with emotional
learning and social interactions.

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:35.500
And we experienced this in certain dreams.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.450
So if you had a dream
that you're puzzled about,

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:40.770
or that you're fixated on
and you're thinking about,

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.462
you might ask, "In that dream

01:06:42.462 --> 01:06:46.480
was I assessing somebody
else's emotion and feeling,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.720
or was I very much in my own
first person experience?"

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.300
And that the tendency
is that theory of mind

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.158
tends to show up most in
these REM associated dreams.

01:06:58.158 --> 01:07:00.470
Now this isn't a hard and fast rule,

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:02.450
but chances are if you were in a dream

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:04.470
and you were thinking about other people

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.070
who wanted to do something to you,

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:07.900
you were thinking about their desire

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.730
to chase you or help you,

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:12.700
or something that was related

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.370
to someone else's emotional experience.

01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:17.001
It was probably a REM dream.

01:07:17.001 --> 01:07:19.620
That dream occurred in
rapid eye movement sleep

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.660
as opposed to slow wave sleep.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.338
And that makes sense when you
think about the role of REM

01:07:24.338 --> 01:07:28.750
in emotional unlearning of associations

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.100
with particular life events.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.960
That REM is rich with
all sorts of exploration

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.760
of the emotional load of being chased,

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.160
or the emotional load of

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.890
having to take an exam the next day,

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.570
or being late for something.

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.430
But again, if you're fixated

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:48.250
or you can recall thinking a lot about,

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.330
or feeling a lot about

01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:51.800
what somebody else's motivations were

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.260
then chances are it was in REM and if not

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.780
chances are it was in slow wave sleep.

01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.298
Today we've been in a deep
dive of sleep and dreaming,

01:08:01.298 --> 01:08:03.139
learning and unlearning.

01:08:03.139 --> 01:08:06.170
And I just want to recap
a few of the highlights

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:07.934
and important points.

01:08:07.934 --> 01:08:11.470
A lot more slow wave sleep and
less REM early in the night,

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:14.662
more REM and less slow wave
sleep later in the night.

01:08:14.662 --> 01:08:16.998
REM sleep is associated with

01:08:16.998 --> 01:08:20.970
intense experiences without
this chemical epinephrine

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:23.650
that allows us the anxiety or fear.

01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:26.100
And almost certainly has an important role

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.620
in uncoupling of emotion from experiences.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:33.080
Kind of self-induced therapy
that we go into each night.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.010
That bears striking resemblance

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:38.670
to things like EMDR and
ketamine therapies and so forth.

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.457
Slow wave sleep is critical, however,

01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:43.700
it's critical mostly for motor learning

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.780
and the learning of specific details.

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:50.320
So REM is kind of emotions and
general themes and meaning,

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.346
and slow wave sleep, motor
learning and details.

01:08:53.346 --> 01:08:57.776
I personally find it fascinating
that consistency of sleep,

01:08:57.776 --> 01:09:01.040
meaning getting six hours every night

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.110
is better than getting ten
one night, eight the next,

01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:05.723
five the next, four the next.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.570
I find that fascinating and I
think I also like it because

01:09:09.570 --> 01:09:11.030
it's something I can control better

01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:12.210
than just trying to sleep more,

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.440
which I think I'm not
alone and agreeing that

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.590
that's just hard for
a lot of people to do.

01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:21.120
This episode also brings
us to the conclusion of

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.870
a five episode streak where
we've been focusing on sleep

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:28.050
and transitions in and out of
sleep, non sleep depressed.

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:30.640
We've talked about a lot
of tools, morning light,

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.630
evening light, avoiding lights,
blue blockers, supplements,

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:37.770
tools for measuring sleep
duration and quality.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:40.620
We've been covering a lot of themes.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.990
I like to think that by now

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:45.520
you're armed with a number
of tools and information.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.100
Things like knowing when
your temperature minimum is,

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.130
knowing when you might
wanna view light or not,

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:52.330
when you might wanna
eat or take hot showers,

01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:54.120
or God forbid a cold shower,

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.560
something that most people
including me more or less loath,

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.510
but can have certain benefits.

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:00.892
And that will allow you
to shape your sleep life

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:03.220
and get this consistent,

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.870
or more or less consistent amount of sleep

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:06.090
on a regular basis.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.940
Nobody's perfect. In fact
I have this little joke

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.600
that I sometimes tell, it's not funny.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.260
Like, most of the jokes I
tell I'm told are not funny,

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.630
but, you know, there's so
much excitement now about

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:17.060
intermittent fasting.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.900
Sometimes I think that
someone should start

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.610
something on intermittent
sleep deprivation,

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.190
although we're already doing that.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.186
We are all experiencing lack
of sleep from time to time.

01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:28.440
And I don't think we should
catastrophize that too much.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.900
I think that what we wanna do

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.610
rather than accumulate
a sleep anxiety is to...

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:37.230
You know, if we get a bad
night's sleep, we want to adjust,

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:38.590
we want to get back on track

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.540
and just get the
consistent amount of sleep.

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:43.340
Use those non sleep deep rest
protocols to help us relax

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.410
when we're feeling anxious,

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:46.980
we're having trouble waking
up in the middle of the night.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.420
There are a lot of tools out there,

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.720
and most of them are zero cost.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.991
And so I hope you'll
find those beneficial.

01:10:52.991 --> 01:10:55.520
If you've been hearing Costello snoring

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.950
throughout this episode.

01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:59.070
I apologize in his behalf.

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:01.440
As I said, in the welcome
video to this podcast

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.090
he's an integral part of the podcast.

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:04.360
A few people have said, "Hey,

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.196
that noise in the background
is really disruptive."

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.550
Hey, what can I say?

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:12.513
Costello is a ten-year-old
bulldog mastiff.

01:11:12.513 --> 01:11:15.610
The lifespan on those
animals is about 10 years.

01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:17.930
So I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,

01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:20.550
but, you know, after he's gone
there won't be any snoring,

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:23.206
although I'll probably
get a different dog.

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:25.894
So sort of a, what were the
kids say, sorry not sorry.

01:11:25.894 --> 01:11:28.773
Sorry not sorry about the snoring

01:11:28.773 --> 01:11:31.070
and I'm sorry if it's
disruptive genuinely,

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:34.120
but he's here for the hall.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.123
So that's what that's about.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.270
As we close out the segment on sleep

01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:42.350
we are moving into a new theme and topic

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:44.460
for the next four to five episodes.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.620
We are going to discuss the science

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.100
and the tools related to neuroplasticity.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.880
Neuroplasticity is a remarkable feature

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.080
of the nervous system.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.890
In fact, it's the defining
feature of the nervous system,

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:59.510
which is its ability to change itself

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:01.170
in response to experience.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.710
That is unlike every other tissue

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.510
and collection of cells
and organ in our body.

01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.350
It's really what makes us us as a species

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:12.310
and it's what makes us us as individuals,

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:14.730
and it's really where our potential lies.

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.430
Everything that we know,
everything we can do,

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.030
and our true potential

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.080
in terms of what we will ever be able to

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.914
know, do, say, in life is set by

01:12:23.914 --> 01:12:26.749
the limits of neuroplasticity.

01:12:26.749 --> 01:12:29.780
So we're going to explore
learning and childhood,

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.030
learning and adulthood.

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:33.309
We're going to discuss detailed protocols

01:12:33.309 --> 01:12:37.180
as they relate to sensory plasticity.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.570
Learning new sensory information,

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:42.200
versus motor plasticity or
sensory motor integration.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.330
We're going to talk about
language acquisition.

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:45.770
We're going to be talking about

01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:47.950
emotional acquisition and breadth.

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:50.040
As well as, I think a
topic a lot of people

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.693
are gonna find fascinating is,

01:12:51.693 --> 01:12:54.590
the relationship between plasticity set

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:57.750
during childhood attachment
to parent or other caregiver,

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.091
and how that maps onto
adult relationships.

01:13:01.091 --> 01:13:03.100
Many of you have probably heard about

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.000
secure attach or insecure attach.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.550
The A, B and C, D babies as they're called

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.390
from the classic studies

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:10.623
of Bowlby and others.

01:13:11.918 --> 01:13:13.360
But now there's actual
neuroscience that can say

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.300
which circuits were active

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.242
during those early life attachment

01:13:17.242 --> 01:13:21.520
and how those map to
adult attachment styles,

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.250
challenges, and what makes us more likely

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.970
to select certain partners
and styles of attachment,

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.240
as well as how to change those.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.290
It's really fascinating and I think

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:34.610
neuroscience's time has
come for neuroplasticity.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.410
We're also gonna talk, of course, about

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:39.090
supplements and chemicals
and machines and devices

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:42.418
that can assist in speeding
up the plasticity process.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.530
Or believe it or not, there are some cases

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:46.680
where you might want to delay plasticity

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.970
in order to get more depth of learning

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.270
and have that learning last longer.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:54.039
Something that is just absolutely
spectacular literature.

01:13:54.039 --> 01:13:57.330
So I'm very excited to
move on to that topic soon.

01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:59.230
I hope that the tools that
you've acquired so far

01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:00.710
and the knowledge that
you've acquired so far

01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.190
is helping you with your self evaluation

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:04.940
and experimentation as you see fit,

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.920
and is allowing you to
not just sleep better,

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.570
but feel better while you're awake.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.680
And hopefully has set the
stage for you to learn better

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.230
as we start to march into
the month on neuroplasticity.

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:18.520
Many of you have asked
how you can help support

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.540
the Huberman Lab Podcast and we

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.660
greatly appreciate the question.

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.060
You can help support the podcast

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.020
by subscribing to the YouTube channel,

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.420
if you haven't already

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.160
and leaving comments and
questions in the comment section.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.210
If you could subscribe
on Apple and or Spotify,

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:35.260
that's helpful.

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.770
And there's a place on Apple
Podcasts to leave a rating,

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:43.515
as well as comments about how
you feel about the podcast.

01:14:43.515 --> 01:14:47.050
If you could suggest the
podcast to friends and coworkers

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.620
and anyone else that
you think would benefit

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.050
from the information
that also really helps us

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:52.040
get the word out.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.530
And of course, check out our sponsors

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:55.780
because that's a very direct way

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:57.610
to help us continue to
get this information

01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:58.980
out to the general public.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:00.650
Many of you have asked about supplements

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:02.670
and where I personally get my supplements.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:04.710
I've partnered with Thorne

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:07.140
and I get my supplements
from Thorne because,

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.542
by my view they have the
highest level of stringency

01:15:09.542 --> 01:15:13.680
and precision in terms
of what's in the bottle.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.360
And they also have very
high quality standards.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.850
They're partnered with the Mayo Clinic

01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:20.530
and all the major sports organizations.

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:22.099
If you wanna try Thorne supplements

01:15:22.099 --> 01:15:24.520
you can go to thorne.com.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.520
So that's Thorne spelled
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:34.690
And if you do that you can see
the formulations that I take.

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:36.330
And you'll also get 20% off,

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.820
not just those formulations,
but anything that Thorne makes.

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:43.751
That's thorne.com/u/huberman

01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:47.470
to get 20% off anything that they provide.

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:50.550
Last but not least, a
few people wrote to me

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:55.550
with some questions/corrections
about things that I said

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.180
in previous podcasts.

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.700
So in keeping with my goal of

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.600
making the information accurate and clear,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.490
I just want to correct myself

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:06.040
about a few things that I said.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.450
One of those and I'm guessing

01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:10.120
it probably came from an endocrinologist

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:14.691
or somebody else that knows
a lot about testicles said,

01:16:14.691 --> 01:16:17.660
"Huberman, you mentioned that testosterone

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.740
is made by the sertoli cells
of the testes, and it's not.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.860
It's made by the leydig
cells of the testes."

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.530
And indeed you are correct.

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:27.480
And so I want to make
sure that I clarify that.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.210
Testosterone is made by the
leydig cells of the testes,

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.487
not by the sertoli cells.

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:35.430
The sertoli cells make 5
alpha-reductase and aromatase,

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:36.650
and some other enzymes involved

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:39.080
in conversion of testosterone into

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.740
things like DHT and estrogen.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.080
So thank you for that correction.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.730
I genuinely appreciate it. I misspoke.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.596
The other thing I said,
was at one point I said,

01:16:46.596 --> 01:16:48.354
"Typical temperature is 96.8

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:52.060
when I actually meant to say 98.6."

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.810
So it was a dyslexic slip
on my part and I apologize.

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:57.800
I don't know that I'm dyslexic.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.930
I know I haven't been clinically
diagnosed with dyslexia,

01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:03.250
but I swapped them,
which sometimes happens

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.660
when I'm going fast.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.487
So I apologize. I'll use
this a moment to just say

01:17:07.487 --> 01:17:10.626
temperature varies a lot
across the day and night,

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.160
that was a theme of previous podcasts.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.260
So we can't really talk about
average temperature anyway,

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.430
but I do want to be clear that

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:21.290
most people think about
average temperature as 98.6.

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:23.924
I misspoke, my error and I apologize.

01:17:23.924 --> 01:17:27.010
Thank you for joining me in this journey

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:29.090
of the nervous system in biology

01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:31.570
and trying to understand the mechanisms

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:34.480
that make us who we are and
how we function in sleep

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.729
and in wakefulness.

01:17:35.729 --> 01:17:38.829
It's really an incredible
landscape to consider

01:17:38.829 --> 01:17:41.584
and I hope that you're getting
a lot out of the information.

01:17:41.584 --> 01:17:44.628
As always thank you for
your interest in science.

01:17:44.628 --> 01:17:47.211
