00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.290
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.710
where we discuss science

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.188
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:09.350
[upbeat rock music]

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.330
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.040
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.090
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.740
Today, I have the pleasure of introducing

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.750
Dr. Matthew Johnson.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.830
Dr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.980
at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.060
where he also directs

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.320
the Center for Psychedelic
and Consciousness Research.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.550
As many of you know,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.390
there's extreme excitement
about the use of psychedelics

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.020
for the treatment of various
disorders of the mind.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.620
Dr. Johnson's laboratory

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.480
is among the premier
laboratories in the world

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.270
understanding how these compounds work,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.320
how things like Psilocybin,
and LSD, and related compounds

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.040
allow neural circuitry in the brain

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.840
to be shaped and changed,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.250
such that people can combat diseases,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.010
like depression, or trauma,
or other disorders of the mind

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.890
that cause tremendous suffering.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.170
Dr. Johnson is also an
expert in understanding

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170
how different types of drugs impact

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.080
different types of human behaviors,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.630
such as sexual behavior,
risk taking, and crime.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.980
Dr. Johnson and his work

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.030
have also been featured
prominently in the popular press,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.120
such as articles in "The New York Times"

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.240
and Michael Pollan's book,
"How to Change Your Mind,"

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.010
and in a feature in "60
Minutes" about psychedelics

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.120
and the new emerging science
of psychedelic therapies

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.430
for treating mental disorders.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.560
During the course of today's conversation,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.310
Dr. Johnson and I talk about psychedelics

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.850
at the level of what's
called micro dosing,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.130
whether or not it is useful

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.530
for the treatment of any mental disorders.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.980
We also talk about more
typical macrodosing,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.780
what those macrodoses entail,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.370
and he walks us through

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.660
what an experiment of a
patient taking psychedelics

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.870
for the treatment of depression

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.090
looks like in his laboratory
from start to finish.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.790
The conversation was an
absolutely fascinating one

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.170
for me to partake in.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.760
I learned so much about the past, present,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.080
and future of psychedelic
treatments and compounds.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.430
And indeed, I hope to have Dr.
Johnson on this podcast again

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.880
in the not too distant future,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.200
so that we can talk about other compounds

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.260
that powerfully impact the
mind and human behavior,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.700
and perhaps, can also be used
to treat various diseases.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.550
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.380
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.230
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.890
It is, however, part of my desire

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.380
and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.500
about science and science-related tools

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.820
to the general public.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.060
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.890
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.270
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.040
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.450
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.877
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,

00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:39.830
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.760
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.540
once or twice a day every day,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.850
is because it covers my
foundational nutritional needs.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.920
It has the vitamins I need,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.800
the minerals I need,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.970
and the probiotics are important to me,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.170
because there is now so much data

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.800
about the importance of the
so-called gut microbiome,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.040
maintaining healthy gut bacteria,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.870
and the ways in which those gut bacteria

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.830
impact things like inflammation,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.500
and keeping inflammation
down in the brain and body,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.850
as well as supporting
things like quality mood,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.550
endocrine function, metabolic function,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.990
just so many factors.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.640
The great thing about Athletic Greens

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.000
is that it also tastes very good.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.890
I mix mine with water, a
little bit of lemon juice,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.400
and as I mentioned, I drink
that once or twice a day.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.790
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.830
you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.130
and if you do that, you'll
get the Athletic Greens,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.740
plus, you'll get five free travel packs.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.430
The travel packs make it very
easy to mix up Athletic Greens

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.740
when you're on the road, in the car,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.070
on the plane, et cetera,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.753
and you'll get a year
supply of vitamin D3/K2.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.710
There's now a lot of evidence

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.670
that vitamin D3 and K2 are important

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.040
for various aspects of metabolic health,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680
cardiac health, and so forth.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.080
So once again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.790
to get Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.920
and your year supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.800
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.880
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.520
that analyzes data from your blood

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.310
and DNA to help you better
understand your body,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.410
and help you reach your health goals.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.500
I've long been a believer

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.370
in getting regular blood work done,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.850
and now, with the advent
of quality DNA tests,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.320
you can get a lot of
information about your genetics,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.100
and how that also impacts

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.150
your immediate and long-term health.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.370
The reason I'm such a fan
of getting blood work done,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.830
is that it is really the
only way to understand

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.270
what's going on in your system

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.860
at a level that can really
inform your decisions

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.470
about your immediate and long-term health.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.140
The problem with a lot of
blood and DNA tests, however,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.430
is that you get numbers
back about your hormones,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.010
and your metabolic factors, et cetera,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.120
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.450
With InsideTracker, they have
a very easy to use dashboard

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.840
that gives you that information,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.440
and then gives you some
suggestions and directives

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.740
about things you could
change about your nutrition,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.920
about your exercise, and
other lifestyle factors

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.370
that can help you move those
numbers in the direction

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.670
that's best for you and for your health.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.140
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.390
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.210
to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.800
Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.910
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Belcampo.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.540
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.440
that raises organic grass-fed

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.170
and finished certified humane meats.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.810
I eat meat about once a day,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.930
In general, my lunch or my
breakfast consists of some meat,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.700
and that meat has to be
of very high quality,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.690
and generally, I'll eat
some vegetable as well.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.690
And then I tend to eat pastas, and rice,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.640
and things of that sort

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.280
later in the day or in the evening

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.770
in order to facilitate
the transition to sleep.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.850
So I'm eating meat about once a day,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.350
and I always insist
that the meat that I eat

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.880
be of the very highest quality,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.310
and that the animals were
raised and maintained humanely.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.910
While conventionally-raised
animals are confined to feedlots

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.830
and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.320
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.690
and seasonal grasses,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.470
resulting in meat that's
higher in nutrients

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.070
and healthy fats.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.820
In addition, they raise
their animals in a way

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.610
that's not just better for our health,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.380
but also has a positive
impact on the environment.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.040
They practice regenerative agriculture,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.150
which means the meat is climate positive

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.370
and carbon negative,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.900
so you can feel good
about what you're eating

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.050
at the environmental level,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.000
and for sake of your health.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.180
You can order Belcampo's
sustainably-raised meats

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.650
to be delivered to you
by using my code Huberman

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.570
at belcampo.com/huberman,
and entering my code Huberman

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.790
to get 20% off your first time order.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.690
I'm partial to the rib-eyes
or the New York steaks.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.080
So on one day, I might have a ribeye.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.580
The next day, I might
have a New York steak.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.290
I also really like the meatballs.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.200
I'm a particular fan of the meatballs.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.550
So again, that's belcampo.com/huberman,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.800
and enter the code Huberman at checkout

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.170
to get 20% off your order.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.610
And now, my conversation
with Dr. Matthew Johnson.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.130
Well, Matthew, I've been
looking forward to this

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.010
for a long time.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.470
I'm a huge fan of your scientific work,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.540
and I'm here to learn from you.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.610
So-
- Likewise.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.013
Big fan and happy to do this with you.

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:55.380
- All right, well, thank you.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.330
My first question is a very basic one,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.130
which is, what is a psychedelic?

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.500
We hear this term all the time,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.920
but what qualifies a
substance as a psychedelic?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.250
- Nomenclature is a real challenge

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.760
in this area of psychedelics.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.943
So starting with the word psychedelic,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.080
if you're a pharmacologist,
it's not very satisfying,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.440
because that term really

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.510
spans different pharmacological classes.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.343
In other words,

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:26.280
if you're really concerned
about receptor effects

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.120
and the basic effects of a compound,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.720
it spans several classes of compounds.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.100
But overall...

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.140
So it's really more of a cultural term,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.140
or it does have a
relationship to drug effects,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.940
but it's at a very high level.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.070
So all of the so-called psychedelics

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.160
across these distinct classes

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.763
that I can talk more about,

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.550
the way I put it, is
they all have the ability

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.550
to profoundly alter
one's sense of reality,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.100
and that can mean many things.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.680
Part of that is profoundly altering

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.070
the sense of self acutely,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.600
so when someone's on the psychedelic.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.210
So the different classes that can be,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.680
the specific pharmacological classes

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.690
that can be called a psychedelic,

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.200
are, one, what are called
the classic psychedelics.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.403
So in the literature,
you'll see that term.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.700
Hallucinogen and psychedelic all have

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.750
traditionally been used synonymously.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.380
I think there was a
little of of a tendency

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.213
to stay away from psychedelics,

00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:33.420
because of the baggage,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.870
but there's been a return to
that in the last several years.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.500
But the classic psychedelics
or classic hallucinogens

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.210
are things like LSD, psilocybin,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.190
which is in so-called magic mushrooms.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.030
It's in over 200 species

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.963
that we know of so far of mushrooms.

00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:53.830
Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.473
which is in dozens and dozens of plants.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.807
Mescalin, which is in the peyote cacti,

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:03.740
and some other cacti, like San Pedro.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.400
And even amongst these
classic psychedelics

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.910
there are two structural,
structural classes.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.860
So that's the chemistry.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.000
There's the tryptamine-based compounds,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.220
like psilocybin and DMT,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.130
and then there's the
phenethylamine-based compounds.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.400
So these are the basic,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.350
two of the, basically, building blocks

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.330
that you're starting from,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.020
either a tryptamine structure
or a phenethylamine structure.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.690
But that's just the chemistry.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.080
All of the...

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.290
What's more important,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.660
or at least to someone like me,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.020
are the receptor effects,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.090
and then, ultimately, that's
going to have a relationship

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.040
to the behavioral and subjective effects.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.310
So all of these classic psychedelics

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.580
serve as agonist, or partial agonists,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.310
at the serotonin 2A receptor,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.890
so a subtype of serotonin receptor.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.480
Then you have these other classes of

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.680
compounds that you could call psychedelic.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.270
Another big one would
be the NMDA antagonist.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.420
So this would include ketamine, PCP,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.500
and dextromethorphan,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.930
something I've done some research with,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.770
which folks might recognize
from like Robo-tripping,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.790
guzzling cough syrup,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.900
which is something kind of like

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.343
high school kids are known to do

00:10:14.343 --> 00:10:16.070
when they can't get ahold of real drugs,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.400
that type of thing.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.400
So a large overlap in the
types of subjective effects

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.610
that you get from those compounds

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.120
compared to the 2A agonist
classic psychedelics.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.953
But then you have...

00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:32.530
And by the way, this description,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.910
this framework I'm describing,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.340
not everyone will agree.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.460
Some people will say,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.040
no, psychedelic only
means classic psychedelic.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.530
So there's different opinions here.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.840
But you have, gosh, Salvinorin A,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.930
which is a kappa-opioid agonist,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.600
which again-
- Where does that come from?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.210
- Salvia divinorum, it's
a plant that became...

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.100
20 years ago, it sort of popped
onto the legal high scene,

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.610
and there's a long history of
this predating the internet,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.350
going back to like the
stuff one could order

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.348
in the back of "High Times Magazine",

00:11:03.348 --> 00:11:06.031
and most of this stuff
never worked, you know?

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.860
[laughs] Or it's like, just
smoke enough of anything,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.620
maybe you get a little bit lightheaded.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.680
But this is one of those things

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.990
that popped around 20 years ago,

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.880
when it quickly got
the reputation of like,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.150
holy shit, this stuff actually works,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.310
and works really strongly.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.410
In these smoked extracts particularly,

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.520
people have these
reality-altering experiences

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.410
on par with smoked DMT,
the classic psychedelic.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.290
So often...

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.790
And we did the first

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.310
blinded controlled human
research with Salvinorin A.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.040
So lots of entity contact.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.590
So feeling that you,

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.060
in the experience of one
is actually interacting

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.470
with autonomous beings,
that type of thing.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.820
And then you have another big one,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.680
I probably should have mentioned

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.540
even before the Salvinorin A,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.810
but you have MDMA,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.890
which really stands in a class by itself.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.825
So it's been called an entactogen,

00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.800
and-
- What does that mean?

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.860
- It means like touching within.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.240
It sort of alludes to the idea

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.490
that it can really put someone
in touch with their emotions.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.408
It's also been called an empathogen,

00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:11.463
meaning it can afford empathy.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.280
But I think entactogen's probably,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.260
that's the term that I tend to focus on.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.810
And I know I'm not telling
you anything you don't know,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.530
but for the viewers,

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.950
the primary mechanism of
MDMA is serotonin release,

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.090
and to a degree, other monoamine release,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.810
dopamine, serotonin.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.240
And so structurally,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.640
that's also in the phenethylamine class,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.160
which contains mescalin,
the classic psychedelic,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.690
but also amphetamine.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.640
So just like Adderall is

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.420
in that phenethylamine class.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.550
And so this is another example

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.080
where chemistry doesn't dictate.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.950
I mean, you can tweak a molecule.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.630
It might have that same basic structure,

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.320
but now you've profoundly changed the way

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.560
it interacts with the receptor.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.900
So in MDMA it does not

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.313
exert its actions by,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.070
I like to say, by mimicking the
baseball entering the glove,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:17.070
the post-synaptic receptor
side acting as an agonist.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.520
So mimicking the endogenous
neurotransmitter, serotonin,

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.240
like the classic psychedelics do.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.410
MDMA works on the pitcher side

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.920
of just basically throwing
out more of the natural,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.052
the endogenous-
- Dumping

00:13:32.052 --> 00:13:33.029
more serotonin.
- Dumping more

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:33.862
serotonin.
- Yeah.

00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:35.780
- Flooding the synapse.
- Yeah.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.220
So I get the impression,

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.530
that this psychedelic space

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.510
is a enormous cloud of
partially overlapping compounds.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.343
- [Dr. Matthew] Right.

00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:46.700
- Meaning some are impacting
the serotonin system

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.950
more than the dopamine system.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.220
Others are impacting the dopamine system

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.880
more than the serotonin system.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.140
Given that the definition of a psychedelic

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.220
is that it profoundly
alters sense of self,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.640
at least that's included
as a partial definition,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.473
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:03.473 --> 00:14:06.540
- can we break that down into
a couple of sub categories?

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.250
So for instance, hallucinating,

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.913
either auditory or visual,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.870
synesthesia, perceptual blending,

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.880
the sense that you can hear colors,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.690
and see sounds, for instance.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.670
A common report of people
- Yeah.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.520
- that take psychedelics
in sufficiently high doses.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.920
So hallucinating, synesthesia.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.720
And then in terms of sense of self,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.060
as a neuroscientist, I think,

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.840
okay, what does it mean to
alter a sense of reality?

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.970
Really, what the brain
does in a very coarse way

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.740
is to try and figure out

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.380
what's happening in space, physical space,

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.600
and that physical space could
be within us or outside us,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.770
and what's happening in time.
- Right.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.030
- And as a vision scientist,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.130
the simplest explanation,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.070
is when I move my hand

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.230
from one location to another location,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.850
it's measuring the space,

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.890
the location of my hand
in space over time,

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.250
and then you get a rate, and a speed,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.220
and all that kind of stuff,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.053
right?
- Yeah.

00:15:05.998 --> 00:15:06.831
- That gets more complicated

00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:09.890
as you get into the emotional realm.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.210
But is it fair to say,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.810
that psychedelics are impacting
the space-time analysis

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.010
that the brain is performing,

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.670
and thereby creating hallucinations,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.790
and thereby altering

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.990
the blending of senses?

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.363
Is it fair to say that?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.450
- I think it's fair to explore that area,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.900
and here's what I'm thinking.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.650
Clearly, there is a changed relationship,

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.823
certainly, at the right dose
of orientation in space-time.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.072
I think as a...

00:15:44.072 --> 00:15:46.190
You know, I'm primarily a behaviorist,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.430
and in terms of human
behavioral pharmacology,

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.980
I always go to comparative
pharmacology, okay?

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.290
What can we say that is truly unique

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.780
about the classic psychedelic,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.460
or psychedelics in general?

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.020
So with that description, I'm thinking,

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.200
okay, alcohol can really screw up your

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.910
time-space orientation.
- And the proprioception,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.650
your balance, your vestibular.
- Proprioception,

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.483
- Yeah.
- you know.

00:16:08.483 --> 00:16:09.770
And in many ways,

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.350
and sort of in those gross
motorways, like far worse,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.640
of course everything's dose-dependent,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.250
but in the classic psychedelics,

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.720
obviously the benzodiazepines
being very similar to alcohol.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.553
Same thing.

00:16:19.553 --> 00:16:24.380
So I'd want to dig in a little more,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.740
in terms of, like, maybe
there's something more specific

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.937
we could say about that
relationship to time,

00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:33.810
and space that the psychedelics
are tinkering with,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:34.690
but I'm not sure.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.380
It's an interesting hypothesis,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.840
the idea that that's a mediator,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.070
that that's something,

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.490
that there's something fundamental

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.383
about changing the
representation in time and space.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.773
There might be something to that.

00:16:48.773 --> 00:16:51.650
I mean, I think of these psychedelics

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.693
as profoundly altering models.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.563
We're prediction machines.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.393
So much of that is top-down.

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:08.290
And psychedelics have a good way of,

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.580
loosely speaking, dissolving those models,

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.740
and one of, the reality-
- Can you give us

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.540
an example of one of, like a model?

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.830
Like, I know that when I
throw a ball in the air,

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.303
it falls down, not up.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.390
That's a prediction that
I learned as a child.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.450
I did not come into the world with a brain

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.193
that knew that relationship

00:17:30.193 --> 00:17:32.730
- Yes.
- between objects and gravity.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.300
But one of the first
things that a child learns

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.410
is the relationship between
objects, and gravity,

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.980
and their trajectory-
- Yeah.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.010
And with a four-year-old,

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.230
I mean, I saw that at earlier ages,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.200
like that experimentation of, like,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.100
oh yeah, that's what happens,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.933
you know?
- Right.

00:17:48.933 --> 00:17:49.766
[interposing voices]

00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:50.640
So if he were to throw a ball,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.210
if a child were to throw a ball,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.060
and it went up into the sky,

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.240
that would be absolutely mind-blowing?

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.073
- Yeah.
- It would be

00:17:58.073 --> 00:17:58.906
for an adult too.

00:17:58.906 --> 00:17:59.739
- It'd be a pretty
- Right.

00:17:59.739 --> 00:18:00.572
- psychedelic experience,

00:18:00.572 --> 00:18:02.950
probably [laughs].
- Right, right.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.030
There's a rule there.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.864
You're saying, there's kind of

00:18:05.864 --> 00:18:07.410
a prediction.
- Right.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.960
- There's a rule that
underlies a prediction,

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.230
that when that rule is violated,

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.380
all of a sudden, the circuit,

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.980
presumably, for that prediction,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.060
it doesn't have a mind of its own,

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.470
but somehow, it creates
a surprise element,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.840
or a recognition element.
- Yeah.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.053
And it's not filtered out, you know?

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.780
And this might sound extreme,

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.060
but there are these cases,

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.620
it was overblown,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.500
and sort of the propaganda
of the late '60s, early '70s,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.500
but there are credible cases of people,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.473
it's very atypical of,

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:42.510
it sounds like they really
thought they could fly,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.160
and jump out of a window.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.850
Now, far more people every year fall.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.168
I mean, who knows, you know?

00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:53.001
- Sure.

00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:54.240
- They fall and die out of,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.820
you know, from height, because
they're drunk, you know?

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.070
So this is extremely rare,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.290
but there are some
pretty convincing cases.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.583
There was one research
volunteer in our studies that,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.920
she looked like she was,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.010
in one of our studies,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.100
she was trying to dive through
a painting on the wall.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.310
She was fine.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.020
But she [laughs]...

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.160
Reviewing the video,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.440
it looked like she really thought

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.010
that she was going to go
through that painting,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.267
and who knows?

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.023
You know what I mean?
- All right, so-

00:19:27.023 --> 00:19:28.280
So she was-
- Into the other dimension-

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.630
- Yeah, so they're
violating these predictions.

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:35.080
Yeah, the reason I asked the
question the way I did is,

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.520
because given the enormous
cloud of different substances,

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.540
and given the range of
previous experiences

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.433
that people show up to a
psychedelic experience with,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.840
I feel like the ability to extract

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.250
some universal themes is useful,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.280
especially for people who
haven't done them before,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.113
right?
- Yeah.

00:19:53.113 --> 00:19:54.610
- Who might not have an understanding

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.550
of what their effects are like.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.800
Can we just briefly touch on

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.030
the serotonin system
and the dopamine system?

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.920
I want to acknowledge
that, as you already know,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.190
that there are many neuromodulator
systems in the body,

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.900
and the opioid systems,
cannabinoid systems.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.740
But there's something so profound about

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.780
the serotonin system
and the dopamine system,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.450
because the way I define
a neuromodulator is,

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:20.290
it's a modulator.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.710
It changes the way that
other circuits behave.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.520
And essentially, it
increases the probability

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.880
that certain circuits will be active

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.670
and decreases the probability
that other circuits

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.130
will be active,
- Yeah.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.510
- in a general sense.
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.620
- So compounds like LSD,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.430
lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.820
my understanding, is that they primarily

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.043
target the serotonin system.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.470
How do they do that at
a kind of general level?

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.280
And why would increasing the activity

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.140
of a particular serotonin receptor

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.170
or batch of serotonin receptors

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.390
lead to these profoundly
different experiences

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.650
that we're calling model challenges,

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.280
challenging pre-existing models

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.113
and predictions?
- Yeah.

00:21:05.113 --> 00:21:07.600
- I mean, at the end of
the day, it's a chemical,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.830
and these receptors are
scattered around the brain

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.060
with billions of other receptors.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.110
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.260
- What do we think is going
on in a general sense?

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.760
- Yeah, yeah, and this is really

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.280
the area of active exploration,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.720
and we don't have great answers.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.420
We know a good amount about the
receptor level pharmacology,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.860
some things about post-receptor
signaling pathways.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.570
In other words, just
fitting into the receptor.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.973
Clearly, serotonin itself is
not psychedelic, you know?

00:21:35.973 --> 00:21:37.830
Or else we'd be tripping, all of us,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.390
all the time.
- 'Cause when I eat a bagel,

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.010
I get serotonin release, right?

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.620
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, there's...

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.453
Or turkey.
- And it's very

00:21:43.453 --> 00:21:44.649
different than LSD.
- I mean, there's tryptophan

00:21:44.649 --> 00:21:45.482
in it, right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:21:45.482 --> 00:21:46.500
- But my understanding of serotonin,

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.080
is that in very broad strokes,

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.060
that it generally leads to
a state of being fairly,

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.500
it pushes the mind and body
towards a state of contentment

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.333
within the
- Right.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.600
- immediate experience.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.110
Whereas the dopamine system

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.840
really places us into an external view

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.330
of what's out there in the
world, and what's possible.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.163
- Yeah.

00:22:07.163 --> 00:22:08.270
- Is that fair to say?
- Need to do something.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.663
I mean, that's consistent
with my understanding,

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.530
and certainly, not in terms of...

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.153
I don't primarily identify
as a neuroscientist,

00:22:17.153 --> 00:22:19.600
so I'll definitely tell the viewers

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.180
that we're far more in
your domain here than mine.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.020
But in terms of how
psychedelics and other drugs

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.420
interface at the neuroscience level.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.400
- Well, feel free to explain
it at the experiential level.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.270
- Yeah.
- I mean, it doesn't have-

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.030
I think there probably
are some audience members

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.380
that are interested in, is it the 5-H2C?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.220
Is it the layer five neurons

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.180
and cortex?
- Yeah.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.560
- That conversation, we could hold,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.850
and that's an interesting conversation.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.050
But just in terms of the
experience of serotonergic

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.790
versus dopaminergic drugs,
- Right.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.810
Yeah.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:54.370
- they do seem to create
distinct classes of experience.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.347
So I think that's

00:22:55.347 --> 00:22:57.070
the appropriate level
- Right.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.210
- for us to discuss them.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.470
- And in terms of how they...

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.120
And I'd like to explore the
biology a little bit here,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.430
and tell you sort of what's known,

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.260
and what some of the ideas are.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.170
- [Dr. Huberman] Please.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.160
- You know, have this path...

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.070
As you know, these are levels of analysis,

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.150
and it's not which one is going on.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.280
It's almost like, for
the particular question,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.893
which level of analysis
is most appropriate?

00:23:19.026 --> 00:23:21.160
Is a question best
addressed by the biology,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.430
the chemistry, or the physics?

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.200
That's how I think of receptor level,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.780
post-receptor signaling,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.470
downstream effects on
other neuro-transmitters,

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.920
and then activation level effects,

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.800
and then coordination of activation.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.490
So you've got the,

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.410
clearly, with the classic psychedelics,

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.640
the two way activation.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.850
We do know that there
are downstream effects

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.000
in terms of increasing
glutamate transmission.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.520
So this is likely a commonality

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.460
why ketamine is very psychedelic

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.350
in a slightly different way,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.183
but-
- Do people

00:23:55.183 --> 00:23:56.016
hallucinate on ketamine?

00:23:56.016 --> 00:23:58.210
- Yes, yes, and it's more dissociative.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.170
So someone is more likely to sort of

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.180
be less behaviorally active.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.290
If they have a really high dose,

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.300
they go into a K-hole,

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.740
and if they go in a really high dose,

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.252
like you get in surgery,
- That's what it's called,

00:24:08.252 --> 00:24:09.085
- you're just unconscious.
- a K-hole?

00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:10.293
- Yeah, a K-hole.
- Not an A-hole,

00:24:10.293 --> 00:24:11.203
but a K-hole?
- A K-hole,

00:24:11.203 --> 00:24:12.036
yeah [laughs].
- Right.

00:24:12.036 --> 00:24:13.223
- It's very different.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.473
The K-hole.

00:24:15.473 --> 00:24:16.306
And ketamine's interesting,

00:24:16.306 --> 00:24:17.850
'cause people can take kind of bumps,

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.040
and kind of dance on it

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.210
with sort of an alcohol
level strength effect,

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.950
and that's sort of the classic
kind of raving use of it.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.820
But then those folks want
to titrate their dose,

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.180
because if they do more of a line,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.670
you get up to like 75, 100 milligrams,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.083
then you're talkin' about,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.730
if you're on the dance
floor, you're on the floor,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.400
and your friends are trying to make sure

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.600
people aren't steppin' on you.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.570
So that's like the K-hole-
- Yeah, why would somebody

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.450
want to take a dissociative anesthetic?

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.960
Like, to me, it's completely mysterious

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.580
as to why someone would want
to dissociate from their body.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.580
- People claim that these
NMDA antagonist psychedelics

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.800
are extremely insightful
in a very similar way

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.870
to the experiences with
the classic psychedelics.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.520
So-
- And ketamine is now legal

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.170
for therapeutic use, correct?
- Right, right.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.170
Spravato, the intra-nasal
form marketed by Janssen,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.483
which is esketamine,

00:25:14.483 --> 00:25:15.980
and it's one of the-
- It's prescription?

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.210
- Yeah, it's prescription-

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.530
and-
- So people are taking

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.780
it in the nasal spray?

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.613
- Yeah.
- And then,

00:25:21.613 --> 00:25:24.130
are they undergoing talk therapy
while they're doing this?

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.313
- Typically not.

00:25:25.313 --> 00:25:26.850
This is very interesting,

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.600
and there's so much work
that needs to be done.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.350
It's not treated as psychedelic therapy,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.183
and by that,

00:25:33.183 --> 00:25:35.220
psychedelic therapy, I mean,

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.053
you tell the person

00:25:36.053 --> 00:25:38.200
they're going to have
an altered experience.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.510
You tell them to pay
attention to that experience,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.360
that they might learn
something from that experience.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.780
And afterwards, you
discuss that experience.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.910
With Spravato,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.690
the model is-
- Spravato is?

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.210
- Is esketamine.
- Okay.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.490
- It's the, yeah, the
spray form of ketamine.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.933
It's been FDA-approved for
treatment resistant depression.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.550
You'll probably feel different.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.610
Ignore that.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.918
That's a side effect.

00:26:02.918 --> 00:26:05.310
[laughs] That's an adverse effect.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.350
Just ignore it.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.883
We don't think that has anything to do

00:26:07.883 --> 00:26:09.900
with the way it works.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.980
But just get this thing.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.640
It's a direct sort of
chemotherapeutic effect in a sense .

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.360
It's not facilitating a learning process.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.070
Now, there's older work.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.160
There was a guy, Krupitsky, in Russia

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.100
that did extensive work with
higher doses of ketamine.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.060
I should say, Spravato,
at the prescribed doses,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.470
isn't very...

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.640
It's a pretty low dose.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.950
It's in the mild psychedelic range,

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.700
but it's not very strong.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.620
But this older work that happened

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.100
in the '90s and early 2000s in Russia,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.390
they were using very high doses,

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.557
and treating it like a psychedelic.

00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:48.260
You know, treating it as if
it was a psychedelic therapy.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.620
In other words, telling people,

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.830
you're going to have this experience.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.360
It's going to...

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.110
We're hoping you learn something from it.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.990
We're going to help you through it.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.410
We're going to discuss it afterwards.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.890
And they found incredibly
high rates of success

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.470
in some pretty well controlled trials

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.900
for both heroin addiction
and alcohol addiction.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.650
So I think a whole lot of
work needs to be done now.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.360
And you see some of the ketamine clinics

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.940
that are using ketamine off-label,

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.970
a lot of them are you treating
it like psychedelic therapy.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.730
There's, essentially, no
research at this point on that.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.123
Do you get better results?

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.120
Straight up use of Spravato,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.470
there's some good variability,

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.990
but its antidepressant
effects last about a week,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.530
but they kick in immediately.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.680
Now, a week is a long time.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.150
For most psychiatric drugs,

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.442
you take it every day,

00:27:34.442 --> 00:27:35.275
you know?
- Right.

00:27:35.275 --> 00:27:37.050
- So that's amazing, but
it's still just a week.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:42.050
We're seeing effects a year
or more later with psilocybin

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:44.510
and some of the classic psychedelics

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.490
that could be a
pharmacological difference,

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.320
or it could be that they get

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.990
a lot more mileage out of ketamine

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.380
if they treated it like
psychedelic therapy.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.050
And so that's some work-
- What would that look like?

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.390
- Really, just like our
psilocybin sessions,

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.950
which I know I haven't described,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.110
but briefly, you have anywhere from

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.860
four to eight hours of preparation

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.010
getting to know the people
who are going to be the guides

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.279
or the therapists in the room

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:09.112
with the person.
- Yeah, maybe you could

00:28:09.112 --> 00:28:10.450
walk us through this?

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.490
So let's say, I were to come
to one of your clinical trials,

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.323
'cause these are

00:28:15.323 --> 00:28:16.590
clinical trials, right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.110
- At your lab at Hopkins?
- Yeah.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.950
- And would I need to be depressed,

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:20.900
or could I just be somebody

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.780
who wanted to explore psychedelics?

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.650
- We've had studies for all of these,

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.680
- Okay.
- and a number

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.513
of other disorders.
- Okay.

00:28:27.513 --> 00:28:28.627
- So healthy, "normal studies",

00:28:28.627 --> 00:28:30.380
- Okay.
- the code for

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.990
not a problem to fix, but we're all...

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.300
That's what's amazing
about psychedelics, though,

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.380
because if you administer
them under this model,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.650
and you develop a relationship,

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:39.620
and give a high dose of a psychedelic,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.730
you can be a healthy normal
without a diagnosable issue.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.670
But man, we're all human,

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.820
and the issues seem to

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.860
come to the surface.
- Sure.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.100
Yeah-
- But we've done

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.220
work with smoking cessation,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.840
so people trying to quit tobacco,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.200
and haven't been successful.
- So a variety of reasons?

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.340
- Right.
- So maybe,

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.080
I'll just ask some very simple questions

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.630
that would kind of step
us through the process.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.130
So let's say I were to sign
up for one of these trials,

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.260
and I qualified for one of these trials.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.093
I'd show up.

00:29:04.093 --> 00:29:06.080
You said, "I would do
several hours in advance

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.140
of getting to know the
team that would be present

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.160
during this psychedelic journey"?

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.210
- First, there's screening.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.630
So it's kind of like a couple
of days of both psychiatric,

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.950
like structured psychiatric interviews

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.800
about your whole, your past,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.780
and symptoms across the
DSM, the psychiatric Bible,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.030
to see if you might have various disorders

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.410
that could disqualify you,

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.860
like the main ones being
the psychotic disorders,

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.737
schizophrenia, and also including bipolar.

00:29:33.737 --> 00:29:35.020
- Right.
- So the manic

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.120
side of bipolar.
- Mm-hmm.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:37.953
- So after that...

00:29:37.953 --> 00:29:40.370
And also cardiovascular
screening, heart disease.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.520
After that screening,
then the preparation.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.140
You develop a therapeutic rapport

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.410
with the people who are going to be

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.850
in the room with you, your guides,

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:53.700
but you're also then
didactically sort of explained

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.480
about what the psychedelic could be like,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.210
and that's kind of a laundry list,

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.800
because they're more
known by their variability

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.170
than it's going to...

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.690
It's not like cocaine.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.380
You're going to feel stimulated.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.801
You're going to feel
like you can do any...

00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:11.360
Or alcohol, you're probably
going to feel more relaxed.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.750
It's like...

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.200
I call 'em uppers,
downers, and all arounders,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.820
and the psychedelics
are the all arounders.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.840
It's like, yeah, you could be,

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.730
you could have the most

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.710
beautiful experience of your life,

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.830
or the most terrifying
experience of your life.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.080
So it's this kind of laundry list

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.210
of like the things that could happen,

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.640
so there's no surprises.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.300
- I think it's so important
for people to hear,

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.897
because the all arounders,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.560
you really can't predict how somebody

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.570
is going to react internally.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:39.740
- Right.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.660
- I want to just briefly
touch on something,

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.450
because we left that topic.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.520
But it occurred to me,

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.420
that a lot of these
effects of psychedelics,

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.080
and how they function, et
cetera, is still very mysterious.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.340
But then I recalled to mind,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.200
that how most prescription
antidepressants work

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.920
is also very mysterious.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.100
They increase serotonin, or dopamine,

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.160
or epinephrin, et cetera,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.900
but why they take weeks on end,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.440
you know, several weeks
to kick in, et cetera,

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.780
is also mysterious.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.010
But going back to the experience of

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.230
coming to your laboratory.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.720
Okay, so let's say that somebody passes

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.083
all the prerequisites.

00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:19.340
and it's the day.
- Yeah.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.300
- Comes the day that they are

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.257
going to have this experience.

00:31:22.257 --> 00:31:24.680
Are they eating mushrooms,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.800
like you hear about,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.973
or are they taking it in capsule form?

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.500
What sorts of doses are you prescribing?

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.060
Is there a dose response curve?

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.200
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.520
- And then secondary to that,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.810
I'd like to talk about micro dose

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.320
versus macro dose.
- Mm-hmm.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.140
- So how do they get this stuff into...

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.770
How do people receive it,

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.603
and how do they get it

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:46.823
into their body?
- So they reive

00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:48.260
pure psilocybin.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.910
So the mushroom, and
there are many species...

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.130
People have taken mushrooms
in the United States,

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.730
it's most likely so Psilocybe cubensis.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.620
They're easy to grow.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.890
They grow in cow patties.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.800
It's easy for anybody to
grow 'em in their closet.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.620
It doesn't take a 1,000
watt light, like cannabis.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.700
It takes like a little 10 watt light bulb

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.650
and a Tupperware bin.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.010
So those are what...

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.280
Those are the types of mushrooms
that people typically take.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.290
We're not administering those.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.380
Psilocybin is the compound.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.930
You could draw a molecule of psilocybin,

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.370
again, based on the tryptamine structure,

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.770
that's a single molecular entity.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.090
So it's a white powder.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.480
- Does it look like serotonin molecularly?

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.152
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:32:30.152 --> 00:32:30.985
[interposing voices]

00:32:30.985 --> 00:32:32.020
- If I were to show people

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.167
the chemical structure of serotonin

00:32:33.167 --> 00:32:35.210
and the chemical structure of psilocybin,

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.590
it would look quite similar?

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.423
- Right, right.

00:32:37.423 --> 00:32:38.300
[interposing voices]
- They're basically

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.623
taking serotonin?

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.890
- A modified version of
serotonin, which makes sense.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.900
But then again, this repeated theme of

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.430
the chemistry doesn't
always neatly line up,

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:54.360
because mescaline looks more like dopamine

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.820
than it does like serotonin,

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.020
but yet, at the receptor activation level,

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.210
the pharmalogical effect,
those are similar.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:07.780
But yeah, I mean, and what it
does at the receptor is an...

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.040
It's hitting the same switch,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.950
but then having an alternate response

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.313
at the receptor level.
- Yeah, so for people

00:33:14.313 --> 00:33:15.710
that don't necessarily understand

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.700
the relationship between
what we call ligand,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.440
the thing that parks in the receptor,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.280
and the receptor is the parking spot,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.960
one of the reasons that you can get

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.880
such a variety of effects
from different compounds is,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.520
for instance, serotonin might
affect a certain pathway

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.130
at a particular rate,

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.510
and a psilocybin might trigger activation

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.610
of different components of
that pathway, different rates,

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.340
and so you can get vastly
different experiences

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.598
from two things that
look chemically similar.

00:33:42.598 --> 00:33:43.431
- Right.
- This is also

00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:47.840
a good reason why people
shouldn't just assume

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.850
that they can cowboy their
own chemistry, right?

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.277
That what you see on paper

00:33:52.277 --> 00:33:54.130
and what you can mix up in a vile

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:58.280
is often vastly different
than what you predict.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.160
- Right.
- Right.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.710
- And there's a dose effect
curve that's really interesting.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:06.420
Some of our early work with
psilocybin in healthy "normals"

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:10.020
looked at a true placebo,
plus four active doses,

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.360
5, 10, 20, and 30
milligrams of psilocybin.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.790
Body weight adjusted,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.880
so those milligrams per 70
kilograms of body weight.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.590
We've recently published a
paper in our newer trials

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.730
where we're dropping the
body weight adjustment,

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.130
'cause going across
hundreds of volunteers,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.058
we've kind of figured out,

00:34:28.058 --> 00:34:29.510
that you shouldn't really be,

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.150
you don't need to be adjusting

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.860
by body weight, so-
- Interesting.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.730
- So yeah.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.250
- Well, brain size doesn't vary

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.290
that much between individuals.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.890
- Yeah, yeah.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.170
- You know, at the end,
this is a brain effect,

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.030
mostly.
- Yeah.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.930
- Probably body as well.

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.220
Okay, so the person ingests the powder

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.153
or capsule?
- Yeah, in a little pill.

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:49.986
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:34:49.986 --> 00:34:50.860
And it doesn't take-
- And how long does it-

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.260
- 30 milligrams is a small...

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.980
He could fit it into a
tiny, little capsule.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.210
And it'll take about a half hour.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.489
Well, anywhere from 15
minutes to an hour to kick in.

00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:01.322
On average, about a-
- And you said,

00:35:01.322 --> 00:35:02.423
the dose range was?

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.980
- Most of our studies are looking at where

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.769
we want a psychedelic effect

00:35:08.769 --> 00:35:12.770
during the 20 to 30 milligram range.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.230
Again, because we have
adjusted by body weight,

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.220
and the average American
is over 70 kilograms,

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.090
about 150 pounds,

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.920
people, in fact, have
gotten more like 40, 45

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.330
in a lot of cases,

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.703
but it's still a small pill.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.670
The session day itself is not full of,

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.880
for most of our studies,
is not full of tasks.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.610
We really want to look at
the therapeutic response.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.470
Obviously, if it's a therapeutic study,

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.680
we want it to be a meaningful experience.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.460
And research has found, not surprisingly,

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.540
that you get a less meaningful experience

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.790
when you're an FMRI,

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.623
- Right.
- ar when you're doing

00:35:49.623 --> 00:35:51.203
a lot of cognitive tasks.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:57.320
We've done some research
on of that type, for sure,

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.130
and plenty of colleagues have.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.780
But when you're in a therapeutic study,

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.900
or if you're trying to understand
the therapeutic effects,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.675
you have to recognize
there's this trade-off

00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:06.780
of what you can do.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.590
So our typical therapeutic model,

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.940
which, again, isn't just
limited, necessarily,

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.160
to the therapeutic studies

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.560
where we're trying to
treat a specific disorder,

00:36:16.244 --> 00:36:17.980
is to have that preparation,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.930
so you the person feels very
comfortable with their guides.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.720
I mean, ultimately, what
I tell people is like,

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.230
any emotional response, it's all welcome.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:33.100
I mean, you could be crying
like a baby hysterically,

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.600
like that's what you should be doing

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.760
if that's what you feel like.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.990
And so in a lot of ways,

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.923
sometimes people with psychedelic
experience on their own,

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.090
it can be harder to
train them in this model,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.920
because in the real world,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.200
people with psychedelic experience,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.980
a lot of times, the
rule is hold your shit.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.750
So several friends go to a party.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.130
They split a bag of mushrooms.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.030
It's like there's a social
pressure, for good reason,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:00.950
not to be the guy in
the corner of the room,

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.950
where everyone's trying to just
have a good time and relax,

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.600
like crying about your mother.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.630
Your other friends,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.110
they're having an experience too,

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.620
and you're being a drama
king, and blah-blah-blah,

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.480
And so, yeah, compose yourself.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.820
Hold your-
- You're doing-

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.060
I mean, you're doing therapy for people.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.410
It's not just about the experience?

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.243
- Right.

00:37:18.243 --> 00:37:19.076
And the experience itself

00:37:19.076 --> 00:37:22.740
is very much shaped by that
container, by the environment,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.090
and the degree to which
one allows it to happen.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.262
Once you let go of control,

00:37:29.262 --> 00:37:30.550
right?
- Yeah, let's talk about

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.170
the letting go of control.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:36.470
And then as we march through
this hypothetical experience

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.500
that does take place in your lab.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.363
So we're using a sort of generic
case example, if you will.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.490
The letting go of control

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.110
is an interesting feature, actually,

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.800
because one of the common
themes of good psychoanalysis,

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.380
or psychotherapy of any kind,

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.090
is that there's a trust built

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.690
between the patient and the analyst,

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.550
and that relationship becomes

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.340
a template for trust more generally,

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.810
and trust in one's self.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.740
It's actually, the end goal
of a good psychoanalysis

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.240
is that the patient actually...

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.120
One of the end goals

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.410
is that they develop an
empathy for themselves,

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.280
which almost sounds like an oxymoron,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.590
but if you spend a little
time with that statement,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.160
it actually pans out.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:20.160
So the psychedelic
experience is one in which,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.460
chemically, you're under a
new set of conditions, right?

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.180
- Yeah.
- Let's coarsely,

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.610
space and time are altered
in some way, sense of self.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.130
For instance, I might be going to

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.220
a strongly interoceptive mode

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.290
where I'm focusing on

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.950
everything within the confines of my skin.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.360
Whereas, normally, we're
sort of interacting in space,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.940
and pens, and conversation.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.080
[mumbles] Occasionally, I'll
pay attention to my breathing,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.630
but I'm sort of dilating

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.100
and contracting my focus for

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.350
different things all the time.
- Yeah.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.860
- The letting go of control,

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.900
it seems, to me, could be sort of

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.560
the expansion of one perceptual bubble,

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.300
to the point where you're
not actually worried

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.650
that that perceptual bubble
is going to pop, or that,

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.160
meaning you're not worried
about what people think of you.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.993
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

00:39:06.993 --> 00:39:08.130
You're not worried whether

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.560
or not your brain is going to explode,

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.660
even though a thought could feel enormous.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.650
If I keep going like this,

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.970
it almost sounds psychedelic,

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.070
but that's the idea here.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.810
Or if I'm paying attention, for instance,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.720
to some Somatic experience,

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.660
like the coursing of waves
of heat through my body,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.570
that I'm not suddenly
saying, "Is that weird?"

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.830
I'm actually just going
deeper and deeper into it.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.763
So it's, essentially, expanding
a perceptual phenomenon.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.250
How do you convince people to go further

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.710
and further down that path?

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.270
What do you think allows them to do that?

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.120
Because I think that, to me,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.970
is one of the more unusual
aspects to psychedelics,

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:51.040
is that, normally, the social pressure,

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.490
but also, just our internal
pressure from our own brain is,

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:59.040
pay attention to many things
at once, not just one.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.630
Is that-
- Especially these days.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.463
Yeah, multi-task.
- Exactly.

00:40:01.463 --> 00:40:02.296
Yeah.
- Right.

00:40:02.296 --> 00:40:03.129
Multitask.

00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:05.520
And the more that we focus on one thing,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.730
the more bizarre that thing

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.460
actually can appear to us, right?

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.293
- Right.
- I mean,

00:40:09.293 --> 00:40:10.440
even if it's the tip of your finger,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.700
and you're not taking any psychedelics,

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.460
you spend long enough looking
at the tip of your finger,

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.293
you will notice

00:40:14.293 --> 00:40:15.126
- Yeah, it's weird.
- some very

00:40:15.126 --> 00:40:16.340
weird things.
- Yeah.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.173
- Right?

00:40:17.173 --> 00:40:19.510
- I think if that as the
classic psychedelic effect,

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.447
or one classic effect,

00:40:21.447 --> 00:40:22.920
and one I've used many times,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.380
of this example of why
people should necessarily...

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.260
These aren't...

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.980
One should be judicious

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.180
in putting themselves
in these circumstances.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:40.180
Someone could be having a very
strong psilocybin experience,

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.710
and they're trying to navigate
their way in Manhattan,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:44.650
crossing the street,

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.347
and they might be staring into their hand,

00:40:46.347 --> 00:40:48.470
and realize, like that's,

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.810
their hand is the most amazing miracle.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.540
Like the entire universe
has essentially conspired

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.370
to come to this one point

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.650
to make this absolutely breathtaking...

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.720
It's almost like, I think,
of the simplest form of...

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.553
Well, we know that the

00:41:01.553 --> 00:41:03.070
simplest form of learning is habituation.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.680
Simply keep applying stimuli,

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.140
and there's less response.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.410
This is what organisms do.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.650
This is what we have to do.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.120
And it's like there's this disc

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.870
habituation component that-
- Disc habituation?

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:13.703
- Yeah, so like we wouldn't
- Yeah.

00:41:13.703 --> 00:41:14.940
- be able to get through life,

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.730
we wouldn't be able to cross
that street if we were like,

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.963
whoa, this is a miracle.

00:41:19.963 --> 00:41:21.310
You know? [laughs]
- Well, I'm so glad you-

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.730
No, I'm so glad you brought this up.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.210
I mean, here, I'm reflecting
my bias as a vision scientist,

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.790
but most people don't realize this,

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.240
but if you look at something long enough,

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.850
it eventually disappears.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.540
It doesn't actually disappear,

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.060
but perceptually, it disappears.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.450
You have these little microsaccades

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.930
that ensure that it doesn't.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:36.970
- Right.
- But most of us

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.470
don't look at any one thing for very long.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.303
- [Dr. Matthew] Right.

00:41:40.303 --> 00:41:41.800
- The brain's default is to

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.670
perceptually jump around like crazy

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.251
with the visual system,
with the auditory system.

00:41:47.251 --> 00:41:50.530
ADD, people talk about ADD a lot,

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.640
is sort of baked into our
underlying networks at some level,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.030
and then we can force attention.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.990
But it sounds like on psychedelics,

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.870
one of the primary goals therapeutically

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.620
is to really drill into one
of these perceptual bubbles,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.900
and expand that bubble.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.800
And the safety, it seems,
- Yeah.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.370
- is the safety...

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:11.400
It's sort of like a permission to do that

00:42:12.977 --> 00:42:14.180
without worrying that
something's going to happen.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.013
- Right.

00:42:15.013 --> 00:42:17.620
Because I've had people
there on the couch...

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.150
Yeah, I remember one lady said,

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:23.647
this is probably 13, 14 years ago, said,

00:42:23.647 --> 00:42:26.377
"Matt, tell me again, I can't die".

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:29.270
"I feel like my heart is going
to rip through my chest."

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.340
I mean, she was feeling...

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.800
And I should say,

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.890
typically, cardiovascular
response is modest.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.450
The pulse and blood
pressure go up somewhat.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:39.750
It can be dangerous for people

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.140
if they're at severe heart risk,

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:41.973
and we do-
- Are you monitoring

00:42:41.973 --> 00:42:43.290
this the whole time?
- We do.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.320
We do monitor it.
- So they're plugged into

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.750
a variety of devices-
- Yeah,

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.180
so every half hour or so,

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.840
we take on protocol,

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.350
and we space it out a little further,

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.770
further into the time course,

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.130
but we take their blood
pressure and their pulse.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.530
And if it goes over a certain level,

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.370
we have a protocol,

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.650
and we've had to do this only a few times,

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.350
but the physician comes in,

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.630
gives them a little
nitroglycerin under the tongue,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.860
and knocks the blood
pressure down a little bit.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.050
Doesn't affect the experience.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.360
So we have it all in place,

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.450
even though they'd probably be fine,

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:09.982
out of an abundance of caution.

00:43:09.982 --> 00:43:11.770
- [Dr. Huberman] Sure.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:15.050
- But yeah, but someone can feel that,

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.500
my god, I'm going to die.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.230
I have never felt my heart
beat like this before.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.280
And the experience of the breath

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.830
can be just absolutely fantastic.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:28.663
This sort of...

00:43:28.663 --> 00:43:29.940
And the breath is obviously interesting,

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.270
because it's this automatic control,

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.140
but it can also be voluntary.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.130
So people get into a sense of like,

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.920
my god, what if I...

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.753
It sounds silly,

00:43:39.753 --> 00:43:40.890
like a stoner movie-
- What if I forget to breathe?

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.063
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.540
- That can be so compelling.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.550
And so one of the...

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.723
Get back to one of your questions,

00:43:47.723 --> 00:43:50.270
it's like, what do we do to kind of

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.970
allow them to go further
into these bubbles?

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.140
One, is wearing the eye shades.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:57.770
We don't call 'em blindfolds,

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.440
'cause that has a negative connotation,

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.110
like peakin' out [laughs].
- And they're probably seeing

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.170
a lot in there anyway.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.092
So blind isn't the appropriate

00:44:04.092 --> 00:44:05.320
word for it.
- Right, right.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.153
I've never thought of it.

00:44:06.153 --> 00:44:08.566
This should be like inner-sight shades.

00:44:08.566 --> 00:44:09.399
[interposing voices]

00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:10.530
- But when you close the eyes,

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.040
the levels of activity in the retina

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.140
actually are maintained.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.150
It's just spontaneous activity.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.983
- And it seems,

00:44:16.983 --> 00:44:19.650
and I'd be curious about your
thoughts on this, I mean,

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.750
but the way I describe it,

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.230
is that the mind's eye,

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.350
this kind of loose term we use,

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:29.810
can be on rocket booster.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.020
So a lot of times, for some people,

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.320
like a compound like psilocybin,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.490
for some people, there's
no perceptual effect.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:38.540
If they're looking at this room,

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.710
it would pretty much look the same.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.543
Sometimes, folks say,

00:44:41.543 --> 00:44:42.930
"Yeah, things seem a little bit brighter".

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.637
Now, some people will say,
"Oh, my god, there's waves".

00:44:45.637 --> 00:44:48.820
"That wall is waving,
and these curtains..."

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.680
On these compounds,

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.440
people don't typically see pink elephants.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.260
You do actually get that in another class.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.020
I didn't mention the anticholinergic,

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.720
sort of like atropine and
scopolamine, those drugs.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.180
Those are the true hallucinations,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.270
where you thought you
were having a conversation

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:04.717
with someone who was never there.

00:45:04.717 --> 00:45:07.020
- Right.
[interposing voices]

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.160
We will definitely get to those.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.830
But the reason I kind of cringe,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.810
and I say, "Oh, my", when
you talked about those,

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.270
is that knowing a little bit

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.270
about the pharmacology of acetylcholine,

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.230
the idea of manipulating
that system, to me,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.490
sounds very uncomfortable.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.930
Because the whole idea
of witches and flying,

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.760
there was a whole history
there hundreds of years ago,

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.680
so-called witches taking these agents,

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.660
and then thinking they were
flying around on broomsticks,

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.597
and things of that sort.
- Yeah.

00:45:36.597 --> 00:45:38.610
- And there's a lot of mythology
around the broomsticks.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:39.830
It's complicated.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.530
But that sounds very unpleasant.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.840
One thing about the serotonergic,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.073
let's just, for with psilocybin,

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.410
so there's an expansion of a particular,

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.010
fairly narrow, percept.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:54.843
It could be sound.

00:45:54.843 --> 00:45:55.676
- Yeah.
- It could be an emotion.

00:45:55.676 --> 00:45:56.510
It could be sadness.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.670
Could be a historical event,

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.980
or a fear of the future.
- Yes.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.650
- And you've mentioned before,

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:06.250
that there's something to be
learned in that experience.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.083
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

00:46:07.083 --> 00:46:09.230
- There's something about
going into that experience

00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:14.900
in an undeterred way

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.330
that allows somebody
to bring something back

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:20.790
into more standard reality.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:22.370
- Yeah.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.100
- Given the huge variety of experiences

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.540
that people have on psychedelics,

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.203
given the huge variety of
humans that are out there,

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.300
but what are now very clear

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.160
therapeutic effects in
the realm of depression,

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.780
what do you think is the
value of going into this

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.050
fairly restricted perceptual bubble,

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.350
what we are calling, letting
go, or giving up control?

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.890
Because if the experiences are many,

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:50.850
but the value of what one exports

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.950
from that experience is kind of similar

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.590
across individuals,
- Yeah.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.850
- that raises all sorts
of interesting questions.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.990
And this is not a philosophy discussion.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.220
We're talking about biology

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.980
and psychology here.
- Yeah.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.200
So let's say, I decide
that I'm going to focus on

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.300
the tip of my pen.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.820
I mean, in a psychedelic state,

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.150
I could fall in love with this pen.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.016
I do happen to like these Pilots V5s

00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:12.290
[Dr. Matthew laughs]
and V7s very much.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.560
But I could feel real love

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.680
- Yeah.
- for the pen,

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.513
right?
- Yeah.

00:47:16.513 --> 00:47:18.820
- That's not an
unreasonable thing to expect

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.730
in a psychedelic journey.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.290
- Right, right.
- And in the context

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.970
of your laboratory model,

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.430
which I think is a great one,

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.920
that experience will be just as valid

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.610
as me going into the experience

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.250
of some of the deep
friction that I might have

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.750
with a family member
over my entire lifespan.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.720
- Yeah.
- And yet,

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.840
the export from that,

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.940
those two vastly different experiences,

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.870
is one of feeling a better
relationship to the world

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:43.960
into one's self.
- Right.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.793
- So what does this

00:47:44.793 --> 00:47:45.727
tell us about-
- How can the pen,

00:47:45.727 --> 00:47:46.980
- Right.
- and the processing

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.130
your childhood trauma

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.640
both lead to-
- Right.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.010
- Yeah-
- So what does this...

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.230
I mean, at that level,
- Yeah.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:54.830
- it raises this question, like,

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.030
first of all, how, why,

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.100
I mean, or just, what are
your thoughts on that?

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.120
- So this is definitely in the...

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.800
This is in the terrain we're
figuring out, you know?

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.820
So there's no...

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.690
Educated speculation is
the best I can provide.

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:12.850
but I think the best...

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.897
I think the common denominator
are persisting changes

00:48:18.897 --> 00:48:20.950
and self-representation.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.198
- Okay, tell me more
about self-representation.

00:48:23.198 --> 00:48:25.090
Yeah.
- That's the way

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.433
one holds the sense of self,

00:48:28.469 --> 00:48:31.950
the fundamental relationship
of a person in the world.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.820
I mentioned earlier, that these experience

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.560
seems to alter the models
we hold of reality,

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.570
and I think the self is the biggest model,

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.503
that I am a thing that's
separate from other things.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.470
I am defined by certain...

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.900
I have a certain personality,

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.560
and I'm a smoker that's
having a hard time quitting,

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.910
or I'm a depressed person that
views myself as a failure,

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.743
and all of these things,

00:48:55.743 --> 00:48:56.880
those are models too.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.440
And I think that change
in self-representation

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.040
may be an endpoint for
these different experiences.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.980
I mean, maybe the falling
in love with the pen,

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.330
the whole idea that you're,

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.970
especially in contemplation afterwards,

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.330
and obviously, I'm speculating here,

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.620
but the whole idea that you could

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.090
have such a deep connection
with this random,

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:21.740
obviously, random, aspect of the universe

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.550
could potentially lead to this

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.840
transformed understanding of the self,

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.640
and the pen may be a proxy
for the miracle of reality

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.340
in a way that relies nothing on,

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.320
on no supernatural thinking.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.157
You know, you can be a hard
atheist, and you take this,

00:49:38.157 --> 00:49:40.860
you know, ultimately,
oh, my god, like that,

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.770
just like the pen,

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:45.397
this is amazing, the fact that we exist,

00:49:45.397 --> 00:49:48.090
and so there could be
an extrapolation chair.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:49.240
And you used the pen,

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.680
but I think it sounds similar to

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.980
Aldous Huxley's classic description

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.150
and the doors of perception
of the chair and the drapes.

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.927
He took 500 milligrams of mescalin,

00:49:58.927 --> 00:50:00.250
and he was just like-
- Is that a

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.410
high dose of mescalin?
- Yeah, yeah,

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:06.522
and that's a heroic dose, for sure.

00:50:06.522 --> 00:50:09.320
He's just going off of the
chairiness of the chair,

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.006
like this chair is exuding
the quality of being a chair,

00:50:13.006 --> 00:50:14.000
and-
- So this is this

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.253
expansion of the perceptual bubble?

00:50:17.277 --> 00:50:20.740
A narrow percept that then grows within

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.120
the confines of that narrow percept?

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.010
- Yeah.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:27.130
- So a sense of self is a
very interesting phenomenon,

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.130
and if we could dissect it a little bit,

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:31.680
there's the somatic sense of self,

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.960
so the ability to literally feel the self.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.800
This process, we call interoception.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.580
And then there's the
the title of the self,

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.050
the I am blank.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.883
- Yeah.
- And I noticed

00:50:41.883 --> 00:50:42.780
you said that several times,

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.707
and it's intriguing to me.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:44.950
But a good friend,

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.680
I don't think I can or
should mention his name,

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.300
but he had a very long
and successful career

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.920
within one of the more elite
teams within the SEAL teams,

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.880
and he's a fairly philosophical guy,

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.670
also a very practical guy,

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:03.740
but he has said many times to me,

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.740
that the most powerful words
in any language are "I am",

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.460
because whatever follows that tends,

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.620
if you repeat it enough,

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.300
tends to have this kind
of feedback effect on

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.763
how you are in the world.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.330
The first pass,

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.600
it sounded to me a little
bit like, you know,

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.990
kind of like internet
psychology-type-thing,

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.300
like, oh, the secret
or something you'd say,

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.133
which frankly,

00:51:27.133 --> 00:51:28.435
I'm just not particularly-
- A little New Agey.

00:51:28.435 --> 00:51:29.268
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:51:29.268 --> 00:51:30.390
- [mumbles] If you kind of like

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.700
the whole fake it till you make it,

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.020
I don't actually subscribe to any of that.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:34.853
- [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh.

00:51:34.853 --> 00:51:36.700
- But in dissecting that a
little bit further with him,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.570
I came to realize,

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:41.110
that these words, "I
am", are very powerful.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.700
I don't think you reprogram
your brain just by saying them.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.480
But how one defines themselves internally,

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.290
not just to other people,

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.423
but how one psychologically,
and by default,

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.400
defines themselves, I
think, is very powerful.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.950
And depressed people,
as well as happy people,

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.060
seem to define themselves

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.810
in terms of these categories
of emotional states.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:07.320
So I think it's so interesting,

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.000
that letting go and going
into this perceptual bubble,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.580
which is facilitated by, obviously,

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.430
a really wonderful team of therapists,

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:17.610
but also, the serotonergic agent,

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:18.750
- Yeah.
- allows us

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:23.270
to potentially reshape
the perception of self,

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:26.450
that's a tremendous
feat of neuroplasticity.

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.283
- Right.

00:52:27.283 --> 00:52:30.770
And I think, certainly,
more work needs to be done.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:33.020
This is the horizon.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:35.480
And I actually credit Chris Letheby,

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.300
a philosopher in Australia,

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.250
who has a forthcoming book.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.660
It might be out right about now, or soon,

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:44.727
within the coming months,

00:52:44.727 --> 00:52:47.258
"Psychedelics and Philosophy".

00:52:47.258 --> 00:52:49.370
- That's the title of the book?

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.267
- It might be "Psychedelic Philosophy"?

00:52:51.267 --> 00:52:52.100
- Okay.
- It's really-

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.933
- Chris Letheby.

00:52:52.933 --> 00:52:54.750
We'll put a link to it-
- Right.

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.300
And so his conclusion in this,

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.410
it's a really great book,

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.570
and he really plays with the idea,

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.490
it's like, psychedelic
experiences come along

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.740
with a lot of supernatural
stuff, experience.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.940
It can certainly go along with that.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.370
But the idea is like,

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:09.820
can these experiences,

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.420
and including those therapeutic effects,

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.130
be explained from a
naturalist point of view?

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:17.160
And his conclusion is that,

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.850
the changes in self representation
may be the commonality.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.860
Now, that could go along
with plant spirits,

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.060
and the Buddha, and chakras,

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:32.060
and whatever your model
system, in Jesus, all of that,

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.990
but it could also be completely devoid

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:37.520
of any supernatural, any religious.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.900
And we do, in fact, see
all of these varieties.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.570
So I think there's something about this

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:46.370
change in sense of self.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.610
It seems to be something on the
identity level, both with...

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.010
I think of the work we
did with cancer patients

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:52.027
who had substantial depression

00:53:52.027 --> 00:53:53.960
and anxiety because of their cancer,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.060
and also our work with people

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.570
trying to quit cigarette smoking.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.810
I mean, there's this real...

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.570
There seems to be, when it really works,

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:06.400
this change in how people view themselves,

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.320
like with smoking,

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.320
like really stepping out
of this model of like,

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:15.670
I'm a smoker, it's tough
to quit smoking cigarettes.

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.680
I can't do it.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.450
I failed a bunch of times.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.830
I remember one participant
during the session,

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.867
but he held onto this afterward, said,

00:54:22.867 --> 00:54:26.830
"My god, it's like I
can really just decide,

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.720
like flicking off a button,

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.730
I can decide not to smoke".

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:32.037
I call these duh experiences
with psychedelics,

00:54:32.037 --> 00:54:35.867
'cause people often, like in
the cancer stage, you say,

00:54:35.867 --> 00:54:38.027
"I'm causing most of my own suffering".

00:54:38.998 --> 00:54:40.250
I can follow my appointments.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.083
I can do everything,

00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:42.050
but I can still plan for the...

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.910
I'm not getting outside in the sunshine.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.460
I'm not playing with my grandkids.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.730
I'm choosing to do that.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.877
And it's like, they told
themselves that before,

00:54:49.877 --> 00:54:53.740
and the smoker has told themselves
a million times, I can...

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.573
So it sounds...

00:54:54.573 --> 00:54:56.370
When it comes out of their mouths,

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:57.203
folks will say,

00:54:57.203 --> 00:54:58.350
this is part of the ineffability

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.450
of a psychedelic experience,

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:01.460
folks say, "I know this
sounds like bullshit

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.380
and this sounds like,

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.440
but my god, I could just sigh",

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:09.040
like they're feeling
this gravity of agency,

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.150
which I think is interesting,

00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:15.150
cause regardless of the debates
on the reality of freewill,

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.350
I think the philosophy of that,

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.880
whether it's ultimately free will,

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.010
like pure agency, if that exists,

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:24.360
which I'm skeptical of,

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.630
or just the idea, that clearly,
we have a sense of agency.

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.400
There's something there,

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.493
whether it's the sense of agency even,

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.570
the human being has,

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:38.910
and that seems to be, at times,

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.240
fundamentally, supercharged
from a psychedelic experience.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.790
This idea like, I'm just
going to make a decision.

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:48.800
Like normally, like you
tell a depressed person,

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.350
don't think of yourself that way.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:51.183
You're not a failure.

00:55:51.183 --> 00:55:52.016
- They can't do it.
[interposing voices]

00:55:52.016 --> 00:55:52.849
- It's just, yeah.

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:53.682
It's like-
- Right.

00:55:53.682 --> 00:55:54.550
- Well-
- But you can, actually,

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:55.730
in one of these states,

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:57.920
have an experience where
you realize, like, my god.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.452
Just like using MDMA to treat PTSD,

00:56:00.452 --> 00:56:01.360
and we're going to be starting work

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.140
with psilocybin to treat PTSD,

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:06.780
someone could really
reprocess their trauma

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.840
in a way that has lasting effects.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.480
And clearly, there's
probably something that...

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.680
You know, reconsolidation
of those memories,

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.080
they are altered,

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.310
very consistent with our understanding

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:20.400
of the way memory works.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.780
So the whole idea, people can actually,

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.480
in a few hours, have a
such a profound experience

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.330
that they decide to make these changes

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:32.650
in who they are, and it sticks,

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:34.207
there seems to be something like that.

00:56:34.207 --> 00:56:35.520
- And that's profound.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.720
I mean, I think, a few moments ago,

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.430
I made a some semi-disparaging statements

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.890
about things like the
secret, and affirmations,

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:46.450
and the reason I do that

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.900
with a nod to the fact that the people

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.490
who are putting those ideas forward

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.120
are well-intentioned people,

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:58.120
is that the neural networks of
the brain put language last.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.550
We tell stories, you know?

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:03.080
And stories are very powerful.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.700
But I think one of the most cruel aspects

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.930
of the whole self-help
literature in popular psychology

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:13.920
is this idea, that everything you say,

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.870
your brain and body hear it.

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:19.440
That's actually a very unkind
or even cruel thing for

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.090
people who are depressed
or anxious to hear,

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.100
because if they hear
that, and believe that,

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.300
and I want to be clear,
I don't think it's true,

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:30.640
that they think that it's
very hard to control thoughts.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.550
Is it very hard to control thoughts?

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.280
So if somebody says, "I can't",

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.187
and then somebody says,

00:57:36.187 --> 00:57:37.740
"Well, no, every time you say you can't,

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.550
your brain hears that,
and it reinforces it",

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:41.803
that's a very treacherous place to live.

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:45.330
And language is powerful,

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:49.030
but neural networks, the brain,

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.110
and the networks that
underlie emotionality,

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:53.170
and perception, and sense of self,

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:56.050
they don't change in response to language.

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:58.710
They change in response to experience.

00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:59.543
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

00:57:59.543 --> 00:58:01.742
- And just fundamentally,

00:58:01.742 --> 00:58:02.760
there are some prerequisites.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.690
You need certain neuromodulators present,

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.480
like serotonin or dopamine.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.290
You need them to be at sufficient levels.

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:10.440
You don't need a drug
necessarily to do it.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.610
You give a kid a kitten or a puppy,

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.860
their first kitten or puppy,

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:17.780
and the levels of dopamine and serotonin,

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:18.620
I've never measured them,

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:19.570
but we can be pretty sure

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:21.880
that they are higher than baseline,

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.550
and that experience will
reshape them, right?

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.180
- Yeah.
- Likewise with an adult

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.320
in certain circumstances.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.430
So I think I'm fascinated by this idea,

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:35.940
that a somatic and a
perceptual experience,

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:39.210
but a real experience of the
sort that you're describing,

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.400
- Yeah.
- is what allows us

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.950
to reshape our neural circuitry,

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:43.810
and to feel differently about ourselves.

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:48.740
And I know there's been
really tremendous success

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:52.460
in many individuals of
alleviating depression,

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.190
of treating trauma with
these different compounds.

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:56.830
I wanted to step from

00:58:58.145 --> 00:59:01.640
the experience under the
effects of the psychedelic.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.340
So the person there with your team,

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.920
they go into this expanded
perceptual bubble.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.050
If things go well,

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.070
they're able to do that
to a really deep degree.

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:12.400
Maybe it's the relived trauma?

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.630
Maybe it's the beauty of their ability

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:16.980
to connect to things in the world?

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.930
And I want to talk about the
transition out of that state,

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:22.030
and then the export into life,

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:23.240
because this is really where the

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.090
power of psychedelic seems to be

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:26.550
in the therapeutic sense,

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:29.610
is the ability to learn, truly
learn, from that experience,

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:31.920
so that the learning becomes the default.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.360
That one doesn't have
to remind themselves,

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.520
oh, I am...

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.990
You know, they don't have
to do an affirmation,

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.057
I am a happy person, I am a...

00:59:37.057 --> 00:59:38.300
You know, I always think of

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.190
Bart Simpson
- Right

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:40.370
- writing on the chalkboard.
[Dr. Matthew laughs]

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:41.460
- Yeah.
- It didn't work for him

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.510
It doesn't work for this other stuff too.

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:46.440
So as they transition out of this state,

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.770
I know that there's a
kind of a heightened,

00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:49.420
there's a so-called peak,

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.710
- Yeah.
- where everything seems to be

00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:55.710
kind of cascading in at such
a level that the person just,

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.800
they can't really turn
it off at that point.

00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.920
- Right.
- It would be challenging.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.920
And then they start to exit
the effects of the drug.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.250
Are those transition zones,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.240
are those valuable,

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.830
much like is the
transition between a dream

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:12.840
and the waking state valuable?

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.560
Because you're in a sort of
mishmash of altered reality

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.860
and new reality.
- Right.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.503
- What do you do to
guide people through the,

01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:23.970
out the tunnel,

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.260
as they exit the tunnel?
- Yeah.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.370
And I have to say,

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:30.240
this is where we need
more experimentation.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.450
Really, the clinical model goes back

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:35.990
to literally the late 1950s,

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:39.430
and there's been virtually
no experimentation on,

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:42.050
let's say, randomized people to...

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:43.070
We're going to talk more

01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.110
during the latter half of
the session, versus not.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.660
Versus we have them

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.180
write an essay after
their session, versus not.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.377
Versus we have this amount of integration.

01:00:52.377 --> 01:00:53.540
[interposing voices]

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.373
- In your studies,

01:00:54.373 --> 01:00:55.980
are they writing or talking

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.830
as they're doing it?
- So-

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:00.650
And it's called a very loosey
goosey term, integration,

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.233
but for us means,

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:05.930
as they're coming back
from the experience,

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.110
so sort of five, six hours in,

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:09.240
so this is the afternoon,

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.680
they've been dosed around nine o'clock,

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.180
so this is like four o'clock or so,

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.430
just some initial, tell
us about the experience.

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:16.263
Do you want to...

01:01:16.263 --> 01:01:17.350
Not unpacking it totally,

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:18.350
but just kind of initially

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:20.340
just have a little bit of
discussion before they go home.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.840
So there's a little bit of that.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.490
But then, that night, their
homework is to write something.

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:27.750
So it could be a few bullet points.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.490
It could be 20 pages.

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:34.020
And we get everything in that range.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.940
But try not to be self-critical.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.170
It's not graded.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:39.760
This is just to process,

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.610
and for a point of
discussion the next day.

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.470
So they write something,

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.970
they come in the next
day for one to two hour,

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:48.190
depending on the study,
"integration session",

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:51.400
basically, let's discuss your experience.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.447
And depending on what study it's in,

01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:56.210
like what that mean for...

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.200
You're dealing with cancer,

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.503
what might that mean for your smoking,

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.490
or becoming a non smoker?

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.990
So you encourage them to
simply take it seriously.

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.240
And I think this is, again, a sort of,

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.870
one of the points that
could be the antithesis

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:13.910
of what some just kind
of social users use.

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:17.280
I mean, this was written
about by Huston Smith,

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.350
the scholar of religion,

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.810
in terms of these mystical experiences

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.220
that can happen from psychedelics,

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.000
and how a lot of times,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.838
the attribution to a
drug effect is dismissed.

01:02:26.838 --> 01:02:31.838
Even if one has this sense of
being one with the universe,

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:35.140
and it totally shakes
their soul, so to speak,

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.740
but the next day, their friends are like,

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.850
ah, dude, you were screwed up!

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:40.160
Too much acid for you!

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:40.993
Whoo!

01:02:40.993 --> 01:02:41.826
You know?

01:02:41.826 --> 01:02:43.850
Like, man, next time, you
needed to have a few more beers

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:44.980
to bring that down.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:49.980
You know, like this sort
of social reinforcement

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.900
for dismissing the experience.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.300
Oh, god, you were talking
out of your head, man.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.240
Even if it's good natured,

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.430
but it's this dismissal.

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:00.680
It's not like...

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.360
What you want to do is like,
tell me more about that.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.300
You know, you were crying at one point

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.380
in talking about your mom.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.330
Let's talk about that.

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.163
What was that like?

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:12.134
Do you remember that?

01:03:12.134 --> 01:03:13.342
[interposing voices]

01:03:13.342 --> 01:03:14.780
- Are you doing that follow-up,

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.680
or they're encouraged to
do that in their own life

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.110
with the various people in their life?

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:18.943
- Both.

01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:20.930
So we do that explicitly in the follow-up,

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.830
where we have these discussions.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:26.580
Depending on what the situation is,

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.830
you might encourage the
person to kind of follow-up.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:34.830
It's really, the basics of
it is, is supportive therapy.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.400
It's non-structured.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.170
It's use all the reflective listening,

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:42.830
and the sort of the
humanistic psychology thing,

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:45.260
unconditional positive
regard for the person.

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:50.260
But I think, if someone feels inclined

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.630
to apologize to their
sibling about some things,

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.810
like, yeah, go ahead and call 'em up.

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.200
With something big, like
a relationship change,

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.210
I'd be like, sit on that two weeks.

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:05.180
Don't make any big...

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.580
Don't end any relationship.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.610
Don't quit your job.

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.260
Don't make any big-
- Do you also tell them

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.810
not to start any relationships?

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.640
- I don't remember that ever coming up.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.270
- Interesting.
- But if it-

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:18.190
- I'm not joking.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:19.270
I was just wondering, you know?

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.103
- Yeah.
- But it makes sense

01:04:20.103 --> 01:04:21.030
why you would want-
- Like if they're dating,

01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:21.890
and they're thinking like,

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:24.250
ah, it might be time to
take it to the next level.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.300
Should I ask this girl to marry me?

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.299
If it did come up, I would say there too,

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:30.207
why don't you sit on that

01:04:30.207 --> 01:04:31.040
a week or two?
- Yeah,

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.470
don't get a puppy.
- And let your sober mind-

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:33.460
- Don't get a puppy.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.900
Certainly, don't get four puppies

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.230
until your...
[Dr. Matthew laughs]

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:40.280
I have a question about flashbacks.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.113
- Uh-huh.

01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:43.280
- You know, one of the kind of things

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.840
you hear is flashbacks,

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.040
and that people-
- Yeah.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.660
- Do people get flashbacks?

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.893
And if so, what is the
basis of flashbacks?

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:54.950
The on-the-street lore about this,

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:57.770
is that, somehow, some of the compound

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.580
gets stored in body fat tissues,

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.510
and then released later.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:02.960
Like, is that complete nonsense?

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.310
- No evidence for that,

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:06.490
so probably complete nonsense.

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:07.650
- Flashbacks are nonsense,

01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:09.610
or the storage in body
fat is complete nonsense?

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.080
- The storage in body fat.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.370
So to answer whether flashbacks
are complete nonsense,

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:15.470
we have to define it.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:16.320
So I really think

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.200
these are multiple
constructs that are going.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.650
It's not the same thing
that fall under that term.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:25.500
There is a phenomenon that appears real,

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.460
that's called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder.

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.623
It's in the DSM.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.153
A certain number of people,

01:05:32.153 --> 01:05:35.800
a very small number of
people percentage-wise

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.140
who have used psychedelics,

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:40.180
will have these persisting
perceptual disorders,

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.790
like they'll see halos around things.

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.083
They'll see some trails,

01:05:43.943 --> 01:05:47.463
like the after image is
following an object in motion.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.340
They'll see distortions in color.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.460
And it'll be like anything else

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.700
that's a disorder in the DSM.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.230
It has to be clinically distressing,

01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:02.220
and it has to be persisting
over some number of months.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.950
And so very rare, very mysterious.

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:06.893
Some of the keys to that are,

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:09.900
amazingly, it's never been seen

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.510
in the thousands of participants,

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:12.740
either from the older era,

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.327
from the late '50s to the early '70s,

01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:17.520
the people in psychedelic
studies with LSD,

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.590
psilocybin, mescalin,

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:20.200
and it's never been
seen in the Modern Era,

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.750
again, now with thousands of participants

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:26.560
at a number of centers like
ours throughout the world.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.550
So it seems to be something that is,

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.890
for some reason, happening in illicit use.

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.380
So now that brings in,

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.210
okay, is there polypharmacology?

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:39.043
- Right.
- You know,

01:06:39.043 --> 01:06:40.350
'cause you're drinking-
- Did you take

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.320
what you thought you took?
- Yeah.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.153
What's the dose?

01:06:42.153 --> 01:06:43.500
What's the purity?
- Yeah.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.587
- But then also, what I think
is actually even more so,

01:06:46.587 --> 01:06:48.130
and what's likely going on,

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:51.050
is some sort of very rare
neurological susceptibility.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:56.050
There is one paper that is
a case series of individuals

01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:57.047
reporting these symptoms,

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:59.420
and they didn't limit it to

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:02.660
just people who had had
hallucinogen history.

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.930
And the amazing thing about this,

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.600
is that a number of people

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.770
seem to have straight up

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:11.850
HPPD diagnosis.
- What is HPPD?

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:14.120
- Hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder,

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.090
who have never taken a psychedelic.

01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:21.090
So it's often prompted by
alcohol, benzodiazepines,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.273
cannabis, even tobacco.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:29.500
And I believe, in one individual,

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.210
no lifetime history of any,

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:35.990
it wasn't proceeded by any
of those substance uses.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.380
So I think it's...

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.630
I think of it like

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:42.700
the precipitation exacerbation
of psychotic disorders.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.780
It seems pretty clear through observation

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.960
that some people with
either predisposition

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.910
or active psychotic disease,

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:51.260
that this can destabilize them.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.680
- Yeah.
- A psychedelic-

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.350
The same way that a life experience

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:55.320
can destabilize this
- Sure.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.400
- person more easily.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.233
I think of it like that.

01:07:57.233 --> 01:07:58.110
There's probably some

01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.710
pretty rare neurological susceptibility.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.470
We have tended, this
goes back to the '80s,

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.590
clinical practice, it ended up in the DSM

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:08.810
focused on hallucinogen,

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:13.810
because I relate it to the
psychology of xenophobia.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.820
It's always the weird other
thing that gets the attribution.

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.820
You don't attribute to the thing,

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.650
like, oh yeah. did you smoke cigarettes?

01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:21.483
Did you drink?

01:08:21.483 --> 01:08:22.316
It's like, well, yeah,

01:08:22.316 --> 01:08:23.690
but I see lots of people drinking,

01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:25.650
and not ending up with this.

01:08:25.650 --> 01:08:29.170
You take a crazy drug,

01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:31.150
and you can get people to believe

01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:32.260
all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.400
The biggest example of that

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.460
is the cathinone derivatives,

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.657
so-called bath salts.

01:08:36.657 --> 01:08:37.570
And if you remember,

01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.010
several years back,
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:39.010 --> 01:08:41.020
What was the deal with that?
- the guy in Florida

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.840
that ate the other guy's face.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.750
There was a homeless guy

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:47.050
that literally ate part
of someone's face off.

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:48.910
Yeah, it's one of the crazies-
- While the person was alive?

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:50.550
- While the person was alive.

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:53.707
And all it took was one
sheriff's deputy to say,

01:08:53.707 --> 01:08:54.540
"Well, I don't know,

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.680
but I bet it was some
of that bath salt stuff

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.530
that's been going on".

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:00.840
The only thing-
- What was it?

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.673
- [Dr. Matthew] The only thing

01:09:01.673 --> 01:09:02.506
in his system-
- Well, maybe we can

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:03.930
set the record straight for people.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.763
What was this...

01:09:04.763 --> 01:09:06.760
Why would he say bath salts,

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.660
and was it bath salts?
- It wasn't.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.450
And so the only thing
in his tox was cannabis,

01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.600
which we all know,

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.610
typically, people don't
eat people's faces off

01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:18.010
after they get stoned.
- It makes you hungrier,

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.220
but not that hungry.
- [laughs] Yeah.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.053
Right.
- Yeah.

01:09:20.053 --> 01:09:20.886
- Right.

01:09:20.886 --> 01:09:23.400
So it's just an example of the xenophobia.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.990
Today, if you get on Google Images,

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:26.520
and look up bath salts,

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.180
one of the most common images you'll see

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.460
is this poor guy's face being eaten off.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.580
So we're just so ready to latch on.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:38.077
Just like the people of another
culture that we don't know,

01:09:38.077 --> 01:09:41.410
it's very easy to assign attribution

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.610
to a class that you're
very unfamiliar with.

01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:45.670
So I think they, the psychedelics,

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:46.770
got that attribution

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:50.430
with this very rare
neurological susceptibility,

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:51.840
the way that alcohol didn't.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.090
So I think it's not
specific to psychedelics,

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.280
but we don't really know.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.370
But we'd look at it,

01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:00.640
and our research have never
seen an example of it.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.760
But flashbacks can mean
a number of other things.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.480
I think the most common
thing people experiences is,

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.603
what we call, state-dependent learning.

01:10:09.754 --> 01:10:12.280
It's returning yourself
to a similar context

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.990
can bring back the same thoughts

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:15.940
and emotions as the experience.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.800
So someone used mushrooms a week ago,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.563
now they do something like
they smoked some cannabis,

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.443
or they take a warm bath,

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:29.150
or they're simply relaxed,

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:30.610
and it seems to come out of the blue,

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.010
and all of a sudden, these,

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:34.740
or they follow a thought
trail that takes them,

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.810
that reminds them of their,

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:39.960
and they find themselves in
that same experience again,

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.060
I think that's more of
state-dependent learning.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.287
It's not the distressing
component that is in,

01:10:45.287 --> 01:10:47.480
and it's typically not perceptual.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.450
And then another class are just sort of

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.570
perceptual anomalies within a day

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:58.580
or two following the
experience, which is not HPPD.

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.720
Most people have joked
that this is a free trip.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.010
Like you might see a few trails
or halos the day afterwards.

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.688
It doesn't last longer than that.

01:11:07.688 --> 01:11:09.370
And it doesn't screw you up.

01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:10.203
It's kind of fun,

01:11:10.203 --> 01:11:11.630
like, "Oh yeah, I'm
still seeing some trip",

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.460
most people will say.

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.523
So it could mean any of those things.

01:11:14.523 --> 01:11:16.630
- Got it.
- So the flashback is...

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:17.620
Yeah-
- Interesting.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.250
No, I appreciate you clarifying that.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:25.010
I mean, one very common
misconception about neuroplasticity

01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:26.370
is that it's an event.

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:28.900
And it's not an event, it's a process.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.660
And we have no understanding

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.830
of the duration of that process.

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:37.490
However, the experience of any drug

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.440
or any life experience, right?

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.020
Even if it's a trauma, or
a wonderful experience,

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.410
or a psychedelic experience,
it doesn't matter,

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:48.010
sets in motion a series
of dominoes that fall,

01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:49.580
and it's the falling of those dominoes

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.030
that we call neuroplasticity.

01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:54.180
I mean, the reshaping of neural
circuits could take years.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.120
We don't know.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.450
It's the trigger,

01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:58.120
and then there's the actual change.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.540
And so I think that some
of what you described

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.790
could be, literally, the
reordering of circuitry,

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:06.690
that in some individuals, might
extend longer than others.

01:12:07.914 --> 01:12:10.390
And there is one phenomenon

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:14.410
that I've been told people experience,

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.150
and I'm wondering
whether or not any of the

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:17.590
patients you've worked with,

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:20.603
or people in your trials
have ever reported this?

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.153
I've never done ayahuasca,

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:25.930
which I'm assuming has some overlap

01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:27.060
with the serotonin system.

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:27.893
Probably hits a

01:12:27.893 --> 01:12:29.216
variety of systems.
- So it's DMT,

01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:30.299
the active-
- Right.

01:12:30.299 --> 01:12:31.257
- It's orally-
- Excuse me, that's right.

01:12:31.257 --> 01:12:32.090
- It's NAO inhibitors
- Of course.

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.923
Of course.
- that allow the

01:12:32.923 --> 01:12:34.230
- Yeah.
- DMT to be orally-

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:36.800
- Right, I should've recalled that.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.633
Absolutely.

01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:38.466
Well, I've never done it,

01:12:38.466 --> 01:12:41.750
but a number of people I know
that have done ayahuasca,

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:44.810
as well as people I know who've done MDMA,

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:48.900
report an increased sense of
what is sometimes called ASMR,

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.050
or these autonomic sensory
meridian reflexes, which is...

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:53.883
And it's interesting,

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:57.920
a lot of people have these
naturally, and they hide these.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.740
It's actually something that many people

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.223
keep hidden to themselves.

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:03.730
I'll just ask you, if you can do it.

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:06.650
So some people are able to pass

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:08.480
like a shiver down their spine,

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.510
or up their spine, consciously.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:11.930
You know, like you can kind of.

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.530
I'm able to actually pass
a shiver up my spine.

01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:15.470
I actually learned how to do this

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:16.680
when I was a kid on a hot day.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.350
I was standing on a field in sports camp.

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.550
I was like, it's really hot here.

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:21.700
And I could actually
create like a cooling,

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:24.860
cooled perception.
- Yeah.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:26.180
- I told someone this once,

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.710
and then this led to a discussion of,

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:28.543
oh, I can do it,

01:13:28.543 --> 01:13:29.560
but I always hid that from people,

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.660
'cause it's actually somewhat pleasurable.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.493
And this is a

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:35.270
well-known phenomenon, ASMR.
[Dr. Matthew laughs]

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:36.880
And some people I know

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.183
who have taken MDMA
therapeutically, or ayahuasca,

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.770
will report that they feel
great relief from this.

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:47.210
They can generate these autonomic reflexes

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:49.260
through their body more readily.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.740
Probably, I'm guessing,

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.730
because they were able to tune in

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:55.320
to a kind of deeper sense of somatic self.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.010
Now, on the internet,
ASMR, if you look it up,

01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:59.470
it's a little bit like
the bath salt thing,

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:00.490
but in the other direction.

01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:02.420
Like there were people that pay...

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:05.040
Let's just say, there
are accounts on YouTube

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.730
that have many, many millions of viewers

01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:11.610
of people that will
whisper to them about...

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:15.420
Like, for instance, there's
people that will go listen to,

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.990
it seems to be women in particular,

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:19.950
whispering about like car
mechanics, or something,

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:21.620
or scratching.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.560
So there are certain
sounds that will do this.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.860
Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.160
And people experience
immense pleasure from it.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.570
It's not really sexual pleasure,

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:30.600
but it's this kind of

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.480
deep core of the body.
- Yeah.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.804
- It's the autonomic
nervous system down in the

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:35.637
curve of the spine.
- Probably what a

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.840
certain number of people
would call Kundalini,

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.108
which is another one-
- Right.

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:40.251
- Scientifically who'd...

01:14:40.251 --> 01:14:41.084
Yeah.
- That's right.

01:14:41.084 --> 01:14:41.917
- Yeah.
- People who do

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:44.400
long duration Kundalini
breathing sessions,

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.820
many of them will report
later feeling as if

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.840
their perception of self
is outside of their head.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.673
- Ah!

01:14:51.673 --> 01:14:52.700
- That they're literally...

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.460
It's very uncomfortable for them.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.080
That they feel like they're walking around

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.420
with their sense of self
extended beyond the body.

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:02.540
And this is a clinically
described neurologic phenomenon.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.473
- Have any studies been done?
- No.

01:15:03.473 --> 01:15:05.950
- I would imagine, that
person might actually like...

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:07.450
Would they duck?

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:08.456
- Oh, what-
- If they're-

01:15:08.456 --> 01:15:09.289
That would be

01:15:09.289 --> 01:15:10.122
an interesting experiment-
- And that would be

01:15:10.122 --> 01:15:10.955
the kind of thing my lab

01:15:10.955 --> 01:15:11.788
would want to get into.
- Where they could-

01:15:11.788 --> 01:15:12.621
- That's right.
- Yeah,

01:15:12.621 --> 01:15:13.454
their body could clear,
- Right.

01:15:13.454 --> 01:15:14.580
Right.
- but their projection

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:15.480
- Yeah.
- wouldn't?

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.710
- Yeah, the sense of self,

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:18.710
I mean, there's a well-known phenomenon.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.210
In a few individuals, it's very sad,

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:24.060
where people actually avidly seek out

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.260
amputation of their limbs,

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.330
because their limbs, they feel,

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:27.670
don't belong to their body.

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:28.503
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:28.503 --> 01:15:29.336
Yep.
- This is very sad,

01:15:29.336 --> 01:15:31.060
and fortunately, very rare,

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.680
but also a very sad condition.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.700
Anyway, I think that the
core of this conversation

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.290
that we're drilling into is,

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:40.610
this notion of reordering the self.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:42.150
And it's a relief to me to know

01:15:42.150 --> 01:15:45.713
that flashbacks are not
something that is kind of,

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:47.920
forgive the term [chuckles],

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.910
baked into to the psychedelic experience.

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:54.180
And I suppose, that's a
good segue to ask about

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.450
other sorts of drugs.

01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:57.350
Having said, "baked in",

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:59.620
the temptation is to go to marijuana

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.270
or cannabis.
- Yeah [laughs].

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.120
- But if we could,

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.460
I'd like to just ask about

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.930
some of the more dopaminergic compounds.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:09.300
In particular, MDMA.
- Yeah.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.580
- My understanding, is the MDMA

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.272
is a purely synthetic compound,

01:16:14.272 --> 01:16:16.910
that you're not going
to find MDMA in nature.

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.030
- So far.

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.863
- So far.
- There are certain-

01:16:18.863 --> 01:16:20.830
DMT was first synthesized in the lab,

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:23.140
and then we thought it
didn't exist in nature,

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.842
and then Richard Schultes
found it everywhere

01:16:26.842 --> 01:16:27.790
[laughs] in South America.
- Yeah, actually-

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:29.140
Yeah-
- So who knows,

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:29.973
a plant out there
- Right.

01:16:29.973 --> 01:16:30.806
- might be making MDMA.
- Right.

01:16:30.806 --> 01:16:31.990
Right.
- But as far

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:33.086
as we know now, no.
- Right.

01:16:33.086 --> 01:16:35.760
And we'll talk about DMT and
its sources within the body.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.760
But MDMA could exist in elsewhere,
but has been synthesized.

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:45.710
And my understanding, is the MDMA leads to

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:48.760
very robust increases in both dopamine

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.680
and serotonin simultaneously,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:55.140
which, from a neural networks perspective,

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.700
is a very unusual situation, right?

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.400
Normally, because dopamine puts us

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.960
in this exteroceptive,
looking outside ourselves,

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.040
seeking things in the world
beyond the skin, our own skin,

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.750
and dopamine, excuse me, serotonin
tends to focus us inward.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.620
Those are almost mutually exclusive

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.453
- Yeah.
- kind of

01:17:12.453 --> 01:17:13.507
neurochemical states,

01:17:13.507 --> 01:17:14.340
but they're always
- Yeah.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.180
- at different levels.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.310
So why would it be,

01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:22.310
that having this increased
dopamine and increased serotonin

01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:26.590
would provide an experience
that is beneficial?

01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:29.640
And how do you, to the extent
that you can describe it,

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.610
how do you think that experience differs

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.150
from the sorts of experiences
that people have on psilocybin

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:38.000
or more serotonergic agents,
just broadly speaking?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.303
- Yeah, yeah.

01:17:41.263 --> 01:17:43.210
In terms of the effects, generally,

01:17:43.210 --> 01:17:44.573
on serotonin and dopamine,

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.720
I can only speculate sort of,

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.360
is that dopaminergic
component necessary for...

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.810
Let's say, we know that the amygdala

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.610
is less reactive under acute effects,

01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:02.530
and that may play a role in...

01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:07.150
There's less sort of
control from the amygdala,

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:10.120
in terms of one's experience of memory,

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.120
so it may be part of this
sort of reprocessing,

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.750
this reconsolidation of these
memories in a different way,

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:17.930
where the amygdala is
not like going crazy,

01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:18.970
saying, freak out,

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:20.420
like fight or flight.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.590
- What I should have said,

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:25.220
it seems like MDMA is being
used clinically, anyway,

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:27.250
mainly for trauma,
- Right.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.777
- not just for depression, sorry.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.240
- Although part of that,
we really don't know,

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.420
and maybe the MDMA is
great for depression,

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.253
and some of these other.

01:18:37.253 --> 01:18:38.090
And it may be that,

01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:39.350
and I'm going to be looking at this soon,

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:42.100
that psilocybin is
great for treating PTSD.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.830
A lot of underground therapists say that,

01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:46.290
underground psychedelic therapists.

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:47.960
So we don't really know yet-
- What do you mean

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:48.793
by underground?

01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:50.750
Oh, because they're doing it-
- People doing illegal,

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:53.220
- Yeah.
- but more like

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:54.420
a professional therapist would.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.520
It's just illegal.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.380
And this is a kind of a growing thing.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:00.923
So we don't really know which.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.660
Speculating, but it may be that MDMA,

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.600
for a broader number of people,

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.090
is better for trauma,

01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:14.290
because the chances of having

01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:16.140
an extremely challenging experience,

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.840
what I call the bad trip,

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.810
like really freaking out,

01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:22.187
is much lower with MDMA.

01:19:22.187 --> 01:19:23.740
People can have bad trips,

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.430
but they're of a different nature.

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.560
It's not-
- Well, what is-

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.500
- It's not sort of like freaking out,

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.100
because all of reality
is sort of shattering,

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.330
and it's less of this.

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:36.340
It can take so many forms
with the classic psychedelics,

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:40.290
but typically, you'll hear something like,

01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:42.750
I didn't know it was
going to be like this.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:44.960
No matter how hard you
tried to prepare them,

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.700
that like this is...

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.930
Like get me off this-
- You're talking about LSD

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:51.035
or psilocybin?
- LSD, psilocybin,

01:19:51.035 --> 01:19:52.540
ayahuasca.
- Bad trip.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:53.510
- Yeah, yeah.

01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:56.700
And just this sense of
like, I'm going insane.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:00.450
This is so far beyond anything
I've ever experienced,

01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:02.463
and it's scaring the shit out of me.

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:04.860
- How often does that happen?
- I don't have a toehold

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.980
on anything,
- Yeah.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.350
- even that I exist as an entity,

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:10.680
and that can be really...

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.490
I think, frankly, experientially,

01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:14.880
that's kind of the gateway to both

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.820
the transcendental mystical experiences,

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.160
the sense of unity with all things,

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.750
which we know our data suggests

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:27.210
is related to long-term positive outcomes.

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.043
- Wait, I want to make sure I understand.

01:20:28.043 --> 01:20:30.370
So you're saying, the
bad trip can be related

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:31.780
to the transcendental experience?

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.280
- Right, I think those are both,

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.760
speculating, but you have to pass through

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.630
this sort of like reality shattering,

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:42.430
including your sense of self,

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.420
and one can handle that
in one of two ways.

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.220
You can either completely surrender to it,

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.980
or you can try to hang on,

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.000
and if you try to hang on,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.710
it's going to be more like a bad trip.

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:54.270
So again, I wish there was more,

01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:56.280
and hopefully, there will
be more, experimentation.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.480
There's a lot going on
here in the black box,

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:01.880
in terms of the operant
behavior of how you are

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.290
within yourself choosing to
handle letting go, you know?

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:09.840
And eventually, we'll be
able to see this in real time

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.810
with brain imaging.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:12.430
Ah, there, they are surrendering

01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:13.720
to the psychedelic experience.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.410
Here, they are trying to hold on.

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:17.400
But we we're not there yet.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.860
But I think through clinical observation,

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.380
it seems pretty clear

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.370
that something like that is going on.

01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:25.610
And certain drugs, like DMT, smoked DMT,

01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:26.680
can be so strong.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.610
The reason I think that
can be so extraordinary,

01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:33.210
even compared to the others,
'cause it forces people.

01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:34.190
There is no choice

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:35.023
to hang out.
- I've never done it.

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:35.960
- Yeah.
- I was told

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.050
that DMT is like a high-speed locomotive

01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:40.750
into the psychedelic experience,

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.564
and out of the psychedelic experience,

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:43.397
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

01:21:43.397 --> 01:21:46.530
- and there's no ability
to hold onto the self

01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:48.860
while you're in the kind of peak phase.

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:49.693
Is that correct?

01:21:49.693 --> 01:21:50.953
- A lot of people say that.

01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:53.640
Terence McKenna, who's kind of the

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.010
classic bard on DMT effects,

01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.660
he would say, "The sense
of self was intact,

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.530
but everything else, the
sensorium, and what you navigated,

01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:05.610
what you oriented towards,

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:07.590
everything else changed, basically".

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:08.423
But it's hard to...

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.310
When everything's changing,

01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:10.143
it's hard to say like,

01:22:10.143 --> 01:22:11.640
what is the self that's changing?

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.000
What is the rest of the world?

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.220
- Well, and Languages is totally deficient

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:17.550
to describe experience anyway,

01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:19.800
much less on a psychedelic.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.680
What is McKenna's background?

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.620
What is his qualification for being this,

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:27.207
as you referred, this bard of DMT

01:22:27.207 --> 01:22:28.152
and psychedelics?
- And we're talking

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:31.320
about Terrence, and there's
also the brother, Dennis,

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.140
whom I know, whose-
- Can only imagine

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.140
what Thanksgiving dinner
- Yeah, they're brothers.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.790
- is like at their house.
- Terence passed away years,

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.470
a couple decades ago now.

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:42.460
But he's sort of the one
who's known as being a bard,

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.140
and you can find hundreds,
if not thousands,

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.930
of hours of him on the lecture circuit

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:49.920
in the '80s and '90s on YouTube.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.760
But his background was really...

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.530
Oh gosh, I don't recall what
his college degree was in.

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:57.680
But he basically, when he was 19,

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.880
he traveled to South America,

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.150
and actually, on the initial
trip, with his brother,

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.080
who was even younger than him,

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.380
with some other friends,

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.380
and just in search for a DMT
snuff that they had read about

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:15.470
in the Harvard archives
from the work of Schultes

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:18.020
from a generation before.

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:20.810
But they had discovered all of these

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:24.050
mushrooms growing down there,

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:26.060
the psilocybin mushrooms,
what they recognized,

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.920
and just took a lot of mushrooms,

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.740
and-
- And talked about it?

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.604
- Talked about it.

01:23:31.604 --> 01:23:33.560
And Terence was basically
very intelligent,

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.670
very well-read in literature

01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:38.327
and culture person that could...

01:23:38.327 --> 01:23:42.500
He was sort of the next
generation's Tim Leary,

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.920
someone who could really speak,

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.500
get a little closer to the magnitude

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.400
of what the psychedelic
experience was like for people.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.810
And he serves, like Leary,
somewhat of an advocate.

01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:56.000
I mean, he would tell people,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.424
folks, you could see the
equivalent of a UFO landing

01:23:59.424 --> 01:24:00.930
on the White House lawn.

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:02.720
Like, it's right there.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.000
It'll take five minutes.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.680
It'll shake everything in your reality.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.060
You know, he would sort of
goad people into doing it.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.670
- Well, certainly, science
and clinical medicine is,

01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:15.250
are just but two lenses
with which to explore

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.800
these things in life.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.390
Well, part of the reason I ask is,

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:19.373
I feel like,

01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:24.263
in the world of health and fitness,

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.270
you have this very extreme condition

01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:31.010
of like Arnold Schwarzenegger's
and bodybuilders

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.337
who have 2% body fat,

01:24:32.337 --> 01:24:34.910
and they look like, to most people,

01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:36.260
they look kind of freakish,
- Yeah

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.240
especially now, right?

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.190
- Oh, especially now.

01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:39.200
- Especially now.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.167
- And yeah-
- Made Arnold look

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:42.310
- Yeah, yeah.
- like regular-

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.143
- Exactly.

01:24:43.143 --> 01:24:44.020
- Back in his day, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.690
And you have contortionists

01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:47.700
who can put themselves into a small box

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.410
and wrap themselves into a pretzel.

01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:54.120
But from those two very extreme
subculture practices that,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.840
I don't know anything about
contortionism, really,

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.850
but except that they get really bendy,

01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:04.600
but it's a community that
included lifestyle practices,

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.830
and nutritional practices,
and then drug practices.

01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:09.290
From those very extreme subcultures,

01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:10.350
there's been an export,

01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:14.290
which is that weight
training is healthy, right?

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:15.650
The general public has done that.

01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:17.180
Or that yoga is healthy.

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.150
- Yeah.
- So contortionism

01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:20.270
to yoga, et cetera.

01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.370
And I feel like a similar
thing is happening

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:23.840
in the realm of psychedelics,

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.827
where it was Leary and Huxley.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.020
Look, I'm from the Bay Area.

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.760
I'm not far from the Midland Park VA,

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.230
where "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's" is

01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:35.063
basically, based on, right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:36.623
- Ken Kesey and those guys.

01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:42.340
There has been an attempt at
creating this movement toward

01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:45.140
openness about psychedelics

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.780
and their positive effects.

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:48.010
This has happened before.

01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:49.170
- Yeah.
- The difference is,

01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:50.480
that now, there are people like you

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.260
inside the walls of the university,

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.010
or publishing peer-reviewed studies,

01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:55.030
and things of that sort.

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.710
The reason I asked about McKenna was,

01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:58.940
it seems like McKenna and his brother

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.880
are but just two of many people,

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.380
Michael Pollan, et cetera,

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:11.323
who have no real formal training
in biology or psychology.

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:15.700
The other guys who were at
universities lost their jobs.

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.410
They were actually removed from places

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.010
like Harvard and other universities

01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.790
for their kind of cavalier explorations.

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.030
Right?
- Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:25.070
- And now, things are kind of returning.

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:27.000
So in the same way that
bodybuilding led to

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.530
weight training in every corner gym,

01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:31.330
- Yeah.
- men, women, and children,

01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:34.440
and contortionism is one extreme,

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.040
but people generally think that yoga

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.250
is a pretty healthy practice, right?

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:40.190
These are matter of degrees, right?

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:41.650
And now, here you are
- Yeah.

01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:44.900
- inside the walls of a

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.950
very highly respected
university, Johns Hopkins.

01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:49.070
You're on the medical school side,

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.903
- Mm-hmm.
- or the undergrad?

01:26:49.903 --> 01:26:50.780
- So in the med school,
- Medical.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:55.780
- which is a serious health institution.

01:27:01.570 --> 01:27:03.423
The question is to me,

01:27:05.258 --> 01:27:07.180
what are the valuable exports, right?

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.130
And where does the extreme lie?

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:11.850
I mean, clearly, there's a problem

01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:16.850
with tinkering with reality
through pharmacology,

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:19.210
and there's a benefit, it sounds like,

01:27:19.210 --> 01:27:21.460
to tinkering with reality

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.110
through pharmacology.
- Yeah.

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.710
- And what's so striking to me,

01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:29.350
is the elements of atypical experience,

01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:31.573
atypical representation of the self.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.330
So for the average person, right?

01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:38.930
Or for kids that are hearing this.

01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:40.690
Kids that are in their teens, right?

01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:41.720
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.858
- I want to talk about, what
are the dangers of psychedelics?

01:27:44.858 --> 01:27:46.620
It's something you don't
hear a lot about these days,

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:48.980
and it's not because I'm
anti-psychedelic at all,

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.433
but what are the dangers, right?

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:55.513
If a kid or adult has a
predisposition toward, let's say,

01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.880
psychotic thinking, right?

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.033
Or auditory hallucinations?
- Yeah.

01:28:04.039 --> 01:28:07.860
- Whereas on the Asperger's
side of the autism spectrum,

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.460
is there an increased risk

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.660
of bringing the mind into these states?

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.870
'Cause it sounds like a
very labile situation.

01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:16.740
So could we talk a little bit about that?

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.950
And are there classes of
these different drugs,

01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:21.453
whether or not it be MDMA, LSD, or DMT,

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.820
that you think are
particularly sharp blades,

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:28.540
and therefore need to be
wielded particularly carefully?

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:29.373
- Yeah.

01:28:29.373 --> 01:28:33.860
So these can be profoundly
de-stabilizing experiences,

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.320
and ones that, ideally, are
had in a safe container,

01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:46.460
sort of where someone...

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.890
What are the relevant dangers,

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:49.750
and what can we do to mitigate those?

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:52.883
So there's two biggies.

01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.900
One, and I've already mentioned,

01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:00.290
it's people with very
severe psychiatric illness.

01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:03.010
Not depression, not anxiety.

01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:06.700
I'm talking about psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia,

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:10.003
or mania as part of bipolar disorder.

01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:13.170
And diagnostically, this has shifted.

01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:14.190
So it's a little hard to say

01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:15.860
how many people today with bipolar

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.183
would have been labeled as
schizophrenia back in the '60s

01:29:18.183 --> 01:29:20.950
when some of this early research

01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:23.270
or just clinical observation was done.

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:25.510
So it seems very clear

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:28.260
that folks with a predisposition
or active disease,

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.630
they could be destabilized.

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.720
And so some of the cases that we know of,

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.500
I always think of Syd Barrett,

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.343
the first singer of Pink Floyd,

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.960
seems pretty clear.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.793
Although, I think the family-
- I don't know

01:29:39.793 --> 01:29:40.650
what happened there.

01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:41.860
- So he-
- I should be...

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:43.160
Sorry, Pink Floyd fans.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:43.993
I've never...

01:29:43.993 --> 01:29:45.340
The songs are just really long.

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.950
- Yeah, you're more of a punk guy, right?

01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:47.846
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:29:47.846 --> 01:29:48.820
[both laughing]

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.010
So I've got my foot in a lot of worlds,

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.468
definitely in part in the Floyd world.

01:29:53.468 --> 01:29:58.003
But he basically went crazy early on.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.740
I don't think his family ever admitted it,

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.683
but he developed
schizophrenia, classic pattern,

01:30:05.959 --> 01:30:07.459
and he was doing a lot of LSD.

01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:11.570
But like a lot of these cases,

01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:15.083
it looked like he was
showing all of the signs of,

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.640
some hints of

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.580
that he had that susceptibility before.

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.490
And often, this is hard to
disentangle what causes what,

01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:30.560
because when do people, typically,
not always, but develop?

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.430
When's the modal period for first break?

01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:33.950
It's adolescence, early adulthood.

01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:34.783
Yeah.

01:30:34.783 --> 01:30:37.218
And when do people start
playing with drugs?

01:30:37.218 --> 01:30:39.810
[laughs] Same exact time period,

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:42.080
so it can be hard to disentangle.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.350
But it seems pretty clear.

01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:44.880
Now, I should also say,

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.740
there are cases of
folks with schizophrenia

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.750
that say psychedelics have helped them.

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:50.685
There's anecdotes for everything, though.

01:30:50.685 --> 01:30:51.531
It's a big world.
- Do the people around

01:30:51.531 --> 01:30:52.844
those schizophrenics say it's helped them,

01:30:52.844 --> 01:30:53.677
or just-
- I don't know.

01:30:53.677 --> 01:30:54.840
- 'Cause when schizophrenics say things,

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.340
you have to-
- You have to weight it.

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.440
- I mean, with all due compassion

01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.700
and respect for schizophrenia,

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.760
it's a disorder of thinking.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.740
So if they're saying, it helped them?

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:04.930
- Yeah, can you trust them?

01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:05.763
Yeah.

01:31:05.763 --> 01:31:07.130
I wouldn't be surprised

01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:09.840
if there was some kernel
of truth in some cases,

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.660
but they're just so...

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.900
It seems very clear that
the other side is there too,

01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.160
and that if there ever is

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.040
a therapeutic potential
there for those disorders,

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.470
that that shouldn't be the
first thing on our list,

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:23.180
and we need to learn a lot more,

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.510
because of the level of risk,

01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:26.890
before we start doing research to see if

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.110
psilocybin can help with schizophrenia.

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.943
I don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles]

01:31:30.943 --> 01:31:32.120
That may never be the case,

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.430
but even if it is,

01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:35.210
you'd have to be even more cautious

01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:37.900
and figure some more things out first

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.560
with some of these other disorders.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.090
- What about bipolar?
- 'Cause it seems-

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:43.070
- Bipolar disorder, can it be exacerbated

01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:46.350
by these compounds?
- Yeah, and it's-

01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:50.310
It may be that, sort of the manifestation

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:53.150
of people having prolonged
psychiatric issues

01:31:53.150 --> 01:31:56.580
after a psychedelic experience,

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:58.850
as atypical as that is,

01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:01.360
when that happens, it may be that

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.860
that might be more like a manic episode

01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.090
than a psychotic episode,

01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:06.743
and that can be a blurry line.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.950
The folklore is that,

01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:12.930
people go on a trip, and
they never come back.

01:32:12.930 --> 01:32:14.440
That's clearly not the case,

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.497
because the drug is metabolized,
like for anyone else,

01:32:17.497 --> 01:32:19.114
and the next day,

01:32:19.114 --> 01:32:21.220
there's virtually nothing-
- But it reshapes circuitry.

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.730
I mean-
- Right.

01:32:22.730 --> 01:32:24.260
And I really do think,

01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:28.140
much like the positive long-term effects

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:32.363
that this class of problems is related to,

01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:38.130
the experience and the destabilization

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:42.070
that can happen from that experience,

01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:44.730
if it's not in the right container.

01:32:44.730 --> 01:32:47.700
And again, these people
are susceptible to...

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:50.830
You know, some people with
that psychotic predisposition,

01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:53.630
they lucky to be born to a great family,

01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:55.150
a stable environment.

01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:56.730
They maybe never have a full break,

01:32:56.730 --> 01:32:58.920
or the one that they
have is not nearly as bad

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.940
as what someone who's homeless,

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:06.100
and is coming from all kinds
of early childhood trauma.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.763
The disease is probably
going to be far worse.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.690
Having a psychedelic experience

01:33:12.690 --> 01:33:15.733
is like one of those
de-stabilizing experiences.

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.530
Now, fortunately, it's really
easy to identify those people.

01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:23.530
And we even err on the
side of extreme caution

01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:25.240
by eliminating people with like, say,

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.280
a first degree relative.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.650
In some studies, even a
second degree relative.

01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:29.940
Given the heritability,

01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:30.950
there's some increased chance

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:33.060
- Sure.
- if your brother or your...

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:33.893
Yeah.

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.730
So in an abundance of caution,

01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:38.570
even eliminating that...

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:43.190
I think, eventually, if it's
approved for use, FDA use,

01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:45.440
we could dial back on
that as we learn more.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.850
I think, it's, again, overly cautious,

01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:49.683
which is-
- But you're doing

01:33:49.683 --> 01:33:50.516
an early stage

01:33:50.516 --> 01:33:52.030
clinical trial, so.
- Yeah, it's the appropriate

01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:53.640
place to start at this point in time.

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.280
But if you give a SCID,

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.270
or another structured

01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:59.160
psychiatric interview with a clinician,

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.890
sitting down with this
person for a few hours

01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:02.950
to delve into their history,

01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:05.200
like you could very reliably determine

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.070
that this person has either
a psychotic disorder,

01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:12.123
or bipolar disorder, or
a strong predisposition.

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:14.440
You can screen for that,

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.910
and that's how you address that.

01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:18.840
The far more likely
danger is the bad trip.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.220
Anyone can have this.

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.240
The most psychologically

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.720
healthy person in the world, probably.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.100
You jack the dose high enough,

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:29.220
and especially in a less
than an ideal environment,

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.630
you can have a bad trip.

01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:33.480
You even get it in an
ideal environment like ours

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.300
at a high dose of around 30
milligrams of psilocybin.

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.020
After the best preparation we can provide,

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.740
about a third of people
will say, essentially,

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.920
at some point, they have a bad trip,

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:45.753
and we'd-
- At some point

01:34:45.753 --> 01:34:47.370
within the entire journey.

01:34:47.370 --> 01:34:48.203
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:34:48.203 --> 01:34:49.036
- Now, they could have

01:34:49.036 --> 01:34:49.890
one of the most beautiful

01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:51.610
experiences of their life, sometimes,

01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:53.380
like a couple of minutes later.

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:54.380
- Right.
- But at some point,

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.130
they had a sense of strong anxiety, fear,

01:34:57.130 --> 01:35:01.410
losing their mind, feeling
trapped, something like that.

01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:04.640
Now, typically, when people have that,

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.700
when they're just taken on their own,

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:08.210
like a lot of things, they're fine.

01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.043
They get through it.

01:35:09.043 --> 01:35:11.150
They're more likely to be better off

01:35:11.150 --> 01:35:14.100
if they're not having to navigate
the streets of Manhattan.

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.530
And if they're with other
people, with friends,

01:35:19.530 --> 01:35:21.000
better that those friends aren't

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.030
also dealing with their
own psychedelic experience.

01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:25.329
But probably having
some friend of any type,

01:35:25.329 --> 01:35:27.270
[mumbles] is better than having nothing.

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:30.340
So very dependent on context.

01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:32.280
And so the tough thing here

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.803
that in conveying to the public is that,

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.370
a lot of folks will say,

01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:41.070
man, I've taken psychedelics
hundreds of times,

01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:43.770
and this is like you're fear-mongering,

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:46.540
and there's no,

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.300
you're exaggerating the danger there.

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:50.800
So I want to say, it is atypical,

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.500
but sometimes, and I have a file folder

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.720
that grows larger every
year of these cases,

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.030
either in the medical
literature or from the news,

01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:02.170
of people that freak out on a psychedelic,

01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:04.740
and they get hurt or they die.

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:07.210
They run into traffic.

01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:08.580
They fall from a height.

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.070
Whether they thought they could fly,

01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:11.230
or whether they just fell,

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:13.570
like you can do when you're drunk

01:36:13.570 --> 01:36:16.150
or you're intoxicated on any substance.

01:36:16.150 --> 01:36:18.710
Sometimes that's unclear.

01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:22.800
Or gosh, one of the
craziest cases was a kid,

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.460
like an 18-year-old or so, in Oregon,

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.420
several years back, that just...

01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.500
He even wrote about, I
want to take the biggest...

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.333
He had done mushrooms before.

01:36:30.333 --> 01:36:32.410
I want to take a heroic dose.

01:36:32.410 --> 01:36:33.610
The biggest dose I've ever taken.

01:36:33.610 --> 01:36:35.680
He ended up just totally out of it.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.060
Ended up in a neighbor's house.

01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.560
He was just totally disoriented,

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.393
disconnected from reality,

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:41.650
and the cops and ended up killing him,

01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:42.730
and it was just tragic.

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.330
Obviously, an overuse
of force in that case,

01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:46.830
'cause he was actually naked at the time.

01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:50.970
This naked like 120 pounds,
I think, as I recall, kid

01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:52.050
that ended up dying.

01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:53.240
But-
- Well, it's analogous

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.320
to the reason I used the
examples of bodybuilding culture.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.430
I mean, people there have taken

01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:01.020
excessive amounts of anabolic
and diuretics, and died.

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.500
Then the contortionist culture,

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:03.333
people would put themselves

01:37:03.333 --> 01:37:05.590
in the little plexiglass boxes to do...

01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:08.210
At the extremes,

01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:09.680
you're going to get deaths,

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.039
and at the extremes
- Right.

01:37:11.039 --> 01:37:14.260
- and one of the extremes is
the sheer number of people

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.550
with different biological
makeups taking the same drug.

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:20.390
And so you can create
extremes through numbers.

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:24.030
You'd create extremes
through dosage, right?

01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:25.640
It seems.
- Right.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.100
- Well, this is why I'm
such a fan of the fact

01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:30.530
that people like yourself
are doing clinical trials

01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:33.840
inside the walls of universities.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.290
Not because I think that psychedelics

01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:40.240
only have utility in those environments,

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.640
but because it's so important

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.690
toward creating their
transition to legality,

01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:48.140
and to understand what legality means

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.580
for a compound like this,

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:50.413
right?
- Right.

01:37:50.413 --> 01:37:51.246
What model.

01:37:51.246 --> 01:37:52.079
Yeah.
- Right, I mean,

01:37:52.079 --> 01:37:54.230
again, we'll stay with
the anabolic steroids.

01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.840
There's now testosterone and
estrogen replacement therapy.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.520
Hormone replacement therapy is a common

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.760
medically approved practice,

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:01.760
but that's vastly different

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.900
than people taking their own stuff,

01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.930
or deciding how much
they need to take, right?

01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:08.380
Like we said, there's yoga,

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.750
and there's contortionism
in a plexiglass box,

01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:12.130
and thinking of Houdini,
- Right.

01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:13.477
- or something.

01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:15.940
These are a matter of degrees.

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:18.710
Speaking of dosage, I
definitely want to ask you

01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:22.543
about microdose versus
standard or macrodose.

01:38:25.407 --> 01:38:26.550
Tell me that I'm wrong,

01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.053
but I'm always a little bit,

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.950
I'm micro-cynical, if you will,

01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:36.640
about this term microdose.

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.540
And the reason is,

01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:41.370
that many people that I know
who talk about microdosing

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:46.230
are taking dosages of compounds that work

01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:50.320
that are very powerful
at microgram levels.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:51.930
So the word micro, I think,

01:38:51.930 --> 01:38:53.540
can be a little bit confusing to people,

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:57.420
because microdose implies
less than something.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.670
- Yeah.
- It's a mini dose, right?

01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:02.090
And yet, some of these compounds

01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:06.660
are tremendously powerful
at microgram concentrations.

01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:10.360
So what constitutes a microdose,

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.260
and what is the value of
so-called microdosing, if any,

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:18.020
and how does it differ from standard,

01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:20.650
or what I can only assume
is called macrodosing?

01:39:20.650 --> 01:39:21.483
- Yeah.

01:39:21.483 --> 01:39:24.510
And so LSD would be the
prototypical example

01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:27.540
of that super potent compound.
- Yeah, how much am I-

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:32.000
What size dosage of LSD
will lead to hallucinations,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.160
and kind of standard-
- So sort of the

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:37.120
entry point for psychedelic-type effects,

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.770
which may not involve hallucination...

01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:40.830
Actually, most classic psychedelics

01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:42.780
don't lead to true hallucinations,

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:44.570
as defined in psychiatry.

01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:46.310
Again, thinking you're talking to

01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:47.240
the person that's not there,

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.493
seeing the pink elephant.

01:39:48.493 --> 01:39:50.280
But pseudo hallucinations-
- It's more like tracers

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.660
and things like that.
- Right.

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.120
- Perceptual blending.
- Yet, some people

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.210
never get that, even at a very high dose.

01:39:55.210 --> 01:39:56.450
So I think more broadly,

01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:58.740
in terms of the psychedelic effects,

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.170
which isn't just perceptual,

01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:01.680
unless we get into the level,

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.640
of as you were alluding to earlier,

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.720
a broader definition of perception,

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.360
like one's models of the
world, the model of the self.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.060
You can consider all of that perception,

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.580
in terms of truly not sensation,

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.413
but the perception,

01:40:15.413 --> 01:40:18.860
the construction of
putting together a reality.

01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:21.590
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:25.280
So the psychedelic effects
are typically considered

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.070
to start by LSD around 100 micrograms.

01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:30.870
So a 10th of a milligram
is 100 micrograms.

01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:31.703
- Right.

01:40:31.703 --> 01:40:34.533
So someone taking 100 micrograms of LSD,

01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:38.330
nowadays, people might
mistakenly refer to that

01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:40.380
as a microdose, because it's micrograms,

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:43.140
but that's actually a macrodose of LSD?

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:44.070
- Right, they might,

01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:45.900
and that's one of the most common mistakes

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.190
or situations that people
get into with microdosing,

01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:50.230
is they intend it to be a microdose,

01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:54.130
but it ends up being a full-blown dose.

01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.270
Now, people do, when
they're working with LSD,

01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:58.130
and they're microdosing,

01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:02.800
they'll shoot for something
like, say, 10 milligrams,

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.960
something in that range,

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.250
10, 20 milligrams of LSD.

01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:08.060
So a 10th, a 5th,

01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:12.450
something of kind of your
entry level psychedelic dose.

01:41:12.450 --> 01:41:15.347
People's ability on the street to do this,

01:41:15.347 --> 01:41:17.330
and I say the street as
if they're on the corner,

01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:18.660
but anyway, like outside of the

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.180
medical profession to do this,

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.810
it varies, as you can imagine.
- And they're not measuring

01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:22.985
purity and molarity,
- Yeah.

01:41:22.985 --> 01:41:24.130
- or things like that, typically.

01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:25.330
- And there's ways to do it.

01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.260
So even if you don't
ultimately know the dose

01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:29.940
that's in the blotter paper of acid,

01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:31.550
one could at least get a sense of like,

01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:34.480
yeah, having one of those tabs is,

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.967
one of those hits is a
psychedelic experience.

01:41:36.967 --> 01:41:39.280
And they could do something
like put in water.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.610
It's 100% aqueous soluble.

01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:44.570
You could make sure it
all gets into solution,

01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:46.120
and then volumetrically measure.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.260
It's going to be
homogeneously distributed,

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.080
so you can you take 1/10
of that volume of water

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.860
after it's fully dissolved,

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.170
that whatever you started with,

01:41:54.170 --> 01:41:55.320
you're going to have a 10th of that dose.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.410
So the people that are more sophisticated

01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:58.730
will do things like that.

01:41:58.730 --> 01:42:00.210
And when they're working with mushrooms,

01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:01.050
they'll grow a bunch of mushrooms,

01:42:01.050 --> 01:42:03.760
and then they'll say, put
it in a coffee grinder.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.710
I'm not telling people
to do this, by the way.

01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:06.640
I'm just describing.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.630
So don't do this at home.

01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:10.090
But grind it all up so it's homogenous.

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:11.580
'Cause you can have like

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:14.720
sort of taking two caps and a stem,

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.340
hey, this two caps and the
stem that this buddy takes

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.760
has a different potency than
this two caps and a stem

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:21.830
that the other buddy takes.

01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:24.260
So people that are kind of in the know

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:26.840
will grind it all up
into a homogenous powder,

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.140
and they'll pack it into
whatever size capsule,

01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:30.040
and they'll know that...

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.840
And again, even if they don't have...

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:32.960
Sometimes, they might have a buddy

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:36.410
that'll sneak it into the
HPLC at their job or whatever,

01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:37.243
if they happen

01:42:37.243 --> 01:42:38.076
to be well connected.
- Not your lab-

01:42:38.076 --> 01:42:38.909
- Not my lab!

01:42:38.909 --> 01:42:39.742
That's never happened.

01:42:39.742 --> 01:42:41.390
Seriously, it never happened.

01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:43.340
But they'll at least know that,

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:46.730
hey, I've got a sense
of what two capsules do.

01:42:46.730 --> 01:42:49.340
I've got a sense of what five capsules do.

01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:51.950
But in reality,

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:53.990
that's not what people do.

01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:55.530
They'll take a piece of blotter paper,

01:42:55.530 --> 01:42:58.310
and they get a tiny,
little pair of scissors,

01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:59.677
a Swiss Army Knife pair of scissors,

01:42:59.677 --> 01:43:02.100
and they'll cut up the tab of acid,

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.280
which is like a quarter
inch square or something,

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.460
and they'll cut it up in 10 little pieces,

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:08.680
and it's like,
- Right.

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:09.850
- you have no idea

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:12.220
if it's equally distributed in that media.

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.043
- Yeah, and we can chuckle about it.

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.180
But to me, one of the reasons why

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.020
this experiment around psychedelics,

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.623
this cultural experiment,
and this legal experiment,

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.470
we're seeing this now,

01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:29.890
but this was all attempted once
before in the '60s and '70s.

01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:30.850
The difference was,

01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:32.600
it was all out in the street.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.550
The people in universities who were

01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:36.330
dabbling with this stuff,

01:43:36.330 --> 01:43:37.730
most of 'em lost their jobs,

01:43:37.730 --> 01:43:40.170
or were asked to leave through...

01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:41.709
- They lost their funding
for this research,

01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:42.542
minimally,
[interposing voices]

01:43:42.542 --> 01:43:43.375
- That's right.
- and they had to

01:43:43.375 --> 01:43:44.208
move on to other topics
- That's right.

01:43:44.208 --> 01:43:45.041
- to have a career.
- So these are

01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:45.903
precarious times.

01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:48.210
We're at a key moment,

01:43:48.210 --> 01:43:52.040
where everyone assumes that
this is all going to be legal

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.873
in a few years.

01:43:52.873 --> 01:43:55.570
but I think that that's
a premature assumption,

01:43:55.570 --> 01:43:56.633
frankly.
- Yeah.

01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:00.830
- Let's touch on the legality,

01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:02.570
and some of the things
that are happening now.

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:06.600
But what is microdosing psilocybin

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:10.010
versus the sorts of dosages
that you described before

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:12.603
in the 10 to 40 milligram range?

01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:15.210
I've heard of people taking

01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:18.820
one or two milligrams
of psilocybin every day

01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.400
as a way to, quote/unquote,

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.233
and for those listening,

01:44:21.233 --> 01:44:23.047
I'm just making air
quotes with my fingers,

01:44:23.047 --> 01:44:24.380
"increase plasticity",

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.780
which is a term that I personally loathe,

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.200
because what does that mean?

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.450
I mean, you don't really want
your brain to be plastic,

01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:33.890
because you need to maintain your ability

01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:34.930
to make predictions.
- It's that balance.

01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:36.830
- Yeah, plasticity-
- Order in chaos.

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.120
You need models of the world.

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.210
You need heuristics, like-
- Plasticity is

01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:43.440
never the goal,

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:45.720
or be it, plasticity is never the goal.

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.640
- The end goal.
- Goal directed plasticity

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.510
is the goal, right?
- Right.

01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:50.560
Right.
- Learning a language,

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.180
reshaping your experience to a trauma,

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.860
altering the perception of self.

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.263
But plasticity is a process.

01:44:58.455 --> 01:44:59.288
It's a-
- Yeah,

01:44:59.288 --> 01:45:01.199
schizophrenia is a lot of plasticity.

01:45:01.199 --> 01:45:02.080
[Dr. Matthew laughs]
- Exactly.

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:02.980
Right, right.

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:03.813
And it might even be,

01:45:03.813 --> 01:45:06.480
there's one theory that it's
extreme ongoing plasticity,

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.140
and that's why people never create

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:10.050
stable representations of anything.

01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:13.823
That's kind of a minority view out there.

01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:17.057
So what's the business with microdosing,

01:45:17.057 --> 01:45:19.190
and is there any clinical evidence,

01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:21.830
or peer-reviewed published
evidence that it works,

01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:24.920
quote/unquote, "to make people
feel better about anything"?

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.920
- So microdosing is the aim
of taking against something

01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:33.740
around a 10th of what would be

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.750
sort of an entry-level psychedelic dose

01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:37.063
for whatever compound.

01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:39.570
So like, yeah, with psilocybin,

01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:42.050
usually people, almost
never do people have

01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:43.590
like pure psilocybin.

01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:44.910
One milligram of psilocybin

01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:46.190
would be in the range of a microdose.

01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:48.650
More likely, people are
going to have mushrooms,

01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:53.351
so something like a half
of a gram of mushroom,

01:45:53.351 --> 01:45:54.184
a quarter gram.
- I know people that

01:45:54.184 --> 01:45:55.530
are doing this every day.

01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:56.586
They're doing these every day.
- Right.

01:45:56.586 --> 01:45:57.530
- It's like in their...

01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:59.023
The same way that I take,

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.180
personally, I'm not recommending
other people do this,

01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.400
but I take some...

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.340
I'm a fan of LCL-carnitine lately.

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:06.173
I've been kind of

01:46:06.173 --> 01:46:07.006
- Yeah.
- experimenting with that

01:46:07.006 --> 01:46:08.920
a little bit, which is not
a psychedelic compound.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.890
I take it every day,
- Right.

01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:11.650
- and they're taking their

01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:12.633
psilocybin every day.
- That's their supplement.

01:46:12.633 --> 01:46:14.480
- That's their supplement.
- Yeah.

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:16.170
- So-
- So yeah,

01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:19.220
the claims are, and
they're a number of them,

01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.550
there's two general ones.

01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:25.550
One, is sort of acting in place
of the ADHD treating drugs.

01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:27.210
So the psychomotor stimulant,

01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:29.750
so like a better version of Adderall.

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.700
The other claims are, essentially,

01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.880
a better version of the
traditional antidepressants,

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.310
a better version of Prozac,

01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:38.660
you know, so-
- So people are taking both

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.830
for attention deficit and for depression?

01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:45.940
- Yeah, and the aspects
of those disorders that

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:48.130
we all have a degree of.

01:46:48.130 --> 01:46:51.030
Just like amphetamine is
going to increase the focus,

01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:52.440
at the right dose, of anyone

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.200
who takes amphetamine, pretty much,

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:57.900
whether you're ADHD diagnosed or not.

01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:00.220
The idea is that,

01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.700
there may not be,
necessarily, a clear divide

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:07.390
between the therapeutic need
and positive psychology,

01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:09.893
even improving mood and focus,

01:47:11.314 --> 01:47:13.630
so it's not necessarily correcting ADHD,

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.230
but improving focus to
supercharge your life.

01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:20.920
And so those are the claims.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.350
I am...

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.470
So none of the peer-reviewed
studies that are,

01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:28.433
have much credibility,

01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:32.660
none of them have shown a benefit,

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.830
and they've tried.

01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:36.610
There's only, at this point,
four or five studies that...

01:47:36.610 --> 01:47:39.080
And I think for things like this,

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.370
you really need double blind research,

01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:43.230
'cause the effects...

01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:45.380
I mean, there was one
study done in Amsterdam

01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.180
where people knew they were
taking psilocybin truffles,

01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:49.013
basically same as mushrooms,

01:47:49.013 --> 01:47:51.156
They're more like the
roots of the mycelia.

01:47:51.156 --> 01:47:52.286
- Microdosing them?

01:47:52.286 --> 01:47:55.417
- Well, taking what would
be considered a microdose,

01:47:56.970 --> 01:48:00.813
and then doing some cognitive
measures before and after.

01:48:00.813 --> 01:48:01.863
And the types of things that,

01:48:01.863 --> 01:48:04.470
like a lot of cognitive
measures are measured on,

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:07.510
the order of reaction
time in milliseconds.

01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:08.850
And the types of effects you get,

01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:09.890
as you could imagine,

01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:12.090
are ones that like would be,

01:48:12.090 --> 01:48:13.750
you would totally expect could be there

01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:15.610
from either a practice effect

01:48:15.610 --> 01:48:19.540
or an expectancy effect, a placebo effect.

01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.743
So for something like these claimed,

01:48:23.716 --> 01:48:26.330
you could imagine, a sort
of an increased focus,

01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:29.200
enhancement of cognition.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.060
These are going to be more subtle effects

01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:36.680
that you really need a
good placebo control for.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:40.710
The handful of studies that
have done that have shown,

01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:43.150
they've ranged from finding
no effect whatsoever

01:48:43.150 --> 01:48:44.950
to just a little bit of impairment,

01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:48.850
like impairing someone's
ability to do time estimation

01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:49.950
and production tasks.

01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:52.500
So you want an accurate sense of time,

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.840
at least if you're
navigating in the real world.

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:57.630
It's different if you're on
the couch on a heroic dose

01:48:57.630 --> 01:48:59.380
for therapeutic reasons where you're safe,

01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:02.291
but if you're crossing
the street, if you're...

01:49:02.291 --> 01:49:03.580
In your work life-
- You have to

01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:04.413
function in the world.

01:49:04.413 --> 01:49:05.246
- Yeah, which is the way people

01:49:05.246 --> 01:49:06.690
are claiming to use that.

01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:09.010
It helps them be a better CEO.

01:49:09.010 --> 01:49:10.570
You want an accurate sense of time.

01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:12.160
So if anything in the data suggests

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.820
that it makes it a
little bit less accurate,

01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:17.480
and there's evidence that someone feels

01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:19.843
a little bit impaired,

01:49:20.707 --> 01:49:22.560
and they feel a little bit high.

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.150
So in terms of...

01:49:24.150 --> 01:49:26.400
You call that abuse liability in research.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.900
Not surprising, you take
a little bit of a drug

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:31.330
that can result in some type of a high,

01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:32.510
and you take a little, tiny bit of it,

01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:34.450
you'll feel a little bit high.

01:49:34.450 --> 01:49:37.670
So none of the...

01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:42.670
So far, no studies have shown
an increase in creativity,

01:49:44.290 --> 01:49:47.660
enhancement of any form of cognition,

01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:50.650
or a sustained improvement in mood.

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:54.250
Now, no studies have actually looked at

01:49:56.258 --> 01:49:59.860
the system of microdosing that
the aficionados are claiming,

01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:02.390
and there's a couple of models out there.

01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:05.450
But folks like Paul Stamets, and others,

01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:06.930
they'll have particular formulas.

01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:09.050
They're like, you need to take it one day,

01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:10.530
and then take so many days off,

01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:11.800
and take it every four days.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.750
And I don't want to get
into whose model is what,

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:15.000
but it's always something like that,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.610
some pattern of use,
usually not every day.

01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:21.590
And the claim is that, it's not just...

01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:23.250
You know, sometimes people get benefit

01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:25.080
that first time when they take it,

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.940
but they really say, you
need to be on it for a while.

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:28.990
Like a few weeks in,

01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.823
you may start to notice

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:32.640
through this pattern of using it,

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.470
and you're feeling the
benefits on those off days,

01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:40.470
like the three or two days
in between your active doses.

01:50:40.610 --> 01:50:41.610
So those are the claims.

01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:44.220
Again, we don't know that there's
any truth to that working,

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.850
but studies have not
been done to model that.

01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:49.340
So that's a big caveat.

01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.360
We, as a field,

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:53.030
I say, "we", as the scientific field,

01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:57.440
have not done the studies to really model

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.520
what the real aficionados are claiming

01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:03.760
where the therapeutic benefits come from.

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.520
That said, it's almost assuredly

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.480
there's a good amount of placebo there.

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.820
But the caveat to that is like,

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.293
almost everything in
medicine or therapeutics,

01:51:14.568 --> 01:51:15.670
it's going to have some degree

01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:16.503
of placebo there.
- Sure.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:17.780
Belief effects are...

01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:20.710
I have a colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum,

01:51:20.710 --> 01:51:24.360
who has published really
beautiful work on belief effects,

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.630
that show that, essentially,

01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:29.272
you give the same milkshake to two people,

01:51:29.272 --> 01:51:30.400
or two groups of people.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.217
You tell them that one
contains a lot of nutrients.

01:51:32.217 --> 01:51:34.810
The other is a low calorie shake.

01:51:34.810 --> 01:51:36.780
The insulin response
- Amazing.

01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:38.450
Yeah.
- varies dramatically

01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:39.283
between the two.

01:51:39.283 --> 01:51:40.880
Or two groups, rather,

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.110
doing equivalent amounts
of physical movement,

01:51:45.110 --> 01:51:46.980
and you tell one group that
it's going to be good for them,

01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:47.890
and help them lose weight,

01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:50.130
and they lose, on average,
8 to 12 pounds more

01:51:50.130 --> 01:51:51.900
doing the exact same

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:53.090
patterns of movement.
- Amazing.

01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:56.060
- And I think that these
belief effects boil down to

01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.600
all sorts of kind of
network-wide neuromodulation,

01:51:58.600 --> 01:51:59.670
things of that sort, but-
- And then the

01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:01.090
work at Harvard suggesting,

01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:03.200
that even if you don't have deception,

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.410
you give a placebo, and say,

01:52:04.410 --> 01:52:06.834
this is a sugar pill,
- Right.

01:52:06.834 --> 01:52:08.010
- and tell them that,
- Right.

01:52:08.010 --> 01:52:09.230
- and they could still treat things.

01:52:09.230 --> 01:52:10.063
I think irritable bowel
- Right.

01:52:10.063 --> 01:52:11.780
- was the first thing they looked at.

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.470
- Right.
- And so there's a huge...

01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:15.990
so there's a reality there.
- Right.

01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:17.560
- There's a necessity in developing drugs

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.400
to make sure it's not only that.

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.760
But in the actual practice of medicine,

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.140
hopefully, what you're always getting

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.180
is some underlying direct efficacy

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:26.850
plus the placebo

01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:27.980
that enhances that.
- Right.

01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.530
- Now, it could be that this is...

01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:31.363
The real question is,

01:52:31.363 --> 01:52:32.530
is the microdosing,

01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:35.540
are those claims 100% placebo,

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:37.620
or are they only part placebo,

01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:41.290
and part "real", quote/unquote, effect?

01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:45.140
My bet is, and this is
totally based on anecdotes,

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.780
that I think there is probably a reality

01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:49.340
to the antidepressant effects.

01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.030
I find that more intriguing,

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.863
- Well-
- because of the

01:52:51.863 --> 01:52:53.610
suffering with depression.
- Right.

01:52:53.610 --> 01:52:54.540
- Even if it's a...

01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.710
It wouldn't be as interesting as, I think,

01:52:56.710 --> 01:52:59.210
what we're doing with high dose psilocybin

01:52:59.210 --> 01:53:01.800
or psychedelics to treat depression.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:02.633
It would be...

01:53:02.633 --> 01:53:04.320
If this is developed,
and there's a reality,

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.870
it would be more like a better,

01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:10.100
perhaps, a better SSRI, a better Prozac.

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:10.933
- Which are similar.
- With that being said,

01:53:10.933 --> 01:53:13.950
we need more tools than
fewer tools in the toolbox.

01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:15.130
- Right.
- And it shouldn't be

01:53:15.130 --> 01:53:15.963
that surprise.

01:53:15.963 --> 01:53:17.110
Like even before,

01:53:17.110 --> 01:53:21.146
going back to the tricyclics,
and the MAO inhibitors,

01:53:21.146 --> 01:53:22.110
going back to the '50s,

01:53:22.110 --> 01:53:25.380
like augmenting extracellular serotonin

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:26.993
in one way or another,

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:28.990
for many people,

01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:31.350
leads to a reduction
in depressive symptoms.

01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:32.970
It wouldn't be that crazy

01:53:32.970 --> 01:53:37.010
for chronically stimulating a
subtype of serotonin receptor

01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:38.880
that you have an antidepressant effect.

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:41.760
So I think, if I had to put my bets on it,

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:42.930
if there's anything real,

01:53:42.930 --> 01:53:44.470
it is in that category.

01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:45.590
Although, I'm very open to like,

01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:48.180
maybe there is something
to the creativity,

01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:51.010
to the improved cognition,

01:53:51.010 --> 01:53:53.900
which covers many
domains in and of itself.

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.900
But my greatest hopes are on
the antidepressant effects.

01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:02.150
That said, in the big picture,

01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:04.940
I think the most interesting
thing about psychedelics

01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.600
are the heroic doses.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.433
I mean, the idea that you can

01:54:07.433 --> 01:54:09.550
give something one, two, three times,

01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:12.287
and you see improvements
in depression months later,

01:54:12.287 --> 01:54:13.970
- Right.
- and in addiction

01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.320
over a year later,

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.530
and with these, people dealing with

01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:20.110
potentially terminal illness,

01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:23.433
I mean, I'm interested in big effects.

01:54:23.433 --> 01:54:24.266
- [Dr. Huberman] Right.

01:54:24.266 --> 01:54:25.160
- And I don't think
you're ever going to get

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.630
the really big effects.

01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:28.680
There's also some concern

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:31.460
that almost all of these common psych,

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.060
the more common psychedelics,
even counting MDMA,

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:37.320
they have serotonin to be agonist effects,

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:39.620
and agonizing serotonin 2B

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:46.147
has been shown to lead to
heart valve formation problems,

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:50.810
morphology issues, so valvulopathy.

01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:53.510
And so this is why fen-phen
was pulled from the market.

01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:54.940
- The diet drug?
- Yes.

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.100
- A very effective diet drug.
- Right, right.

01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.770
And it was the portion of that combination

01:54:59.770 --> 01:55:04.770
that had the serotonin 2B
activity that was the problem.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.240
And so we don't know...

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:09.480
So all of the toxicologists

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:12.050
I've ever spoken to about this would say,

01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:13.300
and cardiologists say, like,

01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:16.400
look, hey, if there
was some concern there,

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.390
it's not applicable to the whole idea

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:19.890
of you taking something a few times

01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:21.940
therapeutically within a lifetime.

01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:26.200
But the idea of taking something

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:29.000
twice a week for years...

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.260
I mean, even the hippies back in the '60s

01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:32.610
weren't doing that, right?

01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:34.232
There's not even these...

01:55:34.232 --> 01:55:39.232
And even if there was some
heart valve disease problem

01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:42.710
that stemmed from psychedelic use,

01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:44.360
who's connecting those dots?

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.340
That's not showing up
in the clinical charts

01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.590
for anyone to figure out.

01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:49.790
And just theoretically,

01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:52.320
there is more of a concern,

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.270
if something's going to
happen with heart valves,

01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:58.940
it's more likely that
that issues would arise

01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.190
when someone's taking these things,

01:56:00.190 --> 01:56:04.250
like, yeah, say, twice a
week for the next five years.

01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:05.590
And so I do want to throw that out

01:56:05.590 --> 01:56:07.060
to people to really consider.

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:07.950
- Right, yeah.

01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:08.783
It's something I hadn't heard before.

01:56:08.783 --> 01:56:12.040
That in micro sounds safer, microdosing,

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:14.280
as opposed to heroic or macrodosing,

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.430
and yet, unless...

01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:18.380
And in the context of your lab,

01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:21.000
and other labs doing similar work,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.050
you've got this,

01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:23.390
people checking blood pressure.

01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:25.100
You've got people that
are really monitoring

01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:27.320
your psychological and physical safety.

01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.870
When people are out there microdosing,

01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:30.930
it sounds like there's the potential,

01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:35.450
either through this
serotonin 5H2B receptor,

01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:36.450
or other mechanism,

01:56:36.450 --> 01:56:38.140
that maybe there could be some common

01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:40.113
cumulative negative effects,

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:44.390
and I think that's a really
important consideration.

01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:46.010
So I'm glad you brought it up.

01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:47.600
What about kids?

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.740
So the brain is very
plastic early in life.

01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:53.340
It becomes less plastic as we age.

01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:54.173
- Yeah.
- Although,

01:56:54.173 --> 01:56:56.170
it maintains some degree of plasticity

01:56:56.170 --> 01:56:57.690
throughout the lifespan.

01:56:57.690 --> 01:56:59.470
The year 25,

01:56:59.470 --> 01:57:01.680
not the year 25,

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:04.450
but rather, the age 25 years,

01:57:04.450 --> 01:57:06.930
is sort of an inflection point

01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:10.440
where the rigidity of the nervous system

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.660
seems to really take off.

01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:12.980
Of course, people don't wake up

01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:14.130
on their 25th birthday,

01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:16.340
and find they have no neural plasticity,

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.450
whereas the day before, they had a lot.

01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:19.970
It's plus or minus,

01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:20.803
- Yeah.
- whatever it is,

01:57:20.803 --> 01:57:21.670
a year or two,

01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:23.743
but depends on the individual.

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:30.560
However, the young brain is very plastic,

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:35.700
and I could imagine, there
could be great risks,

01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:37.470
who knows, maybe even benefits,

01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:40.070
but I'm certainly not
thinking about those.

01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:42.660
I'm mainly thinking about the risks

01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:46.260
for young people taking psychedelics.

01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:49.120
Are there any trials looking at people...

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:49.990
In clinical trials,

01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:51.340
this would be under the age of 18,

01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:54.490
Has anyone explored
this in a rigorous way,

01:57:54.490 --> 01:57:57.790
given the potential to
exacerbate psychotic symptoms

01:57:57.790 --> 01:57:59.590
and bipolar symptoms in some people?

01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:03.350
Is there a heightened risk of that?

01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:05.530
What's the story with age of use

01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:07.620
and psychedelics for therapeutic purposes?

01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:10.110
- There's no formal research.

01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:13.120
Although, there's a very high
chance that there will be.

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.870
And so this is one of the
very interesting things

01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:16.740
folks may not realize

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:19.640
or appreciate about the
FDA approval process.

01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.160
So the FDA already, in multiple instances,

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:25.940
has signaled that they
want to see those studies.

01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:26.890
- Before?

01:58:26.890 --> 01:58:28.700
- Well, not before it's approved

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:32.820
as necessarily as for adults,

01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:34.380
but they're going to
eventually want to see...

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:38.310
In fact, so the MAPS group
that's developing MDMA for PTSD,

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:42.160
they've already signaled
that that's kind of

01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.940
on the list of interest.

01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:49.140
And there's even some
incentives in the FDA pathways

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:55.880
for incentivizing folks to
explore that use in young people.

01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:57.880
I know in some of the
work that I helped with

01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:02.880
in pushing psilocybin into
phase 2B clinical research,

01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:09.620
the FDA said, "Well why
can't you give this to kids?"

01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:12.870
It's like, are you aware that depression

01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:15.423
is a problem with adolescents?

01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:18.370
And it's really interesting,

01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:23.310
because this FDA is very concerned
about pseudo-specificity.

01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:24.270
The idea that-
- Wait, could you define

01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:25.840
pseudo-specificity?
- You put out a drug,

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:28.900
and say, oh, this is good
for men, but not women.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:31.680
This is good for black
folks, but not white folks.

01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.720
And now, sometimes, there's a
very good rationale for that,

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.770
like when we're talking about hormones,

01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:38.033
and for a specific,

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.337
for men versus women,

01:59:40.337 --> 01:59:43.723
and there's certain issues,

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:46.170
certain disease states,

01:59:46.170 --> 01:59:47.830
like maybe sickle cell anemia,

01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:49.170
that's more relevant.
- Or Tay-Sachs,

01:59:49.170 --> 01:59:50.003
things like that.

01:59:50.003 --> 01:59:51.060
Sure.
- Yeah, exactly.

01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:52.790
But absent of something of that,

01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:54.740
they're very concerned about saying,

01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.760
oh, this is for this type of person,

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.020
but not that type of person.

01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.630
So age is one of those things.

01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:01.910
And also, this recognition,

02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:04.100
much like the emphasis at NIH

02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:06.913
with rodent studies and human studies,

02:00:06.913 --> 02:00:09.870
that you can't just say,
"You're studying men".

02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:10.740
You need a rationale,

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:11.750
if you're only [mumbles].

02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:13.880
- Yeah, to be clear to people, there's...

02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:15.380
It's a recent switch,

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:19.850
but there's a stipulation in
every federally funded grant

02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:21.500
that both sexes,

02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:24.100
we don't refer to gender
in scientific studies,

02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:26.490
unless it's a study of gender, per se.

02:00:26.490 --> 02:00:28.910
We refer to sex, meaning biological sex,

02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:31.110
so that there's a stipulation,

02:00:31.110 --> 02:00:33.500
that in order to receive and
continue to receive funding,

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:36.930
you have to do a studies on both males

02:00:36.930 --> 02:00:39.890
and females of that
species, including humans.

02:00:39.890 --> 02:00:42.070
- And at least, even if
you're not powered for it,

02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:44.690
at least looking at that
in exploratory analysis.

02:00:44.690 --> 02:00:48.310
Like as a grant reviewer,
I'm charged with looking at,

02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:50.770
did they address sex as a biologically

02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:52.180
relevant variable anyway?
- Right.

02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:53.063
Does the same-
- You just throw it in there-

02:00:53.063 --> 02:00:55.440
- Does the same drug
have different effects

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:56.800
in males versus females?

02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:57.662
- Right.

02:00:57.662 --> 02:00:59.270
And you could at least look
at the trends, even again,

02:00:59.270 --> 02:01:00.740
if you're underpowered to look at those

02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:02.980
between subject-type effects.

02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:05.080
- Which is a great shift that didn't exist

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:08.340
10 years ago.
- Right.

02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.530
- It sounds like we're
both on grants panels.

02:01:10.530 --> 02:01:11.920
As study section members,

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:12.753
you didn't have to do that.

02:01:12.753 --> 02:01:14.600
Now, it's an important
biological variable.

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.220
If you don't look at that,

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.640
you, essentially, won't get your funding.

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:20.000
- And age is a similar thing.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.210
So if the whole idea, like,

02:01:21.210 --> 02:01:23.040
man, if something could help kids,

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.010
what's the rationale?

02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:24.990
So I think there's going to be...

02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:27.550
Now, obviously, you're going
to have in those studies

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:31.050
at least just as much, probably more,

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:34.770
it should be more, of
a cautionary approach.

02:01:34.770 --> 02:01:36.230
It's probably going to be...

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.050
It would certainly,

02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:39.290
whatever disease states are looked at,

02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:41.360
are going to to have to be
probably treatment resistant,

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.470
at least as a first step.

02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:43.303
You know, hey,

02:01:43.303 --> 02:01:44.136
the kids tried-
- Suicidal depression?

02:01:44.136 --> 02:01:44.969
- Yeah, yeah.

02:01:44.969 --> 02:01:46.710
And so all of that in the mix.

02:01:46.710 --> 02:01:50.640
But hey, if this stuff really helps people

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.530
that are 25 or 30,

02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:57.847
what's the rationale that it
won't help a younger person?

02:01:57.847 --> 02:02:00.320
And there's these generic
kind of concerns about,

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.750
the developing nervous system,

02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:05.340
is more susceptible to...

02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:06.520
I mean, it cuts both ways,

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:07.557
'cause it's also more

02:02:07.557 --> 02:02:09.200
"plastic" generally
- Yeah.

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.750
- and adaptable, maybe resilient
to injury in certain ways.

02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:15.170
But you hear the rhetoric about kids,

02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:16.330
their brains, and drugs,

02:02:16.330 --> 02:02:19.513
and it's like the developing
brain is a special concern.

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:21.613
So yeah.

02:02:21.613 --> 02:02:23.830
But I think we're going to be
seeing research eventually.

02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:24.760
- That's interesting.

02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:29.760
I went to the high school
that is infamous, sadly,

02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.360
Gunn High School, for
having the highest degree,

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:36.130
at least at one point,
of highest suicide rate.

02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:37.720
- Wow.

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:39.070
- A very large number of suicides.

02:02:39.070 --> 02:02:41.480
This was written up in
the "Times" and elsewhere.

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.060
- Is it very academically
successful school?

02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.240
- It's a very academically-
- There's a lot of

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.011
high pressure kind of-
- Yeah, a very academically

02:02:47.011 --> 02:02:47.930
- demanding school,
- Yeah.

02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:50.260
- to the point where they've restricted...

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:53.080
The kids will meet often at 6:30 AM

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.300
or 6:00 AM before school for study groups

02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:56.470
and things of that sort.

02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:58.670
So some of it may relate to that.

02:02:58.670 --> 02:02:59.503
But I have to say,

02:02:59.503 --> 02:03:03.270
that even prior to all
that academic pressure,

02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:04.960
when I went there,

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.930
the pressure wasn't like that.

02:03:06.930 --> 02:03:11.930
We had an unusual number of
suicides for whatever reason,

02:03:13.372 --> 02:03:17.230
and so the idea of kids being prescribed,

02:03:17.230 --> 02:03:18.720
and I want to emphasize prescribed,

02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:19.553
not just using,

02:03:19.553 --> 02:03:22.150
but prescribed psychedelics
for therapeutic purposes,

02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:24.600
I think might make some people balk,

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:29.500
but the idea of kids killing themselves

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:30.820
should also make people balk.

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.220
And so I'm relieved to hear
that there's going to be

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.630
a rational, scientific,

02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:40.063
safe clinical trial-based
exploration of this.

02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.420
I want to ask you about the current status

02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:47.131
of these drugs and compounds.

02:03:47.131 --> 02:03:51.300
I'm pretty active on social media,

02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:53.320
more so on Instagram than on Twitter.

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:57.320
But as I have been on Twitter
a little bit more recently,

02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.730
I've noticed that
there's a lot of dialogue

02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:02.600
around your account and
other people's accounts

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.810
around a couple of themes
related to psychedelics.

02:04:04.810 --> 02:04:08.480
First of all, what is the
status of the transition

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.010
to legality for prescription purposes?

02:04:12.010 --> 02:04:15.970
So medical doctors, MDs,
prescribing it legally

02:04:15.970 --> 02:04:18.030
for therapeutic purposes.

02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.863
That's the first question.

02:04:18.863 --> 02:04:21.040
The second question is,

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:22.120
what is the status

02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:25.610
as it relates to possession
and criminal charges?

02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:28.760
So for a long time, I lived in Oakland,

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:32.090
where we were one day
told not too long ago,

02:04:32.090 --> 02:04:33.187
it is now, quote/unquote,

02:04:33.187 --> 02:04:35.570
"decriminalized" is what I was told.

02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:37.360
Double check, people.
- That's right.

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.870
- But what does that mean?

02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:41.820
And then the other issue,
and the third question,

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.510
and we can parse these one by one,

02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:44.743
is this issue of,

02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:49.240
let's just say, I'm aware
of a lot of investor dollars

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.160
going into companies
that are, essentially,

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.810
companies focused on
psychedelics as therapeutics,

02:04:56.810 --> 02:04:58.823
or psychedelics generally.

02:04:58.823 --> 02:05:01.090
I have to assume that they are investing

02:05:01.090 --> 02:05:04.143
in anticipation of a
shift in the legal status.

02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:07.670
And there's a lot of interest now,

02:05:07.670 --> 02:05:11.530
like will psilocybin
become a taxable thing,

02:05:11.530 --> 02:05:12.430
just like marijuana?

02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:14.400
So let's start with the question of like,

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.110
what is going on in the US legally?

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:23.110
Is it illegal to possess, and
sell, and use these compounds?

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.550
My understanding is,
you can still go to jail

02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:30.300
for having these compounds
in your possession,

02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:31.530
or for selling.
- Right.

02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:35.610
So even though the legal landscape

02:05:35.610 --> 02:05:38.310
is very different than with cannabis,

02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:39.730
there are some similarities.

02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:41.250
So one of the similarities is,

02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:44.720
that regardless of what local, municipal,

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:47.450
whether the city or
state is decriminalized,

02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:51.410
and that word itself can mean many things.

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:54.380
Some forms of
decriminalization is close to

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.860
what folks would call legalization,

02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:59.740
and others are pretty weak, just saying.

02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:01.810
We suggest that the police

02:06:01.810 --> 02:06:03.910
make it their lowest law
enforcement priority,

02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:05.100
that type thing.
[interposing voices]

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:05.933
- Turn the other cheek

02:06:05.933 --> 02:06:06.810
kind of thing.
- Right.

02:06:06.810 --> 02:06:08.080
But even the cops can

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:10.690
still choose to-
- But someone could get

02:06:10.690 --> 02:06:12.300
pulled over for one thing, searched,

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:15.360
and then by definition, if
it's illegal, and they find it,

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.440
- Right.
- then they have-

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:17.406
- So those are-
- They have to do

02:06:17.406 --> 02:06:18.239
something about it.

02:06:18.239 --> 02:06:21.020
- And that'll probably be determined by

02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.500
both judicial precedent,

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:23.790
is it going to be thrown out,

02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:25.950
and just the local prosecutor,

02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:27.570
even before, are they going to choose,

02:06:27.570 --> 02:06:28.600
even at post-arrest,

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.980
are going to pursue to really
go after those charges,

02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:33.750
make those charges stick?

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:34.950
So I think that's still in play,

02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:36.450
and is going to depend
on the municipality.

02:06:36.450 --> 02:06:38.410
But like cannabis,

02:06:38.410 --> 02:06:40.640
federally, these are all
Schedule I compounds.

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:42.030
- Which means they're illegal?

02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:43.910
- Which means they're illegal.

02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:44.900
The caveat to that,

02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:46.180
just has always been the case

02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:49.400
since Prop 215 in California
with cannabis in '96,

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:54.210
is that, hey, 99% of drug enforcement

02:06:54.210 --> 02:06:55.760
is done at the local and state level.

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:59.630
The DEA, which is the federal
level of law enforcement,

02:06:59.630 --> 02:07:02.190
is a tiny fraction of the arrests.

02:07:02.190 --> 02:07:04.900
I mean, most people that
are arrested for any drug

02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:09.900
are done by local or
state level authorities,

02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:13.230
but it's still technically illegal.

02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:14.190
And so you can,

02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:16.100
and they could potentially,

02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:18.450
depending on the ambiguity
of the local law,

02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:20.160
even those local
officials could charge you

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:21.853
with a federal crime.

02:07:22.853 --> 02:07:27.160
And theoretically, the
feds could always come in.

02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:29.330
Now, although you'll...

02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:32.973
Again, a similar case with
the whole cannabis history.

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.000
The feds came in in the early days,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.870
but the folks that were,
basically, highly visible,

02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:42.423
they went after Tommy
Chong for selling bongs.

02:07:43.378 --> 02:07:45.440
I remember him being on
"The Tonight Show" one time,

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.380
and I think it was back
in the Jay Leno days.

02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:50.460
He says, "But all along
the Santa Monica boardwalk

02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:51.537
every shop sells bongs".

02:07:51.537 --> 02:07:53.770
"How did you go to prison
for a half year for bongs?"

02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:55.246
It's cause he was...

02:07:55.246 --> 02:07:58.410
- 'Cause he was famous.
- 'Cause he was Tommy Chong,

02:07:58.410 --> 02:08:01.810
and there was some high
profile cannabis groups

02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:04.550
that were distributing it,
and that were very vocal.

02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:06.940
Those were the ones raided
by the DEA in the early days,

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:08.960
not the ones kind of
keeping to themselves,

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.580
keeping it quiet, and
just doing their thing.

02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:14.650
So there's always the potential
for selective enforcement.

02:08:14.650 --> 02:08:17.280
And so in like this initiative in Oregon,

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:22.280
which is a state level
legalization of psilocybin therapy,

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.230
which is really interesting,

02:08:24.230 --> 02:08:26.010
part of their plan for two years,

02:08:26.010 --> 02:08:30.340
is to figure out how to
integrate with the federal level.

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.130
And I don't know how that's going to go,

02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:36.070
because unless you rewrite
the Controlled Substances Act,

02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:37.500
it seems like the best you're going to get

02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:40.943
is a tolerance from
the federal government,

02:08:43.789 --> 02:08:45.600
and that could be very,

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.070
hey, you change administrations-

02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:51.060
- And this is psilocybin by a prescription

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.650
from a medical doctor,

02:08:52.650 --> 02:08:54.510
or you're talking about therapists

02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:58.800
who have master's degrees, or PhDs,

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:02.030
or self-appointed coaches,
or something like that

02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:06.800
administering psilocybin,
but without any oversight?

02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:09.530
- So this is all getting
figured out in the Oregon case.

02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:11.530
And again, there's that
two year period of like,

02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:13.140
basically, we're going to figure this out,

02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:14.826
and so-
- What is it with Oregon?

02:09:14.826 --> 02:09:16.550
- [laughs] They're ahead of a lot of...

02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:18.250
You know, euthanasia.

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:19.357
- I love the state of Oregon.
- Yeah.

02:09:19.357 --> 02:09:22.570
- But it's interesting how
you have these pockets.

02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:24.760
Oregon and Vermont seems to be one.

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:26.590
You know, you've got these kind of pockets

02:09:26.590 --> 02:09:30.760
where people are experimental
with plant compounds.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.450
They seem to be green, woodsy areas,

02:09:33.450 --> 02:09:34.350
at least in my mind.

02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:35.930
But there's sort of a culture
- Yeah.

02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:39.290
- around plants and the use
of plants as therapeutics.

02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:43.050
- And combine that with the
West, just more geographically,

02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:47.370
of more of the anti-federalism,

02:09:47.370 --> 02:09:49.630
I mean, the Oregon ranchers
from several years ago

02:09:49.630 --> 02:09:54.180
that held up the whatever, wildlife place,

02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:56.280
and that was a big showdown with the feds,

02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:00.310
just kind of the West is kind of known for

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:02.353
more of those issues.

02:10:02.353 --> 02:10:03.530
So you combine the two,

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:05.801
the hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe

02:10:05.801 --> 02:10:06.634
with the kind of anti-
- Although, I would argue

02:10:06.634 --> 02:10:09.960
it's becoming less hippy-dippy than...

02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:11.580
Although, it was.

02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:13.180
There's always been a tradition,

02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:15.480
not just in the culture around drugs,

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:18.420
but certainly, in academia,
and in tech, et cetera,

02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:21.590
that the West has been a place

02:10:21.590 --> 02:10:25.230
where people have tried to
throw off traditionalism,

02:10:25.230 --> 02:10:28.730
and kind of lineage like
who your parents are,

02:10:28.730 --> 02:10:30.283
what school you went to,

02:10:31.859 --> 02:10:35.030
and the past as a
determinant of what's next

02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:36.573
and exciting about the future.

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:38.593
And here we are,

02:10:38.593 --> 02:10:39.547
an East Coast institution guy

02:10:39.547 --> 02:10:41.333
and a West Coast institution guy.

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.030
I think that it's this idea

02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:47.850
of kind of innovation
and the future versus

02:10:47.850 --> 02:10:51.340
do we stay grounded in
history and tradition?

02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:52.290
- Right.
- And, of course,

02:10:52.290 --> 02:10:53.890
there are great
institutions on both sides.

02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:56.280
What's interesting, is that Hopkins,

02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.930
Johns Hopkins Medical School,

02:10:57.930 --> 02:11:02.050
I think of as a real like East
Coast academic institution.

02:11:02.050 --> 02:11:03.140
It is on the East Coast.

02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:08.140
But here you are doing
these very pioneering,

02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:12.860
and important, and
exploratory studies in a,

02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:15.000
certainly not a hippy-dippy environment.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:15.833
- Right.

02:11:15.833 --> 02:11:17.240
Oh, yeah, a very conservative
[interposing voices]

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:18.073
psychiatry department,
- Yeah.

02:11:18.073 --> 02:11:18.906
- even amongst psychiatry departments.

02:11:18.906 --> 02:11:20.710
- Right.
- And as a psychologist

02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:21.970
in a psychiatry department,

02:11:21.970 --> 02:11:25.210
psychiatry is certainly more
conservative than psychology,

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:26.370
even within academics.

02:11:26.370 --> 02:11:28.310
But even amongst psychiatry departments,

02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:30.730
it's very conservative department.

02:11:30.730 --> 02:11:33.010
- So we got the law at the federal level,

02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:35.830
we've got the law at the
state and local level,

02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:37.860
and then we've got this question of

02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:40.590
whether or not it's
going to be physicians,

02:11:40.590 --> 02:11:44.240
so MDs, people with
PhDs or masters degrees,

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.540
or whether or not it will
be kind of a free for all

02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:48.804
- Right.
- for consumption-

02:11:48.804 --> 02:11:49.830
- The life coaches.

02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:51.657
- The life coaches,
and the general public.

02:11:51.657 --> 02:11:53.160
- Right.
- I mean, cannabis-

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:55.023
- Yeah.
- I'm not a pot smoker.

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:57.670
It's never appealed to me.

02:11:57.670 --> 02:11:59.950
That's just me and my pharmacology.

02:11:59.950 --> 02:12:04.950
But you can buy cannabis
most places in the US

02:12:06.010 --> 02:12:07.530
without a ton of risk,

02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:09.467
it seems, right?
- Right.

02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:12.910
- Are we going to see a time in which

02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:16.820
you can essentially go into a shop on a

02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:19.570
Abbot Kinney Boulevard
in Venice, California?

02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:21.610
And right now, you can go buy marijuana

02:12:21.610 --> 02:12:23.350
if you have a marijuana card.

02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:24.240
That's my understanding.

02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:27.140
I see a lot of people going
in and out of these stores.

02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:28.870
The police, certainly,
have no problem with it.

02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:29.930
Is there going to come a time

02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:32.690
where people can just go by psilocybin?

02:12:32.690 --> 02:12:34.449
Do you think-
- Like they do in Amsterdam,

02:12:34.449 --> 02:12:35.282
and have for a long time-
- Do you think

02:12:35.282 --> 02:12:36.949
that time is coming?

02:12:39.124 --> 02:12:43.103
- I think so, at a certain point,

02:12:44.883 --> 02:12:46.543
and I don't know how long.

02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:50.980
It's hard to imagine

02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:55.980
our current level of drug
criminalization holding up for...

02:12:57.110 --> 02:12:58.980
And I'm thinking like large spans of time.

02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:00.420
Like, really, in 100 years,

02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:02.370
are we going to be doing this 500 years?

02:13:02.370 --> 02:13:03.203
How could that...

02:13:03.203 --> 02:13:04.390
It's not going to be sustainable.

02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:06.220
- But in five years, for instance?

02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:09.750
- So I don't think so
in the United States.

02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:12.310
I do think eventually

02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:13.350
you're going to see something like that,

02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:15.120
cause there's going to be no way,

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.680
and I think we're going to,

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.450
I hope that we're going to
eventually come so strongly,

02:13:21.450 --> 02:13:25.550
we're going to move on from this
model of criminalizing drugs.

02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:28.190
That we're really going to
focus on regulating drugs

02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:29.630
at the right level for that drug.

02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:34.000
And I like the word regulation
better than legalization.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.690
I mean, I could imagine
what one day regulation,

02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:39.000
smart regulation, might
mean for psychedelics.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.650
Maybe it could mean that there will be,

02:13:41.650 --> 02:13:44.770
whether or not you have
a diagnosis of a problem,

02:13:44.770 --> 02:13:47.010
it may be that even for
personal exploration,

02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:48.600
you can do this legally,

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:51.197
but you first have to maybe
take a court, get a drive.

02:13:51.197 --> 02:13:52.990
and this has been, I'm
not the first to say this,

02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:55.200
but get equivalent of a driver's license.

02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:58.050
You have to go to get
some sort of training.

02:13:58.050 --> 02:14:00.690
Maybe your first number of experiences

02:14:00.690 --> 02:14:05.060
need to be with trained
guides who can facilitate it.

02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:06.890
And then the public health information

02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:08.100
for anyone using this,

02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:10.750
that this is what risk your use is.

02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:12.030
All use is going to have risks.

02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:13.270
This is what risk your use is.

02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:14.700
This is less risky use.

02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:16.210
These are the factors.

02:14:16.210 --> 02:14:17.530
So I think, eventually,
we're going to be...

02:14:17.530 --> 02:14:20.900
But I would say the same
thing for methamphetamine,

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:24.100
and heroin, and cocaine.

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:24.933
All of these drugs,

02:14:24.933 --> 02:14:27.110
it's hard to imagine the current approach

02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:29.560
of just feeding a black market,

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:32.800
and really exasperating a
lot of the harms from drugs

02:14:34.670 --> 02:14:36.460
that happens under the current model,

02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:38.200
it's hard to imagine maintaining.

02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:39.070
That isn't to say,

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:43.460
I think it should be in all
of the 7-Elevens sold to kids.

02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:45.840
At the other extreme-
- I would hope not.

02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:48.180
- But I do think it's
probably not going to be soon

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.070
in the United States.

02:14:50.070 --> 02:14:51.511
I do want to make the major point,

02:14:51.511 --> 02:14:55.310
that even if psychedelics
had never been made illegal,

02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:56.440
I think the exact,

02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:59.010
the trajectory of the
medical research right now

02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:00.710
would still need to happen.

02:15:00.710 --> 02:15:03.553
If it's effective as an antidepressant,

02:15:04.886 --> 02:15:06.850
we need it to be...

02:15:06.850 --> 02:15:08.790
There's all the evidence suggesting,

02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:10.530
that whatever disorder
we're talking about,

02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:12.170
the efficacy is going to be increased,

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:16.020
and the risks are going to
to be mitigated drastically

02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:18.130
in the types of models we're talking about

02:15:18.130 --> 02:15:20.490
with the screening, with the preparation,

02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:22.740
with the integration of
cognitive behavioral therapy,

02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:23.573
or what have you,

02:15:23.573 --> 02:15:25.460
depending on the
disorder, you're treating,

02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:28.393
with the integration afterwards
with the professionals.

02:15:31.097 --> 02:15:32.610
We would be doing it anyway.

02:15:32.610 --> 02:15:34.410
So it's not like this versus that.

02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:37.100
So I don't see it as a race
between the decriminalization

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:38.880
or legalization of these compounds

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.410
versus their medical development.

02:15:40.410 --> 02:15:42.210
Some people who are psychedelic fans

02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:47.410
get all into a bunch about
the medical development.

02:15:47.410 --> 02:15:49.180
They say, you guys want to like,

02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:52.120
you want to keep it only for

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.050
your medical research in an ivory tower,

02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:57.410
and you want to be in
control of it as academics.

02:15:57.410 --> 02:16:00.850
And my take is, I didn't
make it illegal for anyone.

02:16:00.850 --> 02:16:03.380
We're only moving the
needle in one direction.

02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:05.638
And again, even if it
was already illegal...

02:16:05.638 --> 02:16:09.190
And I've done plenty of survey
research of people reporting

02:16:09.190 --> 02:16:12.270
they took mushrooms for fun,
or for personal exploration,

02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:14.840
and they said, my god, why am I smoking,

02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:16.770
and they quit smoking
20 years because of it,

02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:18.300
or it's helped with their depression,

02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.330
or it's helped with them
overcoming alcoholism,

02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:21.163
or these [mumbles].

02:16:21.163 --> 02:16:22.970
Sometimes that happens out of the blue

02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:24.630
when people use psychedelics.

02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:26.090
None the less,

02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:28.610
obviously, the efficacy
rates are going to be higher

02:16:28.610 --> 02:16:30.410
when you bring it into
these medical models,

02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:31.880
and it's going to be safer.
- Sure.

02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:34.627
- So we need to be pushing that.

02:16:34.627 --> 02:16:38.300
And my best guess, is that
MDMA is going to be approved

02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:40.710
within the next three years-
- For a prescription

02:16:40.710 --> 02:16:42.070
by a physician?

02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:43.490
- Yes.

02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:46.030
And not just take two and
call me in the morning,

02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:47.230
- Right.
- but in the clinics,

02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:50.110
the way that those PTSD
trials are being run.

02:16:50.110 --> 02:16:52.990
So the MDMA would be approved for PTSD,

02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:55.130
and every disorder needs
to be looked at separately,

02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:56.960
and it's going to only be
approved for those things.

02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.536
Now, there's going to be-
- Right, 'cause approved,

02:16:58.536 --> 02:17:01.280
and legalized, and regulated,

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:02.630
now, we're getting into the nuance.

02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:03.490
I think when people hear

02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:04.930
it's going to be approved in two years,

02:17:04.930 --> 02:17:07.940
they think that they'll
be able to buy, and sell,

02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:10.060
and use MDMA without legal consequences,

02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:10.893
and I do not think that's

02:17:10.893 --> 02:17:12.287
going to be the situation.
- Right, that's not going to

02:17:12.287 --> 02:17:13.530
be the case.
- It's not the way it is.

02:17:13.530 --> 02:17:17.790
And I will say, that I think the,

02:17:17.790 --> 02:17:19.730
quote/unquote, "psychedelic community",

02:17:19.730 --> 02:17:21.880
I mean, they've been
doing what they want to,

02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:25.890
and will carry on doing what
they want to anyway, right?

02:17:25.890 --> 02:17:27.970
It's not like the legal status has

02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:28.803
- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.

02:17:28.803 --> 02:17:30.850
- prevented them from
doing what they're doing.

02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:35.278
In fact, unlike Leary, and
Timothy Leary, and Huxley,

02:17:35.278 --> 02:17:38.770
and some of the others
that were very vocal

02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:39.737
and lost their jobs,

02:17:39.737 --> 02:17:41.940
and some of 'em even
went to jail, et cetera.

02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:44.010
I mean, you've got a lot
of public figures now,

02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:45.100
like McKenna and others,

02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:46.040
who are just basically out there

02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:48.030
talking about psychedelics.

02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:50.170
Michael Pollan, who's more of a writer,

02:17:50.170 --> 02:17:53.493
foodie guide gone psychedelic
dabbler writer guy.

02:17:54.370 --> 02:17:56.093
I know he's kind of a polymath.

02:17:57.291 --> 02:18:01.890
You know, the legal status
didn't seem to hinder their,

02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:03.020
at least, online careers.

02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:03.900
I don't know.

02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:05.310
I haven't looked at their bank accounts.

02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:07.750
But I'm imagining they're doing just fine,

02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:08.583
right?
- Right.

02:18:08.583 --> 02:18:10.260
- So the fact that the work is happening

02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:12.810
inside of big institutions,

02:18:12.810 --> 02:18:14.860
I think it's important that you point out,

02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:16.130
and I'm just trying to underscore,

02:18:16.130 --> 02:18:20.920
that that's in no way antagonistic
to what people are doing.

02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:23.860
It's in support of a
different sort of mission,

02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:26.830
which is to explore the
validity in different contexts

02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:28.960
in a really controlled way,

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:29.933
which I really,

02:18:31.135 --> 02:18:34.103
I think it's a really important mission.

02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:36.700
I want to make sure that I ask you about

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.500
the other really important mission

02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:40.580
that you're involved in with
respect to psychedelics,

02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:43.720
which is not about depression, per se,

02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:45.440
but is about neurological,

02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:47.800
neurologic injury or head injury.

02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:49.510
I realize, it's early days for this,

02:18:49.510 --> 02:18:54.260
but I think there's a lot of
concussion out there, sadly.

02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:56.640
There's a lot of TBI,
traumatic brain injury.

02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:58.100
- Yeah.
- Not just from sports.

02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:00.630
I think people sometimes
forget that it's not,

02:19:00.630 --> 02:19:04.310
the major source of traumatic
head injury is not football.

02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:05.330
It's not hockey.

02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:07.010
It's not boxing.

02:19:07.010 --> 02:19:08.560
It's not any of that stuff.

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:09.920
It's construction workers,

02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.210
- Ah, yeah!
- and it's-

02:19:11.210 --> 02:19:12.043
- Yeah.
- I mean,

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:12.876
if you've ever seen the helmets

02:19:12.876 --> 02:19:13.709
that construction workers wear.

02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:14.980
I mean, that-
- The jackhammer,

02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:15.813
- Yeah.
- oh, my god.

02:19:15.813 --> 02:19:16.646
- The jack hammer-
- I mean, how could that

02:19:16.646 --> 02:19:17.710
not be just like-
- Yeah.

02:19:17.710 --> 02:19:19.850
I have a colleague that works
on this in bioengineering.

02:19:19.850 --> 02:19:20.980
And when you look at the...

02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:22.710
You know, we always think sports,

02:19:22.710 --> 02:19:25.880
but there are many
people who make a living

02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:27.183
in a way that is,

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:30.140
over time, is detrimental to their brain,

02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:31.370
and they don't have the option

02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:34.020
of just not being a professional athlete,

02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:34.970
or something of that sort.

02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:36.790
- And if they're not
doing the construction,

02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:37.717
someone else needs to it-
- Someone else has

02:19:37.717 --> 02:19:38.960
to do it, right.

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.050
And for some reason, and I, too,

02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:43.350
I didn't occur to me until I heard it,

02:19:43.350 --> 02:19:45.560
like the people who
are doing construction.

02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:48.380
And then, of course, bike
accidents, and falls,

02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:49.864
and things like that as well.

02:19:49.864 --> 02:19:50.812
So-
- Military.

02:19:50.812 --> 02:19:52.629
- Military, absolutely.
- Yeah.

02:19:52.629 --> 02:19:57.629
- So what do you think is the
potential for these compounds,

02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:01.090
particular psilocybin, but
other compounds as well,

02:20:01.090 --> 02:20:04.970
for the treatment and
possible even reversal

02:20:04.970 --> 02:20:07.090
of neurological injuries,

02:20:07.090 --> 02:20:08.590
and what sorts of things

02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:10.300
are you excited to do in that realm?

02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:13.190
- Yeah, so this is definitely
on the more exploratory end.

02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:15.423
So it's based upon...

02:20:15.423 --> 02:20:18.250
You know, this is sort of beyond

02:20:18.250 --> 02:20:21.260
the improvement of psychiatric disorders,

02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:25.800
like depression, or depression anxiety

02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:28.890
associated with a terminal illness,

02:20:28.890 --> 02:20:31.320
or a substance use
disorder, the addiction.

02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:34.950
So those are sort of
psychiatric disorders.

02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:36.130
So this is...

02:20:38.844 --> 02:20:42.033
There are anecdotes of people saying,

02:20:44.850 --> 02:20:47.570
that psychedelics have
helped heal their brain.

02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:50.800
They've been in one of these
situations, like in sports,

02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:53.600
a sport where there's
repetitive head impact,

02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.980
and they're claiming
that using psychedelics

02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:59.780
has actually improved
their cognitive function,

02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:02.240
for example, improve their memory,

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.373
including improve their mood.

02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:09.440
But it's kind of more of
the cognitive function,

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.930
things like memory are...

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:13.860
Now, the caveat is,

02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:15.960
if you've successfully
improved someone's depression,

02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:17.740
you can get some
cognitive improvement too,

02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:18.970
- Sure.
- but that's more

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:21.700
of a weaker, more indirect effect.

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:23.780
But if you take these anecdotes,

02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:26.890
and you combine it way
across orders of analysis

02:21:26.890 --> 02:21:30.390
to the rodent research from several labs,

02:21:30.390 --> 02:21:32.850
like David Olson, Brian Roth,

02:21:32.850 --> 02:21:34.420
these folks that have shown

02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:38.083
different forms of neural
plasticity unfolding after,

02:21:40.530 --> 02:21:42.000
like sort of post-acutely.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.760
so after, in the days following

02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:46.200
the administration of
psychedelic compounds,

02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:48.680
a variety of psychedelic compounds,

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.483
and even some non-psychedelic
structural analogs,

02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:56.800
that you see these different
forms of neural plasticity.

02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:58.657
So the growth of dendrites,

02:21:58.657 --> 02:22:02.963
and new connections being
formed with different neurons.

02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:08.850
Those effects may be at play,

02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:09.890
and then prove,

02:22:09.890 --> 02:22:12.880
in the psychiatric treatments
that we're dealing with,

02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:14.380
that we don't know that.

02:22:14.380 --> 02:22:15.700
It seems like a decent guess,

02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:18.400
and we're going to be figuring
out whether that's the case.

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.690
But another potential that sets up,

02:22:20.690 --> 02:22:22.720
is that maybe that's, what's going on

02:22:25.929 --> 02:22:30.929
with these claims of improvements
from neurological issues,

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:32.350
that there's actually

02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:39.650
repair of the brain from injuries
underlying things that...

02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:44.240
Situations where there's
repetitive head impact,

02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:46.050
perhaps there's a potential for

02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:48.670
helping folks recover from stroke,

02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:50.763
and disorders like that.

02:22:51.970 --> 02:22:53.700
There's a wide variety of disorders.

02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:57.120
Now, it's a bit of
magic, and a bit of like,

02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:59.120
it's something that
the enthusiasts kind of

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:00.550
can do some hand waving,

02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:02.180
and claim that this is already known.

02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:04.150
It is more exploratory.

02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:05.900
But what I'm hoping to do with some work

02:23:05.900 --> 02:23:10.900
with retired athletes
who had been exposed.

02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:13.370
By the nature of their sport, for example,

02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:15.730
MMA athletes in the UFC

02:23:15.730 --> 02:23:18.980
who have been exposed to
repetitive head impacts,

02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:23.980
like a lot of sports expose people to,

02:23:24.327 --> 02:23:26.150
and who are retired from the sport,

02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:28.950
and are suffering from, say, depression,

02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:33.333
which can, impart, result
from those types of,

02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:36.083
that history of head impact.

02:23:37.130 --> 02:23:39.500
See if we can fix the depression,

02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:41.780
but then also as a cherry on top,

02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:44.100
in a more exploratory aim,

02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:46.950
see if we can have evidence of

02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:48.770
improvement in cognitive function,

02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:50.480
and associate like using MRI

02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:53.150
to see if it affects
gray matter over time,

02:23:53.150 --> 02:23:54.020
these types of things,

02:23:54.020 --> 02:23:56.970
to see if there actually is
some evidence of this improved,

02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:01.500
like this more direct repair of the brain.

02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.090
But again, it is very sort of like,

02:24:04.090 --> 02:24:05.380
we've got some rodent data.

02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:07.915
We've got some human anecdotes.

02:24:07.915 --> 02:24:11.050
- We will acknowledge it's early days,

02:24:11.050 --> 02:24:13.860
and we look forward to seeing the data.

02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:16.320
I appreciate how cautious you are,

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:17.240
attentive you are.

02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:19.060
You're not drawing any conclusions.

02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:23.440
I think from a purely logical

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:26.270
and somewhat mechanistic perspective,

02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:29.780
I mean, if we assume that
lack of ability to focus,

02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:33.770
or degradation and mood is the

02:24:33.770 --> 02:24:35.840
reflection of neurons in the brain,

02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:36.940
I think we can agree on that,

02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:39.600
some dialogue between
neurons and the brain,

02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:41.110
and that what needs to be changed

02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:44.990
is the nature of that dialogue,
aka, neural plasticity.

02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:48.800
We know that reordering of
neural circuitry require,

02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:50.510
in the adult, requires these things,

02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:53.010
like intense focus,
followed by rest, et cetera.

02:24:53.010 --> 02:24:54.780
But the basis for that,

02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:56.850
like beneath, focuses the mechanism,

02:24:56.850 --> 02:24:58.760
is a mechanism, rather,

02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:01.870
beneath the bin that we call
deep rest is a mechanism,

02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:05.700
and those mechanisms are
neuromodulator driven.

02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.570
So, to me, you're...

02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:09.910
I'm not reviewing your grant.

02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:13.410
But from a rational perspective,

02:25:13.410 --> 02:25:17.670
it seems that drugs that
increase certain neuromodulators,

02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:21.760
like serotonin or dopamine,
in a controlled way,

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:25.550
and then coupling that
with learning of some sort,

02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:27.133
sensory input of some sort,

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:31.040
it makes sense that would lead to,

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.350
could, I should say,

02:25:32.350 --> 02:25:33.710
lead to reordering of circuitry

02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:37.343
that would allow for better
thinking, better mood,

02:25:38.350 --> 02:25:40.030
many of the same things
that you've observed

02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:42.550
in the clinical trials for depression.

02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:44.810
So the rationale is really strong.

02:25:44.810 --> 02:25:46.780
I think that's a very exciting area.

02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:48.757
I get asked all the time about TBI,

02:25:48.757 --> 02:25:50.060
and traumatic brain injury,

02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:53.003
and right now, it's kind of,

02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:56.210
there isn't a whole
lot that people can do,

02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:57.410
and people are dabbling in

02:25:57.410 --> 02:25:59.860
the space of hyperbaric chambers,

02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:02.420
and people will do sauna and breath work,

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:05.220
and people are kind of
clipping at the margins

02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:08.270
of what really is a problem
that resides deep to the skull.

02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:12.000
So I think, I just want to
applaud the exploration.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:12.833
I think it's great,

02:26:12.833 --> 02:26:15.300
provided that exploration is
being done in a controlled way.

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:19.030
It sounds like that's what
you're doing with the UFC?

02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:21.090
- Yeah, so that's-
- A great-

02:26:21.090 --> 02:26:22.590
- They were really gracious,

02:26:22.590 --> 02:26:25.180
and had myself and a few of my colleagues

02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:26.900
out to their headquarters in Vegas,

02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:28.040
and-
- Impressive place, right?

02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:29.420
- It's in process.

02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:30.253
- Yeah.
- You know,

02:26:30.253 --> 02:26:31.140
there's a dialogue going on there.

02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:34.740
I'm hopeful that there's going
to be some work with them.

02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:36.470
But it's in process now,

02:26:36.470 --> 02:26:37.580
in terms of exploring it.

02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:38.560
There's a real interest,

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.830
and I'm just really
impressed by the organization

02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:42.740
and their commitment
- Yeah.

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:43.940
- to athlete health,

02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:46.460
and we'll see.
- I am too.

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:47.413
Yeah, I am too.

02:26:48.657 --> 02:26:51.270
We have a colleague out there.

02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:52.420
We're doing a little
bit of work with them.

02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:54.500
Dunkin French, who's a serious
academic in his own right.

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:56.560
And I think when people hear UFC,

02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:58.970
they just think about the
octagon, and fighting,

02:26:58.970 --> 02:27:00.620
and Pay-per-view fights, and things.

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:02.120
But in talking with them,

02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.290
and I'm sure you've had
these discussions as well,

02:27:04.290 --> 02:27:06.760
they are very much
interested in the health

02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:08.950
and longevity of their fighters.

02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:11.220
They are also interested in the health

02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:13.300
and longevity of their
fighters being a template

02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:15.470
for how to treat traumatic brain injury,

02:27:15.470 --> 02:27:18.070
and improve human
performance in other sports,

02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:19.700
and in the general public.

02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:22.360
And I think it's not an image of the UFC

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:23.960
that commonly comes to mind,

02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.080
'cause they haven't been

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:28.550
particularly verbal about it in the press.

02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:30.480
But I think it's great
they're bringing in academics.

02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:31.640
I mean, geeks like us

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.960
going out to the UFC Performance center.

02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:34.910
I mean, you do MMA,

02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:37.430
but I'm basically just a geek
walking through the place.

02:27:37.430 --> 02:27:38.320
But the fact that they're interested

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.373
in talking to scientists is really,

02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:42.423
I'm biased here,

02:27:42.423 --> 02:27:43.763
but a point in their favor.

02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:46.990
Along the lines of other groups

02:27:46.990 --> 02:27:49.440
and individuals that
have impacted the space

02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:51.440
that you're working in in this pioneering

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:53.083
of the psychedelic space,

02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:55.730
a few years ago, I think,

02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:57.860
if someone submitted a grant saying,

02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:02.860
I want to study how psilocybin
impacts human depression,

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:07.331
I'm guessing, having worked
on these panels before,

02:28:07.331 --> 02:28:09.930
that the response might've been closer to,

02:28:09.930 --> 02:28:12.060
well, we need to do a lot
of studies in rodents,

02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:13.360
and a lot of studies in primates,

02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:16.870
and then maybe, just maybe,
we could explore these drugs,

02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:20.065
because the National Institutes
of Health actually has

02:28:20.065 --> 02:28:22.956
a whole institute devoted
to addiction, right?

02:28:22.956 --> 02:28:24.130
- Mm-hmm.
- Of exploring compounds

02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:26.360
only in terms of their negative effects,

02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:27.193
right?
- Yeah.

02:28:27.193 --> 02:28:28.026
- Which is a very-
- NIDA,

02:28:28.026 --> 02:28:30.120
which is where I've gotten
all of my NIH funding

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:31.200
over my career.
- Which is so interesting,

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:32.033
right?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

02:28:32.033 --> 02:28:33.320
- And it's a super important institute.

02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:34.153
I want to be clear,

02:28:34.153 --> 02:28:35.620
there are amazing people there.

02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:40.100
But philanthropy and foundations have been

02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:43.173
very important in supporting
pioneering research,

02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:46.870
and so maybe we just talk
a little bit about that?

02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:51.140
So your lab receives funding
from taxpayer dollars

02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:53.360
through the National Institutes of Health?

02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:56.190
Is that mainly where
your funding comes from?

02:28:56.190 --> 02:29:01.110
- So our group has gotten
some funding from like,

02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:03.560
say, the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, NIDA.

02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:06.890
For some, a small subset
of the psychedelic work,

02:29:06.890 --> 02:29:10.890
but only for some work geared towards

02:29:10.890 --> 02:29:13.270
understanding these
things as drugs of abuse.

02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:14.103
- Right.
- Of course,

02:29:14.103 --> 02:29:15.068
when you do a study, though,

02:29:15.068 --> 02:29:15.901
[interposing voices]

02:29:15.901 --> 02:29:17.070
- Explore how they're bad.

02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.903
- Right.
- Right, right.

02:29:17.903 --> 02:29:18.736
But when you're doing that,

02:29:18.736 --> 02:29:22.923
you can explore like the good stuff too.

02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:27.137
But the large majority of the work,

02:29:27.137 --> 02:29:28.350
and the most interesting work,

02:29:28.350 --> 02:29:30.230
has been funded by philanthropy.

02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:32.090
- Private philanthropy.
- Now, I still have

02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:35.847
some grant support from NIDA
outside of psychedelics.

02:29:35.847 --> 02:29:37.790
- Right.
- I'm shifting more

02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:42.790
and more of my time towards
focusing only on psychedelics.

02:29:43.930 --> 02:29:47.930
And in fact, us getting
the center-level funding

02:29:47.930 --> 02:29:51.930
from some really big
picture philanthropists

02:29:51.930 --> 02:29:54.840
helped me to start to
make that transition.

02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:57.480
But groups like the Heffter
Research organization,

02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:59.870
Dennis McKenna, which is
one of the founding members,

02:29:59.870 --> 02:30:01.197
the brother of Terence McKenna,

02:30:01.197 --> 02:30:02.900
who is, by the way, an ethnobotanist.

02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:04.074
That's what his PhD is in.
- What does that mean,

02:30:04.074 --> 02:30:05.371
ethnobtanist?

02:30:05.371 --> 02:30:08.430
- Studying, essentially, the anthropology

02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:11.920
of psychoactive plant use.

02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:12.941
So, you know-
- Wow!

02:30:12.941 --> 02:30:13.790
You can get a degree in that?

02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:15.040
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:17.210
You know, hanging out with cultures,

02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:19.270
and studying their use of these compounds

02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:20.440
in the traditional ways.
- Wow!

02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:21.313
At Hopkins?

02:30:22.390 --> 02:30:24.160
That degree exists at Johns Hopkins?

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:25.637
- I don't think that
degree exists at Hopkins,

02:30:25.637 --> 02:30:27.480
- Oh, okay.
- but I mean,

02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:28.620
kind of the most...

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:32.470
As you know from academia, I'm not...

02:30:32.470 --> 02:30:34.250
You know, sometimes folks...

02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:35.760
I'm not sure how many people's PhD

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:38.640
is actually in ethnobotany,

02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:39.920
or if it's actually in
- Yeah, I've never heard of-

02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:40.753
- something else.

02:30:40.753 --> 02:30:42.210
But the real focus is...

02:30:42.210 --> 02:30:45.360
My degree is general
experimental psychology.

02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:47.000
- Ten thousand kids out there just decided

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.860
they're going to major in ethnobotany,

02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:50.341
but, you know-
- I mean,

02:30:50.341 --> 02:30:52.380
one of the pioneers of
the psychedelic area,

02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:53.950
before Leary, and before,

02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:54.960
and actually, he was late,

02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:56.241
even for the human researchers.

02:30:56.241 --> 02:30:59.220
Folks like Humphry
Osmond, and Abram Hoffer,

02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:00.610
and Sidney Cohen were earlier.

02:31:00.610 --> 02:31:02.453
But even before those folks,

02:31:02.453 --> 02:31:04.620
Richard Schultes at Harvard,

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:06.680
I mentioned him earlier
in the conversation,

02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:08.450
discovered all of this now.

02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:12.324
These various tribes
using ayahuasca or yagé,

02:31:12.324 --> 02:31:14.620
a different name for the same thing,

02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:16.080
throughout South America,

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:19.140
and these DMT containing
snuffs, and all of this.

02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:22.373
So that was ethnobotany,

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:25.540
this kind of intersection of anthropology

02:31:25.540 --> 02:31:29.320
and these psychoactive plant compounds.

02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:31.960
So the Heffter Research Institute,

02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:36.853
which Dennis is a founding
and active member of,

02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:38.840
a board member,

02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:41.200
they have funded a lot of our early work.

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.160
There's also an organization called

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:47.640
the Beckley Institute based in England,

02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:51.410
that a lady, Amanda Feilding,
has been the head of,

02:31:51.410 --> 02:31:52.370
that has...

02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:54.100
They provided the first funding

02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:57.980
for our psilocybin smoking
cessation research,

02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:01.103
and then Heffter came in and
provided subsequent funding.

02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:03.120
And then there are other groups.

02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:05.020
The Council on Spiritual Practices.

02:32:05.020 --> 02:32:07.780
A great guy named Bob Jesse

02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:09.630
funded some of the
original work at Hopkins,

02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:11.350
looking at the nature
of mystical experience

02:32:11.350 --> 02:32:14.810
outside of treating disease
states or disorders.

02:32:14.810 --> 02:32:15.643
But just
[Huberman speaks indistinctly]

02:32:15.643 --> 02:32:16.640
understanding these...

02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:19.370
Like people take these compounds,

02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:23.020
and astonishingly, frequently, will say,

02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:25.580
that was the most important
thing I've ever experienced.

02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:27.050
And it's like, what the hell is that?

02:32:27.050 --> 02:32:28.190
You know?
- I had someone

02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:29.023
mention recently,

02:32:29.023 --> 02:32:30.480
and I think this might
surprise people a little bit.

02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:31.480
It's certainly surprised me.

02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:35.290
I had a friend who adores his children.

02:32:35.290 --> 02:32:36.580
He's got three children.

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:38.480
He adores his children.

02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:41.010
Happy marriage and a great father.

02:32:41.010 --> 02:32:42.050
They're both great parents.

02:32:42.050 --> 02:32:45.870
And he told me, that as
part of a clinical trial,

02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:49.900
he had a DMT experience that he claims,

02:32:49.900 --> 02:32:51.190
he said, "I'd love to tell you

02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:53.910
that the birth of my
children was as profound,

02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:55.603
but that was a more profound experience

02:32:55.603 --> 02:32:57.660
than the birth of my children,

02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:59.950
any one of them and all of them combined".

02:32:59.950 --> 02:33:00.783
And I was like, "Wow!"

02:33:00.783 --> 02:33:01.616
Now, I've never done DMT,

02:33:01.616 --> 02:33:03.350
but I was like, "Wow, that's
a pretty strong statement".

02:33:03.350 --> 02:33:04.510
Now, he did it in the context

02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:06.980
of one of these clinical explorations

02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:11.600
I assume that was part of
a legal clinical trial.

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:12.780
I mean, that's saying something.

02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:14.320
- Yeah.
- It's saying something.

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:18.403
I mean, he's a very rational,
very grounded guy, otherwise.

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:23.400
So philanthropy foundations.
- Yeah.

02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:24.790
- And then in-
- Most recently,

02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:25.880
and sorry, just I can't,
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:26.930
- 'cause I can't skip it.

02:33:26.930 --> 02:33:27.941
Our center level funding
- Oh, yeah,

02:33:27.941 --> 02:33:28.844
you can't skip-
- which came at

02:33:28.844 --> 02:33:29.747
a year and a half,
- I see.

02:33:29.747 --> 02:33:31.160
- that's like, we...

02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:34.060
I mean, the Heffter
group, the Beckley group,

02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:35.700
I mean, these are wonderful.

02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:36.533
I mean, these are people

02:33:36.533 --> 02:33:37.900
that have been holding the flame alive

02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:39.680
during the darkest hours.

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:42.190
Same thing with the MAPS organization

02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:43.420
more on the MDMA side,

02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:46.130
like holding that candle
during the darkest years.

02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:48.514
You know, so we've...

02:33:48.514 --> 02:33:51.570
Smaller organizations
connected to smaller,

02:33:51.570 --> 02:33:54.603
but growing over time, pockets of wealth.

02:33:55.530 --> 02:33:58.610
But we basically limped along on a wing

02:33:58.610 --> 02:34:00.660
and a prayer until recently,

02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:03.170
when we got the $17 million gift,

02:34:03.170 --> 02:34:04.810
so that we could create a nominal center.

02:34:04.810 --> 02:34:05.643
And as you know,

02:34:05.643 --> 02:34:06.720
basically, to the university,

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:08.630
that means you get a
certain number of dollars,

02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:10.900
and a lot of them, you can
call yourself a center.

02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:12.603
It's a capital investment.

02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:17.840
Staff, equipment, salary, support,

02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:20.680
which has always been
the huge thing for us.

02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:22.670
But the $17 million gift,

02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:26.500
which was split between
the Cohen foundation,

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:29.390
so Steven and Alexandra Cohen,

02:34:29.390 --> 02:34:30.223
they covered half of it,

02:34:30.223 --> 02:34:32.970
and the other half, the
Tim Ferriss collaborative.

02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:36.803
Basically, Tim and a
few friends ponied up,

02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:39.600
divided the rest of that,

02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:41.870
half of that $17 million gift,

02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:44.050
and came together to just...

02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:46.920
I mean, it's completely transformed our,

02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:47.753
the work that we've done,

02:34:47.753 --> 02:34:52.753
and our ability to fully
delve into this area,

02:34:53.530 --> 02:34:54.850
and not worry that, like,

02:34:54.850 --> 02:34:56.560
oh, if I focus on this,

02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.110
rather than putting
another three NIDA grants

02:34:59.110 --> 02:35:02.030
on some other topic that
may or may not get funded,

02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:04.410
if I focus too much on the psychedelics,

02:35:04.410 --> 02:35:06.120
am I putting my career at jeopardy?

02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:07.390
Like so-
- But you're now

02:35:07.390 --> 02:35:08.580
not only a tenured professor,

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:11.330
you're also a full endowed-
- Right.

02:35:11.330 --> 02:35:12.163
So that came-
- By the way,

02:35:12.163 --> 02:35:14.806
when you say somebody is
a fully endowed professor,

02:35:14.806 --> 02:35:15.850
[Dr. Matthew laughs]
- I want to be very clear

02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:16.683
what that means.

02:35:16.683 --> 02:35:17.611
That means that

02:35:17.611 --> 02:35:18.444
there's funding-
- Well, it might mean

02:35:18.444 --> 02:35:20.410
all of the above, but
no, I'm joking [laughs].

02:35:20.410 --> 02:35:23.340
- I have no knowledge of
your particular situation,

02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:25.900
but you probably do.

02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:26.750
- Just kidding.

02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:27.853
- But sure.

02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:31.000
What we're essentially saying,

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.560
is that funding,

02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:35.640
which does not change
somebody's salary level...

02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.473
I just want to be clear,

02:35:36.473 --> 02:35:38.440
'cause I think the general public isn't...

02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:40.450
There's no reason why
they would understand

02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:42.320
all the nuts and bolts of how this works.

02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.153
- Academia is weird.
- Yeah.

02:35:43.153 --> 02:35:43.990
Academia is weird,

02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:46.550
because we're not
talking about increasing.

02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:48.240
We're not talking about an endowment

02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:52.190
or philanthropy that went
to increase Matt's salary.

02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:55.640
That something that's set
at the university level.

02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:56.473
It's always been said,

02:35:56.473 --> 02:35:59.660
and it is, at least, is still true now,

02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:02.070
which is that nobody goes
into science for the money,

02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:04.313
at least not at the academic level,

02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:07.440
not in academia.

02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:11.720
But allows people to
devote more of their time

02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:15.910
and energy to these exploratory realms,

02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:17.210
like psychedelic research,

02:36:17.210 --> 02:36:18.990
or the case of my lab,

02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:20.910
the work that we're doing
with David Spiegel's lab,

02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:22.580
on respiration breath work

02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:24.950
and hypnosis for modulating brain states.

02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:26.640
These are not typically areas

02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.050
that the National Institutes of Health

02:36:28.050 --> 02:36:30.510
and other major organizations have,

02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:33.180
institutions set up to support.

02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:35.610
Now, there is an exciting initiative,

02:36:35.610 --> 02:36:37.310
which is the NCCIH,

02:36:37.310 --> 02:36:39.620
which is Complimentary Health.
- Right.

02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:40.770
Used to be NCCAM.

02:36:40.770 --> 02:36:41.603
- Yep.
- Yeah,

02:36:41.603 --> 02:36:42.436
and they changed their name.
- At NIH.

02:36:42.436 --> 02:36:43.269
- Yeah.
- And now,

02:36:43.269 --> 02:36:44.440
we're not just throwing out acronyms

02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:46.700
just to bat back and forth acronyms.

02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:47.760
But I think what we're looking,

02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:49.060
what we're seeing now

02:36:49.980 --> 02:36:53.890
is a movement toward science,

02:36:53.890 --> 02:36:55.840
and scientists, and clinicians,

02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:59.550
and the general public, and
philanthropy being engaged

02:36:59.550 --> 02:37:01.950
in this dialogue, which says,

02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:04.400
okay, there are problems in the world,

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:06.173
depression, head trauma,

02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:10.550
psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD.

02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:12.950
These problems clearly exist.

02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:15.620
The solutions are going
to involve behaviors

02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:17.410
that are going to involve nutrition,

02:37:17.410 --> 02:37:19.330
supplementation, social connection.

02:37:19.330 --> 02:37:21.500
However, there are drugs,

02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:23.700
there are compounds that
can change the brain,

02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:24.930
and allow the brain to

02:37:24.930 --> 02:37:27.250
change its circuitry through experience,

02:37:27.250 --> 02:37:31.190
and psychedelics are
one of several others,

02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:35.410
but one of the powerful
leavers, it sounds like.

02:37:35.410 --> 02:37:36.773
And I just want to say,

02:37:36.773 --> 02:37:39.493
that I think the reason
I reached out to you,

02:37:39.493 --> 02:37:43.070
and I'm so excited to sit
down and chat with you is,

02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:48.070
because I see very few people
inside the halls of academia

02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:51.530
who have thrown their arms around

02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:54.480
this issue of psychedelics in a way,

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:55.980
and gone through the trouble of trying to

02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:57.853
find the funding to get it done,

02:37:58.760 --> 02:37:59.593
gone through the trouble

02:37:59.593 --> 02:38:01.360
of trying to set up clinical trials.

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:02.750
I know what's involved in doing this.

02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:04.190
It's so complicated.

02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:06.920
It's so time-consuming and painstaking.

02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:08.600
And you've made real progress.

02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:10.640
I mean, you guys are publishing papers.

02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:12.810
There's a new dialogue emerging

02:38:12.810 --> 02:38:14.610
that isn't just books on bookshelves

02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:19.650
and psychedelic, psychonaut
gurus on the internet,

02:38:19.650 --> 02:38:21.190
who also play an important role.

02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:24.400
But you're really moving
this field forward.

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:25.520
And I know there are others as well.

02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:27.676
There are colleagues in
England and others as well.

02:38:27.676 --> 02:38:29.660
We acknowledge them.

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:32.050
But I just want to say personally,

02:38:32.050 --> 02:38:34.380
that I'm inspired

02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:37.510
and impressed by the way
that you've gone about this,

02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:39.000
and the level of rigor.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.680
I mean, when I ask you a
question about serotonin,

02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:43.410
most people will just
kind of kick back to me,

02:38:43.410 --> 02:38:45.320
well, yeah, you got receptors,
and you've got a ligand,

02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:47.460
but I mean, it's clear to me

02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:49.920
that you care about the details,

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:53.030
and that you care about
the future of this area,

02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:55.510
and you also really care
about these patients

02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:56.490
and these individuals.

02:38:56.490 --> 02:39:00.320
So I know I'm speaking on
behalf of a ton of people now,

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:01.660
and in the future,

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:04.210
that don't even know what
they're going to receive

02:39:04.210 --> 02:39:05.290
as a consequence of this.

02:39:05.290 --> 02:39:08.260
I just want to voice a real sincere

02:39:09.810 --> 02:39:11.430
thank you for that effort.

02:39:11.430 --> 02:39:14.000
It's like your lab and your work matters,

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.883
and that's a really
special and unique thing.

02:39:17.883 --> 02:39:18.890
- I appreciate that.

02:39:18.890 --> 02:39:20.790
In fact, I had a good colleague,

02:39:20.790 --> 02:39:22.750
in fact, she shared some grants support

02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:24.940
under the multi-PI system years ago,

02:39:24.940 --> 02:39:29.940
and she actually took a job
at NIH as a review officer.

02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:32.810
And I remember her telling me...

02:39:32.810 --> 02:39:34.880
And she actually left when
she had multiple RO1s.

02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:37.348
So it's like-
- RO1s are kind of

02:39:37.348 --> 02:39:38.610
the bread and butter,
- Big picture grant.

02:39:38.610 --> 02:39:39.825
- big grants
- Yeah.

02:39:39.825 --> 02:39:43.460
- that every card carrying...

02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:45.190
It's a mark of respect in our community

02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:47.380
to have one or several of these, yeah.

02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:48.730
- Yeah, yeah.

02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:51.030
It's like you eat what
you kill in academia.

02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:52.260
It gets to what we were
talking about later,

02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:54.780
it's like you don't make more
money by pulling more grants,

02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:57.620
but you're able to pay the salary that...

02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:01.140
The university doesn't
pay you your salary.

02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:02.840
It goes through them.
- Right.

02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:04.310
You're just able to do more work.

02:40:04.310 --> 02:40:05.170
- Yeah.

02:40:05.170 --> 02:40:06.003
- Yeah.
- And you're able to...

02:40:06.003 --> 02:40:08.680
And if you don't pull in the
grants to cover your salary,

02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:09.880
your job can come to an end.

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:12.870
Even if you're tenured
at a place like Hopkins,

02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:13.730
they can do tricks,

02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:14.890
like slowly lower

02:40:14.890 --> 02:40:16.094
your salary over-
- Well, they just let-

02:40:16.094 --> 02:40:17.720
[interposing voices]

02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:19.390
Or they just take away your space.

02:40:19.390 --> 02:40:20.930
- Yeah, they put you in a closet,

02:40:20.930 --> 02:40:23.300
and give you no support for trainees,

02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:25.190
and basically make life hell for you.

02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:26.160
So you can drive
- It happens.

02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:27.390
- a cab in Baltimore,

02:40:27.390 --> 02:40:30.150
and call yourself a full
professor at Hopkins, truthfully,

02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:32.200
but you may not have no ability

02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:34.710
to get anything done.
- I'm sure they're out there.

02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:35.950
- But yeah, I remember one of the things

02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:36.830
this colleague has said,

02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:39.917
who's is successful, but left on top said,

02:40:39.917 --> 02:40:40.750
"I really don't know

02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:42.210
that I'm making a
difference in the world?"

02:40:42.210 --> 02:40:45.010
And she did some great memory research

02:40:46.213 --> 02:40:47.470
and connected to drugs,

02:40:47.470 --> 02:40:48.520
also connected to aging.

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:52.760
But she said, "I don't feel the impact

02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:55.380
of what I'm doing in the real world".

02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:56.773
Unfortunately, there,
for a lot of academia,

02:40:56.773 --> 02:40:59.380
what we do, it stays in the ivory tower.

02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:00.430
The world is a...

02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:02.550
- Not anymore.
- It's a beautiful,

02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:03.510
but messed up place,
[Dr. Huberman laughs]

02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:05.342
and a lot of this doesn't disseminate,

02:41:05.342 --> 02:41:06.780
- [Dr. Huberman] Right.

02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:08.550
- because of the various structures,

02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:09.820
the way the world is set up.

02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:12.430
And thankfully, this...

02:41:12.430 --> 02:41:15.770
I mean, because the work that our group,

02:41:15.770 --> 02:41:18.690
as well as a few others around the world,

02:41:18.690 --> 02:41:19.590
over the last 20 years,

02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:22.010
it's like you do have an emerging

02:41:22.010 --> 02:41:23.750
psychedelic startup industry now

02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:25.130
with billions of dollars of investment.

02:41:25.130 --> 02:41:29.050
And yeah, that's going to
turn into both good and bad.

02:41:29.050 --> 02:41:30.650
You know, it's upping the ante.

02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:31.560
There's going to be a lot of good

02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:33.010
and bad that comes from that,
- Sure.

02:41:33.010 --> 02:41:35.810
- but any new technology
is going to result in that.

02:41:35.810 --> 02:41:37.790
But we've got psilocybin

02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:39.860
designated for two separate entities

02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:42.350
as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA,

02:41:42.350 --> 02:41:43.183
and people may not realize,

02:41:43.183 --> 02:41:45.670
and the MDMA is designated

02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:48.600
as a breakthrough therapy for PTSD.

02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:50.040
This is a really big deal.

02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:51.510
That's a very high...

02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:56.370
I mean, pharma companies
would pay millions of dollars

02:41:56.370 --> 02:41:59.590
to get their new drug a
designation like that.

02:41:59.590 --> 02:42:00.423
And what it means,

02:42:00.423 --> 02:42:02.200
is early research is showing,

02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:05.130
saying it shows a high
potential for treating disorders

02:42:05.130 --> 02:42:07.203
that don't have very good treatments.

02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:12.330
And we're probably, again, a
few years away from both MDMA,

02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:14.070
probably a year or two,
after that psilocybin,

02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:18.320
and being treated for PTSD
and depression respectively.

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.870
You know, we have to wait
for the Phase 3 studies,

02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:23.010
but if the results hold up...

02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:25.380
Even if the effect size is halved

02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:26.930
of what we're seeing now,

02:42:26.930 --> 02:42:29.020
it's still going to be a lot larger

02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.230
than what you're seeing with
the traditional medications.

02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:33.790
And so it's going to be
approved, if the data hold up,

02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:36.200
and it probably will from my judgment.

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:39.230
So I feel like what I'm doing

02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:42.560
is actually having a
positive impact in the world

02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:43.393
in a way that...

02:42:43.393 --> 02:42:46.050
And I feel lucky that I
got interested in an area

02:42:46.050 --> 02:42:48.810
that happens to plug
into a place in the world

02:42:48.810 --> 02:42:51.500
where there is that opportunity,

02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:53.400
where some great colleagues

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:54.830
and friends are focused on areas

02:42:54.830 --> 02:42:58.240
where I wish they had the opportunity

02:42:58.240 --> 02:42:59.730
for their work to be disseminated.

02:42:59.730 --> 02:43:02.100
I mean, I was lucky to be interviewed

02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:04.450
on "60 Minutes" because of this work.

02:43:04.450 --> 02:43:06.010
And I was like, oh, my
god, I know so many...

02:43:06.010 --> 02:43:09.080
There's a bit of imposter syndrome,

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:11.550
like, oh, my god, I
know so many scientists

02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:15.310
that deserve, more so than me, to be,

02:43:15.310 --> 02:43:18.070
had that level of exposure.

02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:20.713
But if you happen to
be in that place where,

02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:24.980
you got to do your best to make it work,

02:43:24.980 --> 02:43:26.560
to take advantage of that luck,

02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:30.130
and that intersection of
the world, and to push it.

02:43:30.130 --> 02:43:30.963
I've been lucky,

02:43:30.963 --> 02:43:33.960
but I also did take a bit
of a leap of faith early on.

02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:37.370
I did have some advisors
that told me, like,

02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:39.790
you've got a really
promising pedigree early on,

02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:41.610
like, are you sure you want to focus

02:43:41.610 --> 02:43:43.380
much time on this psychedelic stuff?

02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:44.940
- Yeah, you've embraced risk.

02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:46.290
I mean, I think that...

02:43:46.290 --> 02:43:50.120
I mean, the world's changed
since, in 2020, certainly,

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:53.860
but channels like social media, podcasts,

02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:54.990
and things of that sort,

02:43:54.990 --> 02:43:56.810
your exposure is

02:43:56.810 --> 02:43:59.120
because people are
interested in these topics,

02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.810
and that's why people, like myself,

02:44:00.810 --> 02:44:03.200
are interested in talking to you.

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:05.360
I mean at Stanford,

02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:08.410
there are now a few labs
starting to explore psychedelics,

02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:10.590
more at the mechanistic level,

02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:12.300
so in animal models.

02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:13.523
Some excellent labs.

02:44:14.472 --> 02:44:16.430
But also, I can imagine,

02:44:16.430 --> 02:44:18.610
because of the pioneering work
that you've done at Hopkins,

02:44:18.610 --> 02:44:20.920
it'll start to become more common.

02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:23.560
I'm certain that people are
going to have questions about

02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:26.033
how to get in contact
with you and learn more.

02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:30.993
If people have trauma, PTSD, depression,

02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:35.230
it's likely that they're
going start seeking ways

02:44:35.230 --> 02:44:36.810
in which they can potentially

02:44:36.810 --> 02:44:38.373
participate in clinical trials.

02:44:39.210 --> 02:44:41.360
You're very active on Twitter.

02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:42.280
Active, I should say.

02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:43.380
You've got other obligations,

02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:45.130
but where you are active on social media,

02:44:45.130 --> 02:44:46.380
you're active on Twitter.

02:44:47.741 --> 02:44:50.000
It's @drug_researcher,

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.007
correct?
- Right, right.

02:44:51.007 --> 02:44:51.980
Right.
- Okay.

02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:54.630
So get-
- It's drug_researcher,

02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:55.793
that's how to find me.

02:44:55.793 --> 02:44:57.293
- A great account, by the way.

02:44:58.450 --> 02:45:01.090
Matthew and I recently
got into a dialogue there

02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:03.410
about some of the deeper
effects of psychedelics

02:45:03.410 --> 02:45:05.820
in the literature versus
how they're being discussed

02:45:05.820 --> 02:45:07.500
in the general public.

02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:08.550
I follow his account,

02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:10.350
and it's a really wonderful account for

02:45:10.350 --> 02:45:13.770
whether or not you have a
science background or not.

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:15.120
If people are...

02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:16.450
And I'm going to try and persuade you

02:45:16.450 --> 02:45:17.990
to be more active on Instagram,

02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.823
but I don't know

02:45:18.823 --> 02:45:19.656
if I'll succeed in that.
[Dr. Matthew laughs]

02:45:19.656 --> 02:45:20.500
- I'll try to get my

02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:21.333
Instagram game going on.
- You're a busy guy,

02:45:21.333 --> 02:45:22.166
and I get it.

02:45:22.166 --> 02:45:23.087
I'm running a lab too.

02:45:23.087 --> 02:45:23.920
I get it.

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:25.628
You're busy.

02:45:25.628 --> 02:45:29.090
Drug_researcher there as well.
- The same handle, huh?

02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:30.700
- The same handle.

02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:33.550
Your lab at Hopkins is pretty
straightforward to find

02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:35.330
through a Google Search of your name,

02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:37.760
Matthew Johnson, Johns Hopkins University.

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:39.300
Are there portals for people

02:45:40.839 --> 02:45:42.840
to explore clinical trials,

02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:45.100
participation in clinical
trials of various kinds?

02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:46.830
- Yeah, and so in our group,

02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:50.320
so you go to Hopkinspsychedelic.org.

02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:51.550
That's the website.

02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:52.780
And if you can't remember that,

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:53.970
just Johns Hopkins

02:45:53.970 --> 02:45:54.830
psychedelic.
- We will provide a link.

02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:55.663
Yeah, we will provide a link.
- Yeah,

02:45:55.663 --> 02:45:57.430
and you're going to find us.

02:45:57.430 --> 02:45:59.330
It'll be the first thing that pops up.

02:45:59.330 --> 02:46:00.540
And we have...

02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:03.220
Trust me, if we have a study on something,

02:46:03.220 --> 02:46:04.840
it's going to be on that website.

02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:06.430
- That means-
[interposing voices]

02:46:06.430 --> 02:46:07.320
They're being very polite,

02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:09.490
so I will be a little bit
more aggressive, and say,

02:46:09.490 --> 02:46:11.070
don't email him directly.

02:46:11.070 --> 02:46:12.530
He won't see that email.

02:46:12.530 --> 02:46:14.620
Wait until there's a posting for a study,

02:46:14.620 --> 02:46:15.580
and then sign up through

02:46:15.580 --> 02:46:16.440
the correct portal.
- Right.

02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:18.310
And I try to get back to those emails,

02:46:18.310 --> 02:46:22.150
but frankly, and it's 'cause I'm lucky

02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:23.710
the area has taken off so much,

02:46:23.710 --> 02:46:26.064
but there are many days
where I simply get so many

02:46:26.064 --> 02:46:27.440
- Well, you have to do-
- requests that I can't

02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:28.920
get through my day.
- You have to do the research.

02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:31.070
- Yeah, if I answer all the...

02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:32.470
So yeah, trust me.

02:46:32.470 --> 02:46:34.290
And something that a
lot of folks don't get,

02:46:34.290 --> 02:46:35.910
and being in academia like we are,

02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:38.060
it's easy to forget how people don't,

02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:40.210
understandably, don't realize this.

02:46:40.210 --> 02:46:42.430
This is experimental research.

02:46:42.430 --> 02:46:45.590
It's FDA-approved as an experiment,

02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:47.950
so we're working towards
formal FDA approval

02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:49.100
for straight up clinical use.

02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:51.520
But right now, someone
can't bring me a case

02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:56.180
of some idiosyncratic thing, and say,

02:46:56.180 --> 02:46:58.170
I'm suffering from this
complex constellation,

02:46:58.170 --> 02:46:59.530
like depression-
- You're not a clinician.

02:46:59.530 --> 02:47:00.363
- Yeah, I'm not...

02:47:00.363 --> 02:47:02.150
And even if I was,

02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:05.210
I wouldn't be able to
treat them with psilocybin,

02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:10.210
or to send them anywhere
that was legal to take it.

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:14.520
So if we're going to be treating you,

02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:15.353
it has to be,

02:47:15.353 --> 02:47:17.190
or anyone else in the United States,

02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:19.320
or most other countries for that matter,

02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:20.760
it's going to have to be under the guise

02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:22.710
of a very specific protocol.

02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:26.290
This number of milligrams to treat PTSD,

02:47:26.290 --> 02:47:28.120
to treat major depressive disorder,

02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:32.980
to treat, treatment resistant
tobacco use disorder,

02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:34.970
so nicotine addiction.

02:47:34.970 --> 02:47:36.490
Very specific studies.

02:47:36.490 --> 02:47:38.560
This is not one-off treatment.

02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:41.840
And folks say, like, oh, I can
pay to go out to Baltimore.

02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.630
Well, my son has this complex.

02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:47.920
And they're tragic cases, but you...

02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:50.700
So if you're interested in
a study, go to our website.

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:53.150
If it's not on their website,

02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:54.520
we don't have a study on it.

02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:56.060
There are going to be forthcoming studies.

02:47:56.060 --> 02:47:57.360
So I'm going to be starting studies

02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:59.720
on opioid addiction and PTSD,

02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:02.133
and an LSD study for chronic pain.

02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:05.610
The day that those are
open for recruitment,

02:48:05.610 --> 02:48:06.940
they're going to be up on our website.

02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:07.773
- Great.
- So that's where

02:48:07.773 --> 02:48:09.007
you look to see everything.

02:48:09.007 --> 02:48:11.270
And in fact, I just recently,
a couple of days ago,

02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:12.570
put up a couple of surveys studies,

02:48:12.570 --> 02:48:15.370
also where we post a
link to our survey study.

02:48:15.370 --> 02:48:17.660
So if you've had psychedelics,

02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:20.910
and you've taken them for
therapeutic intent for PTSD,

02:48:20.910 --> 02:48:22.690
or for depression, or anxiety,

02:48:22.690 --> 02:48:23.590
you can find a link.

02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:25.770
And also, if you've done
breath work for those reasons,

02:48:25.770 --> 02:48:28.580
we have a link for a study
of that type up there now,

02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:30.230
which is a holotropic-style,

02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:32.150
a very psychedelic-type
- Interesting.

02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:33.900
- of breathing technique

02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:37.190
that can lead to some of
these similar experiences.

02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:38.050
So it's up there.

02:48:38.050 --> 02:48:40.510
More broadly, outside of our group,

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:41.640
'cause there's a growing number

02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:43.720
of groups in the US doing this,

02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:45.590
and in Europe doing this research,

02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:49.310
but you can go to Clinicaltrials.gov,

02:48:49.310 --> 02:48:54.310
and if you look in for the
main search term of psilocybin,

02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:56.350
or MDMA, or psychedelic,

02:48:56.350 --> 02:48:58.110
plug in those terms,

02:48:58.110 --> 02:49:00.190
you can get a list of the growing number.

02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:03.940
I mean, I think there's over 40, maybe.

02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:04.773
It's been awhile.

02:49:04.773 --> 02:49:05.670
There might be over 50 now.

02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:06.503
I don't know.

02:49:06.503 --> 02:49:08.970
But studies with just psilocybin going on

02:49:08.970 --> 02:49:10.980
right now on Clinicaltrials.gov.

02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:13.880
So check out Clinicaltrials.gov
to see what's going on.

02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:15.210
But it's going to be...

02:49:15.210 --> 02:49:17.510
If you're going to do anything legal,

02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:20.360
it's going to be in the context
of a very specific study.

02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:22.650
It's not going to be one-off treatment.

02:49:22.650 --> 02:49:23.907
- Right, and I should say,
- Yeah.

02:49:23.907 --> 02:49:25.220
- and not just legal,

02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:29.010
but also supported in the right framework

02:49:29.010 --> 02:49:30.330
that you described,

02:49:30.330 --> 02:49:32.130
of having a team, et cetera.

02:49:32.130 --> 02:49:34.732
Obviously, people will
do what they will do.

02:49:34.732 --> 02:49:37.690
[interposing voices]
- And if-

02:49:37.690 --> 02:49:39.600
- Oh, yeah, go ahead.
- I will say, if people...

02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:41.680
I never encourage people
to take drugs of any...

02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:43.010
I don't encourage caffeine use.

02:49:43.010 --> 02:49:44.580
Every drug has its risk,

02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:45.413
you know?
- I encourage

02:49:45.413 --> 02:49:46.590
my own caffeine use,

02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:47.840
but nobody else's.
- Yeah.

02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:48.673
I'm drinking up right now.

02:49:48.673 --> 02:49:49.810
This is great.
- Yeah,

02:49:49.810 --> 02:49:51.063
this is a very strong maté.

02:49:51.063 --> 02:49:52.210
It's what we're drinking.

02:49:52.210 --> 02:49:54.640
It has not lead to a alteration,

02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:56.620
in my perception, of self

02:49:56.620 --> 02:49:58.410
to the extent that we
talked about earlier.

02:49:58.410 --> 02:50:00.170
However, this conversation,

02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:02.020
was a good example

02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:04.000
of how we can enter a perceptual bubble.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:07.210
I learned so much about psychedelics,

02:50:07.210 --> 02:50:08.650
and the future of this

02:50:08.650 --> 02:50:10.390
for the sake of mental health,

02:50:10.390 --> 02:50:12.093
and other aspects of health.

02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:15.143
Matt, thank you so much

02:50:15.143 --> 02:50:15.976
- Thank you, Andrew.
- for your time,

02:50:15.976 --> 02:50:16.809
for your knowledge.

02:50:16.809 --> 02:50:18.960
And I think you put it best earlier,

02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:22.060
for holding the candle
in a very dark time,

02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:24.750
and then now, there's light.

02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:25.730
- Thank you.

02:50:25.730 --> 02:50:27.290
Well, thanks for helping
to spread that light,

02:50:27.290 --> 02:50:30.330
and I really appreciate
what you've been doing.

02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:33.320
This is a great, great medium
that you have going on.

02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:35.123
So thank you for doing it.

02:50:35.123 --> 02:50:36.730
- It's my pleasure.

02:50:36.730 --> 02:50:37.563
Thank you.

02:50:37.563 --> 02:50:38.520
Thank you for joining me

02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:41.530
for my conversation with
Dr. Matthew Johnson.

That's a terrific way

In addition, many of you have
questions about supplements.

02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:12.690
We've partnered with Thorne.

02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:15.700
That's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:18.120
because Thorne has the
highest quality standards

02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:19.600
with respect to the

02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:21.460
quality of ingredients
in their supplements,

02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:23.760
as well as precision about the amounts

02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:25.910
of those ingredients
within their supplements.

02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:30.080
If you go to Thorne.com/U/Huberman,

02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:32.250
you can see all the
supplements that I take,

02:51:32.250 --> 02:51:34.590
and you can get 20% off

that you find on the Thorne site.

02:51:39.330 --> 02:51:41.810
So if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

02:51:41.810 --> 02:51:44.520
excuse me, thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:48.090
you'll get 20% off any of the
products that Thorne makes.

02:51:48.090 --> 02:51:49.360

02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:51.633
