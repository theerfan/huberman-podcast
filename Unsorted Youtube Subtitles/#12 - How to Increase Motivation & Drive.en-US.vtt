00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.600
where we discuss science

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.680
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.560
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.400
and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.600
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.800
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.280
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.800
It is however, part of my desire

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.360
and effort to bring you zero
cost to consumer information

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.520
about science and science related tools,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.840
along those lines I'd like to thank

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.160
the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.560
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.880
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.320
mineral probiotic drink.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.240
and so I'm delighted that
they're a sponsor of the podcast.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.480
because I found it rather dizzying

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.800
to know which vitamins
and minerals to take

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
and Athletic Greens covers all my bases

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.240
for vitamins and minerals.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.800
It also includes probiotics
and there are now a lot

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
of data supporting the fact
that probiotics are important

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.120
for the gut brain access, for immunity

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.560
for metabolic health, endocrine
health, many, many things.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.320
So I take Athletic Greens once,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.440
sometimes twice a day

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.000
I mix it with water and a
little bit of lemon juice

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.160
and to me it tastes delicious.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.760
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.880
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.640
and if you do that they'll also give

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.760
you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.120
There are a lot of data now showing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.480
that vitamin D3 is important

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.080
for immune function and a number

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.160
of other important biological processes.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.800
In addition, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.880
you'll get five free travel packs,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.560
travel packs make it easy to mix up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.640
Athletic Greens when you're in the car,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.040
on the plane or generally on the road.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.240
So that's Athletic Greens.com
to get Athletic Greens.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.560
The year supply of vitamin D3 and K2

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.920
and the five free travel packs.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.840
Our second sponsor of
today's podcast is Headspace.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.720
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.240
I've been meditating on and
off since I was 16 years old.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.440
I'm 45 now.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.560
So that's about 30 years
of on and off meditation

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.520
and I confess most of
that time it was off,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280
meaning I find it really hard to stick

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.560
to a meditation practice.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.960
A few years ago I discovered Headspace

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.240
while flying on JetBlue flights

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.720
'cause at that time they
were offering Headspace

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.440
as something you could watch
instead of TV or movies.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960
And it made me feel great.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.400
I'd find that I arrived

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.120
where I was going, more
rested, more relaxed

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.080
and I got the Headspace app
and I started using it daily

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.000
and I've continued to use it daily.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.120
Headspace has a large
number of meditations

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400
all supported by science.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.280
There's also now just a
tremendous amount of science

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.200
supporting a meditation practice

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.320
for all sorts of things
like improved sleep,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.440
reduced impulsivity, improved cognition.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.160
There are just a myriad of
positive effects of meditation.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.280
The hardest thing is doing it

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280
and Headspace makes that easy.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.960
If you wanna try the Headspace app

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.440
and all the meditations
they have, you can go

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.480
to headspace.com/special
offer, and you'll get

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.040
one month completely free
of all the meditations

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.800
they have that's
headspace.com/special offer to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.960
get one month free of Headspace.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.840
The third sponsor of today's
podcast is magic spoon.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.520
Magic spoon is a low carb,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.440
grain-free keto friendly cereal.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.640
As I've mentioned a few
times before on this podcast

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.640
the way I eat throughout
the day has everything to do

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.200
with when I wanna be alert
and when I wanna be sleepy.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.560
So in the first part of the day

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.160
I fast because that enhances alertness.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.280
Then I eat keto.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.480
So my lunch and my afternoon
meals are ketogenic

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160
and then in the evening I eat starches

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.120
and vegetables because those
aid the transition to sleep.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.800
So for me, magic spoon as a
keto cereal is a great snack.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.920
It's really tasty.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.680
I don't actually mix mine with milk.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.800
I just eat it directly.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.080
They have a bunch of different flavors.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.320
I like the frosted flavor also

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.680
because it tastes like donuts.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.480
And I have a pastry affliction
and I love pastries.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.280
So magic spoon allows me to remain

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.200
on keto during the day it's healthy.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.080
It tastes great.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.360
I really enjoy it.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.800
So if you wanna try magic spoon

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.360
you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.520
for a variety pack of different flavors.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.360
And if you put Huberman at checkout

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.680
you'll get 5 dollars off the variety pack.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.200
That's magicspoon.com/huberman
to try a variety pack

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.120
of different flavors of magic spoon keto

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.800
grain-free low carb cereal

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.280
put "Huberman" at checkout
you get 5 dollars off.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.320
A quick note before we
begin today's discussion

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.400
about the neuroscience of motivation.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.320
I'm pleased to announce

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.280
that we have now captioned episodes one

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.960
and two in Spanish and
soon, all the episodes

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.040
of the Huberman Lab
Podcast will be captioned

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.720
on YouTube in Spanish.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.400
We've used some of the revenue

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.040
from the podcast to
hire expert captioners.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.800
So it should be accurate.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.320
You might catch a mistake here

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.680
or there a dialect
difference from time to time

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.800
but by our read and by our experts reads,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.800
it's all accurate.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.080
So we're very pleased that
people who speak Spanish

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.960
and digest information
best in Spanish can now

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.520
digest the information
here on the podcast.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.440
Thanks to everyone for
supporting the podcast

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.160
which allows us to broaden
our reach in these ways

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.360
and we do hope to expand

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.640
to other languages in
the very near future.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.840
This month, we're talking all

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.920
about the neuroscience of emotions

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.240
and today we're going to
talk about an extremely

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.360
important topic that
central to our daily life

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.960
and that's motivation.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.600
We're going to talk about
pleasure and reward.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.080
What underlies our sense
of pleasure or reward.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.640
We're going to talk about addictions.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.240
You can't have a discussion about pleasure

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.360
and reward without having a
discussion about addictions

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.840
and the addictive properties
of certain substances

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840
as well as how to break free of addiction.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.480
As well we're going to talk

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.560
about the neurochemistry
of drive and mindset.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.480
So all these themes are woven together

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.160
in the context of emotions.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.520
Each one of them of course could also

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.920
be its own entire month of the podcast

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.200
and in fact, we are going to have

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.160
an entire month devoted to addiction

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.440
and I have a very special guest

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.480
that's going to be joining us

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.080
to talk about the science

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.520
and clinical practices
that we know are important

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.600
for understanding and treating addiction.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.560
But for now, let's just
talk about the neuroscience

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.240
of motivation and reward
of pleasure and pain

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.200
because those are central to
what we think of as emotions

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.240
whether or not we feel good,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.080
whether or not we feel
we're on track in life

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.920
whether or not we feel
we're falling behind.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.560
So motivation is fundamental
to our daily life.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.800
It's what allows us to get
out of bed in the morning.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.200
It's what allows us to
pursue long-term goals

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.240
or short-term goals,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.320
motivation and the chemistry of motivation

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.440
is tightly wound in with the
neurochemistry of movement.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.040
In fact, the same single
molecule ,dopamine

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.600
is responsible for our sense of motivation

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.440
and for movement, even though
nerves controlling muscles.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.280
So again, these are
nerves in the spinal cord

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.120
or brain that move our
limbs, the effector chemical

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.960
they're the one that actually
causes the muscles to

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.560
twitch to contract, is a
CDOT Colleen in the brain.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.640
Acetylcholine is responsible for focus.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.960
However, whether or not we move,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.720
whether or not we want to move

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.520
whether or not we have the
desire to overcome barriers of

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.960
they could be social barriers

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.520
or financial barriers or time constraints.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.040
That depends on this molecule.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.920
We call dopamine, it's
a fascinating molecule

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.520
and it lies at the center of
so many great things in life

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.280
and it lies at the center

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.280
of so many terrible aspects of life

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.840
namely addiction and certain
forms of mental disease.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.680
So if ever there was a double-edged blade

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.240
in the world of
neuroscience it's dopamine.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.240
So let's talk about what dopamine is

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.160
and as always we are going to talk

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.520
about actionable tools today.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.120
We're definitely gonna talk about

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.960
some things related to supplementation.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.880
Although you might be surprised to learn

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.200
that it's not all just
about increasing dopamine

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.360
and in particular, in some cases

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.120
that's the wrong thing to do.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.200
Sometimes it's appropriate
sometimes it's not.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.120
More so we're going to
talk about tools related

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680
to what's called dopamine scheduling, how

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.200
the way that you're leading your life

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.440
and the way that you're
conceptualizing your goals

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.200
can actually predict whether

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.520
or not you're going to
continue to pursue those goals.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.800
And therefore whether

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.360
or not you will succeed
in achieving those goals

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.360
As well as whether or not you will quit.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.320
There's a fundamental relationship between

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.240
dopamine released in your brain

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.480
and your desire to exert effort.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.040
And you can actually control the schedule

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.000
of dopamine release

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.480
but it requires the appropriate knowledge.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.920
This is one of those cases where

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.320
understanding the way
the dopamine system works

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.560
will allow you to leverage
it to your benefit.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.280
And if you don't understand
the way that dopamine works

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.360
there's a good chance that it's going

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.760
to pull you out into the current of life.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.760
Meaning the rest of the world is going

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.680
to control your dopamine schedules.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.680
So I'm excited to tell you
about today's information.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.960
You're gonna learn some basic science.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.480
You're gonna learn a lot of tools

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.080
and these tools I believe are applicable

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.840
whether or not you're five years old

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.960
eight years old, 80 years
older, anything in between.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.640
So let's talk about dopamine.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.040
Let's get a few basic facts on the table.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.560
Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.960
and it was discovered as the
precursor, meaning the thing

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.640
from which epinephrin
or adrenaline is made.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.880
Now that's fundamentally important

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.760
because this molecule we
call dopamine nowadays,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.960
we think of as the molecule
of reward and pleasure,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.920
but actually it is the substrate

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.200
from which adrenaline
is made and in the brain

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.680
it's the substrate from
which epinephrin is

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.160
made epinephrin is the
same thing as adrenaline

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.920
except in the brain we call it epinephrin.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.360
Epinephrin as you may recall
from previous podcasts,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.520
or if you haven't no problem epinephrin

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.880
allows us to get into action.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.760
It stimulates changes in the
blood vessels, in the heart

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.800
in the organs and tissues

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.760
of the body that bias us for movement.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.000
And if you'd like to learn
more about epinephrin

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.520
you can check out our
episode on mastering stress.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.800
We talk a lot about it there.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.520
Dopamine was initially thought to be just

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.200
the building block for epinephrin.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.280
And it is indeed the
chemical building block

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.520
from which epinephrin is made.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.080
However, dopamine does a
lot of things on its own.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.320
It's not always converted to epinephrin.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.120
Dopamine is released from several sites

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.000
in the brain and body, but
perhaps the most important one

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.920
for today's discussion about motivation

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.080
and reward is something
that sometimes just

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.160
called the reward pathway

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.000
for the it's sometimes called

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the mesolimbic reward pathway

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.480
but it's fundamentally important

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.360
to your desire to engage in action

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.240
and it's fundamentally important

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.400
for people getting addicted
to substances or behaviors.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.840
So how does this work?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.200
Well, you've got a structure

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.680
in the deep part of your
brain called the VTA.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.000
It stands for ventral tegmental area.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.080
As always you don't have
to remember these names,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.720
but if you want to I
offer them to you for food

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.520
further googling, research,
reading, et cetera,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.440
the VTA or ventral tegmental
area contains neurons that

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.480
send what we call axons little
wires that spit out dopamine

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.200
at a different structure
called the nucleus accumbens

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.400
and those two structures VTA
and nucleus accumbens form

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.080
really the core machinery
of the reward pathway

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.560
and the pathway that
controls your motivation

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.080
for anything you can think
of them like an accelerator

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.640
they bias you for action.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.240
However, within the reward
pathway, there's also a break

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.720
the break or restriction on that dopamine

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.320
which controls when it's released

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.440
and how much it's released
is the prefrontal cortex.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.000
The prefrontal cortex is
the neural real estate right

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.040
behind your forehead.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.000
It's discussed for so many
aspects of neuroscience.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.920
You hear about it for decision-making ,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.720
executive function ,for
planning, et cetera.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.480
And indeed it's responsible
for a lot of those.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.480
It's this really unique real estate

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.640
that we were all endowed with as humans,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.920
other animals don't have much of it.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.440
We have a lot of it

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.120
and that prefrontal cortex acts

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.280
as a brake on the dopamine system

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.160
without that break you would be purely

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
a pleasure seeking animal.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.920
You would be purely pleasure seeking.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.240
You would have no basis for
regulating your behavior

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.680
in terms of trying to get
things that make you feel good.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.920
And that brings us to the
important feature of motivation

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.720
which is that motivation
is a two-part process

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.840
which is about balancing
pleasure and pain.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.400
Okay. Most people think about motivation

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.080
and reward and dopamine is just
trying to achieve pleasure.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.400
And indeed dopamine is released

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.040
in the brain from the VTA
at the* nucleus accumbens.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.920
When we experience things that we like.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.800
So here's the way to conceptualize this

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800
and if you can internalize
this in your mind

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.200
it will really help you as
you move through your day

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.120
trying to understand why
you might be motivated

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.200
or not motivated for certain things.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.360
So when you're just sitting
around, not doing much

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.520
of anything, maybe you wake
up in bed in the morning.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.680
You're thinking about getting up or not.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.280
This reward pathway is releasing dopamine

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.720
at a rate of about three
or four times per second.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.160
It's kind of firing in a low level.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.640
When I say firing me an electrical
activity in the neurons.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.840
So when you're just around,
you feel okay, not depressed

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.080
not highly motivated, not excited

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.000
maybe three or four times a second.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.360
If suddenly you get
excited about something

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.560
you anticipate something,
not receive an award

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.440
but you get excited in
an anticipatory way.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.080
Then the rate of firing
the rate of activity

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.320
in this reward pathway suddenly increases

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.720
to like 30 or 40 times

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.680
and it has the effect of creating a sense

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.360
of action or desire to move

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.600
in the direction of the
thing that you're craving.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.280
In fact, it's fair to say
that dopamine is responsible

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.280
for wanting and for craving,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.040
and that's distinctly different

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.120
from the way that you hear
it talked about normally

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.800
which is that it's involved in pleasure.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.160
So yes, dopamine is
released in response to sex.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.680
It's released in response to food.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.240
It's released in response
to a lot of things

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.200
but it's mostly released in anticipation

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.440
and craving for a particular thing.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.000
It has the effect of narrowing our focus

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.840
for the thing that we crave

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.160
and that thing could be as
simple as a cup of coffee.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.040
It could be as important
as a big board meeting.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.320
It could be a big, final exam.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.640
It could be a, the person
that we're excited to meet

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.320
or see dopamine doesn't care
about what you're craving.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.320
It just releases at a particular rate.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.040
In fact, if we just take a step back

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.200
and we look at the scientific data

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.760
on how much the dopamine
firing increases in response

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.720
to different things, you get
a pretty interesting window

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.560
into how your brain works

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.200
and why you might be
motivated or not motivated.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.840
Let's say you're hungry,
or you're looking forward

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.600
to a cup of coffee, or you're
going to see your partner.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.520
Well, your dopamine neurons
are firing at a low rate

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.240
until you start thinking
about the thing that you want

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.760
or the thing that you're
looking forward to

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.240
let's say you're craving chocolate

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.080
or a good meal, a steak

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.720
if you like steak or a nice plate of pasta

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.000
if you like pasta, when you eat that food

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.760
the amount of dopamine that's released

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.920
in this reward pathway goes
up about 50% above baseline.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.840
The neurons there go from firing,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.040
three or four times per second to,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.480
six or 10 times per second.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.440
It really depends

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.880
and these aren't exact numbers.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.160
But if we were to measure the amount

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.320
of dopamine that's released, it goes

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.320
up about 50 points, all right.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.440
Sex, which is fundamental

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.640
to our species, continuation
and reproduction.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.120
Although it doesn't have to
be for conceiving children.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.920
Sex does release dopamine

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.880
and it increases dopamine
levels about a hundred percent.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.240
So basically doubles them.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.000
Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.520
or some people are taking nicotine

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.240
in supplemental form increases the amount

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.600
of dopamine about 150% above baseline.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.120
It also does some other
things that we're gonna

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.480
talk about, but nicotine does that

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.440
and it's kind of interesting

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.880
that nicotine would increase the amount

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.560
of dopamine in your brain
very quick, within seconds

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.160
that's 150 times over
baseline as opposed to sex

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.360
which is a 100 percent
above or food which is 50%.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.960
Cocaine and amphetamine
increase the amount

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.600
of dopamine that's
released a thousand fold

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.160
within about 10 seconds
of consuming the drug.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.280
However, just thinking about food,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.560
about sex, about nicotine

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.640
if you like nicotine or cocaine

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.960
or amphetamine can increase the amount

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.320
of dopamine that's released

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.080
to the same degree as
actually consuming the drug.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.640
Now it depends in some cases, for instance

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.920
the cocaine user, the
addict that wants cocaine

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.320
can't just think about
cocaine and increase

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.320
the amount of that's
released about a thousand

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.920
fold is actually much lower

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.560
but it's just enough to put
them on the motivation track

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.880
for it to crave that particular thing.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.400
Now, there are reasons why you would

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.680
have brain circuitry like this.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.560
I mean, brain circuitry

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.720
like this didn't evolve
to get you addicted

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.440
brain circuitry like this evolved

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.240
in order to motivate behaviors

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.520
toward particular goals,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.960
water when you're thirsty ,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.400
sex in order to reproduce

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.240
and we're gonna talk
about the relationship

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.800
between estrogen and testosterone
and the dopamine system

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.160
because those hormones actually

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
bias dopamine to be released.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.680
These things and these
brain areas in neurons

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.880
were part of the
evolutionary history that led

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.560
to the continuation of our species.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.400
Things like cocaine and
amphetamine are disastrous

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.440
for most people because
they really so much dopamine

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.520
and they create these
closed loops where people

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.600
then only crave the particular
thing, cocaine, amphetamine

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.400
that leads to those massive
amounts of dopamine release.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.360
Most things don't release
that level of dopamine.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.800
Now, nowadays there's a ton

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.240
of interest in social
media and in video games

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.960
and there have been some measurements

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.680
of the amount of dopamine
released video games

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.400
especially video games
have a very high update

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.800
speed where there's novel
territory all the time

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.600
not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.280
Those can release dopamine somewhere

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.520
between nicotine and cocaine.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.520
So very high levels of dopamine release.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.560
Social media is an interesting one

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.840
because the amount of dopamine

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.600
that's released in response to logging

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.560
onto social media initially
could be quite high

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.600
but it seems like likely that
there's a taper in the amount

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.640
of dopamine and yet
people still get addicted.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.440
So why, why is it that we can get addicted

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.440
to things that fail to get

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.280
to elicit the same massive amount

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.720
of pleasure that they initially did.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.920
Being addicted to
something isn't just about

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.360
the fact that it feels so good

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.120
that you wanna do it over and over again

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.640
and that's because of
this pleasure pain balance

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.000
that underlies motivation.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.200
So let's look a little bit closer

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.640
at the pleasure pain balance because

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.880
there in lies the tools

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.880
for you to be able to control motivation

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.840
toward healthy things and
avoid motivated behaviors

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.000
towards things that are
destructive for you.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.200
There are a lot of reasons why

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.200
people try novel behaviors

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.480
whether or not those are drugs or

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.480
whether or not those are adventure,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.880
thrill-seeking things or
they seek out new partners

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.160
they take a new class as you'll notice.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.920
I'm not placing any judgment

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.760
or value on these different behaviors.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.280
Although I think it's fair to point

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.040
out that for most people addictive drugs

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.080
like cocaine and amphetamine
are very destructive.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.280
Actually we know that about 15

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.280
to 20% of people have a genetic bias

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.720
towards addiction , you sometimes hear

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.400
that the first time that you use a drug

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.600
you can become addicted to it.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.960
That's actually not been shown
to be true for most things

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.520
in most people, but for some
people that actually is true.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520
And we'll talk a little
bit later about why

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.280
certain people are heavily
biased toward becoming addicts

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.840
on the first use of a particular drug.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.960
It's actually very interesting,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.640
it has everything to do with whether

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.280
or not they were formerly
addicted to something else

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.640
but in any case, the
way that addiction works

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.440
and the way that
motivation works generally

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.200
in the non-addictive setting is

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.720
that when you anticipate something

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.800
a little bit of dopamine
is released, and then

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.120
when you reach that thing,
you're engaged in that thing

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.560
the amount of dopamine
goes up even further

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.360
but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.760
and you repeatedly engage
with a particular thing

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.200
let's say you love running

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.880
or you love chocolate as
you eat a piece of chocolate

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.760
believe it or not, it tastes good

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.240
and then there's a shift away
from activation of dopamine.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.720
And there are other
chemicals that are released

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.600
that trigger a low level sense of pain.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.600
Now you might not feel it as physical pain

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.360
but the craving that you feel

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.160
is both one part dopamine

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.800
and one part, the mirror image of dopamine

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.080
which is the pain

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.480
or the craving for yet
another piece of chocolate.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.480
And this is a very important

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.480
and subtle feature of the dopamine system.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.240
That's not often discussed.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.000
People always talk about just as pleasure.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.120
You love social media.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.520
So it gives you dopamine.
And so you engage in that.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.280
You like chocolate, it releases dopamine.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:51.840
So you do that.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.320
But for every bit of
dopamine that's released

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.440
there's another circuit

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.440
in the brain that creates you can think

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.080
of it as kind of like a
downward deflection in pleasure.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.000
So you engage in something you really want

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.760
and there's an increase in pleasure.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.600
And then without you doing anything

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.960
there's a mirror image of that

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.040
which is a downward deflection in pleasure

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.320
which we're calling pain.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.840
So for every bit of pleasure

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.160
there is a mirror image experience

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.040
of pain and they overlap
in time very closely.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.720
So it's sometimes hard to sense this

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.120
but try it the next time you
eat something really delicious.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.920
You'll take a bite,

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.200
it tastes delicious

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.640
and part of the experience is
to want more of that thing.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.880
This is true for any
pleasureful experience.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.800
Now, the diabolical part
about dopamine is that

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.080
because it didn't evolve in
order to get you to indulge

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.760
in more and more and more of
something, what happens is

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.280
that initially you experience
an increase in pleasure

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.360
and you also experience this increase

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.520
in pain shortly after or woven in

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.960
with the pleasure that makes
you want more of that thing.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.680
But with each subsequent time

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.520
that you encounter that thing

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.280
that you pursue, the chocolate that

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.400
you pursue the lover
each time, the experience

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.840
of dopamine release and pleasure
is diminished a little bit.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.480
And the diabolical thing is

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.400
that the pain response
is increased a little bit

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.000
and this is best observed

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.160
in the context of drug seeking behavior.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160
The first time someone
decides to take cocaine

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.280
or amphetamine, they may
do it out of boredom.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.880
They may do it out of peer pressure.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.520
They may do it to relieve
some internal sense.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.120
Maybe they're bored, or
they're just excited.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.200
Maybe they're high in
novel novelty seeking.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.880
There are a lot of reasons why people

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.120
might try a drug far too many for us

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.040
to get into our parks here.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.720
Maybe they don't even wanna do it

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.240
but someone encourages them.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.560
They will experience a
huge dopamine release

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.800
and they will feel likely very good.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.120
However, the next time they take it

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.800
it won't feel quite as good.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.880
And it won't feel even
as good the third time

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.040
or the next time, but the amount of pain

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.200
the amount of craving that they experience

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.280
for the drug will increase over time.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.280
So much of our pursuit of pleasure

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.480
is simply to reduce the pain of craving.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.160
So the next time you
experienced something,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.280
you really like I don't wanna

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.400
take you out of that experience

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.280
but it's really important
that you notice this

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.200
that if there's something you really enjoy

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.520
part of that enjoyment is

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.880
about the anticipation and
wanting of more of that thing

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.160
and that's the pain system in action.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.240
And so we can distinguish between dopamine

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.160
which is really about
pleasure and dopamine

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.800
which is really about
motivation to pursue more

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.720
in order to relieve or
exclude future pain.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.760
Let me repeat that.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.240
Dopamine isn't as much
about pleasure, as much

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.240
as it is about motivation
and desire to pursue more

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.280
in order to reduce the amount of pain

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.600
and we are now talking about pain

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.520
as a psychological pain and a craving

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.120
although people that
miss a lover very badly

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.960
or that really crave a food very badly,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.880
or that are addicted to
a drug and can't access,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.240
it will experience that
as a physical craving

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.080
and a mental craving the body and brain

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.360
are linked in this way.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.360
It's almost, they'll
describe it as painful.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.800
They yearn for it.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.520
And I think the word yearning
is one that's very valuable

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.760
in this context, because yearning seems to

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.360
include a whole body experience
more than just wanting

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.880
which could just be up in the mind.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.200
So your desire for
something is proportional

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.280
to how pleasureful it is
to indulge in that thing

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.280
but also how much pain you experience when

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.480
you don't have it.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.120
And you can now start
to let your mind wander

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.880
into all sorts of examples of addictions

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.160
or things that you happen to like,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960
I'll use the example that
I sometimes use on here

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.400
which is my love of croissants.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.680
Although several of you pointed out

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.040
these are called croissant

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.800
but then it sounds like
I'm trying to speak French

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.720
and I always tried to
do that when I was a kid

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.400
and I went to a bilingual
school and it failed

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.440
then it's gonna fail now.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.720
So I'm gonna call them croissants.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.480
They're delicious.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.480
I love them a really good
one makes me wanna eat six.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.280
It's true.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.600
I have pretty good
impulse control, I think

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.920
but it makes me wanna eat six.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.840
I taste it and it tastes so delicious

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.080
and unless I really force
myself to experience

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.280
the taste of it in my mouth

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.360
and how flaky I'm getting
hungry for it right now

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.400
and delicious the croissant
is mostly the tastes

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.120
of that croissant makes me
want to eat more croissants.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.120
Now, eventually blood sugar goes up

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.560
satiety is reached, et cetera.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.440
What happens then?

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.760
What is satisfaction and satiety about?

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.760
Well, that's a separate neuromodulator.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.400
That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.240
It's about oxytocin.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.800
It's about a hormone system
that involves something

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.680
called prolactin.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.640
So we're gonna talk about

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.560
all of those in the book

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.400
"the Molecule of More" wonderful book

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.240
those were described as
the here and now molecules

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.960
the ones that allow you to
experience your sensations

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.320
and pleasure in the present

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.520
and for which the brain stops
projecting into the future.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.200
So now let's talk about craving

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.840
and these so-called here and now molecules

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.520
and how those engage in a kind

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.480
of push pull balance that
will allow you to not

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.600
just feel more motivated,
but also to enjoy the things

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.800
in life that you are pursuing
to a much greater degree.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.960
We have neurons in an area

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.080
of our brain called the raphe R-A-P-H-E

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.040
The raphe releases serotonin

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.720
at different places in the brain.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.760
Serotonin is the molecule of bliss

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.240
and contentment for what you already have.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.440
I've talked before about exteroception,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.320
exteroception is a focus
on the outside world,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.240
everything beyond the
confines of your skin.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.200
I've also talked about
interoception of focus

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.720
on things that are happening internally

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.920
within the confines of your skin.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.240
Dopamine and serotonin can be thought

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.040
of as related to extra reception.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.440
Dopamine makes us focused
on things outside us

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.320
that are beyond what we
call our personal space

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.000
where we actually have to move

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.800
and take action in order to achieve things

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.120
and serotonin in general has to do with

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.200
the things that are in our
immediate here and now,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.000
hence the description

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.920
of these as the here and now molecules.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.400
So it's interesting to
point out that the body

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.040
and the brain can direct its attention

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.800
towards things outside us or inside us

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.320
or split our attention between those.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.920
I talked about this in a previous podcast

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.280
but if you didn't see it, no problem.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.480
Just understand that dopamine biases us

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.640
toward thinking about what we don't have,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.280
whereas serotonin and some
of the related molecules

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.000
like the endocannabinoids
if you picked up on

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.080
the word cannabinoid,
yes it's like cannabis

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.680
because cannabis attaches to
endocannabinoids receptors

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.240
and the endocannabinoids
are receptors that

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.560
and chemicals that the
cannabinoids that you

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.360
naturally make that are involved
in things like forgetting.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.040
It's not a coincidence

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.600
that pot smokers don't have
the most terrific memory.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.360
You may know a few that
have great memories

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.000
but chances are, they would
have even better memories

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.520
if they weren't pot smokers

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.080
but you make these molecules that bind

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.240
to these receptors that
make you feel kinda blissed

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.640
out and content in the present.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.640
Those are receptors that exist in us

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.200
not for sake of consuming
THC or marijuana, but

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.120
for sake of binding of our
natural endogenous cannabinoids.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.320
So you've got these two systems

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.600
they're kind of like a push pull

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.120
and if you were to say in the book

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.680
or wherever you go there
you are Jon Kabat-Zinn talks

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.360
about this meditation practice.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.360
That's different than
most meditation practices

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.880
where you eat one almond

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.680
and you focus all of your
attention on the almond

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.680
the taste of the almond,
the texture of the almond.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.560
That's really a mindfulness practice

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.280
that's geared towards
trying to take a behavior

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.400
which is normally about
pursuit, normally feeding

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.920
as we were going to engage in
feeding because of dopamine

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.120
we pursue more of a food

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.720
because of that pleasure pain relationship

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.840
I talked about before the
focus on the one almond

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.840
or becoming very present

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.640
in any behavior that
normally would be a kind

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.280
of extra susceptive pursuit behavior

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.320
and bring it into the here

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.920
and now that's a mental
trick or a mental task

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.640
that the mindfulness
community has really embraced

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.280
in order to try

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.400
and create increased pleasure
for what you already have.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.640
It's really trying to accomplish a shift

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.600
from dopamine being released to serotonin

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.880
in the cannabinoid system,
being involved in that behavior.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.280
So if you're interested in mindfulness

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.280
which is something I've talked
about before in this podcast

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.920
and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.320
about the opposite of
mindfulness being mindlessness.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.920
Mindfulness is a vast space

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.920
that is a mindful practice that a lot

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.880
of people have engaged in.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.520
And indeed it can give
you deeper appreciation

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.280
for things that you already have.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.560
Dopamine has the quality

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.760
of making people kind of
rabidly in pursuit of things.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.800
Look at people who are high

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.640
on cocaine or amphetamine,
and they are almost

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.960
entirely extra receptive drugs
like marijuana, the opioids

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.160
anything that really hits
the serotonin system hard

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.000
tend to make people rather lethargic

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.600
and content to stay
exactly where they are.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.680
They don't wanna pursue much at all.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.240
Occasionally when people
smoke marijuana or consume THC

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.520
their appetite goes way up

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.200
and they really wanna consume food.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.160
That's because of its effects
on insulin and its effects

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.880
on blood sugar, which is a
slightly separate matter.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.120
But since some of you, probably your minds

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.080
might've gone to those either experiences

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.440
or reports of what pot does,
that's why it does that.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.600
So you've got these molecules

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.120
like dopamine that make you focused

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.200
on the things you want
and the things you crave.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.440
And then you've got the
molecules that make you content

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.240
with what you have.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.680
So the most important thing,
perhaps in creating a healthy

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.760
emotional landscape is to have a balance

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.080
between these two neuromodulator systems

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.160
people that are always in anticipation

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.640
and desire and seeking that's
wonderful for pursuing goals.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.040
However, it's terrible for enjoying life

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.560
and actually those
people are actually quite

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.600
difficult to be around.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.240
There's a certain, almost
sociopathic element

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.040
to people who are what they
call hyper dopaminergic.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.280
People who are always on
the dopaminergic scale

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.200
to the point where they
are always pursuing goals.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.720
In fact, those people are known to be

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.520
at least in the psychological spectrum.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.080
They can be very manipulative dopamine

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.640
and the pursuit of something
doesn't necessarily

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.000
have to be high energy and
intense from the outside.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.520
When you observe it from the outside.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.160
In fact, there are people
who will manipulate

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.760
in order to get what they want.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.640
This has been shown who have
high levels of dopamine release

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.480
in their brain, but
they've learned that a kind

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.520
of passive manipulation is
the best way to maneuver

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.280
through a particular environment.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.480
I don't wanna focus too much

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.840
on sociopathy because those
are kind of extreme examples

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.800
but it just goes to show that
people who identify a goal

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.680
and realize the series of
steps that they need to take

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.520
in order to achieve that
goal can either do it

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.920
through ethical means or non
ethical means they can do it

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.440
through active pursuit, being the kind

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.000
of type a person that's
always declaring their goals

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
and going after it,
posting it on Instagram

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.960
telling everybody about
it, try and recruit others.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.160
There's that phenotype

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.760
there's that kind of signature of dopamine

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.600
and then there are the people that wanna

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.960
get what they want, and they're doing it

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.240
by always serving other people

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.240
by always taking care of
everybody else's needs

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.960
by always trying to accomplish their goals

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.960
but through a mode that at least

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.200
from the outside seems more passive

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.600
or more about supporting others.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.520
Neither of these are good or bad.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.760
And that's because dopamine is a molecule.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.320
It doesn't care how you reach your goals.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.400
It only cares that you reach your goals

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.960
because the internal sensation
is one again of mild pleasure

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.560
a little bit of pain,
although more pain over time.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.400
If you're not reaching those goals

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.600
and it takes you away
from the here and now.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.080
So at about this point in the podcast

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.560
I'm guessing that some you
are thinking, okay, great.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.680
I want more dopamine.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.120
I want to be more motivated.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.200
I don't wanna procrastinate as much

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.600
and I want to be able to experience life.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.640
I want these here and now
molecules to be released as well.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.400
Well, there is a way to
do that, but you have to

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.880
understand the source of
procrastination is not one thing.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.000
There are basically two kinds

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.560
of procrastinators or
so says the research.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.360
The first kind are people
that actually really

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.600
enjoy the stress of
the impending deadline.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.440
It's the only way they
can get into action.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.480
These are people that
really like the feeling of

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.720
something being due in
an hour and how activated

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.640
and sharp and focused
that makes them feel.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.640
Those people are people that are tapping

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.200
into the epinephrin
system, the stress system

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.440
and for which the stress really tightens

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.760
their ability to see it creates that

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.520
soda straw view of the world.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.120
It creates an action element

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.600
in the body that makes them
feel like they wanna move.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.200
It really eliminates all
the distractions for them.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.240
So they're actually leveraging
stress internal stress

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.040
in order to achieve a
state that they can't

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.240
seem to otherwise achieve.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.480
I won't tell you what to do

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.960
in order to overcome all
kinds of procrastination

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.360
but from a logical
perspective, it makes sense

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.000
therefore, for those
kinds of people to think

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.760
about other ways that
they can get their system

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.120
into activation, I've talked

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.400
about this in previous podcasts

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.120
but a couple of those tools might be the

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.120
what we called super oxygenation breathing

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.520
which I admit is not
always super oxygenating.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.960
So this would be if didn't
want it to consume anything.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.320
This could be 25 or 30 cycles of

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.000
in deep inhales and exhales.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.840
It's likely to create some
anxiety and a low level stress.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.520
If you're someone who's
prone to panic attacks

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.160
I wouldn't recommend this, but
it's pretty straight forward.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.080
It will deploy adrenaline
into your system.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.880
And you will find that your
visual field is focused

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.400
and you will be able to work

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.120
and focus better than if
you just kinda waited around

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.080
for some wave of motivation
to wash over you.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.760
Normally you're waiting

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.920
for that deadline to come into sight

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.680
and then that's what the stimulus is.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.760
But you can self-direct adrenaline release

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.280
without ingesting anything.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.920
You can also ingest coffee, caffeine

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.480
or Mate or something
like that, which is what

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.320
I prefer very often to
coffee, which has caffeine.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.640
Caffeine does release
dopamine at low levels

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.600
how much it releases
dopamine it isn't clear.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.320
It seems to increase
firing in these neurons

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.400
in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.840
which is a pretty low level,

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.680
but it can create agitation so for

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.720
caffeine sensitive people,
that could be a problem.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.960
I've talked before about things

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.720
like L tyrosine the precursor
to dopamine or Mucuna Purina.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.080
I talked about that in the last episode

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.600
but if you didn't see
that, just to remind you

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.240
L tyrosine is present in red meats,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.800
it's in certain nuts and L tyrosine

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.320
is the precursor to dopamine.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.640
You can supplement L tyrosine.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.120
If you like, you will get a
big inflection in dopamine

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.040
but there is a crash associated with it.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.080
However, it will increase
motivation in the short term

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.000
not suggesting anyone do this.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.840
I wanna be very clear to
say what I always say.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.720
I'm not a doctor.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.920
I don't prescribe anything.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.720
I'm a professor.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.680
I profess things.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.240
You have to know whether or not
these things are appropriate

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.560
for your mental and
physical health or not.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.000
So you need to consult a doctor.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.040
For instance, people who
suffer from schizotypal

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.520
or schizophrenia or
mania should probably not

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.840
be taking supplements that
increase their dopamine levels.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.840
Now, if you can't increase your level

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.760
of focus and your level of alertness

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.160
and your level of motivation
using breathing well

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.560
then there might be
something else at play.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.000
There are other procrastinators

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.880
for which they simply are not
releasing enough dopamine.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.960
They're not making enough dopamine.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.320
And for those people

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.720
there are a variety of things
that can increase dopamine.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.480
I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.640
or doctor I've talked about Mucuna Purina,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.000
which is 99.9%. L-DOPA
the precursor to dopamine.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.200
So there are people
that do much better when

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.840
they take things that increase
their dopamine levels.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.960
There are antidepressants
like Wellbutrin Pru prior own

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.120
which increase is the other name for it

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.200
which increased dopamine and epinephrin,

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.360
it can increase risk of epileptic attacks

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.080
if you're epileptic.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.000
So again, you have to talk to your doctor

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.120
but they will increase dopamine
and motivation and focus.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.840
However, if you think back

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.400
to our earlier discussion
about dopamine, dopamine

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.080
if it's very high, creates
a sense of pleasure

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.000
and the desire for more,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.320
so you can also become a person

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.720
for which enough is never enough.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.440
The only thing that dopamine
really wants is more

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.120
of the thing that releases dopamine

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.040
and so big inflections in dopamine,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.560
whether or not they come from cocaine

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.040
or whether or not they come
from a supplementation,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.440
caffeine exercise study regime

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.320
will just make you want more of something

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.720
and we've all heard
before of growth mindset

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.320
this incredible discovery of my colleague,

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.720
Carol Dweck where some of
these positive mindsets

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.800
that the psychology
community has put forth

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.960
as really good for pursuit of goals

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.800
and pursuit of things that
require long bouts of effort.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.760
Well, it's wonderful if you
can learn to attach dopamine

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.160
to that process psychologically, but

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.840
if you're starting to augment the amount

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.040
of dopamine increase the amount

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.960
of dopamine through things
like supplementation

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.000
and prescription drugs
what's gonna happen is

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.400
you're not only gonna need to pursue more

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.680
and more of the sorts of things

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.160
that are associated with the dopamine.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.960
So more doing more studying, more sport

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.520
more pursuit, higher
mountains, more money,

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.280
more whatever but we know that over time,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.200
the mirror image of that

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.560
the pain of lack of
accomplishment will also increase.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.240
This is the pleasure pain relationship

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.840
that we talked about earlier.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.520
So in a few moments, I'm gonna talk

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.960
about how to think about
healthy dopamine schedules

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.800
but I just wanna take a
step back for a second

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.280
and talk a little bit about
the flip side of Dolby

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.600
and what happens after this
so-called dopamine crash

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.160
what mechanisms are installed in us,

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.960
because believe it or not,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.560
there are mechanisms that are installed

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.440
in all of us that really put the complete

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.000
and total break on
dopamine, why they're there

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.440
and what they do because
you've experienced these before

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.560
and there are actually ways
that you can navigate them.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.200
These dopamine crashes
are these intentional

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.200
dopamine suppression mechanisms

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.240
in order to leverage
healthier dopamine schedules

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.520
and to feel more motivated.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.720
Perhaps one of the most
fundamental mechanisms

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.040
in all humans is the
neuro circuitry designed

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.520
for seeking out mates and for reproduction

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.920
and that's because the continuation

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.480
of any one species is the
primary driver for any species.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.760
That's just the reality.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.600
Now I'm removing all context here.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.760
So whatever I say, of course, it's

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.949
on a backdrop of consensual age

00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:25.680
appropriate species, appropriate context,

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.120
appropriate all of that.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.000
This is not about the sociology
of reproduction and sex.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.680
This is about the biology,

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.280
the biology of sex in males and females

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.520
doesn't matter if it's XX chromosome X

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.320
Y chromosome X, X, Y
X, Y Y doesn't matter.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.000
The reality is that dopamine is released

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.080
on anticipation and consummation
of sex and reproduction.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.960
And after orgasm, regardless
of chromosomal background

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.040
there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.000
and an increase in a
hormone called prolactin.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.520
Now, prolactin is associated

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.200
with milk let-down in lactating mothers.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.880
It's also present in males and in general

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.800
prolactin creates a sense
of lethargy of stillness

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.400
and lack of desire to move

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.320
and lack of desire to pursue more

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.800
of whatever released the dopamine.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.680
Prolactin in fact, sets
the refractory period

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.240
on a male's ability to mate again

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.200
now this is gonna vary tremendously

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.880
from individual to individual.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.200
It also can, there are data showing

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.120
that it can vary tremendously

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.680
from mate pairing to
mate pairing the number

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.040
one thing that releases
dopamine is novelty

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.800
and it is true that the
refractory period is shortened

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.720
by the introduction of novel mates.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.240
This was first shown in a kind

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.320
of classic experiment in
of all things in chickens.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.840
This is called the Coolidge effect

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.800
and the story is the story goes

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.000
and I believe it's a true story,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.720
it's actually in all the
neuroendocrinology textbooks.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.320
So I believe it's true is

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.080
that president Calvin Coolidge

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.600
was visiting a chicken farm.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.280
They were is being taken
around and the person who was

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.960
hosting the visit showed them

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.920
a rooster that was Coolidge and his wife

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.920
were on the visit and said

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.840
"this rooster copulates
thousands of times per day."

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.480
And Mrs. Coolidge apparently

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.400
kind of elbowed president Coolidge

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400
and said, "ah, you hear
that" kind of like pointing

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.040
out the prowess of this rooster
and Coolidge said," yeah

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.560
but let me ask you a question,

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.400
same hen or different hens."

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.320
It turns out it was different hens.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.760
And the reason is the introduction

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.240
of a novel mate increases dopamine levels.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.920
And what's interesting about this is that

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.520
after copulation prolactin
goes through the roof

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.200
and prevents further
copulation dopamine crashes

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.120
but the introduction of some
sort of novelty shortens this.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.040
Now this is not a ploy for people

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.360
to change mates often what this

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.400
is a story about the
dopamine and prolactin system

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.240
that also exists in humans.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.280
Now, there are actually things that people

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.120
in certain communities take

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.200
in order to bypass these
refractory periods.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.400
There's actually drugs
that increase dopamine

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.800
suppress prolactin and vice versa.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.040
There's actually another
way to suppress prolactin.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.160
Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent
prolactin inhibitor as a zinc.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.040
And if you look out there

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.400
in the literature and for those either

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.640
in the wellness and cost
sports performance community

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.280
a lot of the so-called
quote unquote testosterone

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.160
boosters are actually
combinations of vitamin B6

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.320
and zinc which inhibit prolactin

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.760
and by way of inhibiting
prolactin increase dopamine.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.840
So they do have some functional
effect in that regard.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.840
They're not really increasing
testosterone directly

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.760
they're suppressing prolactin levels.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.280
And there are clinical conditions
like hyperprolactinemia

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.120
which leads to massive
decreases in libido, et cetera.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.800
And there are prescription drugs to

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.000
treat hyperprolactinemia, which of course

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.600
you should always talk
to an endocrinologist

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.680
about those sorts of prescription drugs.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.560
So it's interesting that
this very basic mechanism

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.440
of dopamine and prolactin,
this sort of motivation,

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.800
no more motivation is
a system that evolved

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.760
for reproduction first, but
that actually takes place.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.000
And you can see in elsewhere
in the world, for instance

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
schizophrenia disease that
has many different types

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.840
and facets, but schizophrenia
is a case of an often

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.240
of hyperactivation of the dopamine system

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.440
so much so that it can make
people feel kind of high,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.280
they hallucinate, I
mean, we're talking very

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.600
very high or dysregulated
dopamine circuits in the brain.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.680
One of the treatments for schizophrenia

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.160
are drugs that block dopamine receptors.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.520
And if you have the it's unfortunate,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.880
there are so many people that are out

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.960
on the street these days
who have schizophrenia,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.160
some of whom are taking their meds,

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.680
some of who, whom aren't

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.880
if you ever see somebody on
the street that's doing what's

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.200
it's like a lip smacking and writhing

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.680
it's actually called tardive dyskinesia.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.440
This is a movement disorder that's created

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.080
by taking these anti dopaminergic drugs.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.800
So you can imagine these
anti-doping synergic drugs

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.120
while being very effective
in suppressing hallucinations

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.280
they create these movement problems

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.600
because of dopamines importance

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.960
for the movement circuitry
so-called pyramidal circuitry

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.000
for the aficionados.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.760
In addition, you sometimes see

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.560
in males that take these drugs, drugs

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.840
like haloperidol and the
other dopamine blockers

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.400
that they actually develop
breast tissue gynecomastia.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.600
So the development of
male breast tissue is

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.000
because of the elevated
levels of prolactin

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.320
because they're suppressing
their dopamine so much.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.680
Now that's a really extreme
case, but maybe perhaps

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.120
if you see somebody engaging
these very strange kind

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.520
of face riding and body riding behaviors

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.920
that's actually not a consequence
of their mental illness.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.040
That's a consequence
most often of the drugs

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.880
that they're taking to
treat the mental illness.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.880
Those are side effects of those drugs.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.600
Now prolactin is increased any time.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.240
We have some really
heightened, intense experience.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.600
It's not just released
after sex and reproduction.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.120
Prolactin is released
after some major event,

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.560
it's actually responsible

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.240
thought for some of postpartum depression

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.040
for different types of kind
of the, the let down the low.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.120
I can distinctly remember
that after finals or

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.640
after publishing a big paper,
I would be very, very happy

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.800
but then I'd find that, Oh, you know

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.360
like what next or things
might seem a little bit dimmed

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.480
or dulled out for the next day
or so, or the following week.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.840
The timescales on these are gonna vary

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.760
because some people
release a lot of dopamine

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.640
for a very long time in
response to something great

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.960
and other people have a quick inflection

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.280
of dopamine and then they're
back to feeling not so great.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.360
It really varies from person to person.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.600
In fact, long ago, I started

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.680
as I learned about
dopamine reward circuitry

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.800
and the relationship would be

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.640
between dopamine and prolactin.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.280
I started to leverage
this, believe it or not.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.960
After some major event

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.680
I would take a couple 100
milligrams of vitamin B6.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.920
I think for people who
have diabetic neuropathy

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.880
you need to be careful

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.960
with vitamin B6 check with your doctor.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.440
I was told, although I
haven't found the literature

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.920
on this that it can, in some cases

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.080
exacerbate peripheral neuropathy, but

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.160
for most people it's thought
to be reasonably safe

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.800
but again, always check
with your physician

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.080
but I would take some B6 to
kind of offset some of that low.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.920
And I actually, I don't know
if it was subjective or not

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.600
but it seemed to have
somewhat of a positive effect.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.880
I also started just internalizing the fact

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.800
that dopamine is so subjective.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.120
There are objective aspects to dopamine

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.320
and how much is released

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.520
but there's also some
subjective effects to dopamine.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.440
And so one of the things that you can do

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.080
in order to generally
just be a happier person

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.560
especially if you're a person
in pursuit of long-term goals

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.800
of any kind is the longer
that you can extend

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.680
that positive phase of
the dopamine release.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.280
And the more that you can
blunt the pain response to that

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.360
the better, and you can
actually do this cognitively.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.560
I used to joke with my lab
that when we'd publish a paper

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.720
I would get really excited, but I wouldn't

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.680
allow myself to get too excited
what I wanted to do instead

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.880
and what I've still tried to do is try

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.320
and extend the arc of
that positive experience

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.000
as long as I possibly can simply

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.760
by thinking back like,
Oh, that was really cool.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.200
I really enjoy doing that work.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.360
I really enjoyed the discovery.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.120
I really enjoy doing that with the people

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.360
that I was working with at the time,

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.880
what a pleasure that was.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.080
I can get this very easily

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.320
from pictures of people,
in things like Costello

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.800
that I really enjoy trips that I've taken.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.320
So you can extend pleasure

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.360
without having to engage in
the behavior over and over.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.720
That's extending the arc of
that dopamine release as well.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.560
It offset some of the pain

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.000
of not having that experience occur over

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.280
and over and over again.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.880
Now for the high performers out there

00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.840
you're probably familiar

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.240
with this many people who
have a big achievement.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.080
Their first thoughts are will now, what

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.040
what am I gonna do next?

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.240
How am I ever gonna exceed that?

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.880
And indeed many people who are very high

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.560
on this kind of dopamine sensation

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.600
and novelty seeking scale
are prone to addiction.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.520
They're prone to the rabid pursuit

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.560
of external goals of external
perception to the neglect

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.720
of these internal mechanisms
that allow them to

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.160
feel calm and happy.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.880
So for people that are
very driven, very motivated

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.320
adopting a practice of
being able to engage

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.520
in the here and now the sort

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.840
of almond type practices
we talked about earlier

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.920
of learning how to achieve
a really good night's sleep

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.960
on a regular basis through
tools and mechanisms I talked

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.120
about in previous podcasts gives us sort

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.120
of balance to the pleasure
seeking for an offsetting

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.680
of pain and the pleasure
in the here and now.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.440
So pleasure is really two things.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.520
It's a joy in pursuit

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.440
but it's also the joy in what you have.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.040
And there's a beautiful model

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.520
of emotional development
that was developed

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.440
by Alan shore professor at UCLA

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.720
and psychiatrist that talks
about some of the basics

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.520
of good infant parent attachment

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.600
where good parenting that leads

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.760
to healthy adult relationships

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.080
and emotion regulation
tends to include both sides

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.280
of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.760
We talk about the
relationship between child

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.800
and parent typically was
the mother, but also father

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.200
where you can get the child really excited

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.800
by kind of squealing and ramping them

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.200
up or talking about something
or ice cream or play.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.560
And the kid gets very excited.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.000
That's the dopaminergic system

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.120
the anticipation of something
that's coming, but as well

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.760
engaging with children
in a way that's really

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.280
about everything that you have right

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.520
in the here and now,
the reading of the book

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.000
the kids always seem to ask one more time.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.720
One more.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.880
They seem to want more of
the things that they enjoy

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.200
but really engaging with them

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.920
in a way that increases
their sense of pleasure

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.560
for what's right there, as
well as giving them a lot

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.680
of things to be excited about
and positive anticipation.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.320
Now, having worked years ago
with at-risk kids and also

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.800
with young kids at summer
camps and things like that

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.000
one of the things that you
learn is you never say maybe

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.360
to a kid about a reward.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.360
If you say, we might have ice cream later

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.920
you are essentially saying
we are having ice cream.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.440
They don't hear the maybe part

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.760
and it turns out adults don't either.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.560
It's really interesting.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.720
There's something called
reward prediction error.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.920
I've talked about this before

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.560
but I haven't really talked
about it deeply in the context

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.440
of the dopamine system,
dopamine, as I've said,

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.000
is involved in anticipation of wanting,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.760
not of having it's involved

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.320
in motivation toward
the thing that you want.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.000
And it biases us towards action.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.920
Reward prediction, error
equals the actual amount

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.680
of dopamine that's released in response

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.440
to something versus minus
the amount that's expected.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.440
Okay. So if you tell a kid,
we might have ice cream

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.400
they hear we're gonna have
ice cream and they expect it.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.640
And if you later say, well

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.080
we're not gonna have ice cream

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.560
and I said, maybe that's
actually gonna lead

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.600
to a much bigger crash in dopamine.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.240
It's going to lead to a negative signal,

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.440
a punishment signal.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.600
It's literally going to feel like pain.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.040
So kids, you can leverage this.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.040
If your parents say

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.440
maybe they're effectively
telling your dopamine system

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.080
absolutely. Now adults are like this too.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.040
If we think something might
happen and it doesn't happen

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.520
there's a big crash in our aspect,

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.840
in our emotionality and that's because

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.520
that dopamine system goes from firing

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.440
about three to four times per second

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.840
to about 10 or 15 times per second

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.560
in the possibility that
something might happen

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.600
possibility is deeply
woven into our biology

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.000
of the dopamine and motivation system,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.200
as a way for us presumably
in ancient times

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.800
to explore novel territories

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.800
and get a sense that
maybe there's water there.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.240
Maybe there are mates there.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.520
Maybe there's better food there

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.360
maybe there's resources there.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.040
The maybe is important thing

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.520
that in language terms
maybe means maybe, but

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.040
in neuro-biological
terms maybe means perhaps

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.400
there's going to be the surprise

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.720
of an even bigger dopamine reward.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.560
And the one thing dopamine loves more

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.880
than anything else is surprise.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.000
When we get something
positive, we go to the mailbox

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.760
we're expecting some bills and you open it

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.800
up and you get a letter

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.800
from somebody you haven't
thought about in a long time.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.840
And you adore that person.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400
That's a huge dopamine release.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.720
It actually triggers neuroplasticity.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.840
You probably never forget that

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.560
because of the way that
dopamine Gates' plasticity.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.960
When we get an, a surprise

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.080
of something that we didn't want,

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.480
also it creates plasticity.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.000
So the surprise, novelty,
motivation, and reward

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.360
they're all woven into this
package that we call dopamine.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.920
And the cool thing is you can actually

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.720
regulate this whole system
in a way that will steer you

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.440
or lean you towards more
positive anticipation

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.440
of things in life and less disappointment.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.400
It's simply a matter

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.360
of adjusting what we call
the dopamine schedule.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.840
Okay. A couple things before we continue,

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.320
we're gonna talk about attention
deficit in a few minutes.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.680
But before that, I wanna talk

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.600
about something that I've mentioned before

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.680
in previous podcasts, but
that you may not be aware of

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.600
and if you're aware of
you may still be doing,

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:18.080
which is severely injuring your
ability to release dopamine

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.040
it's creating a sense of
disappointment in ways

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.160
that are most likely hurting
you mentally and physically.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.320
And that's the blunting of dopamine

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.320
by viewing light in
the middle of the night

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.160
I realized this is not
a discussion about sleep

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.320
and circadian rhythms,
but the data now are so

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.200
strong showing that viewing bright light

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.480
from about 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM
too often triggers activation

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.800
of this circuit called the habenula

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.080
So this is eye to

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.200
It goes from your retina

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.160
to a structure called the
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.840
Then from the habenula to
some of this reward circuitry

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.840
and it suppresses the
activation of the reward.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.440
Circuitry, not just in
that moment, but to things

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.800
that you normally positively
anticipate and pursue.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.680
And the reason I'm bring this

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.960
up now is because I haven't really gone

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.080
into depth on the dopamine
system before now, you understand

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.600
that you have this very
precious reward system.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.200
That's kind of a double-edged sword.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.160
It needs to be taken
care of and treated well.

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.280
You wanna use it, but
not overuse it, et cetera

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.600
but getting bright light
exposure in the middle

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.960
of the night is reducing your
capacity to release dopamine.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.520
So it's not just

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.600
about the sleep that you're
not getting in that time.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.880
It's also that you're
not getting the dopamine

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.040
that would otherwise be available to you.

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.200
So you're actually taking, think of light

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.880
in the middle of the night as a kind

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.760
of antagonist is kind of
a blocker of dopamine.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.120
Maybe that'll help you.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.160
If you're somebody who has to work

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.120
in the middle of the night

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.840
and you wanna bypass
this dopamine suppression

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.400
please see the episode
about jet lag and shift work

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:46.880
because there are a lot

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.880
of tips there that will
allow you to do that

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.520
in order to understand how to
control the dopamine system

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.600
how to leverage it for a better life.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.560
You need to understand the results

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.160
of a very important experiment.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.520
This experiment was able
to separate pleasure

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.880
from motivation.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.480
It's a very simple, but
like many simple experiments

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.520
a very elegant experiment, what they did

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.960
and this has now been done in animals.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.320
and in humans, they offered rats food.

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.880
It was a food that they particularly liked

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.240
and the animals would lever
press for a pellet of food

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.800
kind of classic experiment
that eat the food

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.040
and they presumably liked the food

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.440
because they were motivated,
press the lever and eat it.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.080
Great. They took other rats.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.680
They eliminated the dopamine neurons.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.720
You can do this by injection

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.360
of a neurotoxin that
destroys these neurons.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.680
So they actually had no
dopamine in their brain.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.520
They have no ability to release dopamine

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.600
and they gave them a lever
that rats would sit there

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.200
and they'd hit the lever
and they'd eat the food.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.360
They're still enjoyed the food.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.440
So you say, well, okay

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.280
so dopamine is involved in motivation.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.720
It is involved in pleasure.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.160
No, it absolutely is.

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.800
They could still enjoy the
food, but if they moved the rat

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.680
literally one body length
away from the lever.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.960
What they found was the animals
that had dopamine would move

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.720
over to the lever, press it and eat.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.000
And the ones, the rats that
did not have dopamine available

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.320
to them, wouldn't even move
one body lane, one rat length

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.000
to the lever in order to
press it and get the food.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.760
Dopamine, therefore is not

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.640
about the ability to experience pleasure,

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.880
it is about motivation for pleasure.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.680
This has been repeated in humans

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.600
in a variety of different scenarios.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.000
You can't really do the lever
press thing quite as easily

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.760
but we know that people have low levels

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.480
of dopamine are simply less motivated

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.320
even though they can achieve pleasure.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.720
And this has serious ramifications

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.347
for the fact that now, quote

00:56:50.347 --> 00:56:53.680
unquote pleasure or ways
to induce things that we

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.400
believe give us pleasure are everywhere.

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.360
And they're within reach.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.880
We don't have to forage for our food.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.400
There's lot of highly
processed, high sugar

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.600
high fat foods.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.920
There's also foods that are
healthy, that tastes good

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.840
but they're hopefully
they're pretty easy to

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.160
get all that different
people have different access

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.800
to things, of course, but dopamine

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.280
isn't about the ability
to experience pleasure.

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.800
It's about how motivated you
are to reach those pleasures.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.760
And so many of you are
probably thinking, wow

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.280
I'm not a very motivated person.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:23.680
Like you talked

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.440
about the one kind of
procrastination earlier.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.440
What about when I just feel
kind of met about life now

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.600
for some of you, there may
be a real clinical depression

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.120
and you should talk to a professional.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.040
There are very good prescription drugs

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.200
that can really help people.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.360
There's also great non drug
treatments of psychotherapy

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.880
and other treatments
that are being developed

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.760
in addition to psychotherapy
in the various kinds

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.720
of psychoanalysis, et
cetera, that one can use.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.840
I think the data really points

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.360
to the fact that a combination

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.600
of pharmacology and talk
therapies are generally best.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.120
And there are a huge
range of these things.

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.640
I know many of you are
in these professions.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.400
We're not gonna talk about that right now.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.200
There's a compound.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.200
That's kind of interesting
in the supplement

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.480
space that isn't MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:11.680
it's not L tyrosine that isn't
promoting massive releases

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.240
of dopamine or even dopamine alone

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.880
but a combination of
dopamine and serotonin.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.320
And it's an intriguing molecule
it's sold over the counter.

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.920
Again, you have to check
with your healthcare provider

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.920
before you would take
anything or remove anything.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.560
That's very important, which
is, but it's, fenal ethyl

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:38.800
fenal Ethel aiming, or P-E-A
pea or beta fenal Ethel

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.640
aiming releases dopamine at low levels

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.480
but also serotonin and low level.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.480
So it's kind of a cocktail
of the motivation molecules

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.040
as well as the quote unquote
here and now molecules.

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.800
And people's response
to this varies widely

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.640
but many people report
feeling heightened sense

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.120
of mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera.

00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.800
It is a bit of a stimulant

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.160
like anything that triggers activation

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.560
of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.000
but is an interesting supplement.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.840
I actually haven't tried it before.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.160
So I can't report on my own experiences.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.840
I will point you however, to examine.com.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.760
It wouldn't be a Huberman
Lab Podcast episode.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.280
If I didn't point you to examine.com

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.840
this incredible free
resource where you can put

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.880
in any supplement.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.880
And it will tell you the
quote unquote human effect

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.040
matrix it'll point you
to the various studies.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.880
We always provide a link
to this in the caption.

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.480
It's an amazing resource.

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.800
So you can go there to explore more

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.760
but I haven't talked about
beta Fino, L Ethel, Amy

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.880
and before in previous podcasts

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.240
and I wanted to add it to
the list of things that tap

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.840
into the dopamine system that are in this.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.080
I guess we call it now
the supplementation space.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.240
I personally am fascinated
by these supplements

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.400
and the things that
exist out there that are

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.600
non-prescription that seem to, at least

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.080
in some people have positive effects.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.200
For instance, last episode

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.400
we talked about CDOT
L-carnitine, which there

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.720
are several papers that
report antidepressant effects

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.840
as well as positive effects

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.840
on other things, sperm health,
ovarian health, et cetera.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.640
I learned from a colleague
that acetyl L-carnitine

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.800
in Europe is actually a prescription drug

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.960
in the US it's sold over the counter.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.720
So I guess, depending on
where you're listening to this

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.640
the availability might vary.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.640
And as always, I put the
caveat, you have to check

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.400
with your healthcare provider,
if it's right for you

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.080
but I'm fascinated by the fact

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.120
that these things exist
and that they lie somewhere

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.640
between prescription
drugs and doing nothing.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.880
And that makes them interesting compounds.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.520
And I think that P-E-A
beta fennel ethylamine is

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.160
yet another one of the, of such compounds.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.480
I going to talk a lot
about attention deficit

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.800
and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.440
in a future episode, but I
do wanna mention it today

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.960
in the context of
dopamine and impulsivity.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.560
So ADHD or ADD so attention deficit

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.600
hyperactivity disorder,
ADD our clinical diagnoses.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.080
I think a lot of people
nowadays walk around and say

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.240
I have ADD or you have ADD

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.280
and indeed one can create a sort

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.240
of ADD by attention
switching all the time.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.480
I'm a big fan of Cal Newport.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.680
He wrote the book" deep work."

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.960
I believe he was the one who said context

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.880
switching is terrible for the brain.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.480
It's like the worst thing for the brain

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.200
because then the brain
learns to context, switch

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.040
and real deep work productivity,
learning of all kinds

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.400
good relationships of all kinds

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.320
really come from depth of experience

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.160
not from breadth of
experience within the moment.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.120
And so I think it's important to know that

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.280
there's clinical ADHD and ADD

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.640
and then there's the
kind that people are kind

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.040
of inducing and through distraction

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.440
and social media and phones, et cetera.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.400
And those can sometimes lead
to clinical ADHD and ADD

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.840
But I wanna talk about ADHD
and ADD in kids just briefly

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.920
the drugs that are normally
given to treat those conditions

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.680
ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.480
things that have very
amphetamine, light qualities

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.360
and structures, and you might
ask, why would they do that?

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.920
Well, it turns out that in kids

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.560
these activate that for brain circuitry

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.360
the break that exists on the
deeper mesolimbic circuitry.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.792
So as you recall, there's
the VTA and nucleus accumbens

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.520
as the kind of accelerators on dopamine.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.800
And then there's the prefrontal cortex

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.160
which acts as a break and
can limit impulsivity.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.400
And those drugs tend to
increase the activity

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.440
of neurons in that pathway,
the prefrontal cortex

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.880
and it reduces impulsivity.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.760
In fact, there's a experiment
described in the book

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.080
"the molecule of more,"
which is really interesting

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.680
where they looked at
impulsivity in obese children

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.240
and it turns out they did this experiment

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.040
in a safe way that they looked at kids

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
both obese kids and non obese kids

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.520
and their willingness to
cross a very busy highway.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.440
And it turns out that
the obese kids got hit

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.440
by cars more often than
non obese children.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.680
It turns out this was a
virtual reality experiment

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.480
and it had nothing to do

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.760
with the fact that they were obese

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.480
or limitations on movement
or speed of movement.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.800
It was that the obese
children were more impulsive

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.000
in a variety of contexts

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.560
not just in this virtual
crossing the street thing.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.360
And it turns out the
data point to the fact

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.040
that impulsivity at age
10 is actually predictive

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.880
of overeating disorders
at a later stage in life.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.280
So some of these drugs
that are designed to

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.320
create heightened activity
in the braking system

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.400
the decelerator

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.000
of the reward pathway are
designed to reduce impulsivity

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.400
because they suppress
the release of dopamine

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.480
and they allow, hopefully
they allow children and it

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.160
and when they become adults
to better control the schedule

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.520
of dopamine release.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.760
So now let's talk about
what is a dopamine schedule

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.360
and how you can leverage this

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.800
in order to have heightened
levels of motivation

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.240
but not get so much dopamine

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.480
that you're experiencing
or a crash afterwards.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.960
And also, so that you can
experience heightened pleasure

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.320
from the various pursuits
that you are engaged in life.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.920
I know many of you are interested

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.920
in tools that will allow
you to be more motivated

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.880
to focus longer, sleep better.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.360
That's really what the Huberman
Lab Podcast is all about

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.920
but always framed in the context

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.680
of neuro-biological principles
and objective mechanisms.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.400
There are some tools that we can apply

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.840
to the dopamine system

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.600
and motivation that can really
improve our ability to stay

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.640
in pursuit of things,
as well as enjoy things

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.320
after we've achieved our goals,
or even an route, our goals.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.720
And here's the key principle.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.480
Dopamine is very subjective.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:51.840
Meaning you can

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.640
either allow yourself to
experience the pleasure

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.760
of reaching a milestone of
achieving or some craving or not.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.840
Now that won't work in
the extreme cases of drugs

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.480
like cocaine and amphetamine,
but it's actually

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.240
pretty powerful what one can
do with the subjective system.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.080
In fact, I'm gonna describe

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.440
to you an experiment
that highlights just how

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.000
powerful the subjective readout

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.760
or the subjective interpretation

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.440
of a given experience really can be.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.080
Even at the level of pharmacology.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.720
I love examples of subjective effects

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.440
over things that would
otherwise seem hardwired

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.080
because they really
illustrate the interplay

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.600
between our cognition, our belief system

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.840
and what would otherwise be these,

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.040
just plug and chug kind of mechanisms of,

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040
you eat X amount of chocolate

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040
or you drink X amount of water

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.440
after being water deprived
for a certain amount of time.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.040
And you get X amount of dopamine.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.320
Here's the experiment.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.560
The experiment was just
published on March 18, 2021.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.400
So very recently, and the title

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.480
of the experiment is expectation

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.880
for stimulant type modifies

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.440
caffeine is effects on mood and cognition

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.120
and this was done in college students.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.120
And it's a fascinating study.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:11.680
What they did is they gave
college students either placebo

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.200
essentially nothing or 200
milligrams of caffeine.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.640
200 milligrams of caffeine is

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.480
about what's in a well, a typical coffee

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.280
like a medium coffee that
you buy a drip coffee

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.120
or a coffee that you'd make at home.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.320
It's a fair amount of caffeine.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.760
If you were to take in pill form

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.440
it would definitely
make you feel more alert

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.280
unless you were one of those mutants

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.400
literally mutants that is
insensitive to caffeine.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.080
And those mutants are pretty rare.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.640
So they took 65 undergraduate
students in college.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.600
They randomized them to
either placebo or caffeine

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.680
and they told them

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.560
that they were either
getting caffeine or Adderall.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.920
Now, Adderall cognitively carries

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.800
a very different expectation.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360
College students know
Adderall to be a much

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.280
stronger stimulant than caffeine.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.600
They know it to create a sort of high.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.360
This is the way the students described it

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.440
and they thought that it
would increase their level

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.240
of focus and their
ability to perform work.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.600
So it was really interesting
is there was definitely

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.520
an effect of placebo versus caffeine.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.080
That's not surprising, however,
right, you take a placebo

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.160
you may or may not feel more alert

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.560
but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.240
very likely you're gonna feel very alert

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.680
but there was also an
effect of whether or not

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.800
the students thought they were
getting caffeine or Adderall.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.360
The subjects receiving
caffeine reported feeling

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.600
more stimulated, anxious, and motivated

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.360
than the subjects that
received the placebo.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.000
Okay. But the ones that expected Adderall

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
reported stronger amphetamine effects.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So they felt much more high.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.640
They performed better on
a working memory test.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.520
And in general, they had
all the increased cognitive

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.240
effects that would have
been seen with Adderall

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.240
but they were only ingesting caffeine.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.240
And so this shows an interaction
between the drug caffeine

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.640
and the expectation that it was Adderall.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.760
So it led to heightened performance simply

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.240
because the students thought
they were getting Adderall.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.040
And I don't know whether

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.400
or not they told them at the
end that it wasn't Adderall.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.680
I doubt that they did this.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.560
If you wanna look it up

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.000
the study was published in the journal

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.400
of experimental clinical
psychopharmacology.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.040
The paper is Looby L-O-O-B-Y at all.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.720
And again, it was just published
March 18th, 2021 speaks

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.240
to the fact that yes, there
are so-called placebo effects

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.680
but this is different than placebo.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.800
This is a belief effect about
what the specific reactions

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.200
to a given stimulant ought to be.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.120
And I think this is very
important because I think

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.960
that it points to the fact that the top

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.280
down the kind of higher
level cognitive processes

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.720
are impacting even the most
basic fundamental aspects

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.240
of the say dopamine release

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.360
or our mountain adrenaline
release or epinephrin release

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.000
in ways that can positively
impact performance.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.840
In this case, it was
a positive improvement

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840
in working memory and focus.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.360
As long as we were talking about caffeine

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.200
I'd like to point out a study.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.240
That's really interesting.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.720
This was published in
journal of neuroscience

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.760
which is the society

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.080
for neurosciences kind
of flagship journal.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:10.960
It's their journal.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.160
It's a good journal

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.840
and what they showed was

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.240
that caffeine can
increase dopamine release

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.280
in the brain by about 30%.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.800
That wasn't surprising.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.120
I even said that earlier,
but what they also showed is

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.440
that it has a protective
effect on dopamine neurons.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.480
So caffeine in some cases may not just

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.760
increase dopamine release

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.760
but it might actually
have a protective effect

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.360
on dopamine neurons.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.720
Now that's distinctly different

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.240
from some claims that drugs
like MDMA ecstasy have been

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.640
it's been argued can, are neurotoxic

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.120
for things like dopamine
and serotonin neurons.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.800
The study that was published about that

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.200
in the journal science,
which is an extremely

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.280
prestigious excellent
journal later, it was shown

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.840
that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy
that was given in that case.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.280
It was actually amphetamine,
which is known to

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.240
destroy dopaminergic and
serotonergic neurons.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.960
So what does this mean?

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.520
This means that low levels
of caffeine may at least

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.240
in a few studies be protective
for dopamine neurons

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.080
over time that MDMA
ecstasy something that's

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.560
in clinical trials right now
for the treatment of trauma

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.600
PTSD of various kinds and depression

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.120
but still illegal at
this point in time may

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.680
although it doesn't appear
yet from any published studies

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.800
destroy dopaminergic neurons,
perhaps origin, urgent neuron.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.200
So there's a real asterix
and a question mark there

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.320
but amphetamine and in
particular methamphetamine

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.000
is very destructive for
dopaminergic neurons.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.560
So I don't think any of
us needed any additional

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.640
reasons to avoid methamphetamine.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.400
This drug that creates
huge increases in dopamine

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.920
and then huge crashes

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.880
from that dopamine, very destructive drug.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.520
But in addition

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.640
to that seems to destroy
dopaminergic neurons from time

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.080
to time, I've talked about
nicotine on here, not smoking

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.840
because obviously smoking
is bad lung cancer's bad

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.920
for health, et cetera, but
nicotine in supplemental form

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.320
I've mentioned that a very
famous neuroscientists

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.520
Nobel prize winning scientists
choose a lot of Nicorette.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.880
I know other people that you Nicorette

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.080
they believe in its
neuroprotective effects

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.760
for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.240
and indeed nicotine can
stimulate dopamine release.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.520
We talked about that earlier

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.120
whether or not it has a protective effect

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.960
isn't clear the protective
effects might be

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.680
through the noradrenergic
and acetylcholine systems.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.280
Those findings are still unclear

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.880
but it is interesting to note

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.000
that nicotine can increase prolactin.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.040
Somewhat. There are a couple

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.560
of studies I'd be happy to link to them

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.760
in the caption that shows
that nicotine taken too much

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.640
over too long periods of time
can also increase prolactin

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.680
which again is the
opposite side of dopamine.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.360
So today we've talked a lot
about the dopamine system

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.960
and those kinds of schedules
that will allow craving

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.480
or addiction, but what's
the schedule of dopamine.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.560
That's going to allow you to maximize

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.000
on your pursuit of pleasure
and your elimination of pain.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.720
And we get the answer to that

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.520
from our good friend gambling,
the reason gambling works

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.760
the reason why people will
throw their lives away.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.960
The reason why people go back
again and again and again

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.680
to places like Las Vegas
and Atlantic city is

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.680
because of the hope and anticipation it's

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.960
as those are cities in
places built on dopamine,

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.160
they are leveraging your dopamine system.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.800
And I realized that there
are experienced gamblers.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.400
There are people that enjoy gambling.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.000
I'll actually just say,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.600
I like sitting at the roulette table.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.360
I was take a designated amount of money.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.480
It's not much, I enjoy playing
a little bit of roulette.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.760
I certainly enjoy when I win.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.440
I certainly don't like it when I lose

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.440
but I do it cheerly for
the pleasure of playing.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.720
And I do it very seldom.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.080
I don't have a gambling problem.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.360
And if I did, I'd probably tell you

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.520
but I don't have a gambling problem.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.160
Yet people throw away the
entire lives on gambling.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.280
And as a friend of mine

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.240
who's a certified addiction
treatment specialist tells me

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.360
that gambling addiction
is a particularly sinister

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.480
because the next time
really could be the thing

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.680
that changes everything.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.720
Unlike other addictions

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.400
the next time really
could change everything.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.960
And that's embedded in the
mind of the gambling addict

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.840
and rarely does it work out in favor

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.320
of the wellbeing of the gambling
addict and their family.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.400
However, the intermittent
reinforcement schedule

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.600
was discovered long ago
by scientific researchers.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.840
So this is the slot
machine that every once

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.160
in a while gives you a
wind to keep you playing.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.840
This is the, the probability
of winning on the craps table

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.960
or the roulette table, or at
blackjack just often enough

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.520
that you're willing to buy
tickets, head out there

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.600
play again, go downstairs
again from your room

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.760
even though you swore you
were done for the night

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.200
intermittent reinforcement
is the most powerful form

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.480
of dopamine reward schedule
to keep you doing something

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.840
so we can export that.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.840
We can use it for good.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.520
If there's something that
you're pursuing in life

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.360
whether or not it's an academic goal

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.520
or a financial goal, a relationship goal.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.800
One of the things that
you can do to ensure

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.120
that you will remain on
the path to that goal

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.680
for a very long time, and
that you will continue to

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.400
exceed your previous performance as well

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.040
as continue to enjoy the
dopamine release that

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.520
occurs when you hit the
milestones that you want to

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.960
achieve is to occasionally remove reward

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.480
subjectively, let's say you
set out a goal of making

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.800
I'm gonna make this quantitative
with respect to finances

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.400
'cause it just is an easy description

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.240
but this could also be in sport.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.200
This could be in school.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.080
This could be in music

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.840
could be in anything creative endeavors

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.160
but let's say you set out
a certain financial goal

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.600
or let's say you wanna
get a certain number

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.920
of followers on whatever
social media platform

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.360
as you reach each one of those goals.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.120
You should know now that the amount

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.720
of dopamine is not going to peak.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.920
It's actually going to diminish

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.520
and make you crave more the
key to avoiding that crash

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.680
but to still keep it in healthy levels

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.800
that will allow you to continue.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.560
Your pursuit is as you are,
stair casing toward your goal.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.120
Maybe that's dollars,
maybe that's followers

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.560
maybe that's grades

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.840
maybe that's some other metric
it's metals or trophies.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.800
You actually want to
blunt the reward response

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.480
for some of those intermediate goals.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.440
Now I'm not telling you
should celebrate your wins

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.160
but I'm telling you not
to celebrate all of them.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.400
Whereas a good friend of mine who recently

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.920
fortunately for him had a
great financial success.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.880
He asked me and somebody
else a good friend of mine.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.880
Who's very tuned into dopamine

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.640
reward schedules understands how they work

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.760
at a really deep level.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.680
And he said," I don't
know what to do next."

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.680
And we said," Oh, well, that's simple,

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.680
You should just give most of it away."

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.600
And this wasn't a ploy to receive any

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.800
of the money ourselves.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.080
This was really about reducing
the impact of that reward.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.320
Now hopefully giving them money away.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.520
If you already have enough

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.840
of it would be something
that was rewarding

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.120
in and of itself.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.720
But if you're a student who's
pursuing goals in university

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.800
or you're an athlete, who's pursuing goals

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.320
it actually makes sense
from a rational perspective.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.680
Once you understand these
mechanisms to hit a new high point

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.040
of performance, or to get
that A-plus or a for you

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.360
if it's an A-minus, et cetera

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.760
and to tell yourself, okay, that was good.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.160
But to actually actively
blunt the reward to not go

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.600
and celebrate too intensely,
because in doing that

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.800
you keep your dopamine system
in check and you ensure

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.680
that you're gonna stay on
the path of continued pursuit

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.800
not just for that thing, but
for all things big increases

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.880
in dopamine leads to big crashes

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.480
in dopamine and big increases
in dopamine up the ante.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.920
They increase the extent
to which you are willing to

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.240
invest time and energy
in order to achieve goals

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.560
and rewards that may be out of your reach.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.880
You never really know if
you're going to succeed.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.880
So to make this crystal
clear, celebrate your wins

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.640
but don't celebrate every win.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.080
That's one way that you can ensure

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.800
that you're going to continue
down the path of progress.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.040
And I think most of the
learning tools that are

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:11.360
in schools are about reward
for genuine performance.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.440
They are about encouraging us.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.840
We do have to believe
that we can perform well.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.600
One of the hallmarks of growth mindset is

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.600
the internalization that we're
not getting it right yet.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.120
The word yet is very important.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.320
And also the sense that we reward

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.760
our good behavior, our good
performance, but not every time.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.640
One way to do this is to
actually take the reward

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.760
and reinforcement out of your
own hands and your own mind.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.280
And you tell somebody that
they are in control of

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.440
whether or not you're allowed
to feel good about your wins.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.720
Now, I realize it's very
unnatural for most people

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.920
but if you're somebody who
simply going to be in pursuit

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.720
and you're going to really
register your wins, and you think

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.040
that that's gonna actually
make you a better performer

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.440
it will in the short term,
but not in the longterm.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.120
So you can lift the what Las Vegas

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.040
and Atlantic city and
other gambling mechanisms

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.480
and places have known for a long time.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.760
They lifted it from the scientists.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.960
You can now take it back and
you can start to leverage that.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.320
And you just make it intermittent.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.200
You reward yourself, not
on a predictable schedule

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.440
so not every other time
or every third time

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.200
or every 10th time, but
sometimes it's three

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.760
in a row then not at all for 10 days.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.400
So reward is important.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.320
Self reward is critically important

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.240
but make sure that you're not doing it

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.600
on such a predictable
schedule that you burn

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.600
out these dopamine circuits or

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.680
that you undercut your own
ability to strive and achieve.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.640
Actually have a story from graduate school

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.040
which I was forced

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.120
into an intermittent
reinforcement schedule

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.520
that I do believe has served me very well

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.920
in my scientific career
and other aspects of life.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.360
My graduate advisor was
an amazing scientist.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.640
Unfortunately, she passed away

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.600
but amazing scientists
and amazing human being

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.840
with a very dry and somewhat
cruel sense of humor.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.520
Her name was Barbara Chapman,
and we published a paper

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.560
in the journal, science and science nature

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.960
and cell are considered the big three

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.200
the most competitive
journals to publish in.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.760
And I had a first author paper in science.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.840
It was really exciting to me.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.200
I was a graduate student.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.040
I was very excited about the discovery.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.720
I was excited that it was in science.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.160
I was just thrilled.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.120
And I remember when the
paper finally got accepted

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.400
because it had involved a ton

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.280
of revisions and a lot of very hard work.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.520
And she came in and she
said," paper got accepted."

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.800
I was super excited

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.280
and she just kind of sat
there and nodded, and I said

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.640
"are we gonna celebrate,
are we gonna have a party?"

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.240
Or what, like, what are we gonna do it?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.520
And I'll never forget her answer.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:50.240
She said," I think we
should skip this one."

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.600
And I thought she was joking.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.040
And I said," what do
you mean skip this one?"

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.920
We're gonna publish the paper.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.360
He said, yeah, we're
gonna publish the paper.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.280
But she said, " maybe when
you get like four more

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.080
maybe three, maybe two too."

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.280
And I thought she was messing

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.960
with me and she wasn't messing with me.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.440
And she was right.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.800
We never had a party.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.960
We had a celebration for that paper.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.320
I think she was really trying
to instill two ideas in me.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.440
One is that the work itself
was what was supposed to

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.400
be most rewarding.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.240
That practice of experimentation

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.000
a writing the paper, the experience

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.240
of achieving something
they worked very hard at

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.000
and that did indeed feel amazing.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.600
I actually can still feel it in my body.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.640
Now, the excitement.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.120
So there's a, still a dopamine release

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.960
or that arc is going very long.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.960
This would be almost 20 years
ago now that this happened.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.400
So that's remarkable.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.560
The other one is that she's right.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.480
We never went out and celebrated

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.240
and we did celebrate other wins

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.640
other papers in the future
and things of that sort.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.880
But she was either consciously
or subconsciously putting me

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.800
on an intermittent reward schedule.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.080
And to this day when
something really good happens

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.720
I actually hesitate as
to whether or not I wanna

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.440
internalize that and
celebrate whether I wanna

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.680
tell anybody which is its
own form of celebration

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.840
because then you're
getting positive feedback.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.520
And so I'm very cautious

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.360
with how I deploy dopamine
release in response to wins.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.960
It's certainly not the only way that I've

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.000
navigated my career.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.960
There are a number of other
principles I incorporate

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.720
but intermittent reward for wins

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.560
for achievements is a very
powerful way to ensure

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.480
that you will stay on the path of pursuit.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.480
At this point in the podcast

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.320
I'd like to take a moment
to address some corrections.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.400
I made some errors in previous episodes.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.600
They weren't major errors

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.600
but a couple of you pointed them out

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.400
and it's important to me
that we strive for accuracy.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.240
So the first one was I
talked in a previous episode

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:45.840
about the potential benefits
for some people, not all

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.600
of ashwagandha and its
role in blunting cortisol

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.160
and a way of offsetting medium term,

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.000
and some long-term stress.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.240
It's a supplement that
I've benefited from.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.600
It works through the GABA system

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.600
and some other systems, someone pointed

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.880
out a study that admittedly
was done in rats.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.480
I point I was focusing mainly

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.640
on studies in humans during
the episode, but they point

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.280
out a study that was
done in rats that showed

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:13.600
that long-term
administration of ashwagandha

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.560
could actually create some
negative effects mainly

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.840
on the fibroid and perhaps
even the cortisol system

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.080
maybe the melatonin system.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.320
I just wanna acknowledge that study.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.800
I'll reference it in the caption again

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.760
that was a rat study.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.120
I was focused on human studies.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.880
Please go to examine.com.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.520
Put in ashwagandha will
tell you the various effects

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.520
on different aspects of brain and body.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.360
It will also link to the pub med articles

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.640
that are relevant there

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.160
it is called the human effect matrix

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.840
'cause that's only focused on humans.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.680
That's one of the reasons
I like examined.com

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.840
as it's focused on human studies, again

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.200
a wonderful free resource,
but I do appreciate

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.800
that you pointed out that study

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.440
because I do want people
to be aware of the range

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.000
of effects that these various
compounds can have as well.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.760
A couple of times in previous episodes

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.880
I said five HTP and not five HT five

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.760
HT is serotonin five

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.520
HTP is a precursor to a serotonin.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.120
I was talking about supplements

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.680
and compounds that can stimulate
the release of serotonin.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.240
In the previous episode,
I was actually referring

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.440
to it in a context

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.480
for which I don't personally
like to take five HTP.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.680
That's just my own bias

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.320
for reasons I described in that episode.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.280
But if you heard me say five HTP

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.120
when I meant to say five HT, I apologize.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.120
And then last, I just
wanna point out again

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.240
something that I
mentioned at the beginning

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.760
which is that the Huberman
Lab Podcast is now subtitled

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.920
in Spanish episodes one and two

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.840
as well as our welcome
video are in Spanish.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:44.560
The other ones will be subtitled soon.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.960
You can expect that within
the next couple of weeks.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.320
So if you know Spanish speaking

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.520
people who prefer to
digest the information

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.400
in Spanish or that's,

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:56.000
you can look forward to
the Spanish subtitles.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.280
You need to activate those

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.160
in the caption feature on YouTube.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.880
Unfortunately, we don't
have Spanish dubbing

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.120
over on the audio platforms.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.960
I realized once again, we've
covered a lot of material.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.600
Hopefully you now know far more

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.960
about the dopamine system
reward and motivation

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.040
than you did at the
beginning of this podcast.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.400
Hopefully you also
understand the other side

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.400
of dopamine and reward, which is pain

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.440
and the balance of this
pleasure pain system, as well

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.800
as the molecules that we
call or that were described

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.280
in the molecule of more book, I should say

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.640
as the here and now molecules

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.120
things like serotonin
and the endocannabinoids.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.720
We talked about a variety
of supplement based tools,

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.640
things like vitamin B6 and zinc

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.120
as they relate to prolactin P-E-A

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.360
Very interesting compound again

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.200
I've never tried it very interesting

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.160
definitely in use out there L-DOPA MuCuna

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.280
appearings talked about
caffeine, talked about nicotine.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.120
Talk about how some of the effects

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.680
of Adderall can be
created purely cognitively

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.000
without actually
ingesting Adderall, simply

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.920
by telling people they're
ingesting Adderall

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.880
giving them caffeine.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.360
Very interesting study that I referenced a

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.080
little bit earlier,

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.160
and we talked about scheduling dopamine

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.160
adopting the intermittent
reward schedule for yourself

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.960
in order to ensure long-term engagement

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.680
with pursuits that I
hope are healthy pursuits

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.120
and ones that serve you well

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.120
this was by no means
an exhaustive coverage

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.120
of all things, dopamine and motivation.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.360
It was by no means.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.560
The only time that we're gonna talk

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.600
about dopamine and
motivation, next episode

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.640
we're gonna continue to talk

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.000
about emotions from
yet another perspective

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
but hopefully you have enough now to think

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.600
about in the meantime, and
that you can consider adopting

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.960
in your own life and practices as always.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.280
I really wanna thank you
for your time and attention.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.400
If you learned something useful
today, please pass it along.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.520
One of the things that we teach

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.920
in science that I think
is really wonderful

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.480
to adopt in general in life is this idea

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.800
of watch one, do one, teach one.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.960
This is what we tell graduate
students and med students

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.400
and post-docs watch somebody
do something, learn it

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.680
then do it, apply it, see

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.160
if it works for you and then teach it.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.240
So it's usually not watch
one, do one, teach one.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.760
It's usually watch one

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.640
do 20 teach as many people
as you possibly want.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.000
I'm not looking for attribution.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.280
These are tools that are grounded

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.160
in neuroscience for which
I can't claim attribution.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.840
I'm just passing them along so

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.800
that you can adopt them if
you like and pass them along.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.000
If you think people can benefit

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.800
from them, many of you
have continued to ask how

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.960
you can help support the
Huberman Lab Podcast.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.720
If you like what we're doing here.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.320

will allow you to make sure
you don't miss any episodes.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.280
Typically we release episodes every Monday

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.800
but in the future

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.200
we may release episodes
as well as short clips.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.840
More often than that as well

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.440
If you want to subscribe
on Apple or Spotify or both

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.880
that's a great help to us.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.360
And on Apple, you have the
opportunity to leave us

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.120
up to a five star review.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.680
We do use the comment
section here on YouTube to

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.640
inform future content and
to address any questions

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.720
and clear up any miss communications

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.800
or misconceptions that might arise.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.280
So please put your
questions, your comments

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.040
and your suggestions for future content.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.960
In the comment section below.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.560
The other way to support us is to check

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.080
out our sponsors that were mentioned

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.760
at the beginning of the podcast.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.840
The links to those sponsors
are in the captions.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.720
As well we've set up a Patreon account

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.240
which is patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.080
That allows you to support the podcast

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.040
at any level that you like as well.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.320
Because we mentioned supplements

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.840
from time to time throughout the podcast

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.320
and people always ask about what brands

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.000
and sources we use or suggest
for those supplements.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.200
We partnered with Thorne

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.760
T-H-O-R-N-E Thorne
supplements are known to be

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.680
among the most stringent supplements

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.760
in terms of the specificity of what's

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.680
in the bottle matches what's on the label.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.240
The quality of the ingredients
is exceedingly high

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.920
the Mayo Clinic

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.320
and all the major sports
organizations are partnered

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.960
with Thorne because of that stringency

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.040
and that commitment to rigor.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.320
If you'd like to see the supplements

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.520
that I personally take

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.920
as well as get 20% off any

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.160
of the supplements that
Thorne makes you can go

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.760
to thorne.com/u, that's the letter

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.600
U, slash Huberman (thorne.com/u/huberman).

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.160
And you can see what I take
and any of those supplements

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.240
as well as any of the other products

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.080
on the Thorne site will be available

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.680
to you at 20% off that's
thorne.com/u/huberman

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.880
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.640
Finally, I wanna thank you

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.320
for your time and attention today.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.120
I hope you learned a lot
and that you learned a lot

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.360
of possible tools that
you could incorporate

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.960
into your life as it relates
to motivation and emotion.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:01.760
Thank you for your interest in science.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.300
