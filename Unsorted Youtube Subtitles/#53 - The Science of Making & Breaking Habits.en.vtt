00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.920
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
where we discuss science
and science based tools

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.318
for everyday life.

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:09.150
[mellow music]

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.680
I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.122
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:16.425
Today we're talking all about habits.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:17.381
In particular,

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:20.902
we're going to discuss the
biology of habit formation

00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:24.160
and the biology of how we break habits.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.931
I think we can all appreciate
the value of having habits.

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:29.920
Habits organize our behavior

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.880
into more or less reflexive actions

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.540
so we don't have to think too much

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.160
about performing the various
behaviors that, for instance,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.419
allow us to brush our teeth

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:41.459
or which side of bed we
roll out of in the morning.

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:44.500
And then of course, habits
can be more elaborate too.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.100
We can be in the habit of exercising

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.550
at a particular time of day.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.230
We can be in the habit
of eating certain foods.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.032
We can be in the habit of
saying or saying certain things.

00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:53.054
But of course,

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:55.920
there are many habits
that don't serve us well,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.500
or that perhaps even
undermine our immediate

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.479
and long term health goals
and psychological goals.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.373
And even some habits

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:05.500
that can really undermine
our overall life goals.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.620
So today we're going to talk
about making, meaning forming,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.061
and breaking, meaning
stopping, various habits.

00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:14.760
There's a lot of information
out there about habits.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.270
You'll find this in the popular sphere.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.570
There are books, there are
articles, there are workshops,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.840
and so forth.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.850
However, lesser known is that
there's a whole neuroscience

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.840
of habit formation and habit breaking.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.940
And there's a whole field
of psychology devoted

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.170
to understanding habit
formation and habit breaking.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.410
And within those scientific literatures,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.360
I think there are some real gems that,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.430
at least to my knowledge,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.030
we haven't paid too much attention to

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.550
in the popular sphere.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.383
So today,

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:41.200
we're going to talk about the
biology of habit formation

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.200
and habit breaking.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.250
I'm going to boil these down
to some very explicit steps

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.300
that anyone can use.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.580
My reasoning for doing
that is, first of all,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.650
it's the end of 2021.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.690
Many people are thinking
about new year's resolutions.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.950
They're thinking about leaving
some things behind from 2021

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.170
and previous.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.274
And acquiring some new behaviors,

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:08.930
taking on some new challenges,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.710
and trying to bring new
things to their lives.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.494
But regardless of when
you're listening to this,

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:14.790
the programs that I'll outline

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.250
are grounded in the neuroscience

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.150
and biology of habit formation.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.310
And they map very well

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.100
to what the psychologists have described,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.120
in terms of habit formation and breaking.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.570
So today you're going to
learn a lot of science,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.326
you're also going to come
away with some practical tools

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:28.810
and I'm certain that regardless
of your present state

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.500
or goals, there'll be
something of value to you.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.090
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.850
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.560
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.380
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.210
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.110
about science and science related tools

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.390
to the general public.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.280
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.423
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:46.423 --> 00:02:48.712
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:02:48.712 --> 00:02:50.920
Athletic greens is in all-in-one vitamin,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.670
mineral, probiotic drink.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.170
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.670
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.230
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.520
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.580
that because of the
ingredients it contains,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.840
I know that I'm covering
all of my foundation needs

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.230
for vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.920
There is a wealth of knowledge
now pointing to the fact

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.167
that the so-called
gut-brain axis is important

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.280
for our brain health,
for our metabolic health,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.520
for our hormone health,
for our immune system,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.830
so the probiotics, vitamins,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.750
and minerals really support that system.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.020
And many of the other things it contains

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.770
generally support our health,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.960
in terms of neural
system, meaning the brain,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.221
the spinal cord, et cetera.

00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:32.130
Basically, Athletic Greens
has all the things I need,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.290
nothing I don't, and by
taking it once or twice a day,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.250
I always feel better

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.594
and I know that I'm covering all my bases.

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.310

or on the plane, et cetera.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.100
Plus, a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.890

of the five free travel packs

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.390
plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.110
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.090
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.216
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.250
to help you better understand your body

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.900
and help you reach your health goals.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.628
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood-work done

00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:18.680
for the simple reason
that most of the factors

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.740
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.150
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.550
And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.300
you can also get insight
into your particular needs

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.566
for your genetic type.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:33.290
Now, a major issue with
a lot of blood tests

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.380
and DNA tests out there is
you get the numbers back,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.560
you get a lot of information back,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.226
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:40.370
InsideTracker makes that very easy.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.087
They have a personalized platform

00:04:42.087 --> 00:04:43.880
where you get your numbers

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.770
and it points to specific
things that you can do,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.350
in terms of behavioral protocols,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.764
meaning things you perhaps
should do more of or less of,

00:04:49.764 --> 00:04:51.670
nutritional protocols,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.126
things that you perhaps should
ingest more of or less of,

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.410
and various things that you might consider

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.650
for more elaborate, directed approaches

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.695
to adjusting the numbers in
your blood and DNA profiles.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:02.723
Another feature of InsideTracker,

00:05:02.723 --> 00:05:05.520
is that it has what's
called "The Inner Age Test".

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.800
This test allows you to see
what your biological age is

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.830
and compare that to
your chronological age.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.663
Of course,

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:12.820
your biological age is the
one that you can control

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.290
and that's the one that's really important

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.160
to your immediate and long-term health.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.560
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.460

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.130
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.700
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.696
that I truly believe
are the best out there.

00:05:35.696 --> 00:05:37.950
I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.070
for about a year now

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.476
and it's the best sleep I've ever had.

00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:43.193
One thing that makes Helix
mattresses really unique

00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:46.490
is that they are tailored
to your unique sleep needs.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.240
You can go to their
website, you take a quiz,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.720
it only takes about two minutes,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.670
and it will match your body
type and sleep preferences

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.090
to a particular mattress.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.167
So, it will ask you questions such as,

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.987
"Do you sleep on your side,
you back, or your stomach?"

00:05:57.987 --> 00:05:59.700
"Do you tend to run hot
or cold during the night?"

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.718
Maybe you don't know.

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:02.950
You answer those questions
and it matches you

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.640
to the mattress that's right for you.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.610
For me, that turned out to be
the Dusk Mattress, D U S K.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.980
I wanted a mattress that
wasn't too firm, not too soft.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.550
Anyway, I matched to the Dusk.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.980
I've been sleeping on a Dusk Mattress,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.450
as I mentioned before.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.050
It's been the best experience for me.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.563
My sleep is so improved.

00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:19.610
So if you're interested
in upgrading your mattress

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.880
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.160
take their two-minute sleep quiz,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.470
and they'll match you to a
customized mattress for you.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.330
And you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.740
and two free pillows.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.280
Again, go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.613
take their quiz, match to the
mattress that's right for you,

00:06:34.613 --> 00:06:36.150
and if you decide to purchase it,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.970
you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.190
and two free pillows.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.620
They have a ten-year warrantee

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.660
and if you want to try
it out, you can do that

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.080
for 100 nights risk-free.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.340
They'll even pick the mattress up for you

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.173
if you don't love it,

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:49.240
but I'm pretty confident that you will.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.728
Again, helixsleep.com/huberman

00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:54.140
is where you'll find the
Helix mattress for you.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.820
Let's talk about habits.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.650
And anytime we're talking about habits,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.653
that means our nervous
system learns something.

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:04.196
Now, many people think that
habits are just like reflexes,

00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:08.270
but pure reflexes are things
like the eye blink reflex.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.650
You know, something comes towards your eye

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.787
and you don't want it to get
in your eye, you'll blink.

00:07:11.787 --> 00:07:14.607
Or if you happen to
step on a sharp object,

00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:17.170
or get too close to
something that's too hot,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.910
you'll reflexively move away.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.850
Those aren't habits.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.442
Those are what we call
hard-wired reflexes.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.995
Habits are things that our
nervous system learned,

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:27.940
but not always consciously.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.178
Sometimes we develop habits
that we're not even aware of

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:32.390
until they become a problem

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.090
or maybe they serve us well.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.000
Who knows?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.019
But the fact of the matter is

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:38.359
that habits are a big part of who we are.

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:43.359
What we do habitually makes up
much of what we do entirely.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.263
In fact, it's estimated

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:47.796
that up to 70% of our
waking behavior is made up

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:50.023
of habitual behavior.

00:07:50.023 --> 00:07:53.308
So, you can imagine that
there's a lot of biology,

00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:56.520
meaning cells and hormones and
neural pathways, et cetera,

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.740
that are going to support
development of those habits.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.430
So if habits are largely, learned,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.532
consciously or unconsciously,

00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:05.230
we have to ask ourselves,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.260
what is learning?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.910
Well, learning is neuroplasticity.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.410
Neuroplasticity is simply the process

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.280
by which our nervous system changes

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.861
in response to experience.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.970
We have to ask, what changes?

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.870
Well, what changes are the
connections between neurons.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.260
Neurons are just nerve cells.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.700
They communicate with one
another by electricity

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.100
and by sending chemical
signals to one another

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.650
that inspire the next
neuron and the next neuron

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.797
to either electrically active or not.

00:08:30.797 --> 00:08:32.260
But at the end of the day,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.460
neuroplasticity is about
forming new neural circuits,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.660
new pathways by which certain
habits are likely to occur,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.572
and other ones are less likely to occur.

00:08:40.572 --> 00:08:41.862
So, we've got habits.

00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:44.110
We have that habits are learned,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.660
we have that learning
involves neuroplasticity,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.650
and that neuroplasticity involves changes

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.170
in the connections between
neurons, nerve cells.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.810
Okay, so that describes
habits through the lens

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.940
of neuroscience and biology,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.737
but as many of you are well aware,

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.807
there are popular books about habits

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:02.208
and there's a whole psychological
literature about habits,

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.610
and those two areas point

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.550
to some very interesting aspects of habits

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.150
that I think are worth mentioning.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.620
First of all is this notion
of immediate goal-based habits

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.927
versus identity-based habits.

00:09:15.927 --> 00:09:18.720
Immediate goal-based habits
are going to be habits

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.223
that are designed to bring
you a specific outcome

00:09:21.223 --> 00:09:22.850
as you do them,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.600
so each and every time you do them.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.433
So for instance,

00:09:25.433 --> 00:09:28.047
it might be that you want to
develop a habit of getting,

00:09:28.047 --> 00:09:32.326
you know, 60 minutes of
zone II cardio each day,

00:09:32.326 --> 00:09:36.910
or perhaps 3-4 times per week,
as we head into the new year.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.240
I've talked before on the
podcast about the fact

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.307
that the scientific literature

00:09:40.307 --> 00:09:41.880
and the health literature really points

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.220
to the incredibly positive effects

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.096
of getting 150 minutes to
180 minutes per week minimum

00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:50.290
of what's called zone II cardio.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.476
Zone II cardio is basically
any cardiovascular exercise

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:56.230
that gets you moving,
and your heart pumping,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.582
and breathing,

00:09:57.582 --> 00:09:59.210
but not so hard that you
can't hold a conversation,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.072
and so that kind of puts
you at the threshold

00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:02.905
of just being just able
to have a conversation

00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:03.990
that's a little bit strained,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.990
but if you were to exercise
a little bit harder,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.130
you know, run a little
bit faster, et cetera,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.987
you wouldn't be able to
talk while you did it.

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:12.190
There's a lot of literature
that points to that

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.700
as a healthy practice.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.240
So maybe you're somebody that wants

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.047
to get more of zone II
cardio, for instance.

00:10:18.047 --> 00:10:21.476
That would be an
immediate goal-based habit

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:25.130
if your goal is to get that cardio,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.290
maybe 4 times a week.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.250
Every time you do it you
check off a little box

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.540
and you say, "Okay, I did
it." You met the goal.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.100
That is different than
so-called identity-based habits

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.580
where there's a larger,
over-arching theme to the habit,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.777
where you're trying to
become, quote unquote,

00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:42.800
"a fit person".

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.190
Or you're somebody who
wants to be an athlete

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.180
or something of that sort.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.780
It's where you start to attach
some sort of larger picture

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.330
about yourself or what it
means for you to do that habit

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.320
where there's both the
immediate goal, right?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.990
Complete the exercise,
complete the session,

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.258
or whatever it is, check off that box.

00:11:01.258 --> 00:11:03.910
But that you're linking it
to some sort of larger goal.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.380
Now, why am I making this distinction?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.320
I mean, first of all,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.200
I'm not the one to first
make this distinction.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.067
Others have made the
distinction between identity

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:12.541
versus immediate
goal-based habit formation.

00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:14.350
But the reason I'm
making the distinction is

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.007
that pretty soon in our discussion today

00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:18.470
we are going to talk about dopamine,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.270
a molecule that's associated
with motivation and reward,

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.029
that we make in our brain,

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:27.764
and how different schedules
of dopamine release

00:11:27.764 --> 00:11:31.513
predict where we will
stick to a habit or not.

00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:32.610
And in particular,

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.082
whether or not we will be able
to form that habit quickly

00:11:35.082 --> 00:11:35.915
or not.

00:11:35.915 --> 00:11:39.340
Now, this is absolutely
critical to understand

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.810
for the following reason.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.960
Another thing that you'll hear
out there in the literature

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.280
is that it takes 21 days to form a habit.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.640
Some people say 18, some people say 21,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.094
some people say 30 days,
some people say 60 days.

00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:51.310
So which one is it?

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.510
Does it depend on the habit
that one is trying to form?

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.670
Or does it depend on the person

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.400
that's trying to form the habit?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.233
Well, it turns out

00:11:57.233 --> 00:11:59.630
that there's excellent
peer-reviewed data on this.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.020
There's a study published in 2010,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.436
first author Lally, L A L L Y.

00:12:03.436 --> 00:12:04.870
This study found that,

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.441
for the same habit to be formed,

00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:10.740
it can take anywhere from 18 days

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.620
to as many as 254 days
for different individuals

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.620
to form that habit.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.307
The reason I bring this up,
is that I always get asked,

00:12:18.307 --> 00:12:20.947
"Is it true that it takes
21 days to form a habit?"

00:12:20.947 --> 00:12:23.527
"Is it true that your nervous
system changes in six days"

00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:25.640
"when you're doing something repeatedly?"

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.010
And the answer is, as I mentioned before,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.460
it's highly variable.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.730
What I didn't tell you actually,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.470
is what specific habit
they were looking at

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.040
in that Lally study.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.550
And it's interesting that
the specific behavior

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.700
was a health-related behavior.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.360
That's pretty relevant
to our discussion here,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.340
on the podcast.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.780
Which was taking walks after dinner.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.000
There's actually a really nice literature

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.370
showing that walks after a meal

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.310
can speed glucose clearance
from the blood stream,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.410
can be beneficial for
not just weight loss,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.640
but cardiovascular health, et cetera.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.260
So a walk after dinner seems
pretty straight-forward, right?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.141
Well, in order to form that habit,

00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:05.100
it took some people 18 days
and other people 254 days.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.440
How did they know when
they formed the habit?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.415
Well, they were doing
it about 85% of the time

00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:12.410
and they also reported not having to spend

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.430
that much mental effort in
order to get into to the mode

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.950
of taking a walk after dinner.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.030
So, for those of you listening,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.937
some of you might be thinking,

00:13:19.937 --> 00:13:22.667
"I can't believe that it would
take certain people 254 days"

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.210
"to get into that habit."

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.266
As I said, people are highly variable

00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:29.130
and if you can't form one habit easily,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.538
it doesn't mean that you can't
form other habits easily.

00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:34.670
The mystery of why certain people

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.360
can form certain habits
more easily than others?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.730
Probably has something to
do with how people manage

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.390
what's called limbic friction.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.972
Now, limbic friction is not a
term that you're going to find

00:13:44.972 --> 00:13:47.720
in the formal neurobiological literature

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.490
or even some of the
psychological literature.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.486
It's, frankly, a term that I coined

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:54.900
to encompass a number of different pieces

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.480
of the psychology and
neuroscience literature.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.730
Limbic friction is a short-hand way

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.120
that I use to describe
the strain that's required

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.000
in order to overcome one of
two states within your body.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.910
One state is one of anxiousness,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.930
where you're really anxious

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.510
and therefore you can't
calm down, you can't relax,

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.000
and therefore you can't engage
in some particular activity

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.830
or thought pattern that you would like.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.210
The other state is one in
which you're feeling too tired

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.670
or lazy or not motivated.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.140
Both of those states, feeling too alert

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.800
and too calm, if you will,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.660
relate to the function

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.690
of the so-called autonomic nervous system,

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.750
a set of neurons and hormones
and chemicals in your brain

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.690
and body that act as sort of a see-saw.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.170
You're either alert or calm.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.250
You're either asleep or stressed.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.300
Those two states are not
compatible with one another.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.990
You've probably heard of "wired and tired"

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.040
but that's really once
you've been very stressed

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.550
for a long time, to the
point where you're exhausted.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.220
What does the autonomic
nervous system have to do

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.053
with any of this?

00:14:50.053 --> 00:14:53.095
Well, limbic friction is a phrase

00:14:53.095 --> 00:14:55.840
that can be used to
describe how much effort,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.510
how much activation energy you need

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.690
in order to engage in
a particular behavior.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.300
So, using this Lally study as an example,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.367
some people would eat
dinner, and then say,

00:15:05.367 --> 00:15:07.367
"Oh, that's right, I've been
trying to develop the habit"

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:08.977
"of taking a walk after dinner."

00:15:08.977 --> 00:15:10.470
"So, let's get up and go."

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.303
Other people will feel like,

00:15:11.303 --> 00:15:12.670
"I just don't want to do it today."

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.640
They're going to feel
too much limbic friction

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.750
and that limbic friction
could arrive, again,

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.110
from one of two sources.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.550
It could be because they
are too tired to do it

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.690
or it could be because they're too anxious

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.000
and distracted in order to do it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.190
So, this is a key distinction.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.080
A lot of habit formation has to do

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.960
with being in the right state of mind

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.420
and being able to control
your state of body and mind.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.440
So as we march forward,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.325
what you're going to
find is that this phrase

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:39.000
or this term, limbic friction,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.620
is going to be a useful metric

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.830
or a way for you to touch in with yourself

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.040
and address whether or not you are likely

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.140
to be able to form a certain habit easily

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.230
or whether or not it's going
to be very challenging.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.750
And I'm going to teach you a way

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.160
to measure your degree of limbic friction.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.730
That is, how much activation
energy it will take

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.710
in order for you to execute a new habit.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.000
And I'm going to teach you

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.590
how to measure your limbic friction

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.970
and activation energy for how likely it is

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.340
that you're going to be
able to break a habit

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.960
that you don't want to have.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.200
The other key concept for us to address

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.240
that's really mainly found in the books

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.220
and articles out there about habits,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.850
is this notions of what
I call linchpin habits.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.910
Linchpin habits are certain habits

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.669
that make a lot of other
habits easier to execute.

00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:23.880
Now, the sorts of linchpin habits

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.220
that I'm referring to are
always going to be things

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.910
that you enjoy doing.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.827
I'll just give you an
example from my life.

00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:31.726
I happen to like exercise.

00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:33.306
Not all forms of exercise,

00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:35.800
but I happen to like resistance training

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.260
and I happen to like running.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.350
So I'm personally in the habit

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.480
of getting cardiovascular
exercise 3 or 4 times per week.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.150
Maybe 30-60 minutes per session.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.910
And I'm in the habit of
doing resistance training 3

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.380
or 4 times per week,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.990
typically also for about 45
to 60 minutes per session.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.169
Now, I enjoy those,

00:16:53.169 --> 00:16:55.810
and for reasons that I'll
get into a little bit later,

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.723
I enjoy those activities
typically early in the day

00:16:58.723 --> 00:17:00.186
because of the neurochemistry

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.020
and the various types
of hormones, et cetera,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.890
that are associates with
performing those activities.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.410
But I really place those
activities under the umbrella

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.030
of what I call linchpin habits.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.760
Why? Because those
particular habits are easy

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.540
to execute because I enjoy them.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.560
But they also make a lot of
other habits easier to execute.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.696
Things like being alert for work,

00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:24.550
things like making sure

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.280
that I get good sleep the night before,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.530
things like hydration,

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.610
things like making sure
that I eat the foods

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.320
that are better for me than
some of the other foods

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.670
that maybe I would more
reflexively reach to

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.420
if I weren't doing that training.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.210
So certain habits act as linchpins,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.370
meaning that they shift
a lot of other things.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.174
They can control and
bias the likelihood that,

00:17:44.174 --> 00:17:46.009
in this case you or me,

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:49.023
will perform other habits
that are harder to access,

00:17:49.023 --> 00:17:52.140
that we have less of an affinity for.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.010
So again,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.020
there's three concepts that
we need to include here.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.040
We've got identity-based
versus goal-based habits.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.920
We've got the concept that
typically different habits

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.070
take different periods of time to adopt,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.800
depending on the person and the habit.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.449
And that there are these,
what I call linchpin habits.

00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:11.030
Certain habits that make other
habits easier to execute.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.380
And those linchpin habits

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.330
always, always, always are
things that we enjoy doing.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.050
So our goal throughout this
episode is for you to identify

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.090
which habits are easy for you to perform,

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.040
which ones are hard for you to perform,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.020
and which habits you want to break.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.100
If you want to grab a pen
and paper, you can do that.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.210
Or if you want to dictate
some of that into your phone,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.320
you can.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.360
But right now, actually,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.380
if you just want to think
about these concepts,

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.688
you can always go back later,

00:18:35.688 --> 00:18:38.660
I'll be sure to spell
out a very specific way

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.410
that you can chart out a map

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.857
towards forming particular habits

00:18:41.857 --> 00:18:44.870
and breaking particular habits later on.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.290
What I'd like us to do at this point is

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.445
to take that concepts of limbic friction

00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:51.526
and for you to ask yourself

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:54.478
what habits you perform on a daily basis,

00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:57.460
and these could be things as basic

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.840
as brushing your teeth before breakfast,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.270
or brushing your teeth after breakfast.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.950
It could be, for instance,
that you get exercise

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.510
or you get it at a particular time of day,

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.320
or even that you take a
particular route to work, right?

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.268
We are very habitual

00:19:09.268 --> 00:19:12.530
and we tend to do things
more or less over and over

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.150
in the same way, unless
we intervene in ourselves.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.703
That's just the way that we are wired.

00:19:16.703 --> 00:19:18.380
So now I'd like you to shift

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.170
to thinking about a
particular aspect of habits

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.303
and that's habit strength.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.250
Now, you all have different habits.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.320
You probably brush your teeth
at a particular time of day,

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.396
you probably exercise at
particular times of week,

00:19:30.396 --> 00:19:33.160
you probably go to the refrigerator
in a very habitual way.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.350
We are incredibly habitual organisms.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.810
Unless we intervene in our habits,

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.200
they tend to carry out the
same way that they always have

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.690
once they've formed.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.170
So you can do this exercise now,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.830
you don't have to write this
down if you don't want to,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.284
but you certainly are welcome.

00:19:46.284 --> 00:19:49.300
We're going to evaluate
what's called habit strength.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.850
That's not a concept that I created.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.750
Habit strength is something

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.210
that you will find in the
psychological literature.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.430
Habit strength is measured
by two main criteria.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.777
The first, is how
context-dependent a give habit is.

00:20:01.777 --> 00:20:03.979
So, context dependence is,

00:20:03.979 --> 00:20:07.470
if you go from one
environment to the next,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.050
do you tend to do the same thing,

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.290
in the same way, at the same time of day?

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.123
So, for instance,

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:13.480
brushing your teeth firs
thing in the morning.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.080
Maybe some of you do
that before breakfast,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.350
maybe some of you do that later,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.377
maybe some of you, like me,
don't even eat breakfast.

00:20:18.377 --> 00:20:22.130
But when I travel, I tend
to brush my teeth at more

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.460
or less the same time of day
relative to when I wake up

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.450
as I do when I'm at home.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.310
So it's context independent.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.440
So it's a very strong habit, right?

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.281
There are certain behaviors,

00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:35.568
like perhaps what you eat,

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:38.300
or, you know, perhaps how you dress,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.510
that are context independent,

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.483
that you might perform
one way in one context,

00:20:43.483 --> 00:20:45.800
and another way in another context.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.610
The other aspect of habit strength is

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.760
how much limbic friction is required

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.040
to perform that habit on a regular basis.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.620
This is extremely important

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.340
because if you are in the
process of building habits

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.193
and consolidating those habits,

00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:03.650
then it's probably going to
take more limbic friction

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.270
to execute those habits.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.103
What do I mean by that?

00:21:06.103 --> 00:21:08.726
Well, let's say you set out to get,

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:12.710
let's say 45 minutes of zone
II cardio exercise every day,

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.819
5 or maybe even 7 days a week.

00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:18.340
Well, if at first you're highly motivated,

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.540
limbic friction might be pretty low.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.740
Limbic friction is how much top-down,

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.940
meaning from your fore-brain
to your limbic system,

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.800
the part of you brain that
generates autonomic responses,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.270
how much limbic friction,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:35.270
meaning conscious over-ride
of your state is required

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.440
in order to engage in
that particular behavior.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.760
So, if you're feeling particularly tired

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.160
and you don't want to get out of bed,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.003
and you don't want to go out
and do your zone II cardio,

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:44.534
then there's a high
degree of limbic friction.

00:21:44.534 --> 00:21:47.340
It takes, some people
think of it as motivation,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.330
but motivation is a
bit of a vague concept,

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.950
whereas limbic friction involves
specific neural circuits

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.310
and you can think of it in a
more or less quantitative way.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.820
You can think of that
your body is very tired,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.460
so it's going to take more limbic friction

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.300
in order to get into action.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.133
Right?

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:02.420
You're going to have to
overcome more limbic friction,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.253
excuse me.

00:22:03.253 --> 00:22:04.906
Whereas if you're very, very alert,

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:06.680
there's less limbic friction

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.210
because you're moving toward something

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.840
that's action oriented.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.628
However, the inverse is also true.

00:22:11.628 --> 00:22:14.660
Let's say that you are
trying to get into the habit,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.910
or you're in the early
stages of forming a habit

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.245
to meditate regularly.

00:22:18.245 --> 00:22:22.040
That's a pretty quiescent
or calming activity,

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.590
so if you're somebody
who comes home from work

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.360
and you're very anxious and
you have a lot of work to do

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.030
and you have to deal
with a bunch of things,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.290
there's a lot of limbic
friction to overcome

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.426
in order to get into that calm state.

00:22:32.426 --> 00:22:35.860
So these two aspects, context dependence,

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.520
whether or not you're like to do the thing

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.620
regardless of where you are.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.150
Right? On travel, at home, on vacation,

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.520
with people around, not
people around, et cetera.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.671
And how much limbic friction is required

00:22:46.671 --> 00:22:48.430
to execute that habit,

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.550
will tell you whether or
not that habit is deeply

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:54.470
or just shallowly embedded
within your nervous system.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.710
The goal of any habit that we want to form

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.960
is to get into what's called automaticity.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.850
Automaticity is fancy language

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.580
for the neural circuits can
perform it automatically,

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.557
and that's the ultimate place to be.

00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:08.344
All right, if you have all these goals

00:23:08.344 --> 00:23:10.400
and things that you want to
be doing on a regular basis,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.040
you'd love for them to be habitual

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.693
because it takes less
mental and physical effort,

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.340
less limbic friction,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.870
in order to execute those.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.870
And so much of what's out there,

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.360
again in the popular
psychology literature,

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.360
in books that you'll find
on the bookstore shelf

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.150
and on Amazon, and in the airports,

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.450
are about how to get

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.870
from that mode of high
degree of limbic friction

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.170
to automaticity.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.070
And they offer a number of different ways,

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.497
I think many of which are useful,

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:37.220
trying to get you to organize
different types of habits

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.990
into different bins, like
value-based, and goal-based,

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.430
and trying to persuade you

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.930
that structuring habits at
the particular times of day

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.070
or in a particular way are
going to be beneficial,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.480
and indeed, I think they
have helped a lot of people.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.890
So what I'd like to do is to
take the scientific literature

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.610
of how the nervous system learns

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.400
and engages in plasticity,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.040
and apply that to habit formation,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.920
habit maintenance, and if so desired,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.060
how to break particular habits.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.850
I'd like to give you a particular tool

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.450
that's gleaned from the
research psychology literature.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.580
I should mention that I learned about this

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.590
from an excellent review article

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.570
that's available online.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.390
It's called Psychology of Habit.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.090
The authors are Wendy
Wood and Dennis Ruenger,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.250
this is published in Annual
Review of Psychology.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.004
The Annual Reviews series is
a very high quality series.

00:24:25.004 --> 00:24:27.730
There are annual reviews of neuroscience,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.070
annual reviews of psychology,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.270
annual reviews of nutrition
science, et cetera.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.103
For those of you

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:34.060
that are interested in
exploring review articles

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.010
that are grounded in hundreds of quality,

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.490
peer-reviewed studies,

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.090
the Annual Review series
is really terrific.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.320
Certainly among the best, if not the best.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.910
And they also tend to be quite
long and quite comprehensive.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.743
So this review, Psychology
of Habit by Wood

00:24:46.743 --> 00:24:49.728
and Ruenger, is excellent.

00:24:49.728 --> 00:24:53.430
And here I'm more or less
paraphrasing from them,

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:57.010
so I want to be clear that
these are their words, not mine.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.639
They're talking about the various ways

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:01.617
that habits form in the nervous system

00:25:01.617 --> 00:25:05.997
and they mention, with
each repetition of a habit,

00:25:05.997 --> 00:25:09.199
small changes occur in the
cognitive and neural mechanisms

00:25:09.199 --> 00:25:11.680
associated with procedural memory.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.990
So I just want to talk for a second

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.578
about what procedural memory is.

00:25:14.578 --> 00:25:16.670
In the neuroscience of memory,

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.310
we distinguish between
what's called episodic memory

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.890
and procedural memory.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.930
Episodic memory is a recall
of a particular set of events

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:25.763
that happened,

00:25:25.763 --> 00:25:27.060
whereas procedural memory

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.840
is holding in mind the
specific sequence of things

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.780
that need to happen

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.545
in order for a particular
outcome to occur.

00:25:32.545 --> 00:25:35.353
So think of it like a
recipe or a protocol,

00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:37.480
or for the sake of exercise,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.560
it's like sets and reps,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.570
or a particular course that
you're going to run or cycle,

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.500
or the number of laps you're going to swim

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.642
and how you're going to perform it.

00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:49.838
It's very clear that for anyone
trying to adopt new habits,

00:25:49.838 --> 00:25:54.040
getting into the mindset of
procedural memory is very useful

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.970
for overcoming that barrier
that we call limbic friction.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.960
How do you do that?

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.660
Well, a simple visualization exercise,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.377
or it doesn't even have
to be done eyes closed.

00:26:03.377 --> 00:26:05.640
You know, often times we
hear visualization exercise,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.790
you think about sitting in a
lotus position, eyes closed,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.040
you know, trying really
hard to visualize something.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.010
Doesn't need to be anything like that.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:16.259
It can simply be, if you are
deciding to adopt a new habit,

00:26:16.259 --> 00:26:19.890
to just think about the very
specific sequence of steps

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.492
that's required to execute that habit.

00:26:22.492 --> 00:26:24.654
And I'll use a trivial example,

00:26:24.654 --> 00:26:26.660
but this could be applied to anything.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.670
Let's say I want to get into
the habit of making myself,

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.130
or someone else in my household,

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.039
a cup of espresso every morning,

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:36.690
I would actually think
through each of those steps.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.250
Walk into the kitchen, turn
on the espresso machine,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.270
draw the espresso.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.120
Walking through each of those
steps, from start to finish,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.423
and it turns out just that
simple mental exercise done once

00:26:47.423 --> 00:26:50.690
can shift people towards
a much higher likelihood

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.090
of performing that habit regularly,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.470
not just the first time,

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.990
but as they continue out into the days

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.170
and weeks that follow.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.300
So that's remarkable to me

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.330
and the literature is really robust.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.043
Just one mental exercise
of thinking through

00:27:04.043 --> 00:27:07.070
what are the sequence of steps required

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.304
in order to perform this
habit from start to finish

00:27:09.304 --> 00:27:13.390
can shift the likelihood of
being able to perform that habit

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.790
from unlikely or moderately likely,

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.470
to very likely over time.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.225
And that's because it
pulls from this process

00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:22.930
that involves our
hippocampus and our neocortex

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.350
and other areas of our
brain and nervous system,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.910
that engage in procedural memory.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.824
It shifts the brain towards
a mindset, if you will.

00:27:29.824 --> 00:27:33.630
It's more of a neural circuit
set, would be more accurate.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.660
But a mindset/neural circuit set

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.000
of doing things in a particular sequence,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.790
which allows that limbic
friction to come down

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.230
and increases the likelihood

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.506
that we're going to perform that thing.

00:27:45.506 --> 00:27:46.907
Simple tool but very powerful too,

00:27:46.907 --> 00:27:48.550
according to the psychology literature.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.780
And actually, the cellular
and molecular mechanisms

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.730
that underlie that sort
of procedural memory,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.383
stepping through phenomenon are known.

00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:59.870
In this article I mentioned,
this beautiful review,

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.540
they talk about so
called Hebbian learning.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.250
Donald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.880
and birthed this field
that has now lasted, gosh,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.910
more than 50 years and
is still very strong

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.700
in neuroscience and psychology
of Hebbian learning.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.390
Hebbian learning is when
particular neurons are co-active,

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:19.680
meaning when they fire together,

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.540
they tend to strengthen their connections

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.410
with one another.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.390
And it has a number of different cellular

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.360
and molecular features

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.760
that we don't have to go into in detail,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.010
but for those of you that want to know,

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.080
I know some of you are hungry

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.466
for a little bit more neuroscience,

00:28:31.466 --> 00:28:34.700
this involves things like NMDA receptors

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.153
and methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

00:28:37.153 --> 00:28:39.180
NMDA receptors are
really important I think

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.690
for everyone to understand.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.290
So I'll just tell you a
little bit about them.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.110
These are receptors that
are on the neuron's surface

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.840
and normally they don't contribute much

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.470
to the activity of those neurons.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.720
Those neurons are perfectly
capable of doing their thing

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.260
without activation of this NMDA receptor.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.900
But when a neuron gets
a very strong input,

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.440
a strong stimulus,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.374
that NMDA receptor triggers
a number of mechanisms

00:29:00.374 --> 00:29:01.850
that recruit

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.450
to the surface of the
neuron more other receptors.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.460
In other words, it makes
that neuron more responsive

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.647
to input in the future

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:11.410
such that it doesn't
require so much input.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.153
In other words, it takes a neuron

00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:16.221
that is very unlikely to fire

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.440
and makes it more likely to fire.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.370
So this procedural stepping through

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.670
of the steps of the recipe

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.440
or the series of actions
steps that are involved

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.160
in sitting down to study
and writing for an hour,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.740
or generating exercise,

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.650
whatever is the habit that
you're trying to learn.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.370
When you're doing that exercise,

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.730
it's not as if your nervous system

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.590
thinks you're actually
performing that behavior.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.880
Your nervous system isn't stupid.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.530
It's actually a lot smarter than that.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.090
It knows the difference between
a thought and an action,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.170
but when you do that,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.370
it sets in motion the same neurons

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.060
that are going to be required

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.920
for the execution of that habit.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.436
And so when you actually show
up to perform that habit,

00:29:50.436 --> 00:29:53.600
it's as if the dominoes fall more easily.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.480
It's a lower threshold, as we say,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.530
in order to get the habit to perform.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.870
So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors,

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.330
all that nuts and bolts stuff.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.700
Really the guts of the
mechanisms of how this works.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.811
But for those of you that just want

00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:09.960
to be more habitual about certain things,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.950
be able to perform certain
things more reflexively,

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.220
that you would like in your life,

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.200
simply take the time,
do it once, maybe twice,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.650
and just sit down, close
your eyes if you like,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.220
and just step through the procedure

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.772
of what it's going to take in
order to perform that habit.

00:30:22.772 --> 00:30:25.130
The psychology literature, as I mentioned,

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.926
and also the neuroscience literature,

00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:28.649
strongly supports the fact

00:30:28.649 --> 00:30:31.240
that it is going to make it far easier

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.680
for you to adopt and maintain that habit.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.600
And if you are somebody who
used to perform a habit,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.060
and you don't understand
why you dropped it,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.550
and you're frustrated with yourself,

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.720
and you're trying to figure out

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.800
how you can get back into that habit,

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.810
well by all means,

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.150
lean right back into that habit,

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.487
but if you're having trouble doing that,

00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:50.265
also just use the
procedural memory exercise

00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:52.502
in order to shift your nervous system

00:30:52.502 --> 00:30:54.777
towards a higher likelihood

00:30:54.777 --> 00:30:57.140
that you will return to that habit

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.130
just the same way I described for trying

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.810
to initiate a new habit.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:02.480
So now I'd like to discuss a second,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.115
and what I think is perhaps
the most powerful tool

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:09.053
for being able to acquire
and stick to new habits.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.710
This tool is rooted in what
we call neural circuits

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.210
and I do think it is important
to understand a little bit

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.420
about how those neural circuits work.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.327
For those of you that are saying,

00:31:18.327 --> 00:31:20.210
"Just tell me what to do."

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.310
I have to say, as I always say,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.503
understanding a little bit or
a lot of underlying mechanism

00:31:25.503 --> 00:31:29.220
will help solidify these concepts for you

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.220
and will help ensure that the tools

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.240
that I offer are going to make sense

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.073
and that they're going

00:31:34.073 --> 00:31:35.380
to make sense in differing contexts

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.880
and for different types of habits

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.180
that you're tying to learn.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.870
So, rather than just tell you what to do,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.247
I'm going to tell you how
this particular tool works,

00:31:42.247 --> 00:31:43.770
and then in doing that,

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.550
you should be able to
apply it to any habit,

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.792
under any conditions.

00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:48.776
The tool that I'm referring to

00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:51.810
is something called task-bracketing

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.920
and the neural circuits
associated with task-bracketing

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.570
are basically the neural circuits

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.130
that are going to allow you
to learn any new type of habit

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.568
or break any habit that
you'd like to break.

00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:05.900
We have in our brain a
set of neural circuits

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.730
that fall under the umbrella
term of the basal ganglia.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.040
The basal ganglia are
involved in action execution,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.590
meaning doing certain things,

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.893
and action suppression,
not doing certain things.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.190
In the experimental realm,

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.620
these are referred to as go, meaning do,

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.136
or no go, don't do, certain things.

00:32:25.136 --> 00:32:27.880
And some of us fall more into the category

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.839
of we find it very easy
to do certain things,

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:32.970
but harder to not do other things.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.820
Some people have a lot
of no go type circuits

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.870
that are very robust,

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.746
and they have a lot of
behavioral constraint,

00:32:39.746 --> 00:32:42.010
but they have a harder
time getting into action.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.950
And some people have a
perfect balance of both,

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.826
but I've never met one of those people.

00:32:45.826 --> 00:32:49.730
So again, drawing from,
more or less paraphrasing

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.940
from this beautiful review
that I described earlier

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.520
in Annual Review of Psychology, excuse me,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.821
by Wood and Ruenger,

00:32:57.821 --> 00:33:01.920
task-bracketing involves a
particular set of neural circuits

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.650
within the basal ganglia,

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.240
so I'm going to describe this
here, again paraphrasing,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.510
a sensory-motor loop.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.880
Sensory means just input
coming in about sight, sounds,

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.170
taste, et cetera.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.790
And then the motor systems,

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.480
the systems of the brain and
body that generate action,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.788
taking that information
and generating action.

00:33:20.788 --> 00:33:24.450
So it turns out that there's
an area of our basal ganglia

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.570
called the dorsolateral striatum,

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.570
we can use the acronym DLS.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.240
Again, dorsolateral striatum.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.250
Dorso means up. Lateral means to the side.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.083
So dorsolateral.

00:33:34.083 --> 00:33:37.760
And striatum is a subdivision
of the basal ganglia.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.383
And it's very important

00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:42.230
for the establishment of behaviors

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.240
that are associated with a habit,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.694
but not necessarily the habit itself.

00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:50.220
And beautiful studies in
both animals and humans

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.670
that record the activity in
the dorsolateral striatum

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.430
find that the dorsolateral
striatum is associated,

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.765
meaning it becomes active at the beginning

00:33:59.765 --> 00:34:01.748
of a particular habit,

00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:05.430
and at the very end and
after a particular habit.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.730
Hence the phrase task-bracketing.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.400
It brackets the habit.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.460
Now, other sets of neurons
are going to be active

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.734
during the actual execution of the habit,

00:34:13.734 --> 00:34:17.280
but what the literature on
the dorsolateral striatum

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.620
tells us is that we have
particular circuits in our brain

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.380
that are devoted to framing the events

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.300
that happened just before

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.860
and as we initiate a habit,

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.750
and just after and as
we terminate a habit.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.110
In other words, it acts
as a sort of marker

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.320
for the habit execution,

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.350
but not the execution of the habit per se.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.610
This is very important

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.880
because task-bracketing
is what underlies whether

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.320
or not a habit will be
context dependent or not,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.070
whether or not it will be strong

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.430
and likely to occur

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:51.650
even if we didn't get good
night's sleep the night before,

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.410
even if we're feeling distracted,

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:56.830
even if we're not feeling like
doing something emotionally,

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.790
or if we are, you know,
completely overwhelmed

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.645
by other events.

00:35:00.645 --> 00:35:03.481
If the neural circuits
are task bracketing,

00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:05.510
are deeply embedded in us,

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.610
meaning they are very robust
around a particular habit,

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.230
well then it's likely
that we're going to go out

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.400
for that zone II cardio no matter what,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.997
that we're going to brush
our teeth no matter what.

00:35:13.997 --> 00:35:16.100
I'm fact, brushing our teeth
is a pretty good example

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.650
because, for most people,

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.003
even if you got a terrible night's sleep,

00:35:19.003 --> 00:35:22.870
even If everything in
your life is going wrong,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.460
chances are, unless you're very depressed,

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.600
if you're going to leave to work,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.890
or even if you're not,

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.300
that you're going to still
carry out the behavior

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.610
of brushing your teeth in the morning.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.250
I would hope so, actually.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.480
But you are probably less likely

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.540
to perform particular habits

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.040
that are not what you deem as necessary.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.750
But if you think about it,

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.750
brushing your teeth, exercise,
eating particular foods,

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.900
maybe engaging socially
in particular ways,

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.410
you are the one that places
any kind of value assessment

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.780
on which ones are essential,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.810
and which ones are negotiable.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.620
So task-bracketing sets a neural imprint,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.170
a kind of a finger print in your brain,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.330
of this thing has to happen
at this particular time of day

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.610
so much so that it's reflexive.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.370
And as we'll talk about in a moment,

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.750
there's a way that you can
build up task-bracketing

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.670
so that regardless of what
it is you're trying to learn,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.490
there's a much higher probability

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:17.260
that you're going to do that thing.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.093
And when I say learn,

00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:20.250
meaning let's say you're
trying to acquire a habit

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.660
that for you is really challenging.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.240
Maybe it's that you're going
to write for an hour a day

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.190
on a book project that
you've been thinking about

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.250
or you're going to work on mathematics,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.940
or you're going to do any sort of thing

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.057
that for you there's a
lot of limbic friction.

00:36:32.057 --> 00:36:35.900
While it is important to think
about the sequence of events

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.460
that would be required in order
to engage in that behavior,

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.020
that procedural memory
visualization exercise

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.832
we talked about before, that will help,

00:36:42.832 --> 00:36:46.391
there's a way also that you
can orient your nervous system

00:36:46.391 --> 00:36:49.213
towards this task-bracketing process,

00:36:49.213 --> 00:36:52.210
so that your nervous system is shifted

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.560
or oriented towards the
execution of a given habit.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.160
So this is sort of like warming
up your body to exercise.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.690
When the dorsolateral striatum is engaged,

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.870
your body and you brain are
primed to execute a habit

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.660
and that you get to consciously insert

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.220
which habit you want to perform.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.136
So in order to leverage
the neural mechanisms

00:37:10.136 --> 00:37:11.513
of task-bracketing,

00:37:11.513 --> 00:37:13.890
in order to increase the likelihood

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.640
that you're going to
perform a particular habit,

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.360
I have to break it to you

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.720
that one thing that you've
probably heard over and over

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.030
about habit formation

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.695
is not true.

00:37:24.695 --> 00:37:27.270
And what I'm referring to is this idea

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.580
that if you're very specific
about exactly when you're going

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.910
to perform a particular habit,

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.530
that you're more likely
to perform that habit.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.570
And while that is true in the short term,

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.813
it is not true in the long term.

00:37:40.813 --> 00:37:44.270
And the reason for that is
that our nervous system tends

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.720
to generate particular kinds of behavior

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.109
based not on time, but on our state.

00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:53.420
Meaning what level of
activation is taking place

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.450
in our brain and body.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.100
How much focus we happen to have,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.360
how fatigued we are, how energized we are.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.860
So while schedules are important,

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.210
it's not the particular time of day per se

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.030
that's going to allow
you to get into a habit,

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.660
and form that habit, and
consolidate that habit.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.120
Rather, it's the state that your brain

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.250
and body are in that's
important to anchor yourself to.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.300
So now I'm going to offer you a tool.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.815
It's actually an entire program

00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:23.650
by which you can insert
particular habits and activities

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.480
at particular phases of the day,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.860
not times of day, but phases of the day,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.600
because it turns out that
particular phases of the day

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.910
are associated with particular
biological underpinnings,

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.270
chemicals and neural
circuits and so forth,

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.040
and in doing so it will
make it far more likely

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.797
that you will be able to
regularly engage in these habits

00:38:41.797 --> 00:38:44.707
and activities over a long period of time.

00:38:44.707 --> 00:38:46.790
And whether or not that
will move you from somebody

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.930
who ordinarily would take
200 days to form a habit

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.780
to one of those 18 days to habit people

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.680
in that earlier study I
mentioned, I don't know.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.980
But I am certain that will
have a significant shift

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.400
on allowing you to engage in
particular habits more easily

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.710
and to consolidate those
habits more quickly.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.620
So the program I am about to describe,

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.150
I formulated for you based on
the neuroscience literature,

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.800
and the psychology literature of learning,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.080
and this concepts of task-bracketing.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.470
It involves the 24 hour days
into what I call three phases.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.320
The first is phase one,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.020
which is 0 to 8 hours after
waking up, approximately.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.840
Okay, you can put a plus
or minus 30 minutes on this

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.220
for yourself.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.517
The second phase is the
9 to 14, maybe 15 hours

00:39:32.517 --> 00:39:34.199
after you wake up.

00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:38.210
And the third phase is 16
to 24 hours after waking up.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.770
So we've taken the 24 hour cycle,

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.730
we've carved it up into three phases,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.950
phase one, phase two, and phase three.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.840
Now, everything I'm describing,

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.790
or at least the way I'm
going to describe it,

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.420
is based on what I would
call a typical schedule,

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.580
diurnal schedule.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.610
You've heard of nocturnal?

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.380
Well, we are diurnal.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.890
Most of us are asleep at night
and awake during the day.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.110
I do realize that a number
of people have shift work

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.180
or they have newborns or other reasons

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.730
why they have to be up in
the middle of the night

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.113
and sleeping during the day.

00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:06.200
If that's the case,

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.500
please listen to the
episode we did on jet-lag

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.250
and shift work because
that has a lot of tools

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.490
specifically for that population.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.220
But most people go to sleep
somewhere around 10:00 PM,

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.690
plus or minus two hours,

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.430
and wake up some time around 7:00 AM,

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.090
plus or minus two hours.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.200
So today, I'm going to
use the to bed at 10:00 PM

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.380
and a wake up time of 7:00
AM as the framework for this,

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.334
but you could adopt it easily
to your particular schedule.

00:40:33.334 --> 00:40:37.409
Phase one, which again, is
0 to 8 hours after waking,

00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:40.660
has a particular neurochemical signature.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.659
Regardless of what you do,

00:40:42.659 --> 00:40:45.016
the neuromodulators norepinephrine

00:40:45.016 --> 00:40:46.630
as well as epinephrine,

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.710
so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline,

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.080
as well as the neuromodulator dopamine

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.280
tend to be elevated during
that first 0 to 8 hours

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.910
after waking.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.540
There are a number of reasons
for this related to the fact

00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:01.680
that also cortisol is higher
in our brain and bloodstream,

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.860
it's a healthy level of
cortisol upon waking,

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.880
body temperature is increased, et cetera.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.080
And there's several things

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.820
that perhaps we should all be doing,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.819
I've talked about many of
these on the podcast before,

00:41:10.819 --> 00:41:13.690
that in addition to those chemicals,

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.120
further support an
alert and focused state.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.470
And I'll just list those off.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.890
I've done many podcasts on each of these

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.235
if you'd like to access those
podcasts you can find them

00:41:23.235 --> 00:41:25.990
in the menu of podcasts on YouTube,

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.510
Apple, Spotify, et cetera.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.830
They involve, for instance,

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.010
viewing sunlight or
bright artificial light

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.160
if you can't access sunlight,

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.670
within the first 30 minutes of waking.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.443
Physical exercise of some kind

00:41:37.443 --> 00:41:41.100
in this phase of the day,
0 to 8 hours of the day,

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.420
ideally pretty early in that phase,

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.253
but, you know,

00:41:44.253 --> 00:41:47.300
if it has to be at the 7
to 8 hour transition point

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.440
that's fine too.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.750
Cold exposure in the form
of cold showers or ice baths

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.477
or outside with minimal clothing,

00:41:54.477 --> 00:41:57.514
appropriate yet minimal clothing.

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:59.597
Caffeine ingestion.

00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:04.520
Fasting, for instance,
not ingesting calories,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.977
also will lend itself to
increased norepinephrine

00:42:06.977 --> 00:42:08.730
and dopamine, et cetera.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.190
If you are going to consume foods,

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.410
foods that are rich in
things like tyrosine,

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.053
which is a precursor for dopamine.

00:42:14.053 --> 00:42:17.320
You can look up foods
that are high in tyrosine.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.680
And for those of you that are
interested in supplementation

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.100
and like to use those routes,

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.720
things like alpha GPC or
phenylethylamine, think,

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.760
or L-tyrosine,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.470
if that's in keeping with
what you're able to do.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.060
Of course, consult your doctor

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.270
if you're going to rely
on supplementation.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:33.140
What's this all about?

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.760
Well, the already elevated norepinephrine

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.680
and dopamine, the sunlight, exercise,

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.430
cold exposure, caffeine,
tyrosine, et cetera,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.618
all of those place the
brain and body into a state

00:42:44.618 --> 00:42:48.320
in which you are better able,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.420
or I would say, more easily able,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.410
to engage in activities

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.660
that have a high degree limbic friction

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.300
and where you need to
override that limbic friction.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.670
Right? We've heard that the
morning is kind of sacred,

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.620
conquer the hardest things
first thing in the morning,

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.820
and that's been discussed in
the pop psychology literature

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.060
and in the habit formation literature

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.290
merely from the perspective of

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.900
get it out of the way so you can feel good

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.490
about having done it.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.050
But what I'm referring
to is quite different.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.143
What I'm referring to is
a particular phase of day

00:43:17.143 --> 00:43:20.298
that after rising, after
waking up, that is,

00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:24.130
for 0 to 8 hours, right,
in that first phase,

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.500
your whole system is
action and focus oriented.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.340
And we know that when you're
action and focus oriented

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.540
and because of the neurochemicals

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.187
that are naturally released
in your brain and body

00:43:35.187 --> 00:43:39.640
that you will be more likely
to overcome any limbic friction

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.740
that stands in the way of
performing particular habits.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.090
So, as you list out or think
about the various habits

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.010
that you'd like to adopt in
your life, take the habits

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.370
for which you know
there's the highest degree

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.530
of limbic friction,

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.600
they are the hardest for you to engage in,

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.930
they require the most activation energy,

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.616
and put those in this 0
to 8 hours after waking.

00:44:01.616 --> 00:44:05.340
This will greatly
facilitate your performance

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.500
of those new habits.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.618
I'm certain of that.

00:44:07.618 --> 00:44:09.570
And in addition to that,

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.570
by doing them in this
particular phase of the day,

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.020
not necessarily the same time,

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.450
I mean, if you want to be very habitual,

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.160
and you want to do,
you know, the exercise,

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.400
or the sunlight viewing
always at the same time,

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.610
or you want to do,

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.030
you want to drink your caffeine

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.590
always at the exact
same time, that's fine,

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.330
but by placing them in this broader window

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.533
of 0 to 8 hours after waking,

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:32.040
what you're doing is you're
creating task-bracketing.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.230
You're making it such
that your nervous system

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.140
will predict when you are going to lean in

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.630
against limbic friction

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.410
in order to perform
particular types of habits.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:43.277
And this is very different than saying,

00:44:43.277 --> 00:44:44.917
"I'm always going to run" or,

00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:49.140
"I'm always going to study from
10 to 12 AM every morning."

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.510
That's great, and if you
can do that, terrific.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.730
But the literature indicates
that people who do that,

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.742
who are very rigid about
when they do things tend,

00:44:55.742 --> 00:44:57.790
because of context dependence,

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:00.980
to not necessarily stick
to those habits over time.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.000
Some people do, but
many, many people don't.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.060
So think about the hardest habits to form

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.890
and the habits that you most want to form

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.440
that are hardest for you
to adopt and to maintain

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.327
and I highly suggest
placing those somewhere

00:45:14.327 --> 00:45:18.520
within this phase one of
0 to 8 hours after waking.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.750
Now of course, some of
the things I listed out,

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.019
sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure,

00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:24.640
caffeine, fasting,

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.400
those might be the
actual habits themselves,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.081
but here I realize, or
rather I want to acknowledge

00:45:30.081 --> 00:45:32.064
that many people, including myself,

00:45:32.064 --> 00:45:34.730
are doing some or all
of these things already

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.780
and many people, including myself,

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.640
are trying to adopt new habits

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.440
that don't fall into the category

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.820
of just trying to set your overall state.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.810
Again, norepinephrine, dopamine,

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.060
and all these neural systems

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.700
will be greatly elevated in
this 0 to 8 hours after waking.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.510
However, the other things I mentioned,

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.920
sunlight exposure,
exercise, cold exposure,

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.200
caffeine, fasting, if that's for you,

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.201
or if you're eating during that phase,

00:45:58.201 --> 00:46:00.100
eating things that contain some

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.660
or elevated levels of tyrosine,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.133
maybe supplementing alpha
GPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera.

00:46:05.133 --> 00:46:09.431
All of those things further
facilitate the neurochemistry

00:46:09.431 --> 00:46:11.280
and therefore the state of mind

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.550
that's going to be ideal for
leaning into limbic friction

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.160
and overriding that limbic friction

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.150
so that you can regularly
perform that habit.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.320
What we're really talking about here

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.290
is leveraging neural systems

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:24.130
in order to help you make it more likely

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.740
that you're going to be able to engage

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.660
and maintain a particular habit.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.570
So what I'm referring to as
phase one of each day is useful

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.620
for acquiring certain habits,

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.420
but there are other phases of the day,

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.800
and those turn out to be useful

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.641
for acquiring other types of habits.

00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:41.225
Phase two, as I mentioned, is about,

00:46:41.225 --> 00:46:43.533
again these aren't specifics,

00:46:43.533 --> 00:46:47.442
but about 9 to 14 or
15 hours after waking.

00:46:47.442 --> 00:46:49.940
During this phase of the day,

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.001
because of the circadian
shifts in our biology,

00:46:53.001 --> 00:46:55.290
the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.570
that's circulating in our brain

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.809
and bloodstream tends
to start to come down

00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:03.600
and levels of cortisol
tend to start to come down.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.020
That's the ideal circumstance.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.471
In fact,

00:47:06.471 --> 00:47:08.010
you don't really want elevated
cortisol late in the day.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:09.730
That's actually a signature of depression

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:13.977
and anxiety and a number of
other unfortunate things.

00:47:13.977 --> 00:47:18.230
So, 9 to 14 hours after waking dopamine

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.700
and norepinephrine and cortisol
are starting to taper down,

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.660
just naturally.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.280
And a different neuromodulator, serotonin,

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.427
is starting to rise.

00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:29.840
Serotonin is definitely
going to be highest

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.950
in this second half of the day

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:36.690
and tends to lend itself to a
more relaxed state of being.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:37.523
Now of course,

00:47:37.523 --> 00:47:40.100
I do realize that some people
are less of morning people

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.570
and do find that they really come alive

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:42.630
and awake in the afternoon,

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:45.280
but most people don't
fall into that category.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.620
Most people feel more
alert early in the day,

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.190
even anxious early in the day,

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:50.680
and then, as the afternoon progresses,

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.860
they tend to be a bit more
sleepy, a bit more relaxed,

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.680
a bit more calm.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.970
There's certain things that we all can

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.902
and should do during this
phase two of each day

00:48:00.902 --> 00:48:03.851
that lend themselves to a state of mind

00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:07.524
and a state of body that
is going to be beneficial

00:48:07.524 --> 00:48:10.320
for the generation and consolidation

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.970
of certain types of habits.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.850
What are those things?

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:14.823
First of all, as the day goes on,

00:48:14.823 --> 00:48:16.630
you should try if you can

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.364
to start tapering the amount
of light that you're viewing.

00:48:19.364 --> 00:48:20.197
Now, this doesn't mean putting yourself

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:24.853
into dim light at 3 o'clock
4 o'clock in the afternoon.

00:48:25.775 --> 00:48:26.608
That's certainly not the case.

00:48:26.608 --> 00:48:29.200
Simply that you want to
start tapering off the amount

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.800
of really bright light
that you're getting,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.792
unless it's sunlight.

00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:34.220
Talked about this before on the podcast,

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.820
but if you haven't heard,

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.060
viewing the sun as it's at
what we call low solar angle

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.140
so it's headed toward the horizon,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.930
you don't necessarily
have to watch the sunset,

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.170
although that can be nice.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.550
But getting some sun light in your eyes

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.690
in the second half of the
day can also be beneficial

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.598
for a number of brain systems
and psychological systems

00:48:50.598 --> 00:48:52.660
so you can get some
some light in your eyes,

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.530
you can certainly have
artificial lights on,

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.246
but you want to start dimming those lights

00:48:58.246 --> 00:48:59.680
and bringing them actually
physically lower in the room

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.760
because the neurons in your eye

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.400
that view the upper visual field

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.780
they actually trigger
this alertness mechanism

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.613
in the brain and body.

00:49:07.613 --> 00:49:09.180
And in the second half of the day,

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.710
even if you're humming
around and doing work at 3

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.825
or 4 or 5 or even 7 PM,

00:49:13.825 --> 00:49:17.730
you are probably headed toward
sleep a few hours later,

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.020
so things like limiting
the total amount of light

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.080
if you can,

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.210
things like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.210
another thing that I've
talked about on this podcast.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:27.430
If you haven't heard about this before,

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.380
non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.700
for things like
meditation, for Yoga Nidra,

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.310
a very powerful science supported tool

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.437
for teaching you how to relax,

00:49:37.437 --> 00:49:39.250
things like self-hypnosis

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.860
which might sound a little
kooky to some of you,

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.380
but actually is a clinically based tool

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.680
for which there's a lot
of scientific literature.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.610
If you're interested in that

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.750
there's a great free
resource called Reverie,

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:49.842
R E V E R I E .com.

00:49:49.842 --> 00:49:53.080
There's a app for both Apple and Android.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.320
This is an app that was
developed by colleagues of mine

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.600
and researchers at Stanford
School of Medicine.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.980
You can do these short
15 self hypnosis script,

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.813
as they're called.

00:50:01.813 --> 00:50:03.830
They can teach you how to relax yourself,

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.708
there's even one for focus,
for sleep, for chronic pain,

00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:09.040
Again, all very strongly supported

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.260
by quality peer-reviewed literature.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.325
So things like Reverie, meditation,

00:50:13.325 --> 00:50:17.679
things like heat and sauna,
hot baths, hot showers.

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:20.890
Those are terrific things
to do in the second half

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:21.740
of the day,

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.110
they tend to support this serotonergic,

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.990
or high serotonin like state

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.783
and lend themselves to
more calm and relaxation.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.800
For those that are interested
in supplementation,

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.510
there's always ashwagandha,

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.610
which reduces cortisol,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:38.030
again peaks in cortisol
late in the afternoon

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.800
and evening are associated
with depression,

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.940
anxiety, and so forth.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:45.940
Ashwagandha has a pretty potent
cortisol inhibiting tool.

00:50:46.179 --> 00:50:48.790
I personally don't use it very often

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:50.720
and I caution people about using it

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.370
for longer than two-week periods of time

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.650
without taking some breaks.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:56.970
You can look up more about
ashwagandha on examine.com.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.190
There's a lot of traffic literature

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:59.680
with links to studies there.

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.810
But basically this phase two of the day

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:04.260
is one in which you're
alert, you are present

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.180
you are working, you
are engaging socially,

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.470
you're cooking dinner probably,

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.100
paying attention to a number of things,

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.110
but you should really be trying

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.930
to taper off your stress level.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.820
So how do you leverage
phase two of the day

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.325
for habit formation?

00:51:15.325 --> 00:51:16.510
Well, given what we know

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:18.670
about the neurochemistry
of learning and memory,

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.800
given what we know about task formation

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.323
and its reliance on certain
forms of neuroplasticity,

00:51:23.323 --> 00:51:25.685
the second half of the
day is a terrific time

00:51:25.685 --> 00:51:30.685
to take on habits and things
that you're already doing

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.300
that require very little
override of limbic friction.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.770
So these might be things that
categorize in common terms

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:40.270
as kind of mellower activities.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:41.439
It might be journaling,

00:51:41.439 --> 00:51:46.110
it might be that you
already are performing music

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.371
or I should say,
practicing music regularly,

00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:50.540
but there's a particular type of music

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.700
that is hard for you

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.580
or that you're working on a
particular piece of music,

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.630
or you're trying to learn a language.

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.110
Something that's a little bit challenging,

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.910
but doesn't require a ton of energy

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:01.090
in order to override that limbic friction.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.610
The second half of the day is
a much better time to do that.

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.999
Less resistance, as we might say.

00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:08.699
But of course, resistance
has a neural substrate

00:52:08.699 --> 00:52:10.650
and the reason for doing those things

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.310
in the second part of the
day, the so-called phase two,

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.120
as I've called it, part of the day is

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.390
because your ability

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:19.040
to override resistance
is really diminished

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.999
in this second phase of the day.

00:52:20.999 --> 00:52:22.447
Some of you might say,

00:52:22.447 --> 00:52:23.280
"Whoa wait,"

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.227
"I like to exercise in the
second half of the day."

00:52:25.227 --> 00:52:26.897
"That's actually when I
have the most energy."

00:52:26.897 --> 00:52:28.467
"That's when I feel warmer"

00:52:28.467 --> 00:52:29.800
"I'm not a morning exerciser."

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.770
That's absolutely fine,

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.630
but what I'm referring
to is the acquisition

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:34.736
of new behaviors

00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:38.430
and placing those consistently
at the second half of the day

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.050
in order to engage these
task-bracketing mechanisms

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.583
that I talked about before.

00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:44.670
One of the hallmark features

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:46.780
of those basal ganglia circuits for go

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.130
and no-go is that they are associated

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:52.200
with certain neurochemicals,
dopamine and serotonin,

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.280
acetylcholine, and other neurochemicals.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.681
And by placing particular habits

00:52:56.681 --> 00:52:58.710
at particular phases of the day,

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.220
those neurochemical states
start to be associated

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.020
with the leaning in and
the process of beginning,

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.850
and as I mentioned, ending
those particular habits.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.730
And in doing so they shift
the whole nervous system

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:10.881
toward being able to predict

00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:12.810
that certain things are going to happen

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:14.560
at particular times a day,

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.680
that you're going to be leaning very hard

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.150
against limbic friction early
in the day in phase one,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:20.370
and that you're going to be doing things

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:23.590
that require less conscious
override of limbic friction

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:24.423
in phase two.

00:53:24.423 --> 00:53:27.294
And in doing so, set up
task-bracketing system

00:53:27.294 --> 00:53:30.660
so that the individual
habits that you're learning

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.120
or that you're trying to learn

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.010
have a much greater
probability of being executed

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.130
and consolidated,

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.050
meaning that pretty soon that they

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.320
will just naturally become reflexive.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.010
And as with phase one, many
of the things that I mentioned

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:47.700
that support this, what I'm
calling a serotonergic state

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.616
or more relaxed state in phase two,

00:53:49.616 --> 00:53:52.751
things like seeing
sunlight in the afternoon,

00:53:52.751 --> 00:53:56.640
but not a lot of bright light
from artificial sources,

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.050
things like NSDR,

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.284
things like heat and sauna,

00:54:00.284 --> 00:54:02.542
hot baths et cetera, ashwagandha,

00:54:02.542 --> 00:54:05.210
again all of those things
themselves could be habits

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:06.980
that you're trying to adopt, right?

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.110
In that case, do those if
you'd like to explore them.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.000
They are quite beneficial
for a number of reasons,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.510
not just related to execution
of particular habits

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:16.870
in phase two of the day,

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:19.320
but also for improving quality of sleep

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.980
and consolidating any learning

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.600
that you might have
triggered earlier in the day.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.650
I've talked about that before,

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.177
but just briefly, as a relevant aside,

00:54:26.177 --> 00:54:30.100
neuroplasticity involves
triggering the neural plasticity,

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.460
setting it in motion,

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.670
but the actual rewiring of the brain

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.170
and the reconfiguration of neurons

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:37.240
that will allow that
learning to be reflexive,

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.430
that actually occurs
during states of deep rest,

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:42.389
like an NSDR and like deep sleep.

00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:43.808
And I should just mention,

00:54:43.808 --> 00:54:46.320
for those of you that can only exercise

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.160
or prefer to exercise in
phase two of the day, right,

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.728
9 to 14 hours or 15 hours after waking,

00:54:52.728 --> 00:54:54.599
that's absolutely fine.

00:54:54.599 --> 00:54:57.708
However, because of
the importance of sleep

00:54:57.708 --> 00:55:00.250
and in particular deep
sleep throughout the night

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:01.870
for not just neuroplasticity,

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.346
but recovery of muscle and other tissues

00:55:04.346 --> 00:55:07.601
that are taxed during physical exercise,

00:55:07.601 --> 00:55:10.260
if you do train in phase two,

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.197
I highly recommend, highly recommend

00:55:12.197 --> 00:55:16.180
that you start doing some
NSDR activity after you train,

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.300
within an hour or two,

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.680
because that will allow
you to taper down and relax

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.650
so that you can get into
the next phase we're going

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:23.710
to talk about, which is phase three.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:27.030
Phase three of the 24-hour schedule runs

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.383
from about 16 to 24 hours after waking.

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:32.925
During that period of time,

00:55:32.925 --> 00:55:34.010
there are few things

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.595
that are going to support
being in a state of mind,

00:55:36.595 --> 00:55:40.910
state of body that are going
to allow neuroplasticity

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.310
to occur, that are going
to allow the rewiring

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.880
that you've triggered during
the waking part of the day

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.266
to actually take place.

00:55:47.266 --> 00:55:50.655
Those things are very low to no light,

00:55:50.655 --> 00:55:53.390
meaning keeping your environment very dark

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:54.586
or very, very dim.

00:55:54.586 --> 00:55:57.620
I don't think it's
necessary to sleep in a room

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.069
that's complete blackness.

00:55:59.069 --> 00:56:01.235
I think that's a little bit overkill,

00:56:01.235 --> 00:56:03.836
but for most people keeping the room dark

00:56:03.836 --> 00:56:07.920
and keeping the room temperature
low is very beneficial

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.973
for getting and staying in deep sleep.

00:56:10.965 --> 00:56:14.080
The body has to drop
by about 1 to 3 degrees

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.770
in order to get into
sleep and stay asleep,

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.550
so low light, low temperature environment,

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:21.380
you can always pile on blankets of course

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.200
if you don't want to be cold at night,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.370
you want to be warm enough,

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.500
but you want your environment to be cold.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.217
Typically people aren't eating
in the middle of the night,

00:56:29.217 --> 00:56:32.430
although one thing that can
be useful is to make sure

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.720
that you're at least well-fed enough

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.100
when you head into this third
phase of every 24-hour day

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.560
that you're not awake
because you're hungry.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.650
A lot of people recommend putting a gap

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.010
between your final bite of food

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.460
and when you got to sleep at night.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.510
Some people say that
gap should be 4 hours,

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.350
other people say 2 hours,

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.470
if you're me, I generally
have something, I don't know,

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:54.190
within 2 hours or 90
minutes of going to sleep,

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.320
but it's not a big meal,
but that's just me,

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.591
and I fall asleep and stay
asleep fine with that.

00:56:57.591 --> 00:56:59.494
You have to experiment for yourself.

00:56:59.494 --> 00:57:01.480
I've talked about supplements

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.130
that can support sleep in
previous episode of the podcast,

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:05.860
things like magnesium threonate,

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.500
or magnesium bisglycinate,

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.970
things like theonine, apigenin.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:11.670
If you'd like to read more about those,

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:12.970
we actually have a newsletter

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:14.460
that I'll just quickly refer you to

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.630
this is the Huberman Lab
Neural Network Newsletter,

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.010
you can sign up for it by
going to hubermanlab.com,

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:21.340
it's very easy to find,

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.380
but even if you don't sign up,

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.410
you can go to the toolkit
for sleep that's listed there

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.210
and that tool kit is not just supplements,

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.980
that tool kit is a number
of different things,

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.800
both behavioral and supplement-based

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.440
and nutrition-based, et cetera,

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.120
that can allow you to get in to sleep

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.710
and to stay asleep more readily.

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:39.820
It's totally zero cost,

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.880
you can find that again
at hubermanlab.com.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.535
So things like low light, low temperature,

00:57:43.535 --> 00:57:44.869
the supplements I mentioned,

00:57:44.869 --> 00:57:47.263
adjusting your eating
schedule appropriately,

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:50.130
obviously not drinking caffeine
in the middle of the night

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.030
or too close to bed,

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.940
that's going to be critical.

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.980
In fact, ideally you
wouldn't ingest any caffeine

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.660
in phase two of the day,

00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:59.003
so that you could get into
this deeper state of rest

00:57:59.003 --> 00:58:02.833
in which habit formation and
neural plasticity can occur.

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.850
What if you wake up?

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:07.690
The way I've cast phase three is

00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:09.730
that you're supposed to
be in this deep slumber,

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:11.420
you're not supposed to wake up at all,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.650
you're supposed to be in low light

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:13.840
and your brain is rewiring

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.740
and those habits are getting
consolidated, et cetera.

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.803
Well, if you're like me,

00:58:17.803 --> 00:58:19.590
you probably get up once
in the middle of the night.

00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:20.660
Maybe go use the restroom.

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.390
Perfectly normal, perfectly normal,

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:24.473
but a lot of people have
trouble falling back asleep.

00:58:24.473 --> 00:58:26.900
Very important if you get up
in the middle of the night

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.160
to use a minimum of light

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.680
in order to navigate your surroundings,

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.230
just as much as you need
in order to safely do so,

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:35.236
because light inhibits hormone melatonin,

00:58:35.236 --> 00:58:37.190
can make it very hard
to fall back to sleep

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:38.870
if you inhibit melatonin.

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:40.186
The effects of light inhibiting melatonin

00:58:40.186 --> 00:58:41.600
are actually very potent.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.200
It happens very, very quickly,

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.630
so try and keep the lights low.

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:47.440
And you have trouble falling back asleep,

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.580
that's when you might
also want to use something

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.713
like a Reverie app,

00:58:50.713 --> 00:58:52.360
they have a sleep script there

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.490
that can hopefully help
you get back to sleep.

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.890
Or something like NSDR,

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.930
you can find NSDR scripts on YouTube.

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.260
These are zero cost.

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.093
You can look up one

00:59:00.093 --> 00:59:02.340
that I particularly like is NSDR Madefor.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.040
It's a company I'm associated with,

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.350
but the NSDR is completely zero cost,

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:07.670
and there are other things,

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:10.320
like Yoga Nidra, which you can
find scripts for elsewhere.

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.040
Again, all of these
habits or these behaviors,

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.810
these do's and don'ts around phase three,

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:17.370
themselves might be habits

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:19.580
that you're trying to create for yourself.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.840
But again, phase three is
really about making sure

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.140
that whatever limbic
friction you've been able

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.680
to override in phase one

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.350
and trigger some new habit, right?

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.870
Forcing yourself to write

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.090
or forcing yourself to study

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:32.510
or forcing yourself to exercise

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.708
during that high limbic friction state.

00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:37.200
And then whatever things
you've been doing in phase two,

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.110
which are habits

00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:39.720
that hopefully have moved
a little bit further

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.180
along the continuum of newly-formed

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.712
versus all the way to reflexive,

00:59:43.712 --> 00:59:46.376
or things that take less limbic
friction in in order to do.

00:59:46.376 --> 00:59:49.620
Phase three is when all
of that gets really locked

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.500
into the nervous system

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.250
through those Hebbian mechanisms,

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.100
like NMDA receptors, et cetera,

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.100
that I talked about before.

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:58.740
Again, neuroplasticity is
the basis of habit formation

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.240
and neuroplasticity and the
rewiring of neural circuits

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.810
happens in these states of deep sleep.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.411
So if you're not obeying this phase three,

01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:10.360
if you're not giving phase
three the material it needs,

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.070
and you're and you're not
avoiding the certain things,

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:16.210
like caffeine and bright light
and stress during phase 3,

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.824
you're simply not going to
be able to build those habits

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:21.737
that you've been working so
hard to trigger in phase one

01:00:21.737 --> 01:00:23.083
and phase two of the day.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.570
Again, these are things

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:28.240
that I've talked about previous
episodes of the podcast

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.718
and elsewhere, but really
this is about habit formation.

01:00:31.718 --> 01:00:33.163
And the whole reason

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.586
for placing particular types of behaviors

01:00:35.586 --> 01:00:39.562
at particular phases of the
day is to set a framework

01:00:39.562 --> 01:00:41.780
for that task-bracketing.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.470
Again, task-bracketing

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.520
and the circuits of the basal ganglia

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.190
indicate that it's not
just the neural circuits

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:51.340
that are engaged by the task itself,

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.320
but the neural circuits
that are engaged before

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.600
and after that task execution.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.640
That's what gets consolidated.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.647
So when you do things that
particular phases of the day,

01:01:02.647 --> 01:01:05.930
under particular conditions
of neurochemistry,

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:06.763
what you're doing is

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:09.600
you're giving the brain a very
predictable set of sequences

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.700
that during sleep it can start
to put into your hard drive,

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.533
if you will.

01:01:14.533 --> 01:01:16.570
It can really program it
into your nervous system,

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.810
so that within a short period of time,

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:22.250
hopefully within 18 or maybe even 6 days

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.190
or who knows? Maybe even fewer days,

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.250
you'll find that executing
those behaviors is very,

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.490
very straightforward for you

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:32.010
and that you won't have to
feel so much limbic friction

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:34.150
or override so much limbic friction.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.156
Some of you are probably asking, okay,

01:01:36.156 --> 01:01:40.273
if I perform a particular
habit during phase one,

01:01:40.273 --> 01:01:42.960
and then I do other
habits during phase two,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.460
and I eventually get to the point

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.370
where I'm engaging in those habits

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.874
in a pretty effortless way,

01:01:48.874 --> 01:01:51.580
do I keep them in the
same phase of the day?

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.580
And the good news is, the
literature says it doesn't matter.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.413
And in fact,

01:01:55.413 --> 01:01:58.790
moving that particular habit
around somewhat randomly

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:00.240
can actually be beneficial to you

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.590
because actually moving
it from one time a day

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.240
to the other is that context independence

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.113
that we really are seeking.

01:02:07.113 --> 01:02:11.030
By being able to do the same
thing that we want to do

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:13.910
regardless of time of day or circumstances

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:14.860
that's how we know

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.180
that we've achieved a
real habit formation,

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.810
that's how we know that
the habit has been moved

01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:21.890
into certain components
of our neural circuity

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.190
that just allow us to do it

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.560
what seems like reflexively.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.680
Although earlier I pointed out

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.477
that these aren't reflexes
in the traditional sense.

01:02:28.477 --> 01:02:32.034
The reason for that is
that this brain area,

01:02:32.034 --> 01:02:34.960
the hippocampus, that many
of you know is associated

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
with learning and memory,

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.340
is not actually where memories are stored.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.740
The hippocampus is where
memories are formed,

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.210
it's where procedures, like
we talked about before,

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.660
procedural memory of how you're going

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.210
to execute a particular sequence,

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:47.740
where that's maintained.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.610
So like if we use the recipe model,

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:51.550
that's where the recipe is maintained

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.720
until you know how to cook that dish

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.939
and then the procedural
memory literally migrates off

01:02:57.939 --> 01:03:00.240
into a different set of neural circuits,

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.500
which are the neural
circuits of the neocortex

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.580
where we have maps of sensory experience,

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.156
maps of all kinds experiences,

01:03:08.156 --> 01:03:10.460
including motor maps of
how to execute things.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.000
So we use one part of the
brain to learn something,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.480
but then that information,

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.930
in the form of the electrical
activity of neurons,

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:20.090
is passed off to a different brain area.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.960
Now, the neurons themselves don't move

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.450
from the hippocampus to the cortex,

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:24.283
that doesn't happen.

01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:26.350
What happens is the signals,

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:28.060
the sequence of electrical firing,

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:31.200
much like a script for a movie

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.791
or the notes on a sheet of paper

01:03:33.791 --> 01:03:36.041
for a particular musical piece

01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:38.644
is transferred off to
a different brain area.

01:03:38.644 --> 01:03:40.970
So, that whole process

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.767
of really leaning into
something that's hard,

01:03:42.767 --> 01:03:44.090
and then it becoming easier,

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:45.790
and then eventually that
things becoming more

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:48.100
or less reflexive involves a migration

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.743
of the information in the brain.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.651
And once it's migrated out

01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:53.730
to a different location in the brain,

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.000
at that point it's achieved
context-independence.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.510
It doesn't have to be
bracketed by, you know,

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:02.100
your caffeine and your lunch.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.000
It doesn't have to occur immediately

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.810
after your afternoon NSDR,

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.780
but before your four
O'clock meeting on Zoom,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.100
or something of that sort.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.360
So all this is to say

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.358
that once something has become reflexive,

01:04:15.358 --> 01:04:18.170
you should play with it a
little bit about time of day.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:20.866
If you want to keep it in
the same phase of day, great.

01:04:20.866 --> 01:04:22.736
But if you one day decide

01:04:22.736 --> 01:04:24.457
you're going to exercise in the afternoon,

01:04:24.457 --> 01:04:25.950
the next day you decide

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:26.980
you're going to exercise in the morning,

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.500
and that's the habit that
you're concerned with,

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.333
that's terrific.

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.166
If you're able to do that, that means

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:32.840
that it's truly achieved
context-independence.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.400
It means that you have
officially formed that habit.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.909
And as I mentioned earlier,

01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:39.258
much earlier at the
beginning of the episode,

01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:41.880
the strength of a habit is dictated by

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.282
how much limbic friction, that was one,

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:48.650
and how much context dependence there is.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:51.310
So when it doesn't take
much activation energy

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:53.470
to get into the execution of that habit

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.890
and you can do it in any context, well,

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.558
then you have formed a habit.

01:04:57.558 --> 01:04:59.887
We really can't have a discussion
about learning anything,

01:04:59.887 --> 01:05:01.811
habits or otherwise,

01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:04.931
unless we talk about
reward prediction error.

01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:07.800
Reward prediction error is associated

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.280
with the molecule dopamine,

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.560
although I should say there
are other neurochemicals

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.420
in our brain and body

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.436
that are also related to
reward prediction error.

01:05:15.436 --> 01:05:20.197
But reward prediction error
is a very good system,

01:05:20.197 --> 01:05:22.920
or I should say, a lens
through which to think about,

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.260
whether or not we should reward ourselves

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.680
for performing a given habit.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.290
And this is a much larger discussion

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:31.330
that actually relates
to things like parenting

01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:32.720
and self-regulation.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.174
You know, should we reward
kids just for effort?

01:05:35.174 --> 01:05:37.860
Should we reward
ourselves just for effort?

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:38.780
What should we reward?

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.140
How much should we reward ourselves?

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.800
When should we withdraw reward?

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.930
Should we use punishment?

01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:43.763
These kinds of things.

01:05:43.763 --> 01:05:44.776
This is a vast literature.

01:05:44.776 --> 01:05:47.150
We don't have time to
go into all the details,

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:51.246
but the notion of reward
prediction error is so powerful

01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:53.410
that it can predict most

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:56.630
if not all forms of learning,
including habit formation.

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:59.530
And you can deploy or
use particular features

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.090
of reward prediction error

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.280
if you would like to reinforce

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.220
or accelerate the formation
of certain habits.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.124
So, reward prediction
error, quite simply, is

01:06:11.124 --> 01:06:15.137
if you expect a reward
and the reward comes,

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:18.010
a particular behavior that was associated

01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:20.350
with generating that reward is more likely

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:21.510
to occur again.

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.380
That's pretty straight forward.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.680
However, the amount of reward,

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.120
in the form of this molecule dopamine,

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.960
that you will experience is even greater

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.960
if a reward arrives
that's unexpected. Okay.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.840
So let me repeat that again.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.532
If I think that something's
coming that's going to be great,

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:46.230
let's say I lean into a habit,

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:48.360
I manage to override my limbic friction,

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.270
and I'm doing my 45 minutes
of writing in the morning

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.770
with no phone and no internet

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:53.603
and I'm getting toward the end,

01:06:53.603 --> 01:06:55.283
and I'm anticipating how
I'm actually doing this,

01:06:55.283 --> 01:06:56.590
this is great, I did it,

01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.470
I'm feeling really, really good.

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:03.350
I finish, I definitely will
receive a dopamine reward,

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:04.610
I'll make my own dopamine reward,

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:05.443
that's where it comes from.

01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:07.069
Remember, this is all internal.

01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:10.240
However, I will also
receive a dopamine reward

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.660
if unexpectedly something
positive happens.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.680
And typically if something unexpected

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.050
but positive happens,

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.670
the amount of dopamine reward

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.250
that we get is actually much greater

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:24.360
than in any other conditions.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.590
However, it's hard to surprise yourself

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:29.160
about a behavior that you're
deliberately engaging in.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.293
So that becomes a bit of a tricky one.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.380
Reward prediction error also says

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:39.380
that if we expect a reward
and the reward doesn't come

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.590
that the pattern of dopamine release

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.990
will follow a particular contour

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:45.550
and that contour is very important.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.866
Here's how it goes.

01:07:46.866 --> 01:07:50.140
Let's say that I'm writing

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.720
and I'm about 30 or 45 minutes in,

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.638
I'm thinking, "Ah, this is great."

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:56.073
"I'm actually, I managed to do this"

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:58.657
"I'm succeeding in
executing the behaviors"

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:01.657
"that I need to in order
to perform this habit."

01:08:01.657 --> 01:08:03.696
"I'm overriding limbic friction."

01:08:03.696 --> 01:08:06.430
Just that series of thoughts will start

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:09.720
to generate the dopamine release
within my brain and body.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.670
However, if at the 15
minute mark the phone rings

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:16.280
and I pick up the phone

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.380
or I break my own protocol, I
break my own self-discipline

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.640
and I go on and check social media

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.310
or I do something that
takes me out of that,

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.320
what's going to happen is

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.267
that my level of dopamine
is actually going

01:08:30.267 --> 01:08:31.840
to drop below the baseline,

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.060
meaning below the level of dopamine I had

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.230
before I even started the
habit execution. Okay?

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:41.482
So what this is, is this
system that predicts whether

01:08:41.482 --> 01:08:43.886
or not rewards are going to come.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:46.570
When we think a reward is going to come,

01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:48.680
it starts to actually arrive earlier

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.040
in the form of dopamine release.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.560
This is the feeling

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.030
that we experience as
positive anticipation.

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.863
You tell a kid,

01:08:55.863 --> 01:08:57.527
"Hey, we're going to go
to the amusement park." Or

01:08:57.527 --> 01:08:59.020
"We're going to go get ice cream."

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.300
They haven't had the ice cream yet,

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.610
they're not at the amusement park,

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:04.580
but they're excited, the
dopamine release comes earlier.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.070
Okay? They get to the amusement park

01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:07.040
or they get the ice cream,

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.390
they will also have some dopamine release

01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:10.443
associated with that.

01:09:10.443 --> 01:09:12.510
But most of it, believe it or not,

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:14.530
came in the form of the anticipation.

01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:15.930
And dopamine has some qualities

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.430
that make the actual ice cream

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:20.440
and the actual amusement park
experience more pleasurable

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.040
than it would be had that
dopamine release not happened.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.100
Now of course, the other way
to do is to surprise a kid.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:26.933
You tell them,

01:09:26.933 --> 01:09:30.300
"Listen, we're going to the
class that you absolutely hate."

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.767
Or "We're going to go see the person"

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.140
"that you absolutely despise."

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.530
And then you drive them
to the amusement park

01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:37.100
that's the big release of dopamine.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.380
But reward prediction error also says

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.677
that if you tell the kid, or yourself,

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.027
"Okay, we're headed to
the amusement park."

01:09:43.027 --> 01:09:44.320
"We're going to get some ice cream."

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.330
They're really, really excited.

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:47.550
And then you get there and it's closed,

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.340
or they're not letting any more people in,

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.400
well then the dopamine level
drops way below what it was

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.530
before you told them that
you were headed there. Okay?

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:55.830
I've given a number of different examples

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:57.170
that hopefully make this clear.

01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:00.805
Reward prediction error
governs virtually all aspects

01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:04.190
of effort and all aspects of learning.

01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:06.900
Why? Because when dopamine
is released in the brain

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.450
and body, the neural circuits
of our brain and body change.

01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:12.620
There's a state change.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:16.440
Our over level, excuse me,
our overall level of energy,

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.610
but also the sorts of sensory events

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:20.500
that we're paying attention to changes

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.460
when there's a lot of
dopamine in our system.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.803
Now you can leverage
this for habit formation.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:28.835
Think back to task bracketing.

01:10:28.835 --> 01:10:31.515
Think back to limbic friction.

01:10:31.515 --> 01:10:35.280
If you are considering
adopting a new habit

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.060
or if you are trying to break a habit,

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.470
something we haven't
talked too much about,

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.970
but we will in a moment, it's very useful

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:44.980
to think not just about
the procedural aspects

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.330
of what you're going to do,

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:49.630
but also think about
the events that precede

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.950
and follow that particular habit,

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:55.680
and the execution, or at least the effort

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.385
to execute that habit.

01:10:57.385 --> 01:11:00.630
What you're doing is you're
casting a kind of a spotlight

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:03.850
around a bin of time, or a set of events,

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:06.030
for which dopamine can be associated.

01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:08.120
What does this look like
in the practical sense?

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.953
Well again,

01:11:08.953 --> 01:11:11.090
I'll just try and use very
simple concrete examples,

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:12.740
but this could carry over to anything.

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.570
Let's say I were somebody who
has a hard time getting in

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:18.300
that 30 to 60 minutes

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.650
of zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning.

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:22.960
This is actually an issue for me.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.810
I much prefer to do resistance exercise

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.070
than cardiovascular exercise,

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:28.710
although once I do it, I
always feel much better

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.683
that I've done it.

01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:36.163
What I should do is positively
anticipate the onset

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.870
and the offset of that session. Right?

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:43.137
So thinking about leaning into the effort,

01:11:43.137 --> 01:11:46.290
going out and doing that
zone II cardio session,

01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:48.380
and I should think about
how I'm going to feel after.

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.270
So, not just thinking about

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.970
how great I'm going to feel after,

01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:54.410
but also thinking about
how hard it's going to be

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.243
at the beginning,

01:11:55.243 --> 01:11:57.730
and then trying to reward
myself subjectively

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.060
for the entire experience.

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.840
In other words, start
rewarding task-bracketing

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.550
in addition to rewarding the
execution of the habit itself.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:07.527
Now some of you might be saying,

01:12:07.527 --> 01:12:09.127
"Well, wait this is all self-talk."

01:12:09.127 --> 01:12:10.700
"This is just positive self-talk."

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.277
But it's not positive self-talk,
it's not saying, you know,

01:12:14.277 --> 01:12:15.817
"I feel so great about doing something"

01:12:15.817 --> 01:12:16.650
"that I actually hate."

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:17.590
You can't lie to yourself,

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:19.080
or you're welcome to lie to yourself,

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.630
but the neuroscience literature,

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:22.120
the literature of growth mindset,

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.080
all the literature basically of mindset

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.170
speaks to the fact that
when you lie to yourself,

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:27.260
you know you're lying,

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.380
and you actually set up the
opposite of a reward system.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.298
So, you have to be brutally
honest with yourself

01:12:32.298 --> 01:12:33.798
that, for instance,

01:12:33.798 --> 01:12:37.137
"I don't like initiating
this cardiovascular exercise"

01:12:37.137 --> 01:12:38.737
"but I do like the fact that I've done it"

01:12:38.737 --> 01:12:39.830
"after I've done it."

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.040
So what you are doing is

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.172
you are applying reward prediction error

01:12:43.172 --> 01:12:45.440
to the entire sequence of things

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.695
that's involved in getting
into the habit execution,

01:12:48.695 --> 01:12:51.050
getting through the habit execution,

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:53.150
and getting out of the habit of execution.

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:54.190
How do you do this?

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:55.530
Well, I take us back

01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:59.140
to our procedural memory
visualization exercises

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.330
we talked about earlier.

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:02.070
When I talked about it in that context,

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:05.920
I talked about walking through
mentally the series of steps

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.810
that's required to perform
a particular habit.

01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:10.437
So in the case of the zone
II cardio thing it would be,

01:13:10.437 --> 01:13:11.527
"Okay up and put on my shoes,"

01:13:11.527 --> 01:13:12.547
"then I'm going to head out the door,"

01:13:12.547 --> 01:13:13.890
"then I'm going to drive up the road."

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.570
There is a particular
canyon near here that,

01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:16.470
if I'm going to run,

01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:19.250
I happen to like running, or
I don't hate running enough

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.560
that I tend to do it.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.310
Going through that, heading
back, et cetera, et cetera.

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.570
That's great, but even better

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.496
would be to broaden the time bin

01:13:27.496 --> 01:13:30.628
and start to positively
anticipate the period headed

01:13:30.628 --> 01:13:35.060
into the habit, so even
before you put on your shoes.

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:39.160
The fact that you are
successfully placing the habit in,

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.210
in this case, phase one of the day

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.540
and that afterwards I'm going

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.930
to feel a particular set
of positive benefits,

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:48.380
elevated mood, et cetera.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.000
I like being hungry and quickly
after I exercise I'm hungry,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.830
so I like being hungry
because I like eating,

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:54.300
so there's a whole set of things

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.880
that link up with one another.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.610
So I'm not just thinking
about habit execution

01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:59.690
as this isolated little set of events,

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:01.270
or this little time bin,

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.170
but rather, I'm drawing a
larger envelope around it

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.700
and starting to positively
associate dopamine reward

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.690
with that larger envelope.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:09.817
And for those of you that are thinking,

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:11.610
"Well, this is just a
psychological trick."

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:13.363
You know, you're kind of like,

01:14:13.363 --> 01:14:14.480
"This is sort of like lying to yourself."

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.990
It's not because you're not
actually contradicting the fact

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.800
that some of this is unpleasant.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.633
What you're doing is

01:14:20.633 --> 01:14:22.360
you're taking this
entire series of events,

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.970
what I'm calling this
kind of time envelope,

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:26.590
and you're associating it
with a particular reward

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:27.423
that comes later,

01:14:27.423 --> 01:14:30.140
which for me would be the
feeling that, you know,

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:31.210
that I've completed this.

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:33.260
Right? Because for me that's
usually a good feeling.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.620
So reward prediction error is beautiful,

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.010
not just because it's a
sort of math of anticipation

01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:41.180
and reward, or a math of anticipation

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.420
and disappointment,

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:45.430
it's beautiful because you can stretch out

01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:47.640
or make more narrow the time bins

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.120
in which reward prediction error works.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.690
Reward prediction error is the way

01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:54.270
in which people navigate
four year degrees.

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:56.630
Right? I mean, you go, sure, final exam

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:57.660
to final exam, et cetera.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.530
But ultimately, there's
a big payoff at the end

01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:02.052
and it's all basically
for that big payoff.

01:15:02.052 --> 01:15:04.150
And of course, I understand
that it's the journey,

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:05.750
not the destination, but let's face it,

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:07.160
for a lot of us goals

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.290
and habits are about achieving
some sort of destination.

01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:11.570
In the case of zone II cardio,

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:14.674
for me it's about trying to
stay alive for as long as I can,

01:15:14.674 --> 01:15:17.610
as long as I can with vitality, that is.

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:20.140
And it's also the fact
that if I'm doing that,

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.620
I get to eat the foods that I like.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.950
I tend to be able to eat more,

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.350
which I happen to really enjoy eating,

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:27.650
so much so that I'd like
it just as an activity.

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:29.520
So basically what you're trying to do

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.280
is not restrict your
thinking to just the habit

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.070
that you're trying to form, but rather,

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.860
to grab ahold of the timing before

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.870
and after that particular habit

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:41.550
and start to positively
associate reward mechanisms

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:44.070
in your brain with that entire time bin.

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:46.700
This is a very useful
and very powerful tool

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.360
in order to form habits.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.530
And I should say that it's not something

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:52.060
that comes naturally to most people.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.520
In fact, even as I describe it,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.570
you might find it's still
a little bit abstract,

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:57.080
but what I encourage you to do,

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.340
if you are finding it to
be a little bit vague,

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.405
would be to pick the habit
that you want to form,

01:16:01.405 --> 01:16:04.096
write down or think about very concretely

01:16:04.096 --> 01:16:06.270
what is the sequence of steps involved

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.030
in the execution of that habit,

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.070
and then write down or think about

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:11.620
what is the sequence of events

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.520
that need to precede that habit,

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.110
maybe the immediate 10
or 15 minutes before,

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:18.229
as well as the immediate
sequence of events

01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:20.838
and/or feelings that will
occur after that habit,

01:16:20.838 --> 01:16:24.870
and then call the whole
thing a habit execution.

01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:29.100
The whole thing a effort to
engage in that particular habit.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.070
And in doing that, and
in positively associating

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:33.470
with the idea that you're going

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:35.440
to complete that entire sequence,

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.520
you will engage reward prediction error

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.489
in the proper way that the dopamine surge

01:16:39.489 --> 01:16:41.910
can lend itself towards motivation.

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:45.500
Because ultimately, dopamine
is not about feeling good,

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.960
it's about feeling motivated.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.793
This is something

01:16:47.793 --> 01:16:49.410
that I've talked about
numerous times before,

01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:51.790
but dopamine, contrary to popular belief,

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:53.522
is not a reward molecule,

01:16:53.522 --> 01:16:57.016
so much as it is a molecule
of motivation and drive.

01:16:57.016 --> 01:16:59.120
And the natural consequence

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.270
of doing the exercise I just described,

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:03.259
of writing things out that precede,

01:17:03.259 --> 01:17:05.670
are involved in the immediate
execution of the habit,

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:06.902
and follow the habit,

01:17:06.902 --> 01:17:11.090
will allow you to experience
an increase in energy

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:13.490
and thereby an increase in likelihood

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.530
that you're going to engage

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.480
in that entire sequence of events.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.607
And the reason for that is
that dopamine gives us energy,

01:17:18.607 --> 01:17:21.577
and the reason for that is
that the molecule epinephrine,

01:17:21.577 --> 01:17:24.870
adrenaline, is actually
manufactured from dopamine.

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:27.070
Biochemically, it comes from dopamine.

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:28.730
So, dopamine is powerful

01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.785
and you can access more dopamine

01:17:30.785 --> 01:17:34.044
around even habits that
you haven't yet formed

01:17:34.044 --> 01:17:36.440
by taking this broader time envelope

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.680
and task-bracketing that
specific task execution

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.330
or habit execution.

01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:43.020
Way back at the beginning of the episode,

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.603
In promised you that I
would deliver two programs

01:17:45.603 --> 01:17:49.330
that are geared towards habit formation.

01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:51.370
And I promised that I would give you ways

01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:52.700
in which you could gauge whether

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:56.051
or not certain habits had
moved from high effort,

01:17:56.051 --> 01:17:59.650
what I call high limbic
friction, to reflexive.

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:02.485
And we talked about a
number of way to gauge that.

01:18:02.485 --> 01:18:04.048
In researching this episode,

01:18:04.048 --> 01:18:07.120
I found a tremendous
number of different systems

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.530
for habit formation.

01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:10.460
It's really amazing how much is out there.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.240
There, one says 60 days to this,

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.600
or 21 days to that, or 18 days to this.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.597
I mean,

01:18:15.597 --> 01:18:17.947
it's just rampant in the
popular psychology literature

01:18:17.947 --> 01:18:19.573
and in the self-help literature.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.440
I want to spell out a particular system

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.100
that I think could be very useful

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.530
to most if not all people

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:31.130
that's rooted in the
biology of habit formation,

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:33.210
rooted in the psychology
of habit formation,

01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:35.780
and that is entirely
compatible with that phase one,

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:37.380
phase two, phase three type program

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.000
that I talked about earlier,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.802
but encompasses a bit
of a longer time scale

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:45.698
and really arrives at a kind
of a system, if you will,

01:18:45.698 --> 01:18:48.800
for how to build in habits

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.100
and then to test whether
or not those habits

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.450
have really stuck

01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:55.120
and whether or not they're
likely to stick going forward.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.460
And so this, at least for
the sake of this example,

01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.670
a 21 day system.

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:02.730
I picked 21 days because
that seems to be the average

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:06.427
or most typical system for
engaging neuroplasticity

01:19:06.427 --> 01:19:08.900
as it relates to the
formation of new habits.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.330
This 21 day system, actually,

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:11.864
is one that someone I know very well uses

01:19:11.864 --> 01:19:13.563
and has used for a very long time.

01:19:13.563 --> 01:19:16.200
They actually, their kids use it as well.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.740
And it has a certain elegance to it

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.650
and I think as I describe it that elegance

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:22.500
will begin to reveal itself.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.180
So basically what this
involves is you set out

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.242
to perform 6 new habits per day

01:19:30.242 --> 01:19:32.770
across the course of 21 days.

01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:34.290
Why 6 and why 21?

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:36.110
Well, we'll talk about that in a moment.

01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:38.247
But the idea is, you write down 6 things

01:19:38.247 --> 01:19:41.336
that you would like to
do every day for 21 days.

01:19:41.336 --> 01:19:44.300
What phase of the day
those things fall into?

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.810
Well, that will depend on what they are

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:47.790
and how they relate to
those earlier phase one,

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:49.570
phase two, phase three, but for now,

01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:51.598
21 days, 6 things per day. However,

01:19:51.598 --> 01:19:55.508
the expectation is that
you'll only complete 4

01:19:55.508 --> 01:19:58.530
to 5 of those each day. Okay?

01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:01.570
So built into this is a
kind of permission to fail,

01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:02.800
but it's not failure,

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.500
because it turns out that this approach

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.330
to forming habits is based

01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:10.770
not so much on the specific habits

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:12.250
that you're trying to form,

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:15.260
but the habit of performing habits. Right?

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:19.532
It's the habit of doing a
certain number of things per day.

01:20:19.532 --> 01:20:21.760
So, you set out to perform 6.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.870
Now, another reason for not
necessarily performing all 6 is

01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:26.570
that some activities probably

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:28.450
shouldn't be performed each day.

01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:31.640
For instance, in my case,
if I were to weight train

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:34.130
or even run every day, I'm of the sort,

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:37.550
or my biology is of the sort
that I don't recover so well.

01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:40.180
So I wouldn't want to do
resistance training every day,

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:42.075
but I might want to do it 4
days a week, for instance.

01:20:42.075 --> 01:20:44.530
So by having 6 things in that list,

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:47.300
you could shuffle out
that particular activity

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.570
on particular days of the week,

01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:51.290
and simply do 4 or 5 other activities.

01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:53.260
So 21 days, you list out 4 to 5 things.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:55.660
So it might be zone II
cardio, resistance training,

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.794
sunlight viewing, writing
could be journaling,

01:20:59.794 --> 01:21:02.570
it could be learning a
language, mathematics.

01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:03.610
Again this is going to vary

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.077
depending on your particular goal

01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:06.937
and the habits that
you're trying to create.

01:21:06.937 --> 01:21:08.685
But no more than six

01:21:08.685 --> 01:21:09.920
and the expectation is

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.170
that you're not going to
perform more than 4 to 5.

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:16.560
If you miss a day, meaning you
don't perform 4 to 5 things,

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.270
there is no punishment.

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:23.200
And in fact it's important
that you don't actually try

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.270
and do what, in the literature,

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:26.490
is called a habit slip compensation,

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:29.090
which is just fancy psychological language

01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:34.090
for if you screw up and you
don't get all 4 or 5 in one day,

01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:37.275
you don't do 8 the next
day in order to compensate.

01:21:37.275 --> 01:21:40.140
This actually brings me
back to an example I had

01:21:41.217 --> 01:21:42.383
from graduate school.

01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:43.768
I remember when I started graduate school

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.490
feeling very excited, but
a little bit overwhelmed

01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:46.946
by the amount of things that I had to do

01:21:46.946 --> 01:21:49.830
because I had to both do
research, I was doing coursework,

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:51.680
at the time graduate students stipends,

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.320
and still now unfortunately,
were depressingly low

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.620
so it was financially stressful.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.030
There were a number of things happening

01:21:58.030 --> 01:22:01.106
and I remember a neurologist,
this was at UC Berkeley,

01:22:01.106 --> 01:22:03.560
he was a really fantastic
scientist and person,

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.349
his name was Bob Knight,
some of you may know him.

01:22:05.349 --> 01:22:07.567
I remember he, I went to
him and I asked, you know,

01:22:07.567 --> 01:22:09.317
"What is the process by which someone"

01:22:09.317 --> 01:22:11.650
"actually navigates graduate
school successfully?"

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:15.927
And he said, "Listen, you
don't want to do anything"

01:22:15.927 --> 01:22:18.567
"or engage in a routine in any way"

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:20.237
"that you can't keep up consistently"

01:22:20.237 --> 01:22:23.230
"for at least five and
ideally 6 days per week."

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.270
I thought, "Oh, that's pretty good."

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:25.927
And he said, "Every 4 or 5 years"

01:22:25.927 --> 01:22:26.957
"you might have to update that,"

01:22:26.957 --> 01:22:29.137
"but you need to decide what
you can do consistently,"

01:22:29.137 --> 01:22:31.907
"what you can do every day
or at least six days a week,"

01:22:31.907 --> 01:22:33.080
"or 5 days a week."

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.110
And that was very very useful to me

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:37.890
and it fits well with this
notion of habit slips,

01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:41.670
that if you happen to screw
up and not be able to engage

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.790
in whatever habits you're trying to learn

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:45.480
for whatever reason, that the next day,

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.260
you just get right back on on
the on the horse, so to speak.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.770
However, there's a really
interesting feature

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:53.620
from the neuroscience literature

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.440
and from the psychology that says

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.940
that chunking this 21 days into 2 day bins

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.900
can be very, very useful.

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.910
While it is true that the unit of the day

01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:06.837
that our cells use is a
circadian one, a 24-hour clock,

01:23:06.837 --> 01:23:09.200
there does seem to be something powerful

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.110
about engaging in particular habits,

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:15.210
in a particular sequence,
for two days in a row,

01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:16.697
and then resetting, so thinking,

01:23:16.697 --> 01:23:18.727
"Okay I can do this for a day"

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.627
"and if I can do it for a day,"

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.910
"I can probably do it for 2 days."

01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:23.730
And then resetting. So every
2 days you're resetting.

01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:26.210
So you're kind of chunking 21 days

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:28.171
into a series of 2 day bins,
in which you are trying

01:23:28.171 --> 01:23:30.590
to perform 4 to 5 new habits

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:33.345
and then completing that 21 days.

01:23:33.345 --> 01:23:36.140
Now, everything I've described
about this 21-day program

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:38.690
with 6 things that you're
trying to do with new habits

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:42.150
and only performing 4 to 5 and
not compensating, et cetera.

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:45.690
There's nothing neuroscientifically
unique about it,

01:23:45.690 --> 01:23:49.691
except for the fact that
it's not just 21 days,

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:52.390
broken up into two day chunks.

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:55.504
After 21 days, you stop engaging

01:23:55.504 --> 01:24:00.050
in this 21-day deliberate
4 to 5 things per day,

01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:04.100
tight schedule, and you
simply go into autopilot.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:07.560
You ask yourself how many
of those particular habits

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.700
that I was deliberately trying to learn

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:13.760
in the previous 21 days are
automatically incorporated

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:14.593
into my schedule?

01:24:14.593 --> 01:24:16.710
How many of them am I naturally doing?

01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:19.250
In other words, every
21 days you don't update

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.100
and start adding new habits.

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.890
You simply try and maintain the ones

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:25.050
that you built in that first 21 days.

01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:27.200
And this I think is extremely important

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.213
because in all the habit
literature that I could find,

01:24:30.213 --> 01:24:33.270
sure, there was a lot
of psychological data

01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:35.890
and neuroscience data,
behavioral science data

01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:37.440
around here's how you form a habit,

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.930
here's how you break a habit.

01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:41.610
There was even some
kind of test for whether

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:45.100
or not a habit had really
achieved context independence,

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.860
whether or not it was a
strongly formed habit.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.750
But there wasn't a lot of information,

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.138
at least by my search,

01:24:51.138 --> 01:24:53.622
of what to do once you've formed a habit,

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:55.240
and how to evaluate whether

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.426
or not that habit is likely to
persist long into the future.

01:24:59.426 --> 01:25:04.260
So here's the idea, you
set out these 6 things

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:05.710
that you would like to learn,

01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:07.680
or that you would like
to acquire in your life,

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.212
these habits, you only expect

01:25:10.212 --> 01:25:11.720
that you're going to
perform 4 or 5 each day,

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.330
you do that for 21 days.

01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:14.307
Again, if you miss a day,

01:25:14.307 --> 01:25:16.030
you just hop right back on the next day.

01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:19.000
However, you should think
about the functional units

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.923
within this 21 day period as 2 days.

01:25:21.923 --> 01:25:25.410
You can try and nail 4 to 5
of these things for 2 days.

01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:26.960
If you happen to get all 6, great,

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.150
but that's not necessarily required.

01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:31.060
So you can do it for 2
days then reset 2 days,

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:33.830
then reset 2 days, and
then in the next 21 days,

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:35.810
you're not trying to
acquire any new habits,

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:38.010
you're not going to throw in 6 more habits

01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:40.222
that you want to learn,
you're simply going to assess

01:25:40.222 --> 01:25:43.492
how well, how deeply, you
rewired your nervous system

01:25:43.492 --> 01:25:46.223
to be able to perform those 6 habits

01:25:46.223 --> 01:25:48.740
of the previous 21 days.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.730
And this is extremely useful, I believe,

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:53.257
because it will allow you to asses whether

01:25:53.257 --> 01:25:55.460
or not you can indeed make room,

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.527
if you even have room, I
should say, for more habits.

01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:02.350
Many people are trying to
cram so many new behaviors

01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:04.730
into their nervous system,
that they don't stand a chance

01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:06.150
of learning all those behaviors.

01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:07.090
What you may find,

01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:10.110
is that you kept up 2 of
those things very consistently

01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:11.290
throughout the 21 days.

01:26:11.290 --> 01:26:14.030
And perhaps there was one of
them that you did sporadically,

01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:17.310
and that there were 3
others that, frankly,

01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:18.720
you didn't manage to execute.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.905
You may also be one of these
people, one of these mutants,

01:26:21.905 --> 01:26:24.444
that sets out to do 6 new
things per day for 21 days

01:26:24.444 --> 01:26:26.474
and performs every single one of them.

01:26:26.474 --> 01:26:28.483
Terrific. More power to you. In that case,

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:32.020
for the following 21
days, let's see whether

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.940
or not you can continue to
perform those very same 6 things

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.111
every day for 21 days,
and then, and only then,

01:26:37.111 --> 01:26:40.853
would you want to add more habits in.

01:26:40.853 --> 01:26:43.540
So you could repeat this
21 day process, you know,

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.900
21 days of new habit, 21 days
of testing those new habits

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:48.290
as to whether or not
they're reflexive or not.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:50.865
You could do that forever, if you wanted.

01:26:50.865 --> 01:26:52.890
But the idea is that this isn't something

01:26:52.890 --> 01:26:54.650
that you're doing all year long.

01:26:54.650 --> 01:26:56.840
It's that you're perhaps
starting the new year

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.740
or regardless of when
you're listening to this,

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:02.320
you set out to make that 21
day really the stimulus period

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.240
in which the habits get wired in

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.460
and then the following month,

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.070
and maybe even the following
months, or periods of 21 days,

01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:12.110
are really the kind of
thermometer or the test bed

01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:15.560
of how well you've embedded
those particular habits.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.580
And if indeed you want to
continue to add new habits

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.530
or you find that certain
habits that you weren't able

01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:22.810
to embed in your nervous
system and make reflexive,

01:27:22.810 --> 01:27:25.100
you want to then bring
those in, fantastic.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.650
But it's only once you've
achieved all those 6 habits

01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:29.430
as reflexive, that you would move forward.

01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:31.077
And I think this sort of system,

01:27:31.077 --> 01:27:33.740
while it could have been replaced

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.700
with many other different systems.

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.890
Again, there's nothing
holy about this system.

01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:40.750
But this particular system
has a number of features,

01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:43.370
the lack of compensation for missed days,

01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:46.080
the fact that it's a fairly
high intensity program

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.520
for 21 days, but then you test yourself,

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.889
a kind of competition test
with yourself, if you will.

01:27:50.889 --> 01:27:54.443
Those features and the
fact that habit slips,

01:27:54.443 --> 01:27:56.660
missing of particular habits

01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:59.010
and not doing all 6 is kind
of built into the system,

01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:01.240
I think makes it a very reasonable one.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.000
It's very adaptable to the real world.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.440
And I think it's one that,
provided you obey the phase one,

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.080
phase two, phase three type system

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:10.990
that we talked about earlier,

01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:13.460
you collapse these two
programs with one another,

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:14.650
which hopefully will be easy,

01:28:14.650 --> 01:28:17.267
based on the descriptions I've
given. Well, if you do that,

01:28:17.267 --> 01:28:19.730
and I think there's a
very high probability

01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.150
that the habits that you try and form

01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:22.740
will achieve this context dependence

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:25.310
and that it will take
progressively less limbic friction

01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:26.480
to try and perform them.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.950
Thus far, we've almost
exclusively been discussing

01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:30.650
how to form habits.

01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:32.370
But what about breaking habits?

01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:35.440
Certainly many people out there
would like to break habits

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.662
that they feel don't serve them well.

01:28:37.662 --> 01:28:40.020
One of the challenges
in breaking habits is

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.160
that many habits occur very, very quickly

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.883
and so there isn't an
opportunity to intervene

01:28:44.883 --> 01:28:47.778
until the habit has already been initiated

01:28:47.778 --> 01:28:50.490
and in some cases completed.

01:28:50.490 --> 01:28:52.230
Well, there are a couple of tools

01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:54.860
that neuroscience and psychology tell us

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:56.610
can be very beneficial.

01:28:56.610 --> 01:28:59.011
Some of those things
are somewhat intuitive

01:28:59.011 --> 01:29:01.846
and relate to what I call
foundation practices.

01:29:01.846 --> 01:29:04.540
Meaning things that set the overall tone

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.545
in your body and brain, such
that you would be less likely

01:29:07.545 --> 01:29:09.763
to engage in a particular habit

01:29:09.763 --> 01:29:12.396
or that would raise
your level of awareness,

01:29:12.396 --> 01:29:16.570
both of your situation and
to how you feel inside.

01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:18.094
So things like stress reduction.

01:29:18.094 --> 01:29:19.720
Things like getting good sleep.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.210
Things like quality nutrition.

01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:23.330
Things like having positive routines

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:24.780
arranged throughout your day.

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.033
All of those, of course, will support you

01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:29.730
in trying to break particular habits.

01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:31.350
And while that can be very useful,

01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:34.130
it's admittedly very generic advice.

01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:36.750
It doesn't point to any
one specific protocol.

01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:39.770
In order to identify a specific protocol

01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:41.857
that one could apply in
order to break habits,

01:29:41.857 --> 01:29:44.043
we have to look at the mirror image

01:29:44.043 --> 01:29:46.170
of the sort of neuroplasticity

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.760
that we talked about at the
beginning of the episode.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.040
At the beginning of the episode,

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.720
we talked about a form of neuroplasticity

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.510
called long term potentiation,

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:55.606
involving the NMDA receptor.

01:29:55.606 --> 01:29:57.354
Just to refresh your memory a little bit,

01:29:57.354 --> 01:30:01.980
it says that if a set of neurons
is very electrically active

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.740
it's likely that those
neurons will communicate

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.154
with themselves more easily

01:30:06.154 --> 01:30:10.320
because of changes in things
like NMDA receptor activity,

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.330
the recruitment of additional
receptors, et cetera.

01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:15.380
It's essentially a cellular
and molecular explanation

01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:18.530
for how something goes from unlearned,

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:20.980
to learned, to reflexive.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.580
Now, in order to break synapses,

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.620
or to break apart neural connections

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.551
that are serving a habit that
you don't want to engage in,

01:30:28.551 --> 01:30:32.530
we need to engage the process
called long term depression.

01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:34.905
And long term depression has nothing to do

01:30:34.905 --> 01:30:39.905
with a state of mental depression
or a reduction in mood.

01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:41.510
So I really want to be clear that

01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:43.890
when I say depression in this context

01:30:43.890 --> 01:30:45.970
it has nothing to do with
psychological depression,

01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:47.910
it has nothing to do with mood.

01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:50.180
It's simply called long term depression

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:52.930
because just as long
term potentiation says

01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:55.850
if neuron A triggers
the firing of neuron B,

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:59.030
and it does so very robustly
over and over and over again,

01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:02.970
then neuron A will not
have to fire as intensely,

01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:06.050
or as frequently, in
order to activate neuron B

01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:08.520
in the future because
they become potentiated.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.700
Right? The threshold for
co-activation has been reduced.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.990
There's a much higher probability

01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:14.670
that they will be activated together

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:16.574
at low levels of intensity.

01:31:16.574 --> 01:31:19.530
That's essentially what
long term potentiation is.

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:23.280
Long term depression says
that if neuron A is active

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.558
and neuron B is not active
within a particular time window,

01:31:27.558 --> 01:31:31.290
then the connection between
neuron A and B will weaken

01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:35.510
over time, even if they started
off very strongly connected.

01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:36.720
Okay? So, I'm going to repeat that

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.726
because this is a pretty detailed
neurobiological mechanism

01:31:40.726 --> 01:31:45.120
whereby if neuron A,
and neuron B is active,

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.781
but at a different time
or outside a particular,

01:31:47.781 --> 01:31:49.520
what we call, temporal window,

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.040
meaning outside a particular time window,

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.360
then through long term depression,

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.240
the connection between neuron
A and neuron B will weaken.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.716
And just as a point of interest,

01:32:00.716 --> 01:32:04.360
the NMDA receptor is also
involved in long term depression,

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.880
although there are other
molecular components involved

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.713
as well.

01:32:07.713 --> 01:32:09.651
So how do you take two neurons

01:32:09.651 --> 01:32:12.250
that underlie a habit out of synchrony?

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:14.153
How do you get them to
fire asynchronously?

01:32:14.153 --> 01:32:17.290
This is pretty interesting
with respect to the cellular

01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:19.740
and molecular biology, but
at the behavioral level,

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.683
it's especially interesting.

01:32:20.683 --> 01:32:23.627
They way that one would do this
is, let's say for instance,

01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:28.627
you have a habit of picking up
your phone mid work session.

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.840
Okay? That's a reflexive habit I think

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.553
that most people have experienced.

01:32:33.553 --> 01:32:37.270
And we often hear the idea that, oh,

01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:40.000
the phone is so filled
with access to dopamine

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.620
and incredible things that
we're just drawn to it.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:45.895
But if you noticed what's
happened with phone use over time,

01:32:45.895 --> 01:32:49.020
most people, including
myself sometimes I admit,

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.820
find ourselves just looking at our phone,

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.700
or find ourselves in a particular app

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.210
without actually having engaged

01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:55.567
in the conscious set of steps of,

01:32:55.567 --> 01:32:56.557
"Oh I'm really curious"

01:32:56.557 --> 01:32:58.157
"what's going on in this particular app."

01:32:58.157 --> 01:32:59.347
"I'm really curious"

01:32:59.347 --> 01:33:01.170
"what's going on in this
particular website."

01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:03.910
And you just kind of "find
yourself", in air quotes,

01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:05.879
for those of you listening,
I'm making air quotes.

01:33:05.879 --> 01:33:09.130
You just sort of find yourself
doing it because the behavior

01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:10.970
of picking up your phone
is sort of reflexive,

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:13.120
or has become fully reflexive.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.850
You see this a lot at meals

01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:16.480
where multiple people are there

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.870
and no one's looking at their phone

01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:19.410
and then all of a sudden
someone takes out their phone

01:33:19.410 --> 01:33:20.243
and you'll notice

01:33:20.243 --> 01:33:22.080
that other people just
naturally take out their phone.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.390
It's this kind observation induced reflex.

01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:30.520
And I would wager that most
people aren't consciously aware

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.116
of the immediate steps involved.

01:33:33.116 --> 01:33:36.040
So the literature says
there are a number of ways

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.573
to break these sorts
of habitual behaviors,

01:33:38.573 --> 01:33:40.980
or reflexive behaviors.

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:44.750
Most of those approaches
involve establishing some sort

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:47.748
of reward for not performing the activity

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:50.940
or some sort of punishment
for forming the activity.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.100
I've heard of some basic things
that some people will do,

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.000
like they'll even put like a
rubber band on their wrist,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.440
and every time they complain,

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.910
or every time they do some behavior,

01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:59.950
like pick up their phone,

01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:01.570
they'll give themselves
a snap on the wrist.

01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:03.860
And yeah, the rationale
there is that you're trying

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.000
to create a somatic, a very
physical representation

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.880
of something that makes it very real

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.210
and harder to overlook.

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:13.470
Other people will just do a
tick mark on a piece of paper.

01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:16.616
This sort of, "What gets
measured is what gets managed"

01:34:16.616 --> 01:34:19.410
kind of mindset, where if
every time you do something,

01:34:19.410 --> 01:34:22.730
you take away the judgment,
this is very new age-y,

01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:25.000
I realize, but this is
what you find out there,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.060
if you search the literature.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.840
Even on PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.760
that every time you engage in a behavior,

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.930
you just measure the fact
that you did that behavior,

01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:35.810
you just mark it down.

01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:37.750
At the end of the day, people
are supposed to look at that

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:38.583
and say, "Oh my goodness!"

01:34:38.583 --> 01:34:41.922
"I can't believe that I
spent, you know, 3 hours."

01:34:41.922 --> 01:34:43.456
Or, "I did it 46 times."

01:34:43.456 --> 01:34:46.117
And in fact, a lot of
apps, social media apps,

01:34:46.117 --> 01:34:49.440
will start to give you
warnings now, if you opt in,

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.860
that you've been on the app for an hour,

01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.693
would you like to leave?

01:34:52.693 --> 01:34:54.258
Most people just click right
past it and go back in.

01:34:54.258 --> 01:34:57.337
I think very few people
say, "Oh my goodness!"

01:34:57.337 --> 01:34:59.277
"It's been an hour and
therefor you're right,"

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:01.530
"I absolutely shouldn't
engage in this any more."

01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:04.092
It's just far to easy to just
blow past those reminders.

01:35:04.092 --> 01:35:08.236
Well, the literature on habit formation

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:12.540
and habit reduction, breaking
habits, has been analyzed.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.992
There's a beautiful meta-analysis,

01:35:14.992 --> 01:35:16.760
which involves looking at a number

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.460
of different studies all together,

01:35:19.385 --> 01:35:22.190
comparing the statistical
strength of each of those studies,

01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.230
looking in different conditions

01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:25.775
what sorts of habits were
trying to be made or broken.

01:35:25.775 --> 01:35:30.775
The first author on this
review is Fritz, F R I T Z.

01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:33.300
I'll certainly put a link to this.

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.887
It's Heather Fritz and it's

01:35:34.887 --> 01:35:37.380
"Intervention to modify
habits: a scoping review."

01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.370
And it is indeed a very
broad scale review. It's from

01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:41.500
the Journal of Occupation
Participation and Health.

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.075
It's published in 2020.
It's a really nice article.

01:35:44.075 --> 01:35:46.030
A couple of things I
learned from this article

01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:47.470
and then I'll get into the specific tool

01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:48.750
for breaking habits.

01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:50.490
Perhaps the most interesting
thing that I took

01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:52.620
from this review was the finding

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:57.200
that notifications to
either engage in habits

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.840
or to not engage in habits

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.610
actually were not very
effective over time.

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.970
They were effective in
the immediate period

01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:05.990
when people started using
these notifications,

01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:07.797
as were little sticky notes, like,

01:36:07.797 --> 01:36:09.117
"Don't go into the refrigerator"

01:36:09.117 --> 01:36:11.320
"between the hours of
whatever and whatever."

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.604
Or just visual reminders,

01:36:13.604 --> 01:36:16.350
physical reminders or electronic reminders

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:18.360
were effective in the immediate term,

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.240
but in the long term,
did not predict whether

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.500
or not people would effectively stick

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.761
to habits they were trying to stick to,

01:36:24.761 --> 01:36:25.970
or break habits that they
were trying to break.

01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:28.980
So sadly, that doesn't
seem to work very well.

01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:31.100
And perhaps they just need to come up

01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.240
with more robust reminders.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.560
I don't know, mild electric shock

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.218
or something like that
because what we do know,

01:36:36.218 --> 01:36:39.342
only sort of kidding
about mild electric shock,

01:36:39.342 --> 01:36:41.440
but what we do know from both human

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.810
and animal studies is that
things like electric shock,

01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.610
things like monetary penalties, right?

01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:49.340
Having to pay out every time you engage

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:50.500
in a particular behavior.

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.776
Those are pretty effective
ways to break habits.

01:36:52.776 --> 01:36:56.043
The problems is when people
are not being monitored

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:59.500
for habit use, for instance,

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.237
you can imagine a situation where you say,

01:37:01.237 --> 01:37:02.507
"I'm not going to pick up my phone"

01:37:02.507 --> 01:37:04.917
"for the 4 hours in the
early part of the day"

01:37:04.917 --> 01:37:07.518
"so I can get, you know, real
dedicated focused work done."

01:37:07.518 --> 01:37:10.224
Unless someone's monitoring
them, then people don't tend

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:14.230
to monitor themselves completely enough

01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:16.160
that they punish themselves
completely enough,

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.070
that they break the behavior.

01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:19.500
In other words, the
punishment isn't bad enough,

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.560
in order to break the habit,

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:23.780
which just speaks to how
powerful these habits are

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:24.950
once they become reflexive.

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:26.681
They're just very, very hard to override.

01:37:26.681 --> 01:37:28.650
So it turns out that the key

01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:32.118
to generating long term
depression in these pathways

01:37:32.118 --> 01:37:36.250
is actually to take the period

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:39.640
immediately following
the bad habit execution,

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.870
meaning, let's say you tell yourself

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:42.713
you're not going to pick up your phone,

01:37:42.713 --> 01:37:43.924
you're not going to bite your nails,

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.341
you're not going to reflexively walk

01:37:45.341 --> 01:37:46.290
to the refrigerator at a
particular time or day,

01:37:46.290 --> 01:37:48.450
but you find yourself doing it anyway,

01:37:48.450 --> 01:37:50.550
and what actually has to happen

01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:52.750
is bringing conscious awareness

01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:54.350
to the period immediately afterwards,

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:55.840
which I think most people recognize,

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.044
they realize "Ugh I just did
it again. I just did it again."

01:37:58.044 --> 01:38:02.010
And in that moment, capture
the sequence of events,

01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:04.961
not that led to the bad habit execution,

01:38:04.961 --> 01:38:07.684
but actually to take advantage of the fact

01:38:07.684 --> 01:38:09.940
that the neurons that were responsible

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:13.454
for generating that bad habit
were active a moment ago,

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:17.183
and to actually engage
in a replacement behavior

01:38:17.183 --> 01:38:19.430
immediately afterward.

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:21.520
Now, this is really interesting
and I think powerful

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:22.730
because I would have thought

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:25.368
that you have to engage
in a replacement behavior

01:38:25.368 --> 01:38:28.895
that truly replaces the
bad habit behavior, right?

01:38:28.895 --> 01:38:30.700
That you would have to be able

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:33.080
to identify your state of mind

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.780
or the sequence of events
leading into the bad habit,

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:37.580
but rather, the stage

01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:40.220
or the period immediately
after the bad habit execution,

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:43.970
is a unique opportunity to
insert a different type of,

01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:45.750
what we would call adaptive behavior,

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:48.880
but that could be any
behavior that's not in line

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:51.820
with the bad behavior, so
let's give it an example.

01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.200
Let's say you find yourself,

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.617
you're trying to do focused
work, you pick up your phone,

01:38:55.617 --> 01:38:58.856
you're disappointed in yourself
for picking up your phone,

01:38:58.856 --> 01:39:01.330
you could of course just put it down,

01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:04.250
and re-engage in the work behavior,

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:05.450
but if you were good at that,

01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:07.550
then you probably wouldn't have
done it in the first place.

01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:09.930
And so, what turns out
to be very effective,

01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:12.930
is to go engage in some
other positive habit.

01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:14.970
Now, this has two major effects.

01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:16.320
The first one is you start

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:19.520
to link in time the
execution of a bad behavior

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.404
to this other good behavior.

01:39:21.404 --> 01:39:25.829
And in doing so, you start to
recruit other neural circuits,

01:39:25.829 --> 01:39:28.340
other neurons, that can start

01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:31.580
to somewhat dismantle sequence of firing

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.580
associated with the bad behavior.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:36.880
In other words, you start to
create a kind of a double habit

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.430
that starts with a bad habit,

01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:40.350
and then ends with a good habit.

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:43.492
And that seems to create
enough of a temporal mismatch

01:39:43.492 --> 01:39:46.020
so that then recognizing

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.890
when you're heading toward to bad habit

01:39:47.890 --> 01:39:50.130
becomes more apparent to you.

01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:52.210
So again, I want to make
this very, very concrete.

01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:53.043
Let's say

01:39:53.043 --> 01:39:55.960
that the behavior is reflexively
picking up one's phone.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.510
You do that, you think, "Ugh,
goodness, I did it again."

01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:59.630
Here's what I'm going to do,

01:39:59.630 --> 01:40:00.800
you would set that down

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.080
and then you would engage in
some other positive behavior,

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.260
that you've deemed positive.

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:06.950
And here, it's very
subjective, so it's hard

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:07.880
for me to give an example

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.163
that will necessarily
make sense to everybody,

01:40:10.163 --> 01:40:12.700
but perhaps you're working on hydration,

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.320
so maybe you go have a glass of water.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.910
Maybe you're trying to do
breath work or something.

01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:23.190
Maybe you're trying to enhance
your language speaking skills

01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:24.890
so you go and you spend 5 minutes

01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:28.050
doing a particular type
of language learning.

01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:30.350
You literally exit whatever you were doing

01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:32.960
and perform that other new positive habit

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.730
in the immediate period right after that,

01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:36.520
even for a short period of time.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.170
It's a little bit counterintuitive,

01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:40.569
but what this does it
creates kind of a cognitive

01:40:40.569 --> 01:40:45.040
and a temporal mismatch between
the initial bad behavior,

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.017
which before is what we would
call sort of a closed loop,

01:40:48.017 --> 01:40:49.530
and the engineers out there will know

01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:51.425
what I'm talking about.

01:40:51.425 --> 01:40:53.044
But in a closed loop, so one behavior,

01:40:53.044 --> 01:40:55.059
one set of neural
firings, leads to another,

01:40:55.059 --> 01:40:56.080
leads to another,

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.110
and then just kind of sets
the same thing in motion.

01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:00.710
It can be kind of a self
perpetuating system.

01:41:00.710 --> 01:41:03.740
By changing the number of
features that are in that loop,

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:06.700
it disrupts the closed
nature of that loop,

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:08.490
it creates what we call an open loop,

01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:10.685
and in an open loop, you are
better able to intervene.

01:41:10.685 --> 01:41:13.787
So, as I mentioned before, this
might seem counterintuitive,

01:41:13.787 --> 01:41:14.727
you might think,

01:41:14.727 --> 01:41:18.477
"Why would I want to reward
the execution of a bad habit"

01:41:18.477 --> 01:41:19.787
"with a good habit."

01:41:19.787 --> 01:41:22.130
"I don't want to reward
myself for the bad habit."

01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:24.030
But really what you're
trying to do is you're trying

01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:26.600
to change the nature
of the neural circuits

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.410
that are firing so that
you can rewrite the script

01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:31.442
for that bad habit.

01:41:31.442 --> 01:41:33.845
A different way to put it would be,

01:41:33.845 --> 01:41:38.670
imagine that the bad habit
is like a chord on the piano

01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:40.280
that you play, or a chord notes,

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.520
or a sequence of notes
that you would play,

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.150
and it comes very easily.

01:41:44.150 --> 01:41:45.840
You can play it every single time.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:46.673
But, let's say,

01:41:46.673 --> 01:41:47.890
as you're trying to learn
a new piece of music,

01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:49.330
you're just constantly inserting that

01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:50.480
at the inappropriate time.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.750
That was, you know, I think
it was a decent enough analogy

01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:55.640
for a bad habit because it
involves some motor execution.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.280
You just find yourself doing it.

01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.750
Rather than trying to prevent
yourself from doing it,

01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:02.790
the next time you do
it, add in a new chord

01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:05.700
or sequence that you're trying to learn.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:08.300
What this does then is it
changes the whole nature

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:11.710
of the sequence of neurons
that are firing from bad habit

01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:15.470
through to the end of this
newly applied good habit.

01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:19.570
So, this is the way in which
you start to dismantle or,

01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:22.730
when I say dismantle,
really weaken the likelihood

01:42:22.730 --> 01:42:25.100
that if neuron A fires,
neuron B will fire.

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.110
Because, as you're
starting off in the mode

01:42:28.110 --> 01:42:30.760
of very reflexively
performing a bad habit,

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.061
those neurons are firing together

01:42:32.061 --> 01:42:34.690
without you consciously being aware of it.

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:38.098
It's almost impossible for
you to intervene in yourself

01:42:38.098 --> 01:42:40.317
without a number of other features,

01:42:40.317 --> 01:42:44.284
like severe punishment, severe
consequence type outcomes.

01:42:44.284 --> 01:42:48.020
Rather, tacking on some
additional sequences,

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.397
like if neuron A, neuron B
fires, and then you're saying,

01:42:51.397 --> 01:42:53.137
"Okay well, if neuron B fires,"

01:42:53.137 --> 01:42:57.360
"I'm going to start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F to fire."

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.890
Right? That's the, C, D, E,
F being the positive behavior

01:43:00.890 --> 01:43:02.030
that you're going to insert.

01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:05.410
And in doing so, you create a
chain of neuronal activation

01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:07.860
that then is very easy to dismantle.

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.900
And so, when people have
applied this kind of approach,

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.400
it removes the need to have
constant conscious awareness

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.440
of one's own behavior
prior to that behavior,

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.940
which is very, very difficult to achieve.

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:24.450
Rather, what they find is
that they are able to engage

01:43:24.450 --> 01:43:27.720
in re-mapping of neural circuits
associated with bad habits

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.590
in ways that are very,
very straightforward.

01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:32.540
Right? Because you can always identify

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.170
when you've done the
thing you don't want to do

01:43:34.170 --> 01:43:36.630
and then tack on to that
something additional

01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:37.690
that's positive.

01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:40.690
Now, the nature of that
positive thing is important.

01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:41.750
You don't want it to be something

01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:43.020
that's very hard to execute.

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.610
You want it to be
something that's positive

01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:46.390
and fairly easy to execute,

01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:48.060
so that you're not struggling all the time

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:50.711
to insert this on top
of this bad behavior,

01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:53.520
whatever that bad behavior
might happen to be.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.353
But again,

01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:56.820
this is rooted in the biology
of long term depression,

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.287
it maps very well to the
behavioral change literature

01:43:59.287 --> 01:44:01.400
that I was able to glean that really shows

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.240
that rather than just get reminders,

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.900
rather than try and instill punishment,

01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.750
rather than setting up reward
for breaking bad habits,

01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:10.054
that perhaps the simplest
way to approach this is

01:44:10.054 --> 01:44:13.600
to tack on additional
behaviors to the bad habits,

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.990
make sure those behaviors
are good behaviors,

01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:18.350
or behaviors that are adaptive for you,

01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:20.650
and in doing so, you will soon find

01:44:20.650 --> 01:44:22.470
that the initiation of the bad habit

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:23.610
takes on a whole new form

01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:26.097
or that you're not even
inspired to do it at all.

01:44:26.097 --> 01:44:27.650
And of course, I want to acknowledge

01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:30.460
that breaking bad habits is really hard.

01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:32.612
We had an episode all about addiction

01:44:32.612 --> 01:44:36.090
with Dr. Anna Lembke from
Stanford Medical School.

01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:37.440
She's a colleague of mine

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.480
who runs the Dual-Diagnosis
Addiction Clinic at Stanford.

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:43.594
And in that episode, we
talked a lot about how addicts

01:44:43.594 --> 01:44:47.410
for drugs, alcohol, people have addictions

01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:50.520
to certain types of behaviors,
or avoidance behaviors even,

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.800
that in the case of addiction,

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.067
there has to be a tremendous
kind of full-scale campaign

01:44:55.067 --> 01:44:57.530
for them to be able to
intervene in their behavior.

01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:58.363
So, for those of you

01:44:58.363 --> 01:44:59.680
that are thinking about bad habit breaking

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.677
in the context of
addictive type behaviors,

01:45:02.677 --> 01:45:04.762
definitely check out that episode.

01:45:04.762 --> 01:45:07.630
Addiction does employ
some of these principles

01:45:07.630 --> 01:45:11.342
around habit making and
habit breaking, as it were,

01:45:11.342 --> 01:45:14.511
but of course, because the consequences

01:45:14.511 --> 01:45:17.736
of certain habits in
addiction can be so severe,

01:45:17.736 --> 01:45:20.010
there's other sets of protocols

01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:22.090
and there's a kind of a
psychological backdrop to it

01:45:22.090 --> 01:45:23.170
that's very important.

01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:24.767
It also relates to the
biology of dopamine,

01:45:24.767 --> 01:45:27.000
and you can find all
of that in the episode

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.470
with Dr. Anna Lembke.

01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:31.310
So today we've covered
a lot about the biology

01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:33.410
and the psychology of habit formation

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:35.020
and habit breaking.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:40.020
We talked about why certain
habits are so hard to wire in,

01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:42.890
why certain habits are
so hard to break down

01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:45.621
and eliminate, and how we can determine

01:45:45.621 --> 01:45:48.905
which habits are going to
be easier for us to access

01:45:48.905 --> 01:45:50.940
and which habits are going to be harder

01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.450
for us to access and break.

01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:55.910
We talked a lot about this
notion of limbic friction

01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:57.740
and we talked about context dependence.

01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.960
And we talked about a
number of different things

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.580
as it relates to neural circuits

01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:05.020
and the formation of new
connections in the brain,

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.426
and strengthening and weakening
of connections in the brain.

01:46:07.426 --> 01:46:09.871
We also discussed two programs.

01:46:09.871 --> 01:46:12.180
Programs designed specifically for you

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:15.040
on the basis of the
neurobiology literature

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.410
and the literature on the
psychology of habit formation

01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:18.510
and habit breaking.

01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:20.307
Just to briefly recap,

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:23.672
one program involves
dividing the 24 hour day

01:46:23.672 --> 01:46:27.680
into three phases, phase
one, phase two, phase three,

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.873
and to try and tackle specific habits

01:46:29.873 --> 01:46:33.075
at particular phases of the 24 hour cycle.

01:46:33.075 --> 01:46:36.976
The second program
involved a 21 day process

01:46:36.976 --> 01:46:41.720
of engaging approximately
6 new habits per day,

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.490
although the expectation,
as I mentioned earlier,

01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:46.140
is that you're not going
to perform all 6 of those.

01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.660
And an assessment in the following 21 days

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.750
as to whether or not you have
indeed formed those new habits

01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:52.720
or not.

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.400
And there were a number of other features

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.710
that I mentioned that were related

01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:57.150
to those two general programs.

01:46:57.150 --> 01:47:00.220
Phase one, phase two, phase
three, and the 21 day program,

01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.450
and how those could be meshed together.

01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:04.810
So, I'm guessing some of you
will probably have questions

01:47:04.810 --> 01:47:06.910
about those programs
and how to apply them,

01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:09.178
but hopefully they were clear
enough for you to get started.

01:47:09.178 --> 01:47:11.820
This is a good opportunity
for me to mention

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.720
that the Huberman Lab Podcast

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.390
has something called the
Neural Network Newsletter

01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:19.198
that is sent out
approximately once a month.

01:47:19.198 --> 01:47:20.832
For the next newsletter,

01:47:20.832 --> 01:47:25.626
I will release a on-paper
version of these two systems

01:47:25.626 --> 01:47:28.060
and how they mesh together
for habit formation

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:31.360
and habit breaking, and if
you'd like to access that,

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.900
you can go to hubermanlab.com,
you go to the menu,

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.510
you can sign up for the newsletter.

01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:37.600
First of all, it's zero cost.

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.010
Second of all, we have
our privacy policy there,

01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.843
but I can tell you right now,

01:47:40.843 --> 01:47:42.970
we don't share your email with any vendors

01:47:42.970 --> 01:47:44.470
or with any other sources.

01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:46.245
Those emails stay internal to us.

01:47:46.245 --> 01:47:48.040
And if you'd like to see

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.830
what the sort of flavor
of those newsletters is,

01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:53.160
the previous newsletters, for instance,

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.650
one on tools for sleep,
that I mentioned earlier,

01:47:55.650 --> 01:47:58.970
or tools for neuroplasticity,
in the classroom

01:47:58.970 --> 01:48:00.610
and outside the classroom as well,

01:48:00.610 --> 01:48:02.800
for teachers and for
students of various kinds,

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.320
those are also posted there

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.100
so you can access any of
the previous newsletters.

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:08.610
My hope is that today you've learned

01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:10.490
both the biological mechanisms

01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:12.720
and the practical tools
by which you can start

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.170
to establish habits that, for you,

01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:17.110
you deem adaptive, healthy,

01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:18.930
and that are going to
support you in your goals.

01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:21.870
And that you can start to
dismantle some of the habits

01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:24.690
that you find to be
unhealthy or maladaptive

01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:26.550
for you and for your goals.

01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:28.680

And now Spotify has a feature

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:52.640
by which you can also
leave us review feedback.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.540
Please also check out
the sponsors mentioned

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.590
at the beginning of this podcast episode.

01:48:56.590 --> 01:48:59.000
That's perhaps the best
way to support out podcast.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.152
In addition, we have a Patreon.

01:49:00.152 --> 01:49:03.109
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:05.210
and there you can support the podcast

01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:06.760
at any level that you like.

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.950
During today's podcast

01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:10.680
and in many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:11.767
I mentioned supplements.

01:49:11.767 --> 01:49:14.740
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:17.042
many people derive tremendous
benefit from supplements.

01:49:17.042 --> 01:49:19.560
Supplements for sleep,
supplements for focus,

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.960
supplements for various other things

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:23.470
related to mental and physical
health and performance.

01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:26.030
One key issue any time
there's a discussion

01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:28.390
about supplements, you have to be sure

01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:30.090
that the supplements you are taking

01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:31.470
are of the very highest quality.

01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:33.600
And for that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.750
because Thorne has the
very highest stringency,

01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:38.240
with respect to the quality of
the ingredients they include,

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.500
and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.560
that they include in their supplements.

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.630
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:46.870
and get 20% off any of those supplements,

01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:51.472
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman and,

01:49:51.472 --> 01:49:54.889
in addition to being able 20%
off any of those supplements,

01:49:54.889 --> 01:49:57.350
if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site

01:49:57.350 --> 01:50:00.700
through that web portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:03.370
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:04.500
that Thorne makes.

01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.490
If you're not already
following us on Instagram

01:50:06.490 --> 01:50:08.639
and Twitter, please feel free to do so.

01:50:08.639 --> 01:50:11.791
There, I teach neuroscience
and neuroscience related tools

01:50:11.791 --> 01:50:13.288
in short format.

01:50:13.288 --> 01:50:15.090
Some of that material overlaps

01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:16.370
with what you hear on the podcast,

01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:17.850
some of it is unique and different

01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:19.310
from what's on the podcast.

01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:20.143
And once again,

01:50:20.143 --> 01:50:22.570
I want to thank you for
going on this journey

01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:24.504
of exploring the neuroscience

01:50:24.504 --> 01:50:28.140
and the psychology of habit
formation and habit breaking.

01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:29.620
I hope it supports you in your goals.

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.701
And last but certainly not least,

01:50:31.701 --> 01:50:33.953
thank you for your interest in science.

01:50:33.953 --> 01:50:36.536
