00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.750
where we discuss science

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.850
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.530
(upbeat guitar music)

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.680
I'm Andrew Huberman

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.720
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.660
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.850
For today's podcast
we're going to talk about

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.420
the parts list of the nervous system.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.070
Now that might sound boring,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.050
but these are the bits and pieces

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.530
that together make up everything

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.410
about your experience of life,
from what you think about

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.610
to what you feel, what you imagine,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.620
and what you accomplish

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.720
from the day you're born
until the day you die.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.350
That parts list is really incredible

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.277
because it has a history
associated with it

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:45.390
that really provides a window
into all sorts of things

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.650
like engineering, warfare,
religion, and philosophy.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.970
So I'm going to share
with you the parts list

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.010
that makes up who you are

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.870
through the lens of some of
those other aspects of life

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.090
and other aspects

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.130
of the history of the discovery
of the nervous system.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.560
By the end of this podcast

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.470
I promise you're going
to understand a lot more

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.353
about how you work and how
to apply that knowledge.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.160
There's going to be a little bit of story.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.220
There's going to be a lot of discussion

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.400
about the people who made
these particular discoveries.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.310
There'll be a little bit
of technical language.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.180
There's no way to avoid that.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.490
But at the end you're
going to have in hand

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.010
what will be the equivalent

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.830
of an entire semester of learning

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.060
about the nervous system and how you work

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.260
So a few important points
before we get started.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.940
I am not a medical doctor.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.700
That means I don't prescribe anything.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.730
I'm a professor, so sometimes
I'll profess things.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.960
In fact, I profess a lot of things.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600
We are going to talk about
some basic functioning

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.840
of the nervous system parts and et cetera,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.860
but we're also going to talk

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.740
about how to apply that knowledge.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.380
That said, your healthcare, your wellbeing

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.470
is your responsibility.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.897
So anytime we talk about tools

00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:57.930
please filter it through
that responsibility.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.290
Talk to a healthcare professional

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.010
if you're going to explore
any new tools or practices

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.290
and be smart in your
pursuit of these new tools.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.250
Also wanna emphasize that this podcast

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.570
and the other things I do on social media

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.590
are my personal goal of bringing

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.150
zero cost to consumer information
to the general public.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.590
It is separate from my role
at Stanford University.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.320
In that spirit I really want to thank

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.670
the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.870
The first one is Athletic Greens

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.380
which is an all-in-one drink.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.450
It's a greens drink

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.260
that has vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, prebiotics.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.310
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.220
so I'm really delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.817
The reason I like it is because

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:44.580
I like vitamins and minerals,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.530
I think they're important to my health

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.140
and it can be kind of overwhelming to know

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.320
what to take in that landscape.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.810
So by taking one thing

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.040
that also happens to taste really good

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.950
I get all the vitamins minerals,
et cetera, that I need.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.040
There's also a lot of data there now

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.810
about the importance of the gut microbiome

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.900
for immune health and
for the gut brain access,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.110
all these things.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.570
And the probiotics and prebiotics

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.510
are important to me for that reason.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.100
If you want to try Athletic Greens

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.730
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.300
and put in the code word
Huberman at checkout.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.290
If you do that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.090
they'll send you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.530
There's a lot in the news lately

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.100
about the importance of vitamin D3.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.440
We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.900
but many of us aren't
getting enough sunlight.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.530
Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevant

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.800
to the immune system and the
hormone systems, et cetera.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.633
So once again

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:41.440
that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.770
enter Huberman at checkout,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.520
and you get the year supply of D3 and K2

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.730
along with your Athletic Greens.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.360
This podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.870
which is a health monitoring company.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.280
It uses blood tests and
saliva tests to look at things

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.872
like DNA and metabolic markers

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.440
and monitors your hormones,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.100
a huge number of different
parameters of health

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.420
that really can only
be measured accurately

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.540
through blood and saliva tests.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.380
I use Inside Tracker because
I'm a big believer in data.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.370
There's a lot of aspects to our biology

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.790
that can only be accurately measured

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.440
by way of blood tests and saliva tests.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.700
The thing that's really
nice about Inside Tracker

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.350
is that rather than just giving
you a bunch of numbers back

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.100
of the levels of these
things in your body,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.150
it gives you, through a
really simple platform,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.260
information about what to do

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.230
with all those levels of hormones

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.490
and metabolic markers, et cetera.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.660
It also has a feature which
is particularly interesting

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.690
which it measures your inner age,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.300
which is more a measure
of your biological age

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.430
as opposed to your chronological age.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.560
And all that information is organized

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.790
so that you can make changes

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.930
in your nutritional regimes
or your exercise regimes

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.940
and watch how those
markers change over time.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.390
So if you want to try Inside Tracker

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.710
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.040
and they'll give you 25% off at checkout.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.580
So let's talk about the nervous system.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.710
The reason I say your nervous
system and not your brain

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.060
is because your brain is
actually just one piece

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.070
of this larger, more
important thing, frankly,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.890
that we call the nervous system.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.930
The nervous system includes
your brain and your spinal cord

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.670
but also all the connections
between your brain

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.550
and your spinal cord and
the organs of your body.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.220
It also includes, very importantly,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.510
all the connections between your organs

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.560
back to your spinal cord and brain.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.220
So the way to think about how
you function at every level

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.100
from the moment you're
born until the day you die,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.910
everything you think and
remember and feel and imagine

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.030
is that your nervous system
is this continuous loop

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.310
of communication between the
brain, spinal cord, and body

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.270
and body, spinal cord, and brain.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.900
In fact, we really can't
even separate them.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.751
It's one continuous loop.

00:05:57.751 --> 00:06:01.230
You may have heard of something
called a Mobius strip.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.670
A Mobius strip is almost like one of

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.410
these impossible figures
that no matter which angle

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.243
you look at it from

00:06:06.243 --> 00:06:08.180
you can't tell where it
starts and where it ends.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.490
And that's really how your
nervous system is built.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.529
That's the structure that
allows you to, for instance,

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.530
deploy immune cells,

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.430
to release cells that
will go kill infection

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.880
when you're in the presence of infection.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.470
Most people just think about that

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.350
as a function of the immune system

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.030
but actually it's your nervous system

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.970
that tells organs like your spleen

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.071
to release killer cells
that go and hunt down

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:37.660
those bacterial and viral
invaders and gobble them up.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.550
If you have a stomach ache, for instance,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.610
sure, you feel that in your stomach,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.310
but it's really your nervous system

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.520
that's causing the stomach ache.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.300
The ache aspect of it is
a nervous system feature.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.420
So when we want to talk about experience

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.930
or we want to talk about how
to change the self in any way,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.810
we really need to think about
the nervous system first.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.760
It is fair to say

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.350
that the nervous system governs

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.320
all other biological systems of the body,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.410
and it's also influenced by
those other biological systems.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.900
So if we're talking
about the nervous system

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.240
we need to get a little
specific about what we mean.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.780
It's not just this big loop of wires.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.470
In fact, there's a
interesting story about that

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.450
because at the turn of the
sort of 1800s to 1900s,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.550
it actually was believed

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.550
that our nervous system
was just one giant cell.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.270
But two guys, that names
aren't super important,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.620
but in fairness to their
important discovery,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.370
Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard,
Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.020
figured out how to label
or stain the nervous system

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.240
in a way that revealed, oh my goodness,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.960
we're actually made up of
trillions of these little cells,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.080
nerve cells that are called neurons.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.020
And that's what a neuron is.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.350
It's just a nerve cell.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.760
They also saw

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.620
that those nerve cells
weren't touching one another.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.580
They're actually separated by little gaps.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.000
And those little gaps you
may have heard of before,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.900
they're called synapses.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.100
Those synapses are where the chemicals

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.330
from one neuron are kind of
spit out or vomited into.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.700
And then the next nerve
cell detects those chemicals

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.410
and then passes
electricity down its length

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.450
to the next nerve cell and so forth.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.280
So really the way to think about
your body and your thoughts

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.670
and your mind is that you are
a flow of electricity, right?

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.030
There's nothing mystical about this.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.420
You're a flow of electricity

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.340
between these different nerve cells.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.590
And depending on which
nerve cells are active

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.950
you might be lifting your
arm or lowering your arm.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.140
You might be seeing something
and perceiving that it's red

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.270
or you might be seeing something

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.580
and perceiving that it's green,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.840
all depending on which nerve
cells are electrically active

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.803
at a given moment.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.360
The example of perceiving
red or perceiving green

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.300
is a particularly good example

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.540
because so often our
experience of the world

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.480
makes it seem as if these out these things

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.760
that are happening outside us

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.980
are actually happening inside us.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.310
But the language of the nervous
system is just electricity.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.710
It's just like a Morse code of some sort

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.530
or the syllables and words and consonants

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.620
and vowels of language.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.040
It just depends on how
they're assembled, what order.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.010
And so that brings us

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.950
to the issue of how the
nervous system works.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.260
The way to think about how
the nervous system works

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.860
is that our experiences, our memories,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.530
everything is sort of
like the keys on a piano

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.940
being played in a particular order, right?

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.550
If I play the keys on a
piano in a particular order

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.010
and with a particular
intensity, that's a given song.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.760
We can make that analogous
to a given experience.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.430
It's not really that the key, you know,

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.440
A sharp or E flat is the song.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.170
It's just one component of the song.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.000
So when you hear that,
you know, for instance,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.180
there's a brain area
called the hippocampus,

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.040
which there is, that's involved in memory.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.830
Well, it's involved in memory,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.910
but it's not that memories
are stored there as,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.770
you know, sentences.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.070
They're stored there as patterns
of electricity in neurons

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.740
that when repeated, give you the sense

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.950
that you are experiencing the thing again.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.540
In fact, deja vu,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.260
the sense that what you're
experiencing is so familiar

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.920
and like something that
you've experienced previously

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.320
is merely that the neurons

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.510
that were active in one circumstance

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.790
are now becoming active in
the same circumstance again.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.620
And so it's really just
like hearing the same song

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.320
maybe not played on a piano

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.700
but next time on a classical guitar,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.810
there's something similar about that song

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.120
even though it's being played
on two different instruments.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.790
So I think it's important

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.557
that people understand the
parts of their nervous system,

00:10:34.557 --> 00:10:38.250
and that it includes so much
more than just the brain

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.010
and that there are these
things, neurons and synapses.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.900
But really that it's
the electrical activity

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.140
of these neurons that
dictates our experience.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.740
So if the early 1900s were when

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.410
these neurons were discovered,

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.320
certainly a lot has happened since then.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.800
And in that time between
the early 1900s and now

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.850
there's some important events

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.829
that actually happened in history

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:05.910
that gave us insight into
how the nervous system works.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.610
One of the more surprising
ones was actually warfare.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.170
So as most everybody knows in warfare

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.170
people get shot and people often die

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.730
but many people get
shot and they don't die.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.730
And in World War One, there
were some changes in artillery,

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.070
in bullets that made for a situation

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.690
where bullets would
enter the body and brain

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.330
at very discrete locations

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.010
and would go out the other
side of the body or brain

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.330
and also make a very small
hole at that exit location.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.905
And in doing so produced a lot

00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:44.220
of naturally occurring
lesions of the nervous system.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.261
Now you say, okay, well,
how does that relate

00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:48.265
to neuroscience?

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:50.500
Well, unlike previous years

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.510
where a lot of the artillery
would create these big

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.890
sort of holes as the bullets

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.530
would blow out of the brain or body,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.360
I know this is rather gruesome,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.610
when the holes were very discrete

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.180
they entered at one point
and left at another point,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.300
they would take out or destroy

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.460
very discrete bits of neural
tissue, of the nervous system.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.100
So people were coming back from war

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.970
with holes in their brain

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.540
and in other parts of their nervous system

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.250
that were limited to
very specific locations.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.020
In addition to that,
there was some advancement

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.250
in the cleaning of wounds that happened

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.393
so many more people were surviving.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.250
What this meant was that neurologists

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.650
now had a collection of patients

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.860
that would come back and they'd have holes

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.310
in very specific locations of their brain.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.230
And they'd say things like,
well, I can recognize faces

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.680
but I can't recognize who
those faces belong to.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.880
I know it's a face, but I
don't know who it belongs to.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.870
And after that person eventually died

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.070
the neurologist would figure out,

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.700
ah, I've had 10 patients that all told me

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.120
that they couldn't recognize faces.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.480
And they all had these bullet holes

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.400
that went through a particular
region of the brain.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.500
And that's how we know a lot

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.970
about how particular brain regions

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.870
like the hippocampus work.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.010
In fact, some of the more
amazing examples of this,

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.540
where people would come
back and they, for instance,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.902
would speak in complete gibberish

00:13:12.902 --> 00:13:15.700
whereas previously they
could speak normally.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.540
And even though they were
speaking in complete gibberish

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.330
they could understand language perfectly.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.950
That's how we know that
speech and language

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.970
are actually controlled

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.230
by separate portions
of the nervous system.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.160
And there are many examples like that.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.830
People that couldn't recognize
the faces of famous people

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.560
or, and that actually brings us

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.760
to an interesting example in modern times.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.190
Many, many years later in the early 2000s

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.978
there was actually a
paper that was published

00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:42.890
in the journal "Nature",
excellent journal,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.810
showing that in a human being,

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.630
a perfectly healthy human being,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.890
there was a neuron that would become

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.140
electrically active only when the person

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.190
viewed the picture of
Jennifer Aniston, the actress.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.100
So literally a neuron that
represented Jennifer Aniston,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.570
so-called Jennifer Aniston cells,

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.870
neuroscientists know about
the Jennifer Aniston cells.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.990
If you can recognize
Jennifer Aniston's face

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.840
you have Jennifer Aniston neurons,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.160
and presumably also have neurons

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.630
that can recognize the faces

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.480
of other famous and non-famous people.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.210
So that indicates

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.270
that our brain is really
a map of our experience.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.090
We come into the world and
our brain has a kind of bias

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.960
towards learning
particular kinds of things.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.890
It's ready to receive information

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.450
and learn that information,

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.660
but the brain is really
a map of experience.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.630
So let's talk about what
experience really is.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.440
What does it mean for your brain to work?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.005
Well I think it's fair to say

00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:42.320
that the nervous system really
does five things, maybe six.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.370
The first one is sensation.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.290
So this is important to understand

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.550
for any and all of you

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.530
that want to change your nervous system

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.560
or to apply tools to make your
nervous system work better.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.200
Sensation is a non-negotiable element

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.420
of your nervous system.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.730
You have neurons in your eye that perceive

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.120
certain colors of light and
certain directions of movement.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.780
You have neurons in
your skin that perceive

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.150
particular kinds of touch,
like light touch or firm touch

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.970
or painful touch.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.020
You have neurons in your ears
that perceive certain sounds.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.020
Your entire experience of
life is filtered by these,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.510
what we call sensory receptors

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.810
if you want to know what the name is.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.760
So this always raises
an interesting question.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.430
People ask, well, is
there much more out there?

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.600
Is there a lot more happening in the world

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.330
that I'm not experiencing

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.600
or that humans aren't experiencing?

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.500
And the answer of course is yes,

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.230
there are many species on this planet

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.130
that are perceiving things
that we will never perceive

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.500
unless we apply technology.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.190
The best example I could think
of off the top of my head

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.580
would be something like infrared vision.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.760
There are snakes out there,
pit vipers and so forth,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.110
that can sense heat
emissions from other animals.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.740
They don't actually see their shape.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.440
They sense their heat shape
and their heat emissions.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.520
Humans can't do that

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.140
unless of course they
put on infrared goggles

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.260
or something that would allow them

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.390
to detect those heat emissions.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.570
There are turtles and
certain species of birds

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.230
that migrate long distances
that can detect magnetic fields

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.970
because they have neurons,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.570
again, it's the nervous system
that allows them to do this.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.350
So they have neurons in
their nose and in their head

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.540
that allow them to migrate
along magnetic fields

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.030
in order to, as amazing as this sounds,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.040
go from one particular
location in the ocean,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.980
thousands of miles away

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.090
to all aggregate on one particular beach

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.600
at a particular time of year

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.250
so that they can mate, lay eggs,

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.860
and then wander back
off into the sea to die.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.870
And then their young
will eventually hatch,

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.830
those cute little turtles
will shuffle to the ocean,

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.430
swim off and go do the exact same thing.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.820
They don't migrate that
distance by vision.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.890
They don't do it by smell.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.400
They do it by sensing magnetic fields.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.030
And many other species do
these incredible things.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.530
We don't, humans are not
magnetic sensing organisms.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.017
We can't do that

00:17:09.017 --> 00:17:11.670
because we don't have receptors
that sense magnetic fields.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.190
There's some data that maybe some humans

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.890
can sense magnetic fields

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.500
but you should be very skeptical of anyone

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.200
that's convinced that they can do that

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.300
with any degree of robustness or accuracy,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.600
because even the people that can do this

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.980
aren't necessarily aware that they can.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.290
Maybe a topic for a future podcast.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.040
So we have sensation,
then we have perception.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.210
Perception is our ability
to take what we're sensing

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.380
and focus on it and make sense of it,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.000
to explore it, to remember it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.610
So really perceptions are
just whichever sensations

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.240
we happen to be paying
attention to at any moment.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.720
And you can do this right now.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.580
You can experience perception

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.940
and the difference between
perception and sensation

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.320
very easily.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.550
If, for instance, I tell
you to pay attention

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.390
to the contact of your feet,
the bottoms of your feet,

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.920
with whatever surface they
happen to be in contact with,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.660
maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.210
if your feet are up maybe it's air.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.090
The moment you place your,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.870
what we call the spotlight of attention

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.190
or the spotlight of
perception on your feet.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.880
You are now perceiving
what was happening there,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.140
what was being sensed there.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.880
The sensation was happening
all along however.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.790
So while sensation is not negotiable

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.310
you can't change your receptors

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.770
unless you adopt some new technology,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.200
perception is under the
control of your attention.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.760
And the way to think about attention

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.253
is it's like a spotlight,
except it's not one spotlight.

00:18:38.271 --> 00:18:40.760
You actually have two
attentional spotlights.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.070
Anyone that tells you you can't multitask,

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.450
tell them they're wrong.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.490
And if they disagree with
you tell them to contact me

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.490
because in old world
primates of which humans are,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.720
we are able to do what's
called covert attention.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.390
We can place a spotlight
of attention on something,

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.810
for instance, something
we're reading or looking at

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.130
or someone that we're listening to.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.250
And we can place a second
spotlight of attention

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.410
on something we're
eating and how it tastes

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.710
or our child running around
in the room or my dog.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.030
You can split your
attention into two locations

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.960
but of course you can
also bring your attention,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.470
that is, your perception,
to one particular location.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.910
You can dilate your attention

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.100
kind of like making a
spotlight more diffuse

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.150
or you can make it more concentrated.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.940
This is very important to understand

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.900
if you're going to think about tools

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.830
to improve your nervous system,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.240
whether or not that tool is
in the form of a chemical

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.090
that you decide to
take, maybe a supplement

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.850
to increase some chemical in your brain

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.820
if that's your choice,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.837
or a brain machine device

00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:45.670
or you're going to try
and learn something better

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.150
by engaging in some focus
or motivated pursuit

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.230
for some period of time each day.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.550
Attention is something

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.370
that is absolutely under your control,

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.820
in particular when you're rested.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.920
And we'll get back to this.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.920
But when you are rested, and
we'll define rest very clearly,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.680
you are able to direct your attention

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.090
in very deliberate ways.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.010
And that's because we have
something in our nervous system

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.370
which is sort of like a two way street.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.500
And that two way street is a communication

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.010
between the aspects of our
nervous system that are reflexive

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.520
and the aspects of our nervous
system that are deliberate.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.180
So we all know what it's
like to be reflexive.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.900
You go through life, you're walking.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.130
If you already know how to walk

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.510
you don't think about your walking.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.830
You just walk.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.680
And that's because the nervous
system wants to pass off

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.276
as much as it can to reflexive action.

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:39.640
That's called bottom up processing.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.700
It really just means that information

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.920
is flowing in through your senses,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.680
regardless of what you're perceiving,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.990
that information is flowing up

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.330
and it's directing your activity.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.310
But at any moment, for instance,

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.390
let's say a car screeches in
front of you around the corner,

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.740
and you suddenly pause.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.480
You are now moving into deliberate action.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.770
You would start looking around
in a very deliberate way.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.550
The nervous system can be
reflexive in its action

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.290
or it can be deliberate.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.960
If reflexive action tends to
be what we call bottom up,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.220
deliberate action and
deliberate perceptions

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.640
and deliberate thoughts are top down.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.010
They require some effort and some focus.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.940
But that's the point,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.610
you can decide to focus
your attention and energy

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.890
on anything you want.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.570
You can decide to focus your
behavior in any way you want.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.090
But it will always feel

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.490
like it requires some
effort and some strain.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.840
Whereas when you're in reflexive mode,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.760
just walking and talking and
eating and doing your thing

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.320
it's going to feel very easy.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.570
And that's because your nervous system

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.370
basically wired up to be able

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.540
to do most things easily
without much metabolic demand,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.090
without consuming much energy.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.080
But the moment you try and
do something very specific,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.900
you're going to feel a
sort of mental friction.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.480
It's going to be challenging.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.010
So we've got sensations, perceptions,

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.120
and then we've got things

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.820
that we call feelings slash emotions.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.820
And these get a little complicated
because almost all of us,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.420
I would hope all of us,
are familiar with things

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.820
like happiness and sadness
or boredom or frustration.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.870
Scientists argue like crazy,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.350
neuroscientists and psychologists

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.780
and philosophers for that matter,

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.750
argue like crazy about what
these are and how they work.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.780
Certainly emotions and feelings

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.060
are the product of the nervous system.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.600
They involve the activity of neurons.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.540
But as I mentioned earlier,
neurons are electrically active

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.400
but they also release chemicals.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.443
And there's a certain
category of chemicals

00:22:33.443 --> 00:22:36.270
that has a very profound influence

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.173
on our emotional states.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.470
They're called neuromodulators.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.520
And those neuromodulators
have names that probably

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.700
you've heard of before.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.910
Things like dopamine and serotonin

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.053
and acetylcholine, epinephrine.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.390
Neuromodulators are really interesting

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.770
because they bias which
neurons are likely to be active

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.710
and which ones are likely to be inactive.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.750
A simple way to think
about neuromodulators

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.990
is they are sort of like playlists

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.740
that you would have on any kind of device

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.210
where you're going to play
particular categories of music.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.070
So for instance, dopamine,
which is often discussed

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:16.070
as the molecule of reward or
joy, it is involved in reward.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.626
And it does tend to create
a sort of upbeat mood

00:23:20.626 --> 00:23:23.450
when released in appropriate
amounts in the brain.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.740
But the reason it does
that is because it makes

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.060
certain neurons and neural
circuits as we call them

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.670
more active and others less active.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.040
Okay.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.400
So serotonin, for instance,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.200
is a molecule that when released

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.400
tends to make us feel really
good with what we have,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.980
our sort of internal landscape

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.660
and the resources that we have,

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.360
whereas dopamine more than
being a molecule of reward

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.360
is really more a molecule of motivation

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.243
toward things that are outside us

00:23:52.243 --> 00:23:53.830
and that we want to pursue.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.570
And we can look at healthy conditions

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.450
or situations like being
in pursuit of a goal

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.280
where every time we accomplish something

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.690
en route to that goal, a little
bit of dopamine is released

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.640
and we feel more motivation, that happens.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.790
We can also look at the extreme example

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.150
of something like mania,

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.540
where somebody is so
relentlessly in pursuit

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.610
of external things like
money and relationships

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.380
that they're sort of in this
delusional state of thinking

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.210
that they have the
resources that they need

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.370
in order to pursue all these things

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.680
when in fact they don't.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.510
So these neuromodulators can exist

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.760
in normal levels, low levels, high levels.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.520
And that actually gives us a window

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.608
into a very important aspect
of neuroscience history

00:24:34.608 --> 00:24:36.900
that all of us are impacted by today,

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.160
which is the discovery of antidepressants

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.130
and so-called anti-psychotics.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.600
In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.410
it was discovered that
there are compounds,

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.130
chemicals that can increase
or decrease serotonin,

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.840
that can increase or decrease dopamine.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.010
And that led to the development

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.990
of most of what we call antidepressants.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.030
Now, the trick here or the problem

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.360
is that most of these drugs,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.720
especially in the 1950s and '60s,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.070
they would reduce serotonin

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.760
but they would also reduce dopamine

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.090
or they would increase serotonin,

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.490
but they would also increase

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.320
some other neuromodulator chemical.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.340
And that's because all these
chemical systems in the body,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.480
but the neuromodulators in particular,

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.400
have a lot of receptors.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.830
Now, these are different
than the receptors

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.030
we were talking about earlier.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.370
The receptors I'm talking about now

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.750
are sort of like parking spots
where dopamine is released.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.663
And if it attaches to a
receptor, say on the heart,

00:25:32.663 --> 00:25:35.210
it might make the heart beat faster

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.630
because there's a certain
kind of receptor on the heart.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.020
Whereas if dopamine is released

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.490
and goes and attaches to muscle

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.670
it might have a completely
different effect on the muscle.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.520
And in fact, it does.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.967
So different receptors on
different organs of the body

00:25:48.967 --> 00:25:51.460
are the ways that these neuromodulators

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.780
can have all these different effects

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.910
on different aspects of our biology.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.900
This is most salient in the example

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.640
of some of the antidepressants
that have sexual side effects

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.920
or that blunt appetite
or that blunt motivation.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.320
You know, many of these
which increase serotonin

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.360
can be very beneficial for people.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.550
It can elevate their mood.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.800
It can make them feel better.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.050
But they also if their,
the doses are too high

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.650
or if that particular drug
isn't right for somebody

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.400
that person experiences
challenges with motivation

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.840
or appetite or libido

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.840
because serotonin is binding to receptors

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.730
in the areas of the brain

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.220
that control those other things as well.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.020
So we talked about sensation.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.470
We talked about perception.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.510
When we talk about feelings,

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.910
we have to consider these neuromodulators.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.668
And we have to consider also
that feelings and emotions

00:26:40.668 --> 00:26:42.770
are contextual.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.550
In some cultures showing a
lot of joy or a lot of sadness

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.890
is entirely appropriate,

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.480
in other cultures it's
considered inappropriate.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.860
So I don't think it's fair to say

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.210
that there is a sadness
circuit or area of the brain

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.560
or a happiness circuit
or area of the brain.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.460
However, it is fair to
say that certain chemicals

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.070
and certain brain
circuits tend to be active

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.670
when we are in motivated states,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:09.380
tend to be active when we are
in non-motivated lazy states,

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.630
tend to be active when we are focused

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.103
and tend to be active
when we are not focused.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.650
I want to emphasize also

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:22.020
that emotions are something
that we generally feel

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.260
are not under our control.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.140
We feel like they kind
of geyser up within us

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.220
and they just kind of happen to us.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.920
And that's because they
are somewhat reflexive.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.440
We don't really set out

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.100
with a deliberate thought to be happy

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.810
or a deliberate thought to be sad.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.140
We tend to experience them

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.890
in kind of a passive reflexive way.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.870
And that brings us to the next
thing, which are thoughts.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.490
Thoughts are really interesting because

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.780
in many ways they're like perceptions

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.460
except that they draw on

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.480
not just what's happening in the present

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.320
but also things we remember from the past

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.120
and things that we
anticipate about the future.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.060
The other thing about thoughts
that's really interesting

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.790
is that thoughts can be both reflexive,

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.690
they can just be occurring all the time

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.420
sort of like pop-up windows

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.223
on a poorly filtered web browser,
or they can be deliberate.

00:28:09.223 --> 00:28:10.080
We can decide to have a thought.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.130
In fact, right now you could
decide to have a thought

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.950
just like you would decide
to write something out

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.320
on a piece of paper.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.680
You could decide that you're
listening to a podcast,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.890
that you are in a particular location.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.540
You're not just paying
attention to what's happening,

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.800
you're directing your thought process.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.560
And a lot of people don't understand

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.780
or at least appreciate
that the thought patterns

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.600
and the neural circuits
that underlie thoughts

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.690
can actually be controlled
in this deliberate way.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.370
And then finally there are actions.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:40.210
Actions or behaviors are perhaps
the most important aspect

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.610
of our nervous system.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.712
Because first of all,

00:28:43.712 --> 00:28:46.630
our behaviors are actually the only thing

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.540
that are going to create any
fossil record of our existence.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.160
You know, after we die, the
nervous system deteriorates,

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.850
our skeleton will remain.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.410
But it's, you know, in the moment

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.560
of experiencing something very joyful

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.540
or something very sad, it
can feel so all encompassing

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.960
that we actually think
that it has some meaning

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.210
beyond that moment.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.373
But actually for humans and
I think for all species,

00:29:12.373 --> 00:29:16.520
the sensations, the
perceptions and the thoughts

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.800
and the feelings that
we have in our lifespan,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.740
none of that is actually carried forward

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.910
except the ones that we take

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.960
and we convert into
actions such as writing,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.470
actions such as words,

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.720
actions such as engineering new things.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.270
And so the fossil record of
our species and each one of us

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.090
is really through action.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.350
And that, in part, is why so
much of our nervous system

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.880
is devoted to converting
sensation, perceptions, feelings,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.690
and thoughts into actions.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.420
In fact, the great neuroscientist

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.410
or physiologist Sherrington
won a Nobel prize

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.000
for his work in mapping
some of the circuitry,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.520
the connections between nerve cells

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.470
that give rise to movement.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.200
And he said, "Movement is
the final common pathway".

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.560
The other way to think about it is that

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.631
one of the reasons that
our central nervous system,

00:30:12.631 --> 00:30:14.970
our brain and spinal cord
include this stuff in our skull

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.150
but also connects so heavily to the body

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.860
is because most everything
that we experience,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.630
including our thoughts and feelings,

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.950
was really designed to either
impact our behavior or not.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.020
And the fact that
thoughts allow us to reach

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.010
into the past and anticipate the future

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.740
and not just experience
what's happening in the moment

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.140
gave rise to an incredible capacity

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.150
for us to engage in behaviors

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.870
that are not just for the moment,

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.970
they're based on things
that we know from the past

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.950
and that we would like
to see in the future.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.850
And this aspect of our nervous
system, of creating movement,

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.510
occurs through some very simple pathways.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.880
The reflexive pathway basically

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.820
includes areas of the brain stem

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.030
we call central pattern generators.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.070
When you walk, provided you
already know how to walk,

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.130
you are basically walking

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.040
because you have these
central pattern generators,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.330
groups of neurons that generate

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.980
right foot, left foot,
right foot, left foot

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.080
kind of movement.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.620
However, when you decide to move

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.200
in a particular deliberate way

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.270
that requires a little more attention

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.151
you start to engage areas of your brain

00:31:17.151 --> 00:31:18.910
for top-down processing

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.660
where your forebrain
works from the top down

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.630
to control those central
pattern generators

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.220
so that maybe it's right foot, right foot,

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.167
left foot, right foot,
right foot, left foot

00:31:29.167 --> 00:31:30.170
if maybe you're hiking along
some rocks or something.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.590
And you have to engage
in that kind of movement.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.030
So movement, just like thoughts,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.470
can be either reflexive or deliberate.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.030
And when we talk about deliberate

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.070
I want to be very specific
about how your brain works

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.903
in a deliberate way

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:48.490
because it gives rise to
a very important feature

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.280
of the nervous system that
we're going to talk about next,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.010
which is your ability to
change your nervous system.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.210
And what I'd like to
center on for a second

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.100
is this notion of what does it mean

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.110
for the nervous system to
do something deliberately?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.520
Well, when you do something deliberately,

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.710
you pay attention, you are
bringing your perception

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.500
to an analysis of three things,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.740
duration, how long something
is is going to take

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.200
or should be done,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.260
path, what you should be doing,

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.300
and outcome, if you do something

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.640
for a given length of time,
what's going to happen.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.570
Now when you're walking down
the street or you're eating

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.170
or you're just talking
reflexively, you're not doing this

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.750
what I call DPO, duration, path, outcome,

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.450
type of deliberate function

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.330
in your brain and nervous system.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.090
But the moment you
decide to learn something

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.110
or to resist speaking

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.450
or to speak up when you
would rather be quiet,

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.120
anytime you're deliberately

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.720
kind of forcing yourself over a threshold,

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.590
you're engaging these brain circuits

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.400
and these nervous system circuits

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.170
that suddenly make it feel as
if something is challenging.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.650
Something has changed.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:54.750
Well, what's changed?

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.870
What's changed is that when you engage

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.530
in this duration, path, and outcome

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.970
type of thinking or
behavior or way of being

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.070
you start to recruit these neuromodulators

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.370
that are released from
particular areas of your brain,

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.940
and also it turns out from your body.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.280
and they start cuing
to your nervous system.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.130
Something's different.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.330
Something's different
now about what I'm doing.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.420
Something's different
about what I'm feeling.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.970
Let's give an example where perhaps

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.190
somebody says something
that's triggering to you.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.240
You don't like it.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.360
And you know you shouldn't respond.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.030
You feel like, oh, I shouldn't respond,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.420
I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.870
You're actively suppressing your behavior

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.670
through top down processing.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.620
Your forebrain is actually preventing you

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.370
from saying the thing that
you know you shouldn't say

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.810
or that maybe you should wait to say

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.590
or say in a different form.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.810
This feels like agitation and stress

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.150
because you're actually
suppressing a circuit.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.620
We actually can see examples

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.130
of what happens when
you're not doing this well.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.000
Some of the examples come from children.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.470
If you look at young children

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.602
they don't have the forebrain circuitry

00:33:57.602 --> 00:33:59.940
to engage in this top down processing

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.360
until they reach age 22, even 25.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.950
But in young children, you see
this in a really robust way.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.750
You'll see they'll be
rocking back and forth.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.050
It's hard for them to sit still

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.990
because those central pattern generators

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:13.440
are constantly going in the background.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.450
Whereas adults can sit still.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.680
A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.710
and will just reach out and grab it.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.620
Whereas an adult probably would ask

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.453
if they could have a piece

00:34:22.453 --> 00:34:25.620
or wait until they were
offered a piece in most cases.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.020
People that have damage
to the certain areas

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.150
of the frontal lobes don't
have this kind of restriction.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.620
They'll just blurt things out.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.520
They'll just say things.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.020
We all know people like this.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.000
Impulsivity is a lack of top down control,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.170
a lack of top-down processing.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.190
The other thing that will
turn off the forebrain

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.300
and make it harder to top-down processing

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.600
is a couple of drinks containing alcohol.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.240
The removal of inhibition is actually

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.620
removal of neural inhibition,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.120
of nerve cells suppressing the activity

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.490
of other nerve cells.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.350
And so when you look at people

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.140
that have damage to their frontal lobes

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.130
or you look at puppies or
you look at young children,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.450
everything's a stimulus.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.460
Everything is a potential
interaction for them.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.890
And they have a very hard time

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.560
restricting their
behavior and their speech.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.330
So a lot of the motor system
is designed to just work

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.860
in a reflexive way.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.790
And then when we decide
we want to learn something

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.210
or do something or not do something,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.720
we have to engage in this
top-down restriction.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.260
And it feels like agitation
because it's accompanied

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.120
by the release of a neuromodulator
called norepinephrine,

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.110
which in the body we call adrenaline.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.360
And it actually makes us feel agitated.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.655
So for those of you that are
trying to learn something new

00:35:36.655 --> 00:35:39.160
or to learn to suppress your responses

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.541
or be more deliberate and
careful in your responses,

00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:46.510
that is going to feel challenging
for a particular reason.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.580
It's going to feel challenging

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.900
because the chemicals in
your body that are released

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.440
in association with that effort

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.670
are designed to make you
feel kind of agitated.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.650
That low-level tremor
that sometimes people feel

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.100
when they're really, really angry

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.440
is actually a chemically
induced low-level tremor.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.950
And it's the, what I call limbic friction.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.900
There's an area of your brain

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.600
that's involved in our more
primitive reflexive responses

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.010
called the limbic system.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.790
And the frontal cortex is in a friction,

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:16.050
it's in a tug of war with
that system all the time.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.300
Unless of course you have
damage to the frontal lobe

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.830
or you've had too much
to drink or something.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.360
In which case you tend to
just say and do whatever.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.510
And so this is really
important to understand

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.770
because if you want to
understand neuroplasticity,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.790
you want to understand how
to shape your behavior,

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.880
how to shape your thinking,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.750
how to change how you're able
to perform in any context,

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.640
the most important thing to understand

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.790
is that it requires top-down processing.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.800
It requires this feeling of agitation.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.300
In fact, I would say
the agitation and strain

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.290
is the entry point to neuroplasticity.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.960
So let's take a look at
what neuroplasticity is.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.060
Let's explore it, not as the
way it's normally talked about

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.810
in modern culture,

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.900
neuroplasticity, plasticity is great.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.070
Well, what exactly do people mean?

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.070
Plasticity itself is just a process

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.477
by which neurons can
change their connections

00:37:06.477 --> 00:37:07.790
and the way they work

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.770
so that you can go from things

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.530
being very challenging and deliberate,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.520
requiring a lot of effort and strain,

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.050
to them being reflexive.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.850
And typically when we
hear about plasticity,

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:19.960
we're thinking about positive

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.410
or what I call adaptive plasticity.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.030
A lot of plasticity can be induced,

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.490
for instance by brain damage,

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.470
but that's generally not

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.190
the kind of plasticity that we want.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.890
So when I say plasticity,
unless I say otherwise

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.710
I mean adaptive plasticity.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.220
And in particular

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.520
most of the neuroplasticity
that people want

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.640
is self-directed plasticity.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.460
Because if there's one
truism to neuroplasticity,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.720
it's that from birth until about age 25

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.680
the brain is incredibly plastic.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.700
Kids are learning all sorts of things

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.430
but they can learn it passively.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.840
They don't have to work
too hard or focus too hard,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.760
although focus helps, to learn new things,

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.150
acquire new languages, acquire new skills.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.120
But if you're an adult

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.820
and you want to change your
neural circuitry at the level

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.390
of emotions or behavior or
thoughts or anything really,

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:11.320
you absolutely need to ask
two important questions.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.480
One, what particular aspect

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.410
of my nervous system
am I trying to change?

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.480
Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.520
or my perceptions, my sensations?

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.860
And which ones are
available for me to change?

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.650
And then the second question is

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.290
how are you going to go about that?

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.890
What is the structure

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.380
of a regimen to engage neuroplasticity?

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.420
And it turns out that the
answer to that second question

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.130
is governed by how awake
or how sleepy we are.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.650
So let's talk about that next.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.210
Neuroplasticity is the ability

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.480
for these connections
in the brain and body

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.563
to change in response to experience.

00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:49.257
And what's so incredible

00:38:49.257 --> 00:38:51.060
about the human nervous
system in particular

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.140
is that we can direct
our own neural changes.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.460
We can decide that we
want to change our brain.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.570
In other words, our
brain can change itself

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.440
and our nervous system can change itself.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.310
And the same can't be said
for other organs of the body.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.190
Even though our other organs of the body

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.050
have some ability to change,
they can't direct it.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.780
They can't think and decide,

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.850
you know your gut doesn't say,

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.990
oh, you know, I want to be able

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.540
to digest spicy foods better

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.520
so I'm going to rearrange the connections

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.390
to be able to do that.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.160
Whereas your brain can decide

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.700
that you want to learn a language

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.070
or you want to be less
emotionally reactive

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.780
or more emotionally engaged,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.080
and you can undergo a series of steps

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.070
that will allow your brain
to make those changes

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.210
so that eventually it becomes
reflexive for you to do that,

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.093
which is absolutely incredible.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.464
For a long time it was
thought that neuroplasticity

00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:43.410
was the unique gift of
young animals and humans,

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.160
that it could only occur when we're young.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.160
And in fact, a young brain
is incredibly plastic.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.960
Children can learn three languages

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.160
without an accent reflexively,

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.800
whereas adults, it's very challenging.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.480
It takes a lot more effort and strain,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.200
a lot more of that duration,
path, outcome kind of thinking

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.239
in order to achieve those plastic changes.

00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:06.410
We now know, however, that
the adult brain can change

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:08.250
in response to experience.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.850
Nobel prizes were given

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.730
for the understanding that the young brain

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.420
can change very dramatically.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.664
I think one of the most
extreme examples would be

00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:20.010
for people that are born blind from birth

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.500
they use the area of their brain

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.780
that normally would be used

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.150
for visualizing objects and colors

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.220
and things outside of
them for braille reading.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.260
In brain imaging studies it's
been shown that, you know,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.460
people who are blind from
birth, when they braille read,

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.293
the area of the brain

00:40:34.293 --> 00:40:39.293
that would normally light
up, if you will, for vision

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.000
lights up for braille reading.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.590
So that real estate is reallocated

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.343
for an entirely different function.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.610
If someone is made blind in adulthood,

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.130
it's unlikely that their
entire visual brain

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.590
will be taken over

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.890
by the areas of the brain that
are responsible for touch.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:00.220
However, there's some evidence
that areas of the brain

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.610
that are involved in hearing and touch

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.180
can kind of migrate into that area.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.540
And there's a lot of interest
now in trying to figure out

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:10.120
how more plasticity can
be induced in adulthood,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.400
more positive plasticity.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.670
And in order to understand that process

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.580
we really have to understand something

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.420
that might at first

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.920
seem totally divorced
from neuroplasticity,

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.950
but actually lies at the
center of neuroplasticity.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.460
And for any of you that are interested

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.070
in changing your nervous system

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.470
so that something that you want can go

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.410
from being very hard or
seem almost impossible

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.940
and out of reach to being very reflexive,

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.713
this is especially important
to pay attention to.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:43.430
Plasticity in the adult human
nervous system is gated,

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:47.670
meaning it is controlled
by neuromodulators.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.630
These things that we talked about earlier,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.258
dopamine, serotonin,

00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:54.373
and one in particular
called acetylcholine,

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.960
are what open up plasticity.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.240
They literally unveil plasticity

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.670
and allow brief periods of time

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.750
in which whatever information,

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.200
whatever thing we're sensing
or perceiving or thinking,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.060
whatever emotions we feel

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.300
can literally be mapped in the brain

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.280
such that later it will become much easier

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.960
for us to experience and feel that thing.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.960
Now, this has a dark
side and a positive side.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.280
The dark side is it's actually very easy

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.570
to get neuroplasticity as an adult

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:28.440
through traumatic or terrible
or challenging experiences.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.770
But the important question
is to say, why is that?

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.460
And the reason that's the case is because

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.320
when something very bad
happens, there's the release

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.660
of two sets of
neuromodulators in the brain,

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.290
epinephrine which tends to make
us feel alert and agitated,

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.200
which is associated with
most bad circumstances.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.830
And acetylcholine, which tends to create

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:55.100
a even more intense and
focused perceptual spotlight.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.895
Remember earlier we were
talking about perception

00:42:56.895 --> 00:42:58.860
and how it's kind of like a spotlight.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.530
Acetylcholine makes that
light particularly bright

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:06.130
and particularly restricted to
one region of our experience.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.630
And it does that by making certain neurons

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.336
in our brain and body

00:43:11.336 --> 00:43:14.720
active much more than all the rest.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.230
So acetylcholine is sorta
like a highlighter marker

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:22.180
upon which neuroplasticity
then comes in later and says,

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.860
wait, which neurons were active

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.800
in this particularly alerting
phase of whatever, you know,

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.830
day or night, whenever
this thing happened.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.670
So the way it works is this,
you can think of epinephrine

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.127
as creating this alertness

00:43:35.127 --> 00:43:39.020
and this kind of unbelievable
level of increased attention

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.710
compared to what you
were experiencing before.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.580
And you can think of acetylcholine

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.710
as being the molecule that
highlights whatever happens

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.480
during that period of
heightened alertness.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.110
So just to be clear,

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.800
it's epinephrine creates the alertness,

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.870
that's coming from a subset
of neurons in the brain stem

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.970
if you're interested,

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.228
and acetylcholine coming
from an area of the forebrain

00:44:01.228 --> 00:44:04.640
is tagging or marking the neurons

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.040
that are particularly active

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.990
during this heightened level of alertness.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.190
Now that marks the cells,
the neurons and the synapses

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.540
for strengthening,

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.600
for becoming more likely
to be active in the future

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.080
even without us thinking about it.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.567
Okay?

00:44:22.567 --> 00:44:24.340
So in bad circumstances

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.640
this all happens without
us having to do much.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.090
When we want something to happen, however,

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.220
we want to learn a language,
we want to learn a new skill,

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.390
we want to become more motivated,

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.580
what do we know for certain?

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.370
We know that that process
of getting neuroplasticity

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:42.540
so that we have more
focus, more motivation,

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.780
absolutely requires the
release of epinephrine.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.130
We have to have alertness
in order to have focus

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.920
and we have to have focus

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.830
in order to direct those plastic changes

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.710
to particular parts of our nervous system.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.291
Now, this has immense implications

00:45:00.291 --> 00:45:03.230
in thinking about the various tools,

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.520
whether or not those are
chemical tools or machine tools

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.970
or just self-induced regimens

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.840
of how long or how intensely
you're going to focus

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.903
in order to get neuroplasticity.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.210
But there's another side to it.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.970
The dirty secret of neuroplasticity

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.630
is that no neuroplasticity occurs

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.810
during the thing you're trying to learn,

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.630
during the terrible event,
during the great event.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:29.470
During the thing

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.510
that you're really trying
to shape and learn,

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:35.710
nothing is actually
changing between the neurons

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.210
that is going to last.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:41.640
All the neuroplasticity, the
strengthening of the synapses,

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.660
the addition, in some
cases, of new nerve cells

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.490
or at least connections
between nerve cells,

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.940
all of that occurs at a
very different phase of life

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.880
which is when we are in sleep
and non-sleep deep rest.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.330
And so neuroplasticity,

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.480
which is the kind of Holy
Grail of human experience of,

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.490
you know, this is the New Year

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.320
and everyone's thinking
New Year's resolutions.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.950
And right now, perhaps
everything's organized

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.440
and people are highly motivated

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.200
but what happens in March or April or May?

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.737
Well, that all depends
on how much attention

00:46:11.737 --> 00:46:14.230
and focus one can continually bring

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.100
to whatever it is they're trying to learn,

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.350
so much so that agitation
and a feeling of strain

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:20.980
are actually required

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.690
for this process of
neuro-plasticity to get triggered.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.270
But the actual rewiring occurs

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:30.690
during periods of sleep
and non-sleep deep rest.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.060
There's a study published last year

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.310
that's particularly relevant
here that I want to share,

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.350
it was not done by my laboratory,

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:41.320
that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.970
this is not deep sleep,

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.890
but essentially doing something
very hard and very intense

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.540
and then taking 20 minutes
immediately afterwards

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.350
to deliberately turn off

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.730
the deliberate focused
thinking and engagement

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.510
actually accelerated neuroplasticity.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.710
There's another study
that's just incredible.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:01.760
And we're going to go into this

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.210
in a future episode of the
podcast not too long from now,

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:10.210
that showed that if people are
learning a particular skill,

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.840
it could be a language
skill or a motor skill,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.380
and they hear a tone just
playing in the background,

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.560
and the tone is playing
periodically in the background,

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.510
like just a bell.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.740
In deep sleep, if that bell is played

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.730
learning is much faster for the thing

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.240
that they were learning
while they were awake.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.850
It somehow cues the
nervous system in sleep,

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.590
doesn't even have to be in dreaming,

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:38.050
that something that
happened in the waking phase

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.540
was especially important.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:43.630
So much so that that bell
is sort of a Pavlovian cue,

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.350
it's sort of a reminder
to the sleeping brain,

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.950
oh, you need to remember what it is

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:49.730
that you were learning at
that particular time of day.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.860
And the learning rates and
the rates of retention,

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.260
meaning how much people can remember

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.450
from the thing they learned,

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.860
are significantly higher
under those conditions.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.714
So I'm going to talk about how
to apply all this knowledge

00:48:01.714 --> 00:48:04.150
a little bit more in this podcast episode

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.970
but also in future episodes.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.826
But it really speaks to
the really key importance

00:48:09.826 --> 00:48:12.630
of sleep and focus,

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:15.800
these two opposite ends
of our attentional state.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.810
When we're in sleep these DPOs,

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.430
duration, path, and outcome
analysis are impossible.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.820
We just can't do that.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.460
We are only in relation to
what's happening inside of us.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.420
So sleep is key.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.120
Also key are periods
of non-sleep deep rest

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.000
where we're turning off our analysis

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.593
of duration, path, and outcome,

00:48:34.789 --> 00:48:35.990
in particular for the thing

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.170
that we were just trying to learn.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.290
And we're in this kind of liminal state

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.500
where our attention is
kind of drifting all over.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.970
It turns out that's very important

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.950
for the consolidation, for the changes

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:48.053
between the nerve cells that will allow

00:48:48.053 --> 00:48:49.980
what we were trying to learn to go

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:54.000
from being deliberate and hard
and stressful and a strain

00:48:55.052 --> 00:48:57.303
to easy and reflexive.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.270
This also points to how different people,

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.160
including many modern clinicians,

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.670
are thinking about how to prevent

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.660
bad circumstances, traumas,

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.320
from routing their way into
our nervous system permanently.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.999
It says that you might want to interfere

00:49:10.999 --> 00:49:14.240
with certain aspects of brain states

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.580
that are away from the
bad thing that happened,

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.600
the brain states that
happened the next day

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.810
or the next month or the next year.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.790
And also, I want to make sure

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.260
that I pay attention to the
fact that for many of you

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.650
you're thinking about neuro-plasticity

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:30.920
not just in changing your nervous system

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.420
to add something new

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.910
but to also get rid of things
that you don't like, right?

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:38.130
That you want to forget bad experiences

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.540
or at least remove the
emotional contingency

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.970
of a bad relationship

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.020
or a bad relationship to some thing

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.820
or some person or some event.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.000
Learning to fear certain things,
less to eliminate a phobia,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.790
to erase a trauma.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.010
The memories themselves don't get erased.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.600
I'm sorry to say

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.800
that the memories don't
themselves get erased,

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.680
but the emotional load of
memories can be reduced.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.950
And there are a number of different ways

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:03.220
that that can happen

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.670
but they all require this thing

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.550
that we're calling neuroplasticity.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.960
We're going to have a
large number of discussions

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.060
about neuroplasticity in depth,

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.480
but the most important thing to understand

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.460
is that it is indeed a two phase process.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.280
What governs the transition
between alert and focused

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.840
and these deep rest and deep sleep states

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.280
is a system in our brain and body,

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.880
a certain aspect of the nervous system

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.640
called the autonomic nervous system.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.850
And it is immensely
important to understand

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:36.310
how this autonomic nervous system works.

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.450
It has names like the
sympathetic nervous system

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.770
and parasympathetic nervous system

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.450
which frankly are complicated names

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.790
because they're a little bit misleading.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.610
Sympathetic is the one that's associated

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:46.450
with more alertness.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.130
Parasympathetic is the
one that's associated

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.790
with more calmness.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.140
And it gets really misleading

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:54.380
because the sympathetic nervous
system sounds like sympathy.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.910
And then people think
it's related to calm.

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:57.480
I'm going to call it the alertness system

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.230
and the calmness system,

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:02.730
because even though
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.420
are sometimes used, people
really get confused.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.730
So the way to think about
the autonomic nervous system

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.980
and the reason it's important
for every aspect of your life,

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.940
but in particular for neuroplasticity

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.857
and engaging in these focus states

00:51:15.857 --> 00:51:17.650
and in these de-focused states

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.910
is that it works sort of like a seesaw.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.030
Every 24 hours, we're all
familiar with the fact

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.230
that when we wake up in the morning

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.350
we might be a little bit groggy

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:26.990
but then generally we're more alert.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.180
And then as evening comes around

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.300
we tend to become a little
more relaxed and sleepy.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.690
Eventually at some point
at night, we go to sleep.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.920
So we go from alert to deeply calm.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.430
And as we do that, we go
from an ability to engage

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:43.322
in these very focused
duration, path, outcome

00:51:43.322 --> 00:51:44.155
types of analyses

00:51:44.155 --> 00:51:46.830
to states in sleep that
are completely divorced

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.520
from duration, path, and outcome

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.880
in which everything is
completely random and untethered

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.160
in terms of our sensations,
perceptions and feelings

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.090
and so forth.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.226
So every 24 hours, we
have a phase of our day

00:51:57.226 --> 00:52:02.226
that is optimal for thinking
and focusing and learning

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.800
and neuroplasticity and
doing all sorts of things.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.540
We have energy as well.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.940
And at another phase of our day

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.400
we're tired and we have
no ability to focus.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.700
We have no ability

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.860
to engage in duration, path,
outcome types of analyses.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.970
And it's interesting that
both phases are important

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.650
for shaping our nervous system
in the ways that we want.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.620
So if we want to engage neuroplasticity

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.300
and we want to get the most
out of our nervous system

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.831
we each have to master

00:52:28.831 --> 00:52:32.850
both the transition between
wakefulness and sleep

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.510
and the transition between
sleep and wakefulness.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.940
Now so much has been made
of the importance of sleep.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.320
And it is critically important

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.090
for wound healing, for
learning as I just mentioned,

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.060
for consolidating learning,

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.370
for all aspects of our immune system.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:48.540
It is the one period of time

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.373
in which we're not doing

00:52:49.373 --> 00:52:51.760
these duration, path, and
outcome types of analyses.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.920
And it is critically important

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.620
to all aspects of our health,
including our longevity.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.140
Much less has been made, however,

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.830
of how to get better at sleeping,

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.810
how to get better at the process

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.680
that involves falling
asleep, staying asleep,

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:10.090
and accessing the states of mind and body

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:11.770
that involve total paralysis.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:12.603
Most people don't know this

00:53:12.603 --> 00:53:14.930
but you're actually paralyzed
during much of your sleep

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:17.570
so that you can't act out
your dreams, presumably.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.870
But also where your brain
is in a total idle state

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.030
where it's not controlling anything,

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.103
it's just left to kind of free run.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.910
And there are certain
things that we can all do

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.430
in order to master that transition,

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:34.380
in order to get better at sleeping.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.710
And it involves much more
than just how much we sleep.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.430
We're all being told, of course,
that we need to sleep more

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:41.810
but there's also the
issue of sleep quality,

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:45.330
accessing those deep
States of non DPO thinking.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.140
Accessing the right timing of sleep,

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.670
not a lot has been discussed
publicly, as far as I'm aware,

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.610
of when to time your sleep.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.480
I think we all can appreciate

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.890
that sleeping for half an
hour throughout the day

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.565
so that you get a total
of eight hours of sleep

00:54:00.565 --> 00:54:02.420
every 24 hour cycle

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.050
is probably very different and not optimal

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.380
compared to a solid block
of eight hours of sleep.

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.940
Although there are people
that have tried this,

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.850
I think it's been written
about in various books.

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.500
Not many people can
stick to that schedule.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.610
Incidentally, I think it's
called the Uberman schedule,

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.070
not to be confused with
the Huberman schedule

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:19.903
because first of all

00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:21.310
my schedule doesn't
look anything like that.

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:22.143
And second of all

00:54:22.143 --> 00:54:24.533
I would never attempt
such a sleeping regime.

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:28.406
The other thing that is
really important to understand

00:54:28.406 --> 00:54:32.870
is that we have not
explored, as a culture,

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.880
the rhythms that occur
in our waking states.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.280
So much has been focused
on the value of sleep

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.470
and the importance of
sleep, which is great.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.970
But I don't think that most
people are paying attention

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:44.780
to what's happening in their waking states

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.540
and when their brain
is optimized for focus,

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.840
when their brain is optimized

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.240
for these DPOs, these
duration, path, outcome

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.230
types of engagements for
learning and for changing

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.360
and when are their brain
is probably better suited

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.560
for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.880
And it turns out

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.820
that there's a vast
amount of scientific data

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:06.400
which points to the existence

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.500
of what are called ultradian rhythms.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.800
You may have heard of circadian rhythms.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.690
Circadian means, circa, about a day.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.664
So it's 24 hour rhythms

00:55:15.664 --> 00:55:18.140
because the earth spins
once every 24 hours.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.284
Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:24.680
and they require less
time, they're shorter.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.170
The most important ultradian rhythm

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.370
for sake of this discussion

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:29.650
is the 90 minute rhythm
that we're going through

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:34.030
all the time in our ability
to attend and focus.

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:37.440
And in sleep, we are,
our sleep is broken up

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.540
into 90 minute segments.

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.373
Early in the night

00:55:40.373 --> 00:55:42.990
we have more phase one and
phase two lighter sleep.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.823
And then we go into

00:55:43.823 --> 00:55:45.390
our deeper phase three
and phase four sleep.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.560
And then we return to phase
one, two, three, four.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.530
So all night, you're going

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:50.220
through these ultradian rhythms

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.560
of stage one, two, three, four,

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.970
one, two, three, four, it's repeating.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.040
Most people perhaps know that.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.873
Maybe they don't.

00:55:57.873 --> 00:56:00.160
But you wake up in the morning,

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.340
these ultradian rhythms continue.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.530
And it turns out that we are optimized

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.540
for focus and attention
within these 90 minute cycles

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.840
so that at the beginning of
one of these 90 minute cycles

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.500
maybe you sit down to learn something new

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.740
or to engage in some new
challenging behavior,

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.210
for the first five or 10
minutes of one of those cycles

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:20.850
it's well-known that the
brain and the neural circuits

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:24.880
and the neuromodulators are
not going to be optimally tuned

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.120
to whatever it is you're trying to do.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.600
But as you drop deeper
into that 90 minute cycle

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.270
your ability to focus and to
engage in this DPO process

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:35.320
and to direct neuroplasticity and to learn

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.740
is actually much greater.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.220
And then you eventually pop out of that

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.100
at the end of the 90 minute cycle.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.160
So these cycles are occurring in sleep

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.330
and these cycles are
occurring in wakefulness.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:47.080
And all of those are governed

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.350
by this seesaw of alertness to calmness

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.660
that we call the autonomic nervous system.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.380
So if you want to master and
control your nervous system,

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.430
regardless of what tool you reach to,

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.070
whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.670
or whether or not it's a behavioral tool

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:04.010
or whether or not it's a
brain machine interface tool,

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.610
it's vitally important to understand

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:09.600
that your entire existence is occurring

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.180
in these 90 minute cycles,

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.040
whether or not you're asleep or awake.

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.010
And so you really need to
learn how to wedge into

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:17.660
those 90 minute cycles.

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.930
And for instance, it
would be completely crazy

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:21.850
and counterproductive

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.930
to try and just learn
information while in deep sleep

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:26.330
by listening to that information

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:28.470
because you're not able to access it.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.820
It would be perfectly good,

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.240
however, to engage in a focused
bout of learning each day.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.460
And now we know how long

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:37.160
that focused bout of learning should be,

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.400
it should be at least one 90 minute cycle.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.150
And the expectation should
be that the early phase

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:44.310
of that cycle is going to be challenging.

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:45.143
It's going to hurt.

00:57:45.143 --> 00:57:46.330
It's not going to feel natural.

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.220
It's not going to feel like flow.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.616
But that you can learn

00:57:49.616 --> 00:57:51.930
and the circuits of your
brain that are involved

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:53.190
in focus and motivation

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:56.810
can learn to drop into
a mode of more focus,

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:59.400
get more neuroplasticity in other words,

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.120
by engaging these ultradian cycles

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.350
at the appropriate times of day.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:06.530
For instance, some people
are very good learners

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:09.120
early in the day and not
so good in the afternoon.

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.880
So you can start to explore this process

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.670
even without any information

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:15.100
about the underlying neurochemicals

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.910
by simply paying attention,

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.340
not just to when you go to sleep

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.380
and when you wake up each morning,

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:24.060
how deep or how shallow your
sleep felt to you subjectively.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.340
But also, throughout the day,

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.480
when your brain tends to be most anxious.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.870
Because it turns out that has a correlate

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:34.850
related to perception
that we will talk about.

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:36.010
You can ask yourself

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:37.220
when are you most focused?

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.390
When are you least anxious?

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.040
When do you feel most motivated?

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.950
When do you feel least motivated?

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.690
By understanding how the different aspects

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.520
of your perception, sensation, feeling,

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.960
thought, and actions,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.490
tend to want to be engaged
or not want to be engaged.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.960
You develop a very good window

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.640
into what's going to be required

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.620
to shift your ability to focus

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.380
or shift your ability to engage
in creative type thinking

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.770
at different times of
day, should you choose.

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.900
And so that's where we're
heading, going forward.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.690
It all starts with mastering this seesaw

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.490
that is the autonomic nervous system,

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.820
that at a course level is a transition

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.300
between wakefulness and
sleep, but at a finer level,

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.550
and just as important,

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:22.250
are the various cycles, these
ultradian 90 minute cycles

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.250
that govern our life all the time,

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.450
24 hours a day every day of our life.

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:28.640
And so we're going to talk
about how you can take control

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.110
of the autonomic nervous system

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:33.130
so that you can better
access neuroplasticity,

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:34.810
better access sleep,

00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:36.710
even take advantage of the phase

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.920
that is the transition
between sleep and waking

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.570
to access things like
creativity and so forth.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.485
All based on studies
that have been published

00:59:44.485 --> 00:59:47.690
over the last 100 years,
mainly within the last 10 years

00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.330
and some that are very, very new.

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:50.510
And that point to the use

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.390
of specific tools that will allow you

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:55.160
to get the most out of
your nervous system.

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.690
So today we covered a lot of information.

00:59:57.690 --> 00:59:59.460
It was sort of a whirlwind tour

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.800
of everything from neurons and synapses

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.490
to neuroplasticity and the
autonomic nervous system.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:07.250
We will revisit a lot of
these themes going forward.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.590
So if all of that didn't
sink in in one pass,

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:11.480
please don't worry.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.480
We will come back to these
themes over and over again.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.000
I wanted to equip you with a language

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.520
so that we're all developing

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.240
a kind of common base set of
information going forward.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.230
And I hope the information
is valuable to you

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.350
in your thinking about what
is working well for you

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:29.410
and what's working less well

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:31.080
and what's been exceedingly challenging,

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.340
what's been easy for you

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.870
in terms of your pursuit
of particular behaviors

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.280
or emotional states where your challenges

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.720
or the challenges of people
that you know might reside.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.740
As promised in our welcome video,

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.770
the format of the "Huberman Lab" podcast

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:47.040
is to dive deep into individual topics

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.100
for an entire month at a time.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.040
So for the entire month of January

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.220
we're going to explore this
incredible state that is sleep

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.040
and a related state, which
is non-sleep deep rest

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.440
and what they do

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.100
for things like learning,
resetting our emotional capacity.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.510
Everyone's probably familiar with the fact

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:07.323
that when we're sleep deprived

01:01:07.323 --> 01:01:10.990
we're so much less good at
dealing with life circumstances.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.010
We're more emotionally labile.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.843
Why is that?

01:01:13.843 --> 01:01:14.800
How is that?

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.190
But most importantly,
we're going to talk about

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:17.710
how to get better at sleeping

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.330
and how to access better sleep

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:24.290
even when your sleep timing
or duration is compromised.

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:27.190
We're also going to talk
about the data that support

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:31.540
this very interesting state
called non-sleep deep rest

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.190
where one is neither asleep nor awake,

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.210
but it turns out one can recover

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.800
some of the neuromodulators

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.840
and more importantly the processes

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.640
involved in sensation, perception,

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.060
feeling, thought, and action.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.510
It's sure to be a very rich
discussion back and forth

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:49.470
where I'm answering your
questions and providing tools.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.380
And I'm certain you're also going to learn

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.320
a lot of information about neuroscience

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.220
and what makes up this
incredible phase of your life

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.690
where you think you're not conscious,

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:02.270
but you're actually resetting
and renewing yourself

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.140
in order to perform better,
feel better, et cetera,

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.600
in the waking state.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.100
