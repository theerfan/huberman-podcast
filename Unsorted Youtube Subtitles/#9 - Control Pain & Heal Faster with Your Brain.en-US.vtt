00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.880
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.670
where we discuss science

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm Andrew Huberman

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.710
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.840
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.670
This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.500
and research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.660
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.820
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.980
about science and science-related tools

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.400
to the general public.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.760
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.650
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.027
Our first sponsor is ExpressVPN.

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:36.640
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.410
that keeps your data
secure by routing your data

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.120
and online activities
through their servers

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.390
and keeping your data safe and secure

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.740
but also not selling your
data to third parties.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.040
I started using ExpressVPN

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.610
because unfortunately I had
my bank accounts hacked.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.920
I was traveling a lot

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.870
and I typically go on hotel or airline

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.550
or other public Wi-Fi from time to time

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.710
and I don't know how it happened,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.127
but somehow my information got out there,

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:09.520
and as I learned more from my friends

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.810
and people that work
in the tech community,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.660
it turns out that many
networks are not secure,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.320
so with ExpressVPN,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.550
it keeps all your information secure.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.140
It keeps information about
your passwords secure.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.660
It keeps information about

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.300
the websites that you visit secure,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.760
and as I mentioned earlier,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.370
they never give away or sell your data.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.730
The nice thing is you can use ExpressVPN,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.030
it runs in the background

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.100
and you don't even really
realize that it's on.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.800
It works on your phone,
it works on your laptop,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.770
it even works on your smart TV.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.690
If you'd like to try ExpressVPN,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.700
you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.900
to get three months free
on their one-year program.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.150
I love ExpressVPN.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.370
I use it even when I'm at home,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.410
and so if you want to try it,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.910
you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.760
and you'll get three months
free on their one-year program.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.090
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.410
Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.330
I started taking Athletic Greens in 2012

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.380
because I wanted to cover my
vitamin and mineral bases.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.970
I didn't know which things to take.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.200
I found it really dizzying to know

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.350
which vitamins and minerals to purchase

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.390
and Athletic Greens allowed
me to get all the things

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.720
I needed to cover my bases in
one easy to consume formula

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.500
that also happens to taste really good.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.790
I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.330
The probiotics in Athletic Greens

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.610
are also really important to me

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.370
because now there's an
abundance of data showing

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.810
that the gut microbiome, which
is supported by probiotics,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.660
is important for gut-brain axis, mood,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.040
metabolic function, hormone function,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.160
just a huge number of biological functions

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.910
and health parameters.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.430
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.880
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.713
and if you do that,

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:57.210
they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.720
Vitamin D3 also has lot of support

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.990
from the scientific literature

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.560
showing that it's important
for immune function,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.440
so if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.680
you'll get Athletic Greens

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.060
plus the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.230
and they'll give you
five free travel packets.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.070
Mixing up powders is a
little bit messy sometimes

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.570
when you're on the road,
if you're in the car,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.400
you're on the plane or you're on the move.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280
These travel packets make
everything really clean

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.430
and really easy.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.510
Once again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.450
for Athletic Greens, the
five free travel packets,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.260
and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.810
Many of you have graciously asked

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.920
how you can help support
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.770
There are several ways
that you can do that.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.860
One is to check out our sponsors,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.320
the other is we've set
up a Patreon account.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.680
You can go to patreon.com/andrewhuberman

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.770
and that allows you to
donate to the podcast

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.200
at a variety of different levels.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.033
In addition,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:56.120
if you could subscribe to
the podcast on YouTube,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.953
that's terrific.

00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:59.180
If you haven't done that
already, please do so,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.460
and please leave a comment.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.910
If you want to make suggestions
about future episodes,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.420
please also put that
in the comment section.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.810
If you subscribe on Apple or
Spotify or both, that helps us,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.220
and as well, Apple gives
you the opportunity

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.500
to leave a review and
give us a five star rating

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.080
if you feel we deserve a five star rating,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.050
and of course,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.370
please recommend the
podcast to your friends,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.670
to your family members,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.770
anyone that you think would
benefit from the information.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.070
Really, the answer to your question of

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.860
how you can support the podcast is

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.230
you don't have to buy products,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.910
although checking out
the sponsors does help.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.200
You don't have to donate to Patreon.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.480
We, of course, can't
require you to subscribe

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.690
and fill out reviews
and things of that sort,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.790
but we like to think that by providing

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.570
a number of different ways
to support the podcast,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.840
some of which are zero cost,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.650
some of which, if you like,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.710
gives you the opportunity
to contribute financially,

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.490
that's terrific as well.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.323
Thank you so much.

00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:55.590
We really appreciate your interest

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.780
in helping us keep this coming your way.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.613
Thank you.

00:04:58.613 --> 00:05:02.540
Let's continue our discussion
about neuroplasticity.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.440
This incredible feature
of our nervous system

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.680
that allows it to change itself
in response to experience,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.830
and even in ways that we consciously

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.190
and deliberately decide to change it.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.700
That's an incredible feature.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.750
No other organ in our
body has that capability.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.840
Our nervous system,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.750
which governs everything about who we are,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.460
how we feel and what we do,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.430
does have that capability.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.070
The issue is most people don't know

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.440
how to access neuroplasticity.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.780
Children readily access neuroplasticity

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.000
and they don't even realize
that they're doing it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.120
Adults want neuroplasticity

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.080
and so that's what this entire month

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.250
of the Huberman Lab
Podcast has been about.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.260
We've explored neuroplasticity

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.970
from a variety of different perspectives.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.960
We talked about
representational plasticity.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.670
We talked about the importance
of focus and reward.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.020
We talked about this amazing
and somewhat surprising aspect

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.650
of the vestibular system,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.420
how altering our relationship to gravity,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.240
and in addition to that,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.140
making errors as we try and learn,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.340
can open up windows to plasticity,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.640
but we have not really
talked so much about

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.530
directing the plasticity
toward particular outcomes,

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.530
and thus far,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.710
we really haven't talked yet

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.050
about how to undo things
that we don't want.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.550
I've talked about learning and I say

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.800
learn a language, learn free throws,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.350
learn a particular motor skill, et cetera,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.280
but what about what we
would call unlearning

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.270
or about removing some aspect

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.070
of our experience that we don't want?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.110
And so today,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.630
we are going to explore that
aspect of neuroplasticity

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.540
and we are going to do that in the context

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.000
of a very important and
somewhat sensitive topic

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.360
which is pain regeneration,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.700
and in some cases, injury
to the nervous system.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.800
For those of you that are fortunate enough

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.350
to not have or had a concussion

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.960
or not have or know someone

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.780
who is experiencing chronic or acute pain,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.390
I encourage you to stay in here with us

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.780
because a lot of the information
that we are going to cover

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.780
has direct relevance to
neuroplasticity for other purposes.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.170
We, as always here on this podcast,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.970
are going to discuss some of the science,

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.640
we get into mechanism,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.760
but we also really get at principles.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.540
Principles are far more
important than any one experiment

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.140
or one description of mechanism

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.220
and certainly far more
important than any one protocol

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.670
because principles allow you

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.460
to think about your nervous system

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.070
and work with it in ways
that best serve you.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.163
They are very flexible
batches of information.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.250
We are going to talk about the
principles of neuroplasticity

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.000
for removing pain and
wound healing and injury.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.410
We're going to talk about
acupuncture, of all things.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.700
We are going to talk about
modern medicine's attempt

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.880
to try and restore youth to the aging

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.470
or injured or demented brain,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.990
and we are going to
definitely talk about tools.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.000
Got a lot of tools.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.330
I consulted a number of
fantastic colleagues at Stanford,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.630
at Harvard Medical School,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.410
and in the greater community
of tissue rehabilitation,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.503
injury and pain management in
preparation for this podcast.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.510
I do want to be very
clear and just remind you

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.310
that I'm not a medical doctor.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.720
I'm a professor, so I
don't prescribe anything.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.010
I profess things.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.020
I have my beliefs,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.540
but the podcast is for
information purposes.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.620
I do hope that the tools that we discuss

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.890
will be of benefit to you, but as always,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.660
you should talk to your
doctor or healthcare provider

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.040
about any tools that you plan to add

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.690
or are looking to explore,

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.320
as well as anything that
you might look to remove

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.600
from your daily protocols.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.880
In other words, don't change anything

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.970
without consulting an expert first.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.220
You are responsible for
your health, not me,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.510
and I say this not just to protect me

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.110
but also to protect you.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.480
Please keep that in
mind as we move forward

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.740
and I'm very excited to share
with you this information

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.130
because I do feel that it
can be of great benefit

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.810
to a number of people.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.900
Let's start our discussion
about pain and sensation

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.490
and regeneration and wound
healing with a discussion about

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.910
a very important system
in the nervous system,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.330
which is the somatosensory system.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.890
The somatosensory system
is, as the name implies,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.140
involved in understanding touch,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.660
physical feeling on our body,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.450
and the simplest way to think
about the somatosensory system

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.990
is that we have little sensors

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.240
and those sensors come in the
form of neurons, nerve cells,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.700
that reside in our skin

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.730
and in the deeper layers below the skin,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.920
and indeed, we do.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.390
We have some that correspond to,

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.000
and we should say respond
to, mechanical touch,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.750
so pressure on the top
of my hand or a pinpoint,

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.020
or other sensors, for instance,
respond to heat, to cold.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.920
Some respond to vibration.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.640
We have a huge number of
different receptors in our skin

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.250
and they take that information

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.460
and send it down these
wires that we call axons

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.010
in the form of electrical
signals to our spinal cord

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.450
and then up to the brain,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.940
and within the spinal cord and brain,

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.810
we have centers that
interpret that information,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.970
that actually make sense of
those electrical signals,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.830
and this is amazing because
none of those sensors

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.130
has a different unique form
of information that it uses.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.010
It just sends electrical
potentials into the nervous system.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.370
The nervous system,

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.370
you somehow decode what a
given stimulus on your skin is.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.270
Maybe it's the wind blowing gently

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.140
and deflecting some of
the hairs on your arm

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.540
or maybe it's a sharp
pinprick or a hot stove

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.170
or the warmth of a glowing fire.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.490
That all arrives in your nervous system

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.730
in the form of these electrical things

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.860
we call action potentials,
which is just amazing,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.510
and then the brain computes
them and make sense of them.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.750
We have peripheral sensors

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.910
and we've got stations up in our brain

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.130
and within our spinal cord

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.100
that make sense of all
the stuff coming in.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.010
Pain and the sensation of
pain is, believe it or not,

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.010
a controversial word in
the neuroscience field.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.110
People prefer to use the word nociception.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.120
Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.660
that detect particular types of stimuli.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.610
It actually comes from
the Latin word nocere

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.940
which means to harm,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.490
and why would neuroscientists
not want to talk about pain?

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.270
Well, it's very subjective.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.820
It has a mental component
and a physical component.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.920
We cannot say that pain
is simply an attempt

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.690
to avoid physical harm to the body,

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.140
and here's why.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.630
They actually can be
dissociated from one another.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.510
A good example would be if, God forbid,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.963
you were exposed to high
levels of radiation,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.480
such as working with some sort of material

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.830
that was radioactive

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.080
or you were near a
former radioactive plant

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.870
or some some radiation,

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.620
excessive X-rays, et cetera,

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.020
you wouldn't feel any
pain during the X-rays.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:10.853
In fact, you don't.

00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:12.950
If you've ever had X-rays, as I have,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.410
you don't feel anything.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.940
They put you under that lead blanket,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.810
they run behind a wall
and then they, in my case,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.300
then they take these
pictures of your teeth

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.517
and it's really scary because you go,

00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:23.270
"Something really terrible
must be happening here,"

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.070
but you don't feel anything,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.780
but there can be a lot of tissue damage.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.070
There can be mutations
introduced to cells, et cetera.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:31.903
I've had X-rays,

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:33.250
I'm not saying people
shouldn't have X-rays,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.070
but excessive X-rays
certainly are not good

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:36.560
for human beings,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.480
likewise with excessive
exposure to any radiation.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.750
There can be tissue damage
without the physical perception

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.870
or mental perception of pain at all.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.010
As well, there can be the belief of pain

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.830
or the feeling of pain without
there being tissue damage,

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.500
and there's a famous
case that was published

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.580
in the "British Journal of Medicine"

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.363
where a construction worker,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.460
I think he fell is how the story went,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.500
and a 14-inch nail

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.000
went through his boot
and up through the boot

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.030
and he was in excruciating pain

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.010
just beyond anything he'd experienced.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.610
He reported that he couldn't
even move in any dimension,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.530
even a tiny bit, without
feeling excruciating pain.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.580
They brought him into the
clinic, into the hospital,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.280
they were able to cut away the boot

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.990
and they realized that the
nail had gone between two toes

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.220
and it had actually not
impaled the skin at all.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.360
His visual image of the
nail going through his boot

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.320
gave him the feeling,
the legitimate feeling,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.420
that he was experiencing the pain

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.770
of a nail going through his foot,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.010
which is incredible

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.570
because it speaks to the power of the mind

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.480
in this pain scenario

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.040
and it also speaks to the
power of the specificity.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.060
It's not like he thought
that his foot was on fire.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.240
He thought, because he saw a
nail going through his foot,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.100
well, it was going through his boot,

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.950
but he thought it was
going through his foot,

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.800
that it was sharp pain of the sort

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.500
that a nail would produce,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.240
and there are thousands

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.800
of these kinds of case reports out there.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.270
That is not to say that
all pain that we experience

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.770
is in our head,

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.470
but it really speaks to
the incredible capacity

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.990
that these top-down,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.920
these higher-level
cognitive functions have

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.090
in interpreting what we're experiencing

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.090
out in the periphery,

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.620
even just on the basis of what we see,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.770
and the example of
radiation speaks to the fact

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.610
that pain and tissue damage

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.513
are dissociable from one another.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.380
Why are we talking about pain

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.500
during a month on neuroplasticity?

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.280
Well, it turns out that
the pain system offers us

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.010
a number of different principles
that we can leverage to,

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.080
A, ensure that if we are ever injured,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.690
we are able to understand the difference

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.920
between injury and pain
because there is a difference,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.150
that if we're ever in pain,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.370
that we can understand
the difference between

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.790
injury and pain,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.950
that we will be able
to interpret our pain,

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.930
and during the course of today's podcast,

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.910
I'm going to cover protocols
that help eliminate pain

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.040
from both ends of the spectrum,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.340
from the periphery, at
the level of the injury,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.890
and through these top-down
mental mechanisms.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.050
A lot of times on this
podcast, in fact mostly,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.500
I tend to center on the physiology,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.190
on the really objective things

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.760
that you can describe and talk about,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.740
diaphragmatic movement

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.300
or sunlight of a particular
number of photons, et cetera,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.200
but today's a really exciting opportunity

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.380
for us to discuss some of
the more subjective things.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.810
Believe it or not, we're
going to talk about love.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.940
A colleague of mine at Stanford,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.113
who runs a major pain clinic,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.860
is working on and has published
quality peer-reviewed data

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.410
on the role of love in
modulating the pain response,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.310
only there's a twist to it

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.670
and I'm not going to reveal it just yet,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.810
but it turns out that the
specific type of connection

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.970
one has to a romantic partner

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.670
actually dictates whether
or not their love for them

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.480
will alleviate physical pain

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.370
and the effects are really robust.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.860
It's an amazing literature,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.240
and so what we're talking about today

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.660
is plasticity of perception,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.930
which has direct bearing on emotional pain

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.900
and has direct bearing on trauma

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.180
and other things that we discussed

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.590
in previous episodes a little bit

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.850
but that we're going to explore even more

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.253
in an entire month about those topics.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.070
Let's get started in thinking
about what happens with pain,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.970
and I will describe some examples

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.130
of some kind of extreme cases.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.470
For instance, I will tell you just now

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.670
that there is a mutation,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.160
a genetic mutation in a
particular sodium channel.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.410
A sodium channel is one of
these little holes in neurons

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.350
that allows them to
fire action potentials.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.730
It's important to the
function of the neuron.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.540
It's also important for the
development of certain neurons,

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.330
and there's a particular mutation,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.530
there are kids that are born

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.130
without this sodium channel 1.7,

00:16:59.968 --> 00:17:01.250
if you want to look it up.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.780
Those kids experience no
pain, no pain whatsoever,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.160
and it is a terrible situation.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.030
They burn themselves.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.550
They tend to rest on their limbs too long.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.610
They don't make the microadjustments.

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:14.930
You might see me swiveling
around in my chair,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:15.770
moving around a lot.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.700
Those microadjustments are actually

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.830
normal, healthy microadjustments

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.300
that prevent us from going into pain.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.420
They don't make those adjustments.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.960
They don't get the feedback

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.390
that they're in a particular position

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.900
and so they never make those adjustments

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.970
and their joints get
destroyed, essentially.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.210
They don't tend to live
very long due to accidents.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.890
It's a really terrible and
unfortunate circumstance.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.090
Some people have a mutation
in the same channel

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.630
where they make too much of this channel

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.760
so they feel too much pain.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.260
In fact, it's reasonable to speculate

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.670
that one of the reasons, not all,

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.880
but one of the reasons
why people might differ

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.400
in their sensitivity to pain

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.590
is by way of genetic variation

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.810
in how many of these sorts of
receptors that they express.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.480
People who make too much of this receptor

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.250
experience extreme pain
from even subtle stimuli.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.250
The good news is there
are good drug treatments

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.780
that can block specifically
this sodium channel 1.7

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.860
and so those people get a lot of relief

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.030
from taking such drugs.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.780
Pain and how much pain we are sensitive to

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.900
or insensitive to probably
has some genetic basis,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.380
and then of course, there
are things that we can do

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.980
to make sure that we experience less pain,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.590
although pain has this adaptive role.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.520
Let's talk about some of the features of

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.780
how we're built physically
and how that relates to pain

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.360
and how we can recover from injury.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.193
First of all,

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.140
we have maps of our body
surface in our brain.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.950
It's called a homunculus.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.970
In a rat, believe it or
not, I'm not making this up,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.460
it's called a ratunculus.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.010
In Costello, my dog, who
is snoring behind me,

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.633
it's a dogunculus.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.970
I could get into the nomenclature
and why it's called this,

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.770
but it's basically a
representation of the body surface.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.890
That representation is scaled

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.740
in a way that matches sensitivity,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.740
so the areas of your body
that are most sensitive

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.720
have a lot more brain real
estate devoted to them.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.260
Your back is an enormous piece of tissue

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.930
compared to your fingertip,

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.670
but your back has fewer
receptors devoted to it

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.680
and the representation of
your back in your brain

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.600
is actually pretty small,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.763
whereas the representation
of your finger is enormous.

00:19:28.274 --> 00:19:32.840
How big a brain area is
devoted to a given body part

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.580
is directly related

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.800
to the density of receptors
in that body part,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.160
not the size of the body part,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.700
and that's why if we were
to draw your homunculus

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.870
or Costello's dogunculus,

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.630
what we would find is that certain areas,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.050
like the lips, like the fingertips,

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.370
like the genitalia,

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.120
like the eyes and the
area around the face,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.300
would have a huge representation,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.000
whereas the back, the torso,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.610
and areas of the body
that are less sensitive

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.040
are going to have smaller representations.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.980
It'd be a very distorted map.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.600
You can actually know

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.550
how sensitive a given body part is

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.620
and how much brain area is devoted to it

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.740
through what's called
two-point discrimination.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.970
You can do this experiment if you want.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.670
I think I've described
this once or twice before,

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.980
but basically if you have someone put,

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.610
maybe take two pens

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.078
and put them maybe six
inches apart on your back

00:20:24.078 --> 00:20:26.600
and touch while you're facing away

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.870
and they'll ask you how many
points they're touching you

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.900
and you say two,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.340
but if they move those closer
together, say three inches,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.730
you're likely to experience
it as one point of contact,

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.080
whereas on your finger,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.340
you could play that game all day

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.510
and as long as there's a
millimeter or so spacing,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.800
you will know that it's two
points as opposed to one

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.220
and that's because there's more pixels,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.600
more density of receptors.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.410
This has direct bearing to pain

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.330
because it says that areas of the body

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.340
that have denser receptors
are going to be more sensitive

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.690
to pain than to others,

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.530
and where we have more receptors,

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.520
we tend to have more
blood vessels and glia,

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.040
which are the support cells,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.400
and other cells that lend
to the inflammation response

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.803
and that's really important.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.320
Just as a rule of thumb,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.260
areas of your body that are injured

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.870
that are large areas that have
low sensitivity before injury

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.180
likely are going to experience less pain

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.180
and the literature shows
will heal more slowly

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.080
because they don't have
as many cells around

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.570
to produce inflammation,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.200
and you might say, "Wait, I
thought inflammation is bad."

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.260
Well, one of the things I
really want to get across today

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.150
is that inflammation is not bad.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.010
Inflammation out of control is bad,

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.910
but inflammation is wonderful.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.720
Inflammation is the tissue repair response

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.940
and we are going to talk about
subjective and objective ways

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.300
to modulate inflammation
after tissue injury,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.203
even after just exercise
that's been too intense.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.550
You have this map of your body surface.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.060
It's sensitive in different
ways. Now you know why.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.850
You've got your neurobiology
of somatosensation 101

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.360
under your belt now.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.470
We didn't cover everything,

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.660
but we'll touch on some
of the other details

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.110
as we go forward.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.850
I thought it might be a nice
time to just think about

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.200
the relationship between the
periphery and the central maps

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.260
in a way that many of you have
probably heard about before,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.550
which will frame the
discussion a little bit better,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.850
which is phantom limb pain.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.340
Some of you are probably
familiar with this,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.280
but for people that have an arm or a leg

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.120
or a finger or some other
portion of their body amputated,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.440
it's not uncommon for those people

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.560
to feel as if they still
have that limb or appendage

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.460
or piece of their body intact,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.540
and typically, unfortunately,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.470
the sensation of that limb
is not one of the limb

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.410
being nice and relaxed and just there.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.620
The sensation is that the
limb is experiencing pain

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.510
or is contorted in the
specific orientation

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.680
that it was around the time of the injury.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.530
If someone has a blunt force to the hand

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.370
and they end up having
their hand amputated,

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.780
typically they will continue to feel pain

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.830
in their phantom hand,
which is pretty wild,

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.870
and that's because the
representation of that hand

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.240
is still intact in the
cortex, in the brain,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.270
and it's trying to balance
its levels of activity.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.240
Normally it's getting what's
called proprioceptive feedback.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.140
Proprioception is just our knowledge

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.630
of where our limbs are in space.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.490
It's an extremely important aspect

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.680
of our somatosensory system,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.640
and there's no proprioceptive feedback

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.650
and so a lot of the
circuits start to ramp up

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.940
their levels of activity

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.933
and they become very
conscious of the phantom limb.

00:23:42.274 --> 00:23:43.470
Before my lab was at Stanford,

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.670
I was at UC San Diego and one
of my colleagues was a guy,

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.580
everyone just calls him by
his last name, Ramachandran,

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.910
who is famous for understanding
this phantom limb phenomenon

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.270
and developing a very simple

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.560
but very powerful solution to it

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.980
that speaks to the incredible capacity

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.650
of top-down modulation,

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.870
and top-down modulation,

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.590
the ability to use one's
brain cognition and senses

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.010
to control pain in the body,

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.560
is something that everyone,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.200
not just people missing
limbs or in chronic pain,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.830
can learn to benefit from
because it is a way to tap into

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.140
our ability to use our mind

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.330
to control perceptions of
what's happening in our body,

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.790
and this is not a mystical statement.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:27.490
This is not about mind, I
guess, as much as it is brain

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.930
to control our perceptions of our body.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.100
What did Ramachandran do?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.100
Ramachandran had people
who were missing a limb

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.130
put their intact limb into a box

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.570
that had mirrors in it

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.470
such that when they looked in the box

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.200
and they moved their intact limb,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.170
the opposite limb,

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.300
which was a reflection of the intact limb

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.000
'cause they're missing the opposite limb,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.970
they would see it as if it was intact,

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.060
and as they would move their intact limb,

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.540
they would visualize with their eyes

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.390
the limb that's in the
place of the absent limb,

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.870
so this is all by mirrors,

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.520
moving around and they
would feel immediate relief

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.080
from the phantom pain,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.100
and he would tell them and
they would direct their hand

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.400
toward a orientation that
felt comfortable to them.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.150
Then they would exit the mirror box,

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.770
they would take their hand out,

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.677
and they would feel as if

00:25:26.677 --> 00:25:29.610
the hand was now in its
relaxed normal position.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.190
You could get real time, in moments,

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.070
remapping of the
representation of the hand.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.180
Now, that's amazing.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.480
This is the kind of thing that all of us

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.890
would like to be able
to do if we are in pain.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.810
If you stub your toe,
if you break your ankle,

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.660
if you take a hard fall on your bike

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.536
or if you're in chronic pain.

00:25:45.536 --> 00:25:47.920
Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to use

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.530
a mind trick,

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.140
but it's not a trick because
it's real, visual imagery,

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.850
to remap your representation
of your body surface

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.260
and where your body is.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.540
That is something that
we could all benefit from

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.000
because if you do anything for
long enough, including live,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.170
you're going to experience
pain of some sort,

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.080
and this, again I just want to remind you,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.600
isn't just about physical
injuries and pain,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.160
this has direct relevance
to emotional pain as well,

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.243
which, of course, we'll talk about.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.330
The Ramachandran studies
were really profound

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.560
because they said a couple things.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.250
One, plasticity can be very fast,

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.930
that it can be driven by
the experience of something,

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:29.970
just the visual experience.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.490
He had people do this mirror box thing

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.150
but not look into the mirror box

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.450
and they didn't get the remapping,

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.943
so it required visual imagery coming in.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.150
We also know, for instance,

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.713
that in cases like where
people are congenitally deaf,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.050
the cochlear implant,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.230
which is simply a way of
putting, it's not simple,

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.270
but it's a way of putting in a device

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.350
that replaces the cochlea,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.420
the device that we're
normally born with in the ear

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.410
that has these little
what are called hair cells

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.320
that deflect according to sound
waves and allow us to hear.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.470
By replacing the normal hearing apparatus

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.090
that's deficient in deaf people
with this cochlear implant,

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.810
the brain can make sense of
this artificial ear, basically,

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.830
it's not the outside ear, not
the pinna, but the inner ear,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.870
and they can start to hear sounds.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.860
Some people really like
the artificial cochlea.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.640
They really benefit from it.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.960
It restores their ability
to hear and they like it.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.990
Other people don't.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.460
Some deaf people would
prefer not to hear anything,

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.190
can be very disruptive to them,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.140
and some of that might
have to do with the need

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.470
for further better engineering
of these artificial cochleas,

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.730
but all this really speaks to the fact

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.870
that the brain is an adaptive device.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.190
It will respond to what you give it.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.060
It is not a device that is fixed.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.670
In fact, the essence of the brain,

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.970
especially the human brain,

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.960
is to take sensory inputs

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.040
and to make sense of those,
meaning cognitive sense,

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.750
and then to interpret those signals,

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.230
and so this may come as
a shock to some of you

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.140
and by no means am I
trying to be insensitive,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.040
but pain is a perceptual thing

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.960
as much as it's a physical thing.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.920
It's a belief system about

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.520
what you're experiencing in your body

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.250
and that has important relevance

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.130
for healing different types of injury

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.660
and the pain associated with that injury.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.300
In people's pursuit for neuroplasticity,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.860
a question that comes
up every once in a while

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.247
is people will say,

00:28:28.247 --> 00:28:30.840
"If I just brush my teeth
with the opposite hand

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.090
for a couple nights in a row,

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.180
will I get neuroplasticity?"

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.630
And the answer is probably
yes. It's a deliberate action.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.270
You're focusing on it.
There's an end goal.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.810
You're very likely to make errors,

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.530
like jamming up into your
lips and gums at first

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.363
and then getting better at it,

00:28:44.363 --> 00:28:46.240
and as you heard in last episode,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.150
making errors is really important

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.770
'cause those errors are the signal

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.390
that plasticity needs to happen,

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.230
and then when you get the actions correct,

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.480
then those correct
actions are programmed in.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.260
I'm not sure that brushing one's teeth

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.970
with the opposite hand is the most

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.820
effective use of this
incredible thing that we have,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.670
which is plasticity.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.740
It's not going to open up
plasticity for many other things.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.380
If that were really important
to you, for whatever reason,

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.930
maybe you have a crowded bathroom

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.180
and it's easier to do on one
side or the other, then fine,

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.790
but it's kind of hard to
imagine why this would be

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.710
a highly adaptive behavior,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.210
unless, of course, you
have an injured limb

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.320
or you're missing a limb,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.500
and that gets me to some really exciting

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.040
and important studies that were performed

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.250
mostly in the '90s as
well as in the 2000s,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.370
and that, for now, there is
really a solid base of data.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.570
There's really a center of mass around

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.330
a particular set of experiments

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.680
that point to particular protocols

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.940
for how to overcome motor injury,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.730
and this may resonate with some of you

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.370
who've ever been injured to the point

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.840
where you couldn't walk well,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.730
temporarily, I hope, or even longer.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.260
Think about a sprained ankle scenario

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.063
or a broken arm scenario.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.970
We're all familiar with
the stories of people

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.220
having a cast on and
then getting the cast off

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.890
and the particular limb
that wasn't being used

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.170
that was casted is much
smaller and atrophied.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.430
Most of that atrophy, you
might be surprised to learn,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.030
is not because the
muscles aren't being used.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.060
It's because the nerves sending
signals to those muscles

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.513
are not active and therefore
the muscles aren't contracting.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.880
Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.200
and his graduate students and postdocs,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.020
Theresa Jones and others,

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.220
in the '90s and 2000s showed
something really wonderful

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.150
that I think we can all benefit from

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.460
should we have an injury

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.460
and even if we simply want
to balance out imbalances

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.930
in our motor activity,

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.520
and I think all of us tend to be stronger

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.020
on one side or the other side.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.460
Usually a right-handed person

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.480
will be stronger in their
left arm, not always,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.720
for compensatory reasons.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.290
Some other time we can
talk about handwriting.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.440
The lefties likely will be
stronger in their right arm,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.890
although it depends on whether or not

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.330
people are hook righties,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.280
that's when you hook around
and write from the top,

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.570
or hook lefties.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.870
There are all sorts of theories about this

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.040
that we can talk about,

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.250
right brain, left brain,
math proficiency, et cetera.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.830
In any event,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.460
what Schallert and colleagues showed

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.970
was that if we have damage to our brain

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.580
in the sensory motor pathways,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.410
any number of different
sensory motor pathways,

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:29.010
or we have damage to a limb,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.460
could be a leg, could be
an arm, could be a hand,

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:36.880
there's great benefit
to restricting the use

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.880
of the opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.920
or hand or other part of the body.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.470
They had about a dozen papers showing

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.450
that if there was damage
centrally in the brain

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.150
or there was damage to a limb,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.270
so unilateral damage, as we say, one side,

00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:00.270
the thing to do is not to
cast up the damaged side,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.870
although you need to do
that to protect the limb,

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.260
of course, from further damage.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.990
If it's a broken arm,
you need to cast the arm

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.610
or you need to brace the arm,

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:11.620
but that the key thing
was to restrict movement

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.960
of the intact, uninjured, opposite limb,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.980
and when they did that,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.440
it forced some movement
in the injured limb

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.400
and remarkably,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.450
through connections from
the two sides of the brain,

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.530
through the corpus callosum,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.820
this huge fiber pathway

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.750
that links the two sides of the brain,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.380
they saw plasticity on
both sides of the brain.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.500
This makes sense when you hear it.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.660
Let's say I injure my left ankle

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.970
and I'm limping along
or I'm using crutches.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.110
You would think, well, the
last thing you want to do

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.190
is injure your opposite limb
or not use your opposite limb.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.030
My right ankle is perfectly fine,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.130
but if I lean too hard on my right limb

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.677
and I take all the work
out of the left limb,

00:32:55.677 --> 00:32:57.460
the left ankle,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.220
that's actually setting up a situation

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.270
where there's going to
be runaway asymmetry

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.780
in the central pathways

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.400
and the nerve-to-muscle
pathways on my left side,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.830
and so what they suggested

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.760
and what they showed in
a variety of experiments

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.470
was that by encouraging
activity of the injured limb,

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.560
provided it could be done without pain,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.870
and importantly,

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.180
not just exercising that
limb or part of the body

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.103
but restricting the opposite
healthy part of the body,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.150
that the speed of recovery
was significantly faster.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.160
Now, I want to repeat,

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.050
you don't want to go
injuring something further.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.180
That's probably the
worst thing you could do,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.300
but in some cases where people
have damage in their brain,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.700
the limbs are perfectly fine,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.920
but the motor signals aren't
getting down to the limbs,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.430
and in that case, the limb is fine,

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:48.650
so you actually are free to use

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.430
either limb as much as you
want, and in that case,

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.430
you don't want to rely on the
uninjured pathway too much.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.430
In fact, you want to restrict
the uninjured pathway.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.460
I find these studies remarkable

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.500
and they've been followed up
on at the molecular level,

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.570
at the cellar level many times,

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.490
and I think the physiotherapists out there

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.937
and the rest of you who are
involved in sports medicine

00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:08.457
and some of the physicians will say,

00:34:08.457 --> 00:34:10.140
"Well, of course that
makes perfect sense,"

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.970
but oftentimes this is not what happens.

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.490
Oftentimes what happens
is it's all about resting

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:17.610
and limiting inflammation, et cetera,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.490
of the injured limb

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:23.860
or the limbs corresponding to
the injured part of the brain,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.610
and these experiments and
the collection of them

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.380
point to the fact that the balance between

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.380
the right and left side of
our body is always dynamic.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.140
It's always being updated at
the level of neural circuitry,

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.970
the Ramachandran studies
with the mirror box

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:39.000
support that too,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.540
and that even slight imbalances
in the two sides of the body

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.040
can get amplified,

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.730
and so when you're in a situation
where one side is injured

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.280
or the brain is injured
representing one side of the body,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.650
the key thing to do is to really overwork

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.610
the side that needs the work

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.550
and to restrict the activity of the side

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.930
that doesn't need the
work because it's healthy,

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.450
and this has great semblance
to ocular dominance plasticity,

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.390
which I talked about
a couple episodes ago.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.800
I won't go into it in detail,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.810
but where the Nobel Prize
winning neurobiologists

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.280
Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel showed

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.470
that if one eye is closed
early in development,

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.080
that the representation of
the opposite eye in the brain

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.313
is completely overtaken by the intact eye.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:24.783
This is important.

00:35:24.783 --> 00:35:27.520
It means that all of our
senses and our movements

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.380
are competing for space in our brain

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.550
and so the way to think
about the principle is

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.750
anytime you're injured
and you're hobbling along,

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.740
you don't want to injure yourself further,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.500
but you want to try and compensate

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.840
in the ways that respect this competition

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.250
for neural real estate,

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.920
and what that usually
means is not relying on

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.810
where you're still strong

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.290
because that's just going
to create runaway plasticity

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:54.700
that's going to make it very hard

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.140
for you to recover the motor function,

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.880
and in some cases, the sensory function,

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.660
of the damaged limb.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.530
Some of you may be wondering

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.870
how long and how often one
should restrict the activity

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.550
of the intact or healthy limb,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.320
or limbs in some cases,

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.430
and the answer is

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.260
you don't have to do
that all day, every day.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.290
These experiments centered on

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.000
doing one or two hours of dedicated work,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.140
sensory motor work or,

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.150
so for instance, if you had
a sprained ankle on the left,

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.270
you might spend part of the
day where your left leg,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.083
provided it's not too
painful, can be exercised,

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.840
again, in a way that's not
damaging to the injury,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.830
and the right limb can't
contribute to that exercise.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.380
This might be peddling unilaterally

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.150
on a stationary bike if you can do that.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.440
For a different type of limb
injury, like an arm injury,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.590
this might be reaching,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.010
provided the shoulder is
mobile, doing reaching.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.910
It might be even writing
with the damaged side

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.950
and then intentionally not writing

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.523
with the preferred or undamaged side.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:03.610
This has been shown to
accelerate the central plasticity

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.350
and the recovery of function,

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.430
which I think is what most people want

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.390
when people are injured.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:09.560
They want to get back to doing

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.010
what they were doing previously

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.113
and they want to be able
to do that without pain.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.760
This brings up another topic,

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.440
which is definitely related
to neuroplasticity and injury

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.870
but is a more general one
that I hear about a lot,

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.320
which is traumatic brain injury.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.830
Many injuries are not just about the limb

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.880
and the lack of use of the limb

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.940
but concussion and head injury,

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.330
and I want to emphasize
I'm not a neurologist.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.420
I have many colleagues that are.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.800
At some point, we will
do a whole month on TBI

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.550
because it's such a serious issue

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.363
and it's such a huge discussion,

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.930
but I want to talk a little bit about

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:48.130
what is known about
recovery from concussion,

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.850
and this is very important
because it has implications

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.540
for just normal aging as well

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.210
and offsetting some of
the cognitive decline

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.983
and physical decline that
occurs with normal aging.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.470
We shouldn't think of TBI as
just for the football players

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.080
or just for the kids that had an injury

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.770
or just for the person that
was in the car accident.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.040
We want to learn about TBI

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.100
and understand TBI for those folks,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.230
but we're also going to talk about TBI

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:18.510
as it relates to general
degradation of brain function

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.030
because there's a
certain resemblance there

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.910
of TBI to general brain aging.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.120
Typically after TBI,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.600
there are a number of
different things that happen

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.053
and there are a huge range of
things that can create TBI.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.030
Neurologists and the
emergency room physicians

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.130
are going to want to know

00:38:37.302 --> 00:38:38.930
was the skull itself injured

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.203
or did the brain rattle
around in the skull?

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.310
Was there actually a
breach through the skull?

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.600
Is there a physical object in there?

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.510
How many concussions has the person had?

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.750
Everyone's situation with
TBI is incredibly different,

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.540
but there's a constellation of symptoms

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.670
that many people, if
not all people with TBI,

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.880
report which is headache,

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.920
photophobia, that lights become aversive,

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.330
sleep disruption, trouble concentrating,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.720
sometimes mood issues.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.970
There's a huge range

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.623
and of course the severity
will vary, et cetera.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.130
In a previous episode, I
mentioned the Kennard Principle.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.480
The Kennard Principle,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.930
named after the famous neurologist,

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.640
named by and after the famous
neurologist Margaret Kennard,

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.120
said that if you're going
to get a brain injury,

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.220
better to get it early in
life than later in life

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.080
and that's because the
brain has a much greater

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.620
or heightened capacity
for repairing itself

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.340
early in life than later,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.320
but of course, none of us want TBI

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.260
and you can't pick when you get your TBI.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.050
You can avoid certain activities
that would give you TBI,

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:42.230
but really, when it comes to TBI,

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.350
there are a couple of things that are

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.040
agreed upon across the board.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.120
The first one is,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.990
as much as possible you want to avoid

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:52.180
a second traumatic brain
injury or concussion.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.720
That's going to be a tough
one for some of the athletes

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.480
and even recreational athletes to swallow

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.300
because they want to
continue in their sport,

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.690
and I'm not here to tell you

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:02.770
that you should or you shouldn't,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.310
but that's simply the way that it is.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.940
For folks that are in military

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.440
or that are in certain professions,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.350
construction is a place
where we see a lot of TBI.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.710
It's not always just football.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:18.010
A lot of construction workers
are dealing with heavy objects

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.890
swinging around in space.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:21.520
They wear those hardhat helmets,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.380
which unfortunately don't protect much

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.000
against a lot of those blunt forces

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.880
and certainly not against
falls and things of that sort.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.390
Many people, in order to
survive and feed their families,

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.603
have to go back to work.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.180
It's very clear that
regardless of whether or not

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.310
there was a skull break

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:39.440
and regardless of when the TBI happened

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.770
and how many times it's happened,

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.543
that the system that repairs
the brain, the adult brain,

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.540
is mainly centered around
this lymphatic system

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.833
that we call, for the brain,
the glymphatic system.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.940
The brain wasn't thought
to have a lymphatic system.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.300
It wasn't thought to have
circulating immune cells,

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.860
but about 10 years ago it
was sort of rediscovered

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.930
because if you look in the literature

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.750
you realize this stuff was around longer,

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.040
that there's a glymphatic system.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.630
It's sort of like a sewer
system that clears out

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.820
the debris that surrounds neurons,

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.390
especially injured neurons,

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.520
and the glymphatic system
is very active during sleep.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.950
It's been imaged in functional
magnetic resonance imaging

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.620
and the glymphatic system is something

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.000
that you want very active

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.790
because it's going to
clear away the debris

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.940
that sits between the neurons,

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.480
and the cells that surround

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.470
the connections between the
neurons, called the glia,

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.290
those cells are actively involved

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.923
in repairing the connections
between neurons when damaged.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.930
The glymphatic system is so important

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.820
that many people, if not
all people who get TBI,

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.790
are told, "Get adequate
rest, you need to sleep,"

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.140
and that's kind of twofold advice.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.230
On the one hand, it's
telling you to get sleep

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.300
because all these good
things happen in sleep.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.180
It's also about getting those people

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.910
to not continue to engage
in their activity full time

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.710
or really try and hammer through it.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.040
You might say, "Well, if
you have trouble sleeping,

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.120
how are you supposed to get deep sleep?"

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.140
Most of the activity of
the glymphatic system,

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.630
this wash out of the debris,

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.130
is occurring during slow-wave sleep.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.130
Slow-wave sleep, as I mentioned
in a previous episode,

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.260
is something that happens typically

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.550
in the early part of the evening.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.120
Even for those of you that are falling,

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.520
or early part of the night, rather,

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.910
if you're falling asleep
and then waking up

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.930
three, four hours later,

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.750
it's important that you
continue to get sleep

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.640
but know that the slow-wave sleep

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.640
is mainly packed toward the
early part of the night,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.540
so that hopefully will
alleviate some of the anxiety

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.100
of the 3:00 and 4:00 am wake up,

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.810
although you really should follow

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.410
some of the protocols that I've suggested

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.660
and your physician's protocols

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.090
in order to try and get
regular, longer sleep

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.360
of seven, eight hours.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.050
Later, we're going to talk
about the eight-hour mark

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.943
as a prerequisite for repair.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.920
The glymphatic system has been shown

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.490
to be activated further in two ways.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.960
One is that sleeping on one side,

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.590
not on back or stomach,

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:09.540
seems to increase the amount of wash out,

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.520
or wash through, I should say,

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.900
of the glymphatic system.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.240
There aren't a ton of data on this,

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.110
but the data that exist are pretty solid.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.210
Again, sleeping on one side

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.420
or with feet slightly elevated, as well,

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.550
has been shown to increase
the rate of clearance

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:27.830
of some of the debris

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.310
and that's because the way that
the glymphatic system works

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.610
is it has a physical
pressure fluid dynamic to it

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.950
that allow it to work more efficiently

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:40.490
when one is sleeping on their side

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.290
or with feet slightly elevated.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:46.130
This means not falling asleep
in a chair while watching TV.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.080
This means, if possible,

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.720
not falling asleep on one's
back or on one's stomach,

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.220
sleeping on one's side,

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.590
and if you can't do that,

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.040
I don't really like to sleep on my side.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.530
I sleep with my feet slightly elevated.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.590
I put a thin pillow under my ankles.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:03.590
I don't have TBI, but I have
had a few concussions before,

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.520
but right now I feel fine,

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.230
but I find that putting
the pillow under my ankles

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.060
helps me sleep much more deeply

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.810
and I wake up feeling much more refreshed.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.490
The other thing that has been shown

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.900
to improve the function
of the glymphatic system,

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.860
and this is, again, is for sake of TBI

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.500
as well as for everyone,
even without brain injury,

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.910
is a certain form of exercise,

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.790
and I want to be very, very clear here.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.490
I will never and I am not suggesting

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.360
that people exercise in any way

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.150
that aggravates their injury

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.440
or that goes against
their physician's advice.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.040
Take your physician's advice

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.960
as to whether or not you
should be exercising at all

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.270
and how much and then to what intensity.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.320
However, there's some interesting data,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.550
and we can provide a link
to the review on this.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.770
It shows that exercise of

00:44:56.770 --> 00:45:00.110
what I guess people would
nowadays call it Zone 2 cardio,

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.530
which is low-level
cardio that one could do

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:04.930
while talking to somebody else.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.440
You could maintain a conversation,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.320
although you don't have
to talk to somebody else.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.020
It just gives you a sense of
the intensity of the exercise.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.700
That Zone 2 cardio

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.970
for 30 to 45 minutes 3 times a week

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:19.530
seems to improve the rates of clearance

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.400
of some of the debris after injury,

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.680
and in general, injury or no,

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.810
to accelerate and
improve the rates of flow

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.150
for the glymphatic system.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:32.600
I find this really interesting

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.590
because I think nowadays
there's such an obsession

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.770
with high-intensity interval training

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.180
and people trying to pack
in as much as they can

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.410
into a short workout,

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.550
which is great if it
brings people to the table

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.460
who haven't been exercising before,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.560
but I think it's really
important that we know

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.987
that the data on exercise

00:45:48.987 --> 00:45:51.230
and its relationship to brain health

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.560
speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.960
of this what we call low-level cardio.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.640
It could be fast walking.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.950
It could be jogging

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.100
if you can do that with
your injury safely.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.690
It could be cycling.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.490
This is not the kind of workout

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.110
that's designed to get your
heart rate up to the point

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:10.920
where you're improving your fitness levels

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.330
at some sort of massive rate

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:18.090
or taking huge jumps in your
VO2 max or anything like that.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.150
This is exercise,

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.060
I do this and I know a
number of other people,

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.210
especially people in communities

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.730
where there is a lot of TBI,

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.040
are now starting to adopt this,

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.450
that the 30 to 45 minutes
3 times a week or so,

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.283
could be more,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.720
of this Zone 2 type cardio
can be very beneficial

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.870
for washout of debris from the brain,

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.380
and this is really
interesting outside of TBI

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.810
because what we know from aging

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.450
is that aging is a nonlinear process.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.270
It's not like with every year of life

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.714
your brain gets a little older.

00:46:49.714 --> 00:46:51.437
Sometimes it follows what's
more like a step function

00:46:51.437 --> 00:46:55.760
where you get these big
jumps in markers of aging.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.480
I guess that we could
think of them as jumps down

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.070
because it's a negative
thing for most everybody.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.850
We'd like to live longer and
be healthier in brain and body,

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:06.320
and so the types of exercise
I'm referring to now

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.140
are really more about brain longevity

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.380
and about keeping the brain healthy

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.230
than they are about physical fitness.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:17.080
There's no reason why you
couldn't do this and also,

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.210
provided, again, it's safe for you

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.863
given your brain state and
injury state, et cetera,

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.860
there's no reason why you
couldn't also combine it

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.410
with weight training and
other forms of cardio.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:28.660
I think this is really interesting

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.780
and if some of you would
like to know the mechanism

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.310
or at least the hypothesized mechanism,

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.900
there's a molecule called aquaporin-4.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.330
It almost sounds like

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.980
the fourth in a sequel of
movies or something like that,

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:44.630
but aquaporin-4 is a molecule

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.970
that is related to the glial system.

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.750
Glia are the, it means glue in Latin,

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.380
are these cells in the brain,

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.360
the most numerous cells
in the brain, in fact,

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.130
that ensheathe synapses, but
they're very dynamic cells.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.820
They're like little ambulant cells.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.530
The microglia will run in

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.160
and will gather up debris and soak it up

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.714
and then run out after an injury.

00:48:04.714 --> 00:48:06.080
Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.940
by the glial cell called the astrocyte.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.020
Astro, it looks like a little star.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.740
Incredibly interesting cells

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.770
and the thing to remember is

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.330
that the astrocytes bridge the connection

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:18.923
between the neurons,

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.040
the synapse, the connections between them,

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.360
and the vasculature, the blood system,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.286
and the glymphatic system.

00:48:27.286 --> 00:48:29.100
They sit at the interface
and they kind of,

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.670
imagine somebody on an
emergency site, car crash site,

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.900
who's directing everybody
around as to what to do.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.910
Get that person on a
stretcher, bandage them up,

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.910
call their mother, et cetera, et cetera,

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.250
get this out of the road,
put down some flares.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:43.470
The astrocytes work in that capacity

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.620
as well as doing some
things more directly.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.900
This glymphatic system and
the glial astrocyte system

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.840
is a system that we
want chronically active

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.950
throughout the day as much as possible,

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.050
so low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio,

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.300
and then at night, during slow-wave sleep,

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.193
is then really when this
glymphatic system kicks in.

00:49:02.193 --> 00:49:04.790
That should hopefully be
an actionable takeaway,

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.440
provided that you can do
that kind of cardio safely,

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.710
that I believe everybody should be doing

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.270
who cares about brain longevity,

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.743
not just people who are
trying to get over TBI.

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.490
Now I'd like to return a little bit

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:20.710
to some of the subjective
aspects of pain modulation

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.180
because I think it's so
interesting and so actionable

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.840
that everyone should know about this,

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.020
and in this case,

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.160
we can also say that
regardless of whether or not

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.200
you're experiencing
pain, acute or chronic,

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.990
what I'm about to tell you

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:39.870
is as close as anything is to proof,

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:41.620
in science, we rarely talk about proof,

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.930
we talk about evidence in
favor or against a hypothesis,

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.600
but as close as possible to proof

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.730
that our interpretation,

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.420
our subjective interpretation
of a sensory event

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.780
is immensely powerful

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.333
for dictating our experience of the event.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.710
Here are a couple examples.

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.150
First of all,

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:04.690
anyone who's ever done
combat sports or martial arts

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:07.960
knows that it's incredible

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.850
how little a punch hurts during a fight

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:15.170
and it's incredible how
much it hurts after a fight.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.870
The molecule adrenaline,

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.893
when it's liberated into our body,

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.023
truly blunts our experience of pain.

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:25.630
We all know the stories of people

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.810
walking miles on stumped legs,

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.260
people doing all sorts of things

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.110
that were incredible feats

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:36.580
that allowed them to move through

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.080
what would otherwise be pain,

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.700
and afterward they do
experience extreme pain,

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.640
but during the event oftentimes

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.440
they are not experiencing
pain and that's because of

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.020
the pain-blunting effects of adrenaline.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.570
I'll tell you exactly how
this works in a few minutes

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.440
when we talk about acupuncture,

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.940
but norepinephrine binding
to particular receptors,

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.890
adrenaline binding to particular receptors

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:00.503
actually shuts down pain pathways.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.460
People who anticipate
an injection of morphine

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:11.460
immediately report the
feeling of loss of pain.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:12.980
Their pain starts to diminish

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.040
because they know they're
going to get pain relief

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.227
and it's a powerful effect.

00:51:17.227 --> 00:51:19.480
All of you are probably
saying placebo effect.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.270
Placebo effects are very real.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:24.340
Placebo effects and belief
effects, as they're called,

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.700
have a profound effect on our experience

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.430
of noxious stimuli like pain

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:32.540
and they can also have a profound
effect on positive stimuli

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.060
and things that we're looking forward to.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.910
One study that I think is
particularly interesting here,

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:39.820
it's from my colleague
at Stanford, Sean Mackey.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.610
They did a neuroimaging study.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.050
They subjected people to pain.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:45.270
In this case, it was a heat pain.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.830
People have very specific
thresholds to heat

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:50.810
at which they cannot
tolerate any more heat,

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:52.620
but they explored the extent to which

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.030
looking at an image of somebody,

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.780
in this case, a romantic
partner that the person loved,

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:02.163
would allow them to adjust
their pain response,

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.150
and it turns out it does.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.130
If people are looking at an image

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:11.550
or thinking about a person that they love,

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.450
or even a thing that they
love, a pet that they love,

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.630
studies previous to the one
that Mackey and colleagues did

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:21.020
showed that their experience
of pain was reduced.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.090
Their threshold for pain was higher.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.400
They could tolerate more pain

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.563
and they reported it as not as painful,

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.310
but there's a twist there
which is it turns out

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:36.310
that the extent to which
love will modulate pain

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.720
has everything to do with how infatuated

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.550
and obsessed somebody is with
the object of their love.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:49.300
People that report thinking
about somebody, or a pet,

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.560
for many hours of the day,

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.640
kind of having an obsessive nature,

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.360
almost like what people might call

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.890
quote, unquote, codependency.

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:58.830
For those of you that are listening,

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.130
I'm just providing air quotes

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:02.240
'cause codependency is kind
of a clinical thing now

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.500
although it's thrown
around a lot all the time.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.570
It's sort of like gaslighting.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.210
People talk about
gaslighting all the time now.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:08.890
Gaslighting is a real thing

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:10.580
but then people talked about gaslighting

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.933
for many things outside
the clinical description.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.370
If people are very obsessed with somebody,

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:21.440
they have a kind of obsessive
love of somebody's face,

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.960
even if the other person
doesn't know them,

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.160
which is a little weird,

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.630
that response, that
feeling of love internally

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:34.200
can blunt the pain experience
to a significant degree.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.320
These are not small effects.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.850
It's not just that love
can protect us from pain.

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.160
It's that infatuation and obsession

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.330
can protect us from pain,

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.270
and not surprisingly,

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:48.400
how early a relationship is,
how new a relationship is

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.530
directly correlates with
people's ability, they showed,

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:55.900
to use this love, this internal
representation of love,

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.463
to blunt the pain response.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.340
For those of you that have
been with your partners

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.180
for many years and you love them very much

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.220
and you're obsessed with them, terrific.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.470
You have a pre-installed,

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:07.590
well, I suppose it's not pre-installed.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.500
You had to do the work because
relationships are work,

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:14.100
but you've got a installed
mechanism for blunting pain,

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.440
and again, these are not minor effects.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.460
These are major effects

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.940
and it's all going to be
through that top-down modulation

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:21.773
that we talked about,

00:54:21.773 --> 00:54:24.410
not unlike the mirror box
experiments with phantom limb

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:26.250
that relieve phantom pain

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:29.070
or some other top-down modulation,

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.330
and the opposite example was
the nail through the boot,

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.590
which is a visual image
that made the person think

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:34.930
it was painful when in fact

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.010
it was painful even though
there was no tissue damage.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.170
It was all perceptual.

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:41.940
The pain system is really subject

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.510
to these perceptual influences,

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:47.470
which is remarkable because, really,

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:49.220
when we think about the
somatosensory system,

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.530
it has this cognitive component,

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.260
it's got this peripheral component,

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.290
but there's another component

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.750
which is the way in which our sensation,

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:58.410
our somatosensory system is woven in

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:00.360
with our autonomic nervous system,

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.660
and we're going to get to that next,

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.780
but I want to just raise the idea

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.390
that the reason that
this kind of infatuation

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.600
and obsessive love can
blunt the pain response

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.280
and increase one's threshold for pain

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.190
may have to do,

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.770
I would say almost certainly has to do,

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.100
but it hasn't been measured yet,

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.530
with dopamine release

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:23.190
because dopamine is
absolutely the molecule

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:26.610
that's liberated in our brain and body

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:30.930
when there's a new kind of
obsession or infatuation.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:34.500
It's very distinct from
the kind of love chemicals,

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.140
if you will,

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.740
I don't even like calling
them love chemicals.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.650
That just feels weird.

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:40.440
If this were text, I
would delete that line,

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.710
but from the chemicals associated

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:45.410
with warmth and connection,

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:47.600
such as serotonin and oxytocin,

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.650
which tend to be for more stable,

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:50.940
long-lasting relationships.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.650
Dopamine is what dilates the pupils,

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.850
which gets people really excited.

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.470
They can't stop thinking about somebody.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:58.610
The text messages are even exciting.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:00.920
They write to them and they can't wait

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.400
for the text message to come back,

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.810
the dot dot dot on the screen.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:05.690
The text message is excruciating.

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:07.250
They don't respond for two minutes

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.640
and people are getting flipped out.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.360
I'm not here to support
that kind of whatever,

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.700
what I'm saying is that

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.270
that obsessive type of love,

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.030
which without question

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.880
is going to be associated
with the dopamine pathway,

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:24.480
does seem to have a
utility in the context of

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:28.380
reducing the unpleasantness
of physical pain,

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:29.610
and probably has a lot to do

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.590
with reducing the
unpleasantness of a lot of life,

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:32.960
like sitting in traffic, et cetera,

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.950
because when we talk about pain,

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:36.530
emotional pain and physical pain

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.560
start to become one in the same.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.030
They are so closely intertwined

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.740
that the lines between them
neurally become very blurry.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:45.840
What do I mean by that?

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.200
Well, if love and infatuation

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.160
can reduce pain,

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.030
presumably through the
release of dopamine,

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:56.440
well, then does dopamine
release itself blunt pain?

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.390
Should we be chasing dopamine release

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:01.530
as a way to treat chronic and acute pain?

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.810
And that's exactly what we're
going to talk about now.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:04.890
Independent of love,

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:06.460
we're going to talk about
something quite different

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.590
which is putting needles and electricity

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.060
in different parts of the
body, so-called acupuncture.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.203
Something that, for many people,

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.280
it's been viewed as a kind
of alternative medicine,

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.600
but now there are excellent
laboratories exploring

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.130
what's called electroacupuncture
and acupuncture.

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:26.690
These are big university centers.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.210
In fact, my source for everything
I'm about to tell you next

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:33.430
is Professor Qiufu Ma at
Harvard Medical School

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.340
and his papers.

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.630
I stand behind the information
that I'm going to provide today,

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:40.760
but it's extracted largely
from the Ma lab's papers

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.760
which use very rigorous
variable-isolating experiments

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:49.560
to address just how does
something like acupuncture work,

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.320
and I think what you'll be interested in

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.900
and surprised to learn
is that it does work,

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:57.060
but sometimes it can exacerbate pain

00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:59.250
and sometimes it can relieve pain

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.780
and it all does that through
very discrete pathways

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.957
for which we can really say,

00:58:03.957 --> 00:58:05.500
"This neuron connects to that neuron

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.470
connects to the adrenals,"

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.850
and we can tie this all back to dopamine

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:11.390
because in the end it's the
chemicals and neural circuits

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.410
that are giving rise to these perceptions,

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:15.010
or these experiences, rather,

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.650
of things that we call
pain, love, et cetera.

00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:19.540
In a previous podcast episode,

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.260
I mentioned my experience
of visiting an acupuncturist

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.320
and getting acupuncture.

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.100
The acupuncture itself

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.130
didn't really do that much for me,

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:31.910
but I wasn't there for
any specific reason.

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:35.320
It was gifted to me by somebody
and I wanted to try it.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.780
I'm not passing judgment on acupuncture.

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.170
In fact, I know a number of people

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:42.440
that really derive tremendous
benefit from acupuncture

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:45.670
for pain and for gastrointestinal issues.

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.800
There are actually a lot of

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.010
really good peer-reviewed studies

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.730
supporting the use of
acupuncture for, in particular,

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.193
GI tract issues.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.840
In recent years, there's
been an emphasis on

00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.600
trying to understand the mechanism

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.180
of things like acupuncture
and acupuncture itself,

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.250
not to support acupuncture

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.140
or to try to get everybody
to do acupuncture

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.780
but as a way to try and understand

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.880
how these sorts of practices

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.100
might actually benefit people
who are experiencing pain

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.720
or for changing the nervous system

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.300
or brain-body relationship in general,

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.133
and actually,

00:59:19.133 --> 00:59:22.500
the National Institutes of
Health in the United States

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.640
now has a entire subdivision,

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.573
an institute within the
National Institutes of Health,

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.210
which is complementary health,

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:36.880
and that institute is interested
in things like acupuncture

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.437
and a variety of other
practices that, I think,

00:59:39.437 --> 00:59:41.930
10, 15 years ago people probably thought

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:45.177
were really alternative and
maybe even counterculture,

00:59:45.177 --> 00:59:47.280
at least in the States, and it's exciting.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.310
I think people are starting
to really take a look at

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.370
what's going on under the hood

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.860
for certain types of
treatments that are very useful

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.570
and I think it's very likely to lead

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.510
to an expanded number of treatments

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:59.360
for a number of different conditions.

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.830
What I want to talk about
in terms of acupuncture

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:06.570
is the incredible way in
which acupuncture illuminates

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.670
the crosstalk between
the somatosensory system,

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:12.880
our ability to feel stuff

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.890
externally, exteroception,

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.820
internally, interoception,

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.530
and how that somatosensory system

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.440
is wired in with and communicating

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.010
with our autonomic nervous system

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:27.963
that regulates our levels
of alertness or calmness.

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:30.990
After that, I'm going to talk about

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:34.640
how the acupuncture that's
being done right now

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.283
also points to relief for
what's called referred pain.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.100
This takes us all back to the
homunculus. Let's start there.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.690
We have this representation
of our body surface

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:45.893
in our brain.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:50.023
That representation is
what we call somatotopic,

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.390
and what somatotopy is

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:55.510
is it just means that areas of your body

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:56.800
that are near one another,

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.260
so your thumb and your
forefinger, for instance,

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.190
are represented by neurons
that are nearby each other

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.023
in the brain.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.460
You might say, "Well, duh,"

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.010
but actually, it didn't
have to be that way.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.110
The neurons that represent
the tip of my forefinger

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:11.660
and the neurons that represent
my thumb on the same hand

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.790
could have been distantly located

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:16.570
and therefore the map of my
body surface, the homunculus,

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.650
would be really disordered,
but it's not that way.

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:20.900
It's very ordered. It's very smooth.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.830
As, let's say you were to image my brain,

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.980
if you were to stimulate
my finger, my forefinger,

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.270
and then march that
stimulation across my finger,

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.660
across the palm and to the nearby thumb,

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.150
you would see that neurons in the brain

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:32.920
would also make a sort of J shape

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.470
in their pattern of activation.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.920
That means there's so-called somatotopy,

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.550
but the connections
from those brain neurons

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:42.400
are sent into the body

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.380
and they are synchronized with,

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.470
meaning they cross-wire with

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:52.260
and form synapses with some of the input

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.750
from the viscera, from our guts,

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.970
from our diaphragm, from our stomach,

01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:00.410
from our spleen, from our heart.

01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:02.820
Our internal organs
are sending information

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.160
up to this map in our
brain of the body surface,

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.870
but it's about internal information,

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.380
what we call interoception,

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.810
our ability to look
inside or imagine inside

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:13.653
and feel what we're feeling inside.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.060
The way to think about this accurately

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.690
is that our representation of ourself

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:22.650
is a representation of
our internal workings,

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:25.300
our viscera, our guts,
everything inside our skin,

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.400
and the surface of our skin,

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.140
and the external world, what we're seeing.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.960
Those three things are
always being combined

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.143
in a very interesting,
complex but very seamless way.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.540
Acupuncture involves taking needles,

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.720
and sometimes electricity
and or heat as well,

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.250
and stimulating particular
locations on the body

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.960
and through these maps of stimulation

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.910
that have been developed
over thousands of years,

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:55.313
mostly in Asia,

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.530
but now this is a
practice that's being done

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.430
many places throughout the world,

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.520
they have these maps that speak to,

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.480
oh, well, if you stimulate
this part of the body,

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.510
you get this response,

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:07.350
and if somebody has a
gastrointestinal issue,

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.930
like their guts are moving
too quick, they have diarrhea,

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.010
you stimulate this area

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:12.880
and it'll slow their gut motility down,

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.540
or if their gut motility is
too slow, they're constipated,

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.710
you stimulate someplace
else and it accelerates it,

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.330
and hearing about this
stuff, it sounds kind of,

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.680
to a Westerner who's not thinking about

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.330
the underlying neural circuitry,

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:25.770
it could sound kind of wacky.

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:27.210
It really sounds like alternative

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.790
or even really out there stuff,

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.390
but when you look at the neural
circuitry, the neuroanatomy,

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:33.590
it really starts to make sense,

01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:36.870
and Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:39.820
is an excellent laboratory,

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.910
has been exploring how
stimulation of different types,

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:47.740
intense or weak, with
heat or without heat,

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.120
on different parts of the body

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.680
can modulate pain and inflammation,

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.990
and what they've shown in a
particularly exciting study

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.193
is that stimulation of the abdomen,

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.240
anywhere on the midsection,

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.247
weakly does nothing.

01:04:06.247 --> 01:04:08.230
"Well, that's not very
interesting," you might say.

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:11.110
Intense stimulation of
the abdomen, however,

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:14.940
with this electroacupuncture
has a very strong effect

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.690
of increasing inflammation in the body,

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.840
and this is important to understand

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.450
because it's not just that
stimulating the gut does this

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:28.150
because you're activating the gut area.

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:30.980
It activates a particular nerve pathway.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.940
For the aficionados,

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.550
it's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:35.650
if you really want to know,

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:40.070
and it's pro-inflammatory
under most conditions.

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:43.300
However, there are other
conditions where if, for instance,

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.330
the person is dealing with a
particular bacterial infection,

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:48.160
that can be beneficial,

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.060
and this goes back to a
much earlier discussion

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.530
that we had on a previous podcast

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.430
that we'll revisit again and again,

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.130
which is that the stress response

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:58.250
was designed to combat infection.

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:00.200
It turns out that there
are certain patterns

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.600
of stimulation on the abdomen

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.090
that can actually liberate immune cells

01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:07.120
from our immune organs, like our spleen,

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.900
and counter infection

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.670
through the release of
things like adrenaline.

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:13.760
Qiufu's lab also showed

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.760
that stimulation of the feet and hands

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.330
can reduce inflammation,

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.420
and again, this was done mechanistically.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.300
This was done by blocking certain pathways

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.430
with the appropriate control experiments.

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:32.020
This was done not in any
kind of subjective way.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.820
This was also done by
measuring particular molecules,

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.440
IL-6 and cytokines

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.140
and things that are related
to the inflammation response,

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.830
and what they showed is
that the stimulation of the,

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:46.830
in particular, the hind
limbs at low intensity

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:51.420
led to increases in the
activity of this vagal pathway.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.380
The vagus nerve being
this 10th cranial nerve

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.270
that serves the rest and
digest and parasympathetic,

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:58.420
in other words, calming response.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.980
What this means is that we
are now at the front edge

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.993
of this research field that's,

01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:05.130
it's early days still,

01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:07.060
but it's discovering that
depending on whether or not

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.050
the stimulation is intense or mild

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:13.310
and depending on where the
stimulation is done on the body

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:15.270
you can get very different effects.

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:18.410
This points to the idea that
you can't say acupuncture good

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.070
or acupuncture bad.

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:23.360
There has to be a
systematic understanding of

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.340
what exactly the effect is
that you're trying to achieve

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.860
and the underlying basis
for this is really relevant

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.540
to the thing about adrenaline
that I said before,

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.840
that in a fight,

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.580
it's rare that you ever
feel pain when you get hit,

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.270
I've experienced that,

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:38.500
but later it hurts a lot.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.990
It turns out that when you
stimulate these pathways

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:43.980
that activate, in
particular, the adrenals,

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.480
the adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine and epinephrine

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.180
and the brain does as well,

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.220
it binds to what are called

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.610
the beta noradrenergic receptors.

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.540
This is really getting
down into the weeds,

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:58.010
but the beta noradrenergic
receptors activate the spleen

01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:01.210
which liberates cells
that combat infection

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:03.960
and it's anti-inflammatory.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.690
That's the short-term quick response.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:11.660
The more intense stimulation
of the abdomen and other areas

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.050
can be pro-inflammatory

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.990
because of the ways that
they trigger certain loops

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.540
that go back to the brain and
trigger the anxiety pathways

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.470
and that place people
into a state of anxiety

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.890
that exacerbates pain.

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:26.940
One pathway stimulates
norepinephrine and blunts pain,

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.780
the other one doesn't.

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.810
What does all this mean?

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:31.860
How are we supposed to
put all of this together?

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.190
Well, there's a paper that was published

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:34.783
in "Nature Medicine" in 2014,

01:07:34.783 --> 01:07:36.920
this is an excellent journal,

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.500
that describes how dopamine

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.300
can activate the vagus
peripherally in the,

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.343
not dopamine in the brain, peripherally,

01:07:45.343 --> 01:07:49.300
and norepinephrine can
activate the vagus peripherally

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.840
and reduce inflammation,

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.977
and I'm not trying to throw
a ton of facts at you.

01:07:52.977 --> 01:07:54.410
You'll say, "Well, what
am I supposed to do

01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:55.300
with all this information?"

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.300
What this means is that

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.350
there are real maps of our body surface

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.740
that when stimulated

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.170
communicate with our
autonomic nervous system,

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.830
the system that controls
alertness or calmness,

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:09.620
and thereby releases either molecules

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.010
like norepinephrine and dopamine,

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:15.030
which make us more alert,
as we would be in a fight,

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:17.510
and blunt our response to pain

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.370
and they reduce inflammation,

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:23.710
but there are yet other
pathways that when stimulated

01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:25.230
are pro-inflammatory,

01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:26.510
and that brings us to the question of

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:28.340
what is all this inflammation stuff

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.220
that people are talking about?

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.720
One of the things that
bothers me so much these days,

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.190
and I'm not easily irritated,

01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.460
but what really bothers me is when people

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.640
are talking about inflammation
like inflammation is bad.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.920
Inflammation is terrific.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.320
Inflammation is the reason
why cells are called

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.230
to the site of injury to clear it out.

01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:46.210
Inflammation is what's going to allow you

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:47.930
to heal from any injury.

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.110
Chronic inflammation is bad,

01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:53.010
but acute inflammation
is absolutely essential.

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.950
Remember those kids that
we talked about earlier

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.860
that have mutations in these
receptors for sensing pain?

01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.200
They never get inflammation

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.290
and that's why their joints
literally disintegrate.

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:04.260
It's really horrible

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.830
because they don't actually
have the inflammation response

01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:10.340
because it was never triggered
by the pain response.

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.360
Inflammation can be very beneficial.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.280
There's a lot of interest nowadays

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.990
in taking things and doing
things to limit inflammation.

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:19.970
One of the ones that comes
up a lot is turmeric.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:21.830
I'm sure the moment anyone
starts talking about

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:24.620
inflammation the question
is, "What about turmeric?"

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.590
I have talked before
about turmeric elsewhere.

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:30.700
I am very skeptical of turmeric

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.520
and I might lose a few friends,

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.280
although that'd be weird if my friend,

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.600
that would say something
about my friendships

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.380
if I lost friends over a
discussion about turmeric,

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.000
but in any case,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.300
turmeric does have
anti-inflammatory properties,

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.520
there's no question about that,

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.040
but as we've just described,

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.550
inflammation can be a very good thing,

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:50.850
at least in the short term.

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:52.230
The other thing about turmeric is

01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.580
there was a study
published out of Stanford

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.610
in collection with some
work from other universities

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.930
showing that a lot of turmeric

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:01.340
is heavily contaminated with lead.

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.910
The lead is used to get

01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:06.980
that really rich, dense,
orange coloring to it

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.280
that everyone wants to see,

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.060
so you have to check
your sources of turmeric.

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.700
The other thing is, for men in particular,

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.860
turmeric can be very antagonistic
to dihydrotestosterone.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.210
Dihydrotestosterone is
the more dominant form

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:23.830
of androgen in human males

01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:27.120
and it's involved in things
like aggression and libido

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.380
and things of that sort.

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.210
Many people that I've talked
to who have have taken turmeric

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:36.000
get a severe blunting
of affect and libido.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.110
For some people that might
be a serious negative.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:40.760
I certainly avoid turmeric.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.360
I don't like turmeric for that reason.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.130
I also think that the
inflammation response

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:46.763
is a healthy response.

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:48.740
You have to keep it in check

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.440
and we're going to talk
about specific practices

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.780
for wound healing and injury in a moment,

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.950
but this idea that just
inflammation is bad

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:57.760
and you want to reduce
inflammation across the board,

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.350
nothing could be further from the truth.

01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:01.920
We have pathways that exist in our body

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.963
specifically to increase inflammation.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:07.810
It's the inflammation that goes
unchecked, just like stress,

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:11.410
which is problematic for
repair, for brain injury,

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:14.610
and it can exacerbate certain
forms of dementia, et cetera,

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.760
but I'd like to create
a little bit more nuance

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.320
or a lot more nuance, if possible,

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.770
in the conversation around inflammation

01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:22.950
because people have just taken

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:26.190
this discussion around
inflammation to be this idea

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:27.900
that just inflammation is bad

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.490
and nothing could be
further from the truth.

01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:31.350
Before I continue,

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:35.260
I just thought I'd answer
a question that I get a lot

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.060
which is what about Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.140
I get asked about this a lot.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.680
Wim Hof, also called aka The Iceman,

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.620
has this breathing that's
similar to Tummo breathing,

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.730
as it was originally called,

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:47.530
involves basically hyperventilating

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.660
and then doing some exhales
and some breath holds.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.700
A couple of things about that.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.690
It should never be done near water.

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:53.830
People who have done it near water

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:55.180
unfortunately have drowned.

01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.650
It's certainly not for everybody

01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:01.480
and I'm not here to either promote it

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.570
nor discourage people from doing it,

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:04.757
but I think we should ask ourselves,

01:12:04.757 --> 01:12:06.210
"What is the net effect of that?"

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.320
Because a number of people
have asked me about it

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.900
in relation to pain management.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.140
The effect of doing
that kind of breathing,

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.420
it's not a mysterious effect.

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.390
It liberates adrenaline from the adrenals.

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:18.223
There is a paper published in

01:12:18.223 --> 01:12:20.300
the "Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,"

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.660
which is a very fine journal,

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.520
showing that that breathing pattern

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.510
can counter infection from endotoxin

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.450
and that's because when you
have adrenaline in your system

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.273
and when the spleen is very active,

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:36.970
that response is used to counter infection

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:39.850
and stress counters infection.

01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:41.450
We'll talk about this more going forward,

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:44.740
but the idea that stress lends
itself to infection is false.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.380
Stress counters infection

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.240
by liberating killer cells in the body.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.360
You don't want the stress response

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.583
to stay on indefinitely, however.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.310
Things like Wim Hof
breathing, like ice baths,

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:57.790
anything that releases adrenaline

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.343
will counter the infection,

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.480
but you want to regulate the duration

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.230
of that adrenaline response.

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:06.190
This should make perfect sense.

01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:07.720
We, as a species,

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.790
had to evolve under
conditions of famine and cold.

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:10.880
Actually, Texas right now

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.580
is an extreme case of
cold and power outage.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.450
I've seen the pictures and
a lot of people out there

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.120
are really suffering.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.720
Their systems are releasing
a ton of adrenaline.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.850
They're cold. Some of them
are likely to be hungry.

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:24.373
They're probably stressed.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:26.950
They're releasing a lot of adrenaline

01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:29.403
which is keeping them safe from infection.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.910
After they get their heat
back on and they relax

01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:34.530
and they can finally warm up again,

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:37.450
which we would like for them very soon,

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:38.900
hopefully by the time
this podcast comes out,

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.530
that will have already happened,

01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:42.530
that's typically when people get sick

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:44.550
because the immune response is blunted

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.023
as the stress response starts to subside.

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:51.470
Stress, inflammation,
countering infection,

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:52.700
that comes from endotoxin,

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.190
that comes from any number of things.

01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:56.250
It can be from cold. It can
be from hyperventilation.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.080
It can be from a physical threat.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.720
It can be from the stress of
an exam or an upcoming surgery.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.030
This adrenaline thing

01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:07.180
and the inflammation
associated with it is adaptive.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:08.780
It's highly adaptive.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.830
It is a short-term plasticity

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.660
that is designed to make us better

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:16.890
for what we're experiencing
and challenged with, not worse,

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.140
and so hopefully that will
add an additional layer

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.160
to this whole idea that stress is bad,

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.310
inflammation is bad, et cetera.

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:26.510
Again, I'm not suggesting
people do or don't do

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:28.530
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing,

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.830
I just want to point to the utility.

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:32.110
It's very similar to the
utility from cold showers,

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:34.640
ice baths and other forms of anything

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.540
that increase adrenaline.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.100
Every episode, I want to make sure

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.690
that every listener comes away

01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:42.060
with as much knowledge as possible

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:44.390
but also actionable tools,

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:46.400
and today we've talked
about a variety of tools,

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.160
but I want to center in on a
particular sequence of tools

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.310
that hopefully you won't need,

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:55.580
but presumably if you're a
human being and you're active,

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.140
you will need at some point.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.870
It's about managing injury

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:02.550
and recovering and healing fast

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:04.363
or at least as fast as possible.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.370
It includes removing the pain.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.040
It includes getting mobility back

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.400
and getting back to a normal life,

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.170
whatever that means for you.

01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:17.380
I want to emphasize that what
I'm about to talk about next

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.960
was developed in close
consultation with Kelly Starrett,

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.200
who many of you probably
have heard of before.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.950
Kelly can be found at The Ready State.

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.420
He's a formally trained,

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.820
so degreed and educated,
exercise physiologist.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.370
He's a world expert in movement

01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:35.010
and tissue rehabilitation, et cetera.

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:36.800
They're not sponsors of the podcast.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.550
Kelly is a friend and a colleague.

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:40.270
He's somebody that I personally trust

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:44.080
and his views on tissue
rehabilitation and injury

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.960
I think are really grounded extremely well

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.350
in both medicine, physiology,

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:53.490
and the real cutting edge of what's new

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:56.610
and what you might not
get in terms of advice

01:15:56.610 --> 01:15:58.160
from the typical person.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.700
All that said, you always,
always, always should consult

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.500
with your physician before
adopting any protocols

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.063
or removing any protocols.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.637
I asked Kelly, I made it
really simple, I said,

01:16:08.637 --> 01:16:10.710
"Okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle

01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:12.610
or break my arm or injure my knee

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.853
or ACL tear or something
like that or shoulder injury,

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.120
what are the absolute necessary things

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.823
to do regardless of situation

01:16:21.823 --> 01:16:25.070
and what science is this grounded in?"

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:27.630
And then I made it a point
to go find the studies

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:32.070
that either supported or
refuted what he was telling me

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:34.670
because that's why I'm here.

01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:37.440
The first one is a very basic one,

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.700
that now you have a lot
of information to act on,

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.110
which is in terms of

01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:43.940
what we know about tissue rehabilitation,

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.420
both brain and body, we know
that sleep is essential,

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:49.870
and so we both agreed
that eight hours minimum

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.610
in bed per night is critical.

01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:52.810
What was interesting, however,

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:55.970
is that it doesn't have to
be eight hours of sleep.

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.240
We acknowledged that some of that time

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.970
might be challenging to get to sleep,

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:03.070
especially if one is in
pain or mobility is limited.

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.280
We forget how often we roll over in bed

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.060
or how the conditions of our sleeping

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.853
can impact those injuries too.

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.750
Kelly acknowledged, and I agree,

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.030
that eight hours of sleep would be ideal,

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:19.200
but if not, at least eight hours immobile

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.420
and that speaks to the power of

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.530
these non-sleep deep rest protocols too.

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:23.620
If you can't sleep,

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.370
doing non-sleep deep rest protocols,

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.920
we've provided links to them before,

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.530
we're going to continue to
provide links to the previous ones

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:31.500
and new ones are coming soon,

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.940
that is extremely beneficial.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.040
That's a non-negotiable

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.170
in terms of getting the
foundation for allowing

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:41.060
for glymphatic clearance and
tissue clearance, et cetera.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.850
The other is, if possible,

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:46.350
unless it's absolutely excruciating
or you just can't do it,

01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:47.950
a 10-minute walk per day,

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.030
of course you don't want
to exacerbate the injury,

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:53.870
at least a 10-minute walk
per day and probably longer.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.080
This is where it gets interesting.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.640
I was taught, I learned that
when you injure yourself,

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.950
you're supposed to ice something.

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:01.230
You're supposed to put ice on
it, but I didn't realize this,

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:03.980
but when speaking to
exercise physiologists

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.170
and some physicians,

01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:08.990
they said that the ice is
really more of a placebo.

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:12.100
It numbs the environment of the injury,

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.140
which is not surprising,

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.020
and will eliminate the
pain for a short while,

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.390
but it has some negative effects

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:21.020
that perhaps offset its use.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.570
One, it sludges,

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:24.440
it creates sludging within the blood

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.840
and other lymphatic tissue,

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.440
so it actually can create
some clotting and sludging

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.060
of the tissue and fluids,

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:34.320
the fascial interface with muscle,

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.240
and a number of the stuff

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.720
that's supposed to be
flowing through there

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.690
can slow up and increase
inflammation in the wrong way,

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:44.980
can actually restrict movement
out of the injury site,

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:47.770
which is bad because
you want the macrophages

01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:51.060
and the other cell types
phagocytosing, eating up,

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.050
the debris in an injury

01:18:53.050 --> 01:18:55.643
and moving it out of there
so that it can repair.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.587
That was surprising to
me which made me ask,

01:18:58.587 --> 01:18:59.710
"Well, then what about heat?"

01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:03.070
Well, it turns out heat is
actually quite beneficial.

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:04.870
A lot of people talk
about heat shock proteins

01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:07.740
and all these genetic
pathways and protein pathways

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.240
that can be activated by heat.

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.050
Very little data to support the idea

01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:14.480
that heat shock proteins

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.860
are part of the wound healing process,

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.930
at least in terms of the
sorts of conventional heat

01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:22.420
that one could use like a hot water bottle

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.560
or a hot bath or a hot compress.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.680
The major effects seem to be explained

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.270
by heat improving the
viscosity of the tissues

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:35.420
and the clearance and
the perfusion of fluid,

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.180
blood, lymph and other fluids,

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.960
out of the injury area.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.480
That's really interesting.
I didn't know this.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.020
I thought, well, you're
supposed to ice something.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.680
I said, well, whenever I would see

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.578
a kid get injured in soccer,

01:19:45.578 --> 01:19:46.810
never me, of course,

01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:48.900
no, of course I got injured
in soccer from time to time,

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:49.980
they give you an ice pack

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.330
and the ice pack removes some of the pain.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:55.540
I think the consensus now,
which was surprising to me,

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.080
is that the ice pack is actually

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.810
more of the top-down modulation.

01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:01.410
You think you're doing
something for the pain

01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:02.820
and there's some interesting studies

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.030
that actually showed the
placebo effect of the ice pack,

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:07.570
so ice packs are placebo, perhaps.

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:08.403
That's interesting.

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.110
I'll underline perhaps because who knows?

01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.440
Maybe there's some people out
there that are going to say

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.750
this is totally crazy

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:15.387
and the ice is actually very beneficial,

01:20:15.387 --> 01:20:18.120
but it seems like heat, mobility,

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.870
sleep, keeping movement,

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:22.890
and it turns out that the movement itself

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.930
can act as a bit of an analgesic,

01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:26.760
it can actually reduce the pain,

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.800
whereas the ice reduces the
pain but sludges the tissue

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.430
and keeps the cells
that need to be removed

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:35.880
from leaving the area.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.630
What's also interesting
is in neuroscience we know

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.570
that if we want to kill
neurons or silence neurons,

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:43.970
we cool them.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:46.540
This is a well-known
tool in the laboratory.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.420
Some of the early and most
important studies in neuroscience

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.170
that formed the basis for the textbooks

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.790
were lowering a cooling probe

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:56.070
into a particular area of the
brain or a peripheral nerve

01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:57.730
in order to shut down that nerve,

01:20:57.730 --> 01:21:00.080
so the cooling will shut down the nerve,

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.800
but another very well-known
fact in neuroscience text books

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.340
is that when the activity
of the nerve pathway

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.890
or neurons comes back,

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:11.190
there's what's called
homeostatic plasticity,

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:13.500
that it rebounds with greater pain,

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.980
with a higher level of intensity,

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.310
which in the pain system
would equate to greater pain.

01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.710
Regardless of where these
neurons are in the body,

01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:22.060
if you stimulate a neuron, it's active.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.050
If you cool it, it becomes inactive

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:27.110
and when the neuron heats
back up after being cooled,

01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:28.950
it becomes hyperactive,

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:32.440
and so this makes really
good sense as to why heat,

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.560
provided it's not damaging levels of heat,

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.520
would be more beneficial for wound healing

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.490
and for reducing pain in
the short and long run

01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:43.930
than would be cold or ice,

01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.770
which I find very interesting.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:47.253
In terms of chronic pain,

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.510
the manuscripts on this,

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:52.270
my discussion with Kelly and with others,

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:54.560
point to the fact that
chronic pain is basically

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.150
plasticity gone wrong.

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:59.077
It's sort of like PTSD
for the emotional system

01:21:59.077 --> 01:22:00.510
and the stress system,

01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:02.950
and chronic pain is going to involve

01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:04.550
a number of different protocols

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:07.380
to rewire both the brain centers

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:09.650
and the peripheral centers
associated with chronic pain.

01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:11.850
Certain things like
fibromyalgia, for instance,

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:13.730
which is whole-body pain,

01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:16.470
relate to too little inhibition.

01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.490
In the brain, you have
excitation and inhibition.

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:19.890
They come from different
sources of neurons.

01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:23.010
The inhibition is mainly from GABA

01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.503
and glycine and things like that.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.650
In fibromyalgia, there's
too little central,

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:30.723
within the brain,

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.790
modulation of the pain responses

01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:36.330
so that people experience whole-body pain.

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:39.100
In that case, the emerging
therapies are really interesting.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.250
I have a friend who works

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.490
for the National Institutes of Health

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:44.130
who unfortunately
suffers from fibromyalgia

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:45.440
who asked me about this a lot

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.910
and his question and what
he's now actually exploring

01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:50.300
is red light therapy.

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.400
Something that I've talked about
on various Instagram posts.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.120
Red light therapy
typically is talked about

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.990
in terms of mitochondria

01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:59.600
and the data on that are not so terrific,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.150
at least not really published

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:03.070
in blue ribbon journals in most cases,

01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:04.950
except for one study that I'm aware of

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:07.570
from Glen Jeffery's lab at
University College London

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:09.710
showing that red light
stimulation to the eyes

01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:11.550
in people 40 or older

01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:13.870
can offset some of the effects
of macular degeneration

01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:16.620
by improving the health
of the photo receptors.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:19.850
People with fibromyalgia,
which is this whole-body pain,

01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:23.070
are now starting to use
red light therapies.

01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:27.007
When I asked Kelly and others
and some experts in pain,

01:23:27.007 --> 01:23:29.530
"What are your thoughts
on this red light therapy

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:32.230
for things like fibromyalgia and pain,

01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:34.860
especially red light local therapy?"

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.530
Their idea, and I don't
think this is a field

01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:39.860
that's progressed far enough now

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.450
to really place any firm conclusions on,

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:45.820
but the idea is that red
light therapy locally

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.350
may have some effect,

01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:49.320
but the systemic red light therapy,

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.880
this is like wearing protection
to the eyes, in some cases,

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.140
so not for the treatment
of macular degeneration

01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.460
but wearing protection of the eyes

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.540
and getting very bright red light therapy

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.447
in many ways may be, and
to use Kelly's words,

01:24:02.447 --> 01:24:04.360
"Approximating the effects of nature."

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.100
These are like surrogate technologies

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.740
for getting outside in the sunshine.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.450
When you're in the sun,
it might not look red,

01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:12.610
but there are a lot of red
wavelengths coming toward you.

01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:14.920
The red light therapies
may have some utility,

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.090
but getting into sunlight
may actually have

01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:20.010
as much or more effect.

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:21.890
Of course, if these wounds
are on a part of the body

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.330
that you can't expose,

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:24.430
then you could imagine why

01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:25.930
the red light therapy might be good.

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.363
I don't know, depending on
the neighborhood you live in,

01:24:27.363 --> 01:24:29.500
that may or may not be a
weird thing to go outside

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.150
and expose your body to sunlight.

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:33.810
Probably a number of factors that dictate

01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:34.960
whether or not that'd be weird or not,

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.690
but that's up to you, not me,

01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:38.670
and it seems that,

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:42.320
so movement, heat, not ice,

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.740
light, sleep,

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.610
and in some cases, the use,

01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:48.820
and I'll talk about this in a moment,

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.050
that some cases the use of restricting

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:53.420
above and below the injury to then release

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.340
and then increase
perfusion through the site

01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.800
may actually accelerate the wound healing.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.010
All of this might sound just
like common sense knowledge,

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.710
but to me, at least as a 45-year-old,

01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:06.180
I always just thought it's ice,

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.730
it's non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,

01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:10.840
it's things that block prostaglandins,

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.310
so things like aspirin,
ibuprofen, acetaminophen.

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.270
Those things generally
work by blocking things,

01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:21.530
they're called the COX
prostaglandin blockers

01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:24.163
and things of that sort,
things in that pathway.

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:28.460
Those sorts of treatments
which reduce inflammation

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:29.900
may not be so great at the beginning

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.400
when you want inflammation,

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.480
they may be important for limiting pain

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.430
so people can be functional at all,

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:37.690
but the things that I talked about today

01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:41.190
really are anchored in three principles.

01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:44.980
One is that the inflammation
response is a good one.

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.500
This is what we're learning
from Qiufu Ma's lab's

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:48.850
work on acupuncture.

01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:51.150
The immediate acute
inflammation response is good.

01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:53.930
It calls to the site of injury

01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:56.730
things that are going to clean
up the injury and bad cells.

01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:58.910
Then there are going to be things

01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:00.510
that are going to improve perfusion,

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:03.780
like the glymphatic
system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.083
feet elevated, sleeping on one side,

01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:11.100
low-level Zone 2 cardio
three times a week.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.200
Red light, perhaps, is going to be useful

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.430
although sunlight might be just as good

01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:17.680
depending on who you talk to,

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.460
and we can talk about that
probably more at length

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.660
in a future episode.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.620
A number of people will ask
me, I'm sure, about stem cells

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:27.540
and I don't want to take more of your time

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.960
by going into an hour-long
discussion about stem cells.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.850
Stem cells exist in all
of us during development.

01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:33.850
We were created from stem cells,

01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:36.460
which are cells that can
become essentially anything.

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:39.210
Later, cells get what's called
restricted in their lineage,

01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:40.280
so a skin cell,

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.240
unless you do some fancy
molecular gymnastics to it,

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.903
you can't actually turn
that cell into a neuron.

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.090
Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize

01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:51.140
for finding these Yamanaka factors

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.080
which you could give a skin
cell to turn into a neuron,

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.580
but that's not an approved
therapy at this time,

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.250
but many people ask me
about platelet-rich plasma,

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:00.900
so-called PRP.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:04.180
They take blood, they
enrich for platelets,

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.340
and they re-inject it back into people.

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.790
Here's the deal. This
deserves an entire episode.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:13.530
It has never been shown whether
or not the injection itself

01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:16.180
is what's actually creating the effect.

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.950
This is something that
the acupuncture literature

01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:19.470
suffered from for a long time,

01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:22.070
that the sham control, as it's called,

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.390
sham, we don't mean it's a sham,

01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:25.030
but in science you say a sham control

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:28.700
meaning you do everything
exactly the same way you would.

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.180
So for acupuncture,

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.410
you would bring the needle
right up to the skin,

01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:34.560
but you wouldn't actually poke it

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.070
into the skin, for instance.

01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:37.990
That would be a sham control.

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.940
With a drug treatment,

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.880
you would inject a drug into a person

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.670
and then the control, the sham control,

01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.630
would be that you would
bring the injection over,

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:47.810
you might do the injection
or not do the injection

01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:49.380
'cause you imagine that
the injection itself

01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:50.610
could have an effect.

01:27:50.610 --> 01:27:52.660
It's never really been
shown whether or not PRP

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.950
has effects that are separate

01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:57.010
from injecting a volume
of fluid into a tissue.

01:27:57.010 --> 01:28:00.060
The claims that PRP
actually contains stem cells

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.990
are very, very feeble,

01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:04.928
and when you look at the literature

01:28:04.928 --> 01:28:08.340
and you talk to anyone expert
in the stem cell field,

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:10.610
they will tell you that it's,

01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:14.280
the number of stem cells in
PRP is infinitesimally small.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.230
In fact, so much so that these places

01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:21.630
that inject PRP for injuries
are not allowed to advertise

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.480
through the use of the words stem cells.

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.990
It's actually illegal at this point,

01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:26.150
at least as far as I know.

01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:28.300
It was through the end of last year

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.620
and I'm guessing it still is now.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.970
Stem cells are an exciting
area of technology.

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:35.980
However, there's a clinic down in Florida

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:37.880
that was shut down a couple of years ago

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.350
for injecting stem cells
harvested from patients

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.130
into the eye for macular degeneration.

01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:46.490
These were people that were
suffering from poor vision

01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:48.687
and very shortly after injecting

01:28:48.687 --> 01:28:50.060
the stem cells into the eyes,

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.270
they went completely blind.

01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:56.280
I'm somebody who is very skeptical

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.760
of the stem cell treatment
work that's out there.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.010
It's actually very hard to get

01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:02.580
in the United States for this reason.

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:06.350
It's not approved. The PRP
treatments are very complicated.

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:08.080
The marketing around them is

01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:11.550
shaky at best.

01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:14.080
I'm sure a number of people
will say that they had PRP

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.100
and benefited from it tremendously
and I don't doubt that.

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.380
Whether or not it was placebo,

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.290
today we talked a lot
about top-down control,

01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:24.270
that's just a variant on the
word placebo, belief effects,

01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:27.000
whether or not it was
placebo or not, I don't know.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.740
I wasn't there.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:31.030
That's for you to decide
and I'm not here to tell you

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:32.350
that you should or shouldn't do something,

01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:34.840
but I do think that anything
involving stem cells,

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.360
one should be very cautious of.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.290
You should also be very cautious
of anyone that tells you

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.050
that PRP is injecting a lot of stem cells.

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:43.410
This is an evolving area that really needs

01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:45.460
a lot more work and attention.

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:49.190
The major issue with stem cells
that I think is concerning

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:52.240
is that stem cells are cells

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.270
that want to become lots
of different things,

01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:56.150
not just the tissue that
you're interested in.

01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:57.030
If you damage your knee

01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:00.100
and you inject stem cells into your knee,

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.730
you need to molecularly
restrict those stem cells

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:05.733
so that they don't become tumor cells.

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:08.680
A tumor is a collection of stem cells.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.300
When you get something horrible

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.940
like glioblastoma in the brain,

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.280
which is a terrible thing to have,

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.100
it's glial cells that returned

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.150
to stemness, excessive stemness,

01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:21.610
they've started to produce
too many of themselves,

01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:25.460
and glioblastoma is
often deadly, not always.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.460
Injecting stem cells, it sounds great,

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.990
and it sounds like something
that one would want to do,

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:33.160
but one needs to approach
this with extreme caution,

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.390
even if it's your own blood

01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:37.480
or stem cells that you're re-injecting.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.483
I think those technologies are
coming. They're on the way.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.980
If any of you are devotees of PRP,

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.530
tell me your experiences with them.

01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.250
I'm curious. I want to see the papers.

01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:49.250
I want to know the evidence,

01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:51.357
and of course, there are always
folks out there that say,

01:30:51.357 --> 01:30:52.860
"I don't care what the scientists

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.550
and the physicians and the FDA say.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.840
I just want to do this,"

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.700
and if that's your stance,
that's your stance.

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.400
I'm not here to govern that,

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.520
but I do think that
people should be informed,

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:06.720
and in thinking about
tissue recovery and injury,

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.330
that's what I was able to glean.

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:10.110
Again, check out what Kelly

01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:13.120
and his coworkers are
doing at The Ready State.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:16.120
It's phenomenal and they've
worked with all the top people

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.670
in just about every
domain of life, it seems.

01:31:18.670 --> 01:31:20.143
Very high-integrity folks.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.550
Some of you are probably
saying, "Well, I'm not injured.

01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.660
I'm not an athlete. I don't
want stem cell injections.

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.493
I don't have," again,

01:31:26.493 --> 01:31:29.630
I'm saying you shouldn't get
stem cell injections for now.

01:31:29.630 --> 01:31:31.670
Please hold off until
the field learns more

01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:33.230
about how to do that safely,

01:31:33.230 --> 01:31:35.087
but I want to talk about

01:31:35.087 --> 01:31:38.110
and end with a really interesting

01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:40.380
and somewhat weird technology,

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.180
which is baby blood.

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.570
I have a colleague at Stanford,

01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:46.800
his name is Tony Wyss-Coray,

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.330
and in 2014 his laboratory
published a study

01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:54.640
showing that the blood of young rodents,

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.070
mice and rats,

01:31:56.070 --> 01:32:00.300
when transfused into
old, demented rodents,

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:01.870
mice and rats,

01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:04.230
made those old, demented rodents

01:32:04.230 --> 01:32:09.160
recover much of their
memory and seem much more

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.103
vital and energetic,

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:16.200
better recall of different
spatial learning tasks.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.410
Tissue and wound healing,
they've since shown,

01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:22.130
can be improved in these older animals.

01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:23.280
It's pretty incredible.

01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:26.410
They went on to show several years later

01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:30.550
that blood from umbilical cords,

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:31.450
I'm not making this up,

01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:35.320
blood from umbilical cords can do the same

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.800
and this is the basis
of a biotech company.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.480
Actually, one of my former postdocs

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.850
is now an employee there.

01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:46.240
They've isolated the
molecules from young blood

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.910
that seems to vitalize

01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:52.900
or revitalize the old brain and body,

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.550
and one of those molecules
goes by the name TIMP2.

01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:56.983
T-I-M-P-2.

01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.890
Where's all this going?

01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:03.030
Well, I don't know how
long it's going to be

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:05.860
before there are treatments based on

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.930
these blood transfusions.

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:11.430
I doubt that blood transfusions themselves

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:13.740
from young people into old people

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:16.780
is going to be used for
the treatment of dementia,

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:19.910
although it might, as weird as it seems.

01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:22.730
We know that transfusions
of all sorts of stuff,

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:24.420
for instance, fecal transplants

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.780
are being used to treat obesity.

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:30.310
The gut microbiome of
thin people is being,

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.020
not transfused, but is being transplanted

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:36.140
into the colons and guts of obese people

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:37.480
and leading to weight loss,

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.440
which sounds really wild

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.610
and is not a topic I
particularly enjoy talking about,

01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:45.810
but nonetheless, it
points to the importance

01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:47.900
of the gut microbiome in regulating things

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:50.210
like blood sugar and health

01:33:50.210 --> 01:33:52.720
as it relates to obesity and diabetes

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.423
and all sorts of things.

01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:57.340
It does appear that there are things,

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.560
factors in the blood of young members

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.790
of a given species that are lost over time

01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:06.920
in the older members of that species.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.340
I'm not going to give you a tool

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.210
on the basis of these findings today.

01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:14.740
I am not going to tell
you to consume any fluid

01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.493
from any other member of your species,

01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:21.510
our species, for any reason,

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.730
but I do think that it's
important to mention

01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:27.450
that the science is asking questions

01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:31.620
such as what are the
factors within the brain

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:34.900
that allow the young brain
to recover so much better

01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.030
than the older brain from injury,

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:40.990
from all sorts of things,
events, et cetera,

01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:43.790
and what are the factors
in the older brain

01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:45.200
that are limiting,

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.080
and thinking about
identifying which factors

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.590
are going to allow people to
restore cognitive function,

01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:56.350
physical function, wound
healing and so forth.

01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:57.750
It's a really exciting area.

01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:00.200
I mention it not to be sensationalist

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.260
but because it's happening

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.700
and because there's a lot
of excitement about it

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.700
and because I think it's clear

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:12.050
that the young brain and body and blood

01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:16.290
are very different from the
old brain, body and blood,

01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:18.910
and the goal of science is to identify

01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:22.083
and isolate those factors
that make that so,

01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:27.060
such that people who would
otherwise get dementia

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:29.910
or perhaps even have dementia
will be allowed to recover.

01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:34.370
Again, not an actionable
item at this point,

01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:38.630
but one to think about,
perhaps not too long,

01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:39.993
but one to think about.

01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.260
I'm going to close there.

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:45.020
I've talked about a lot of tools today.

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.140
I've talked a lot about somatosensation,

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:51.780
about plasticity, about
pain, about acupuncture,

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:55.840
some of the nuance of acupuncture,
inflammation and stress.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.240
We even talked a little bit
about high-intensity breathing,

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.740
talked about restricting limb movement

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:05.610
to get compensatory regrowth of pathways,

01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:08.090
or I should say reactivation of pathways

01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:09.970
that have been injured or damaged.

01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:10.970
As always,

01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:15.950
we take a whirlwind tour
through a given topic,

01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:18.220
lay down some tools as we go.

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:22.410
Hopefully the principles that
relate to pain and injury

01:36:22.410 --> 01:36:24.700
but also neuroplasticity in general,

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.910
today in the context of
the somatosensory system,

01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:28.310
will be of use to all of you.

01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:31.070
I don't wish injury on any of you,

01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:34.620
but I do hope that you'll
take this information to mind

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.820
and that you will think about it

01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:38.330
if ever you find yourself in a situation

01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:39.630
where you have to ask

01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:41.840
what's the difference
between my perception

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.040
and the actual tissue damage?

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.010
Is injury and pain, is it the same?

01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:45.940
Well, no.

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:48.700
Do I have some control
over my experience of pain?

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.910
Absolutely.

01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:51.810
Does all of that involve taking drugs

01:36:51.810 --> 01:36:53.140
or doing certain therapeutics?

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.250
No, not necessarily.

01:36:54.250 --> 01:36:56.920
There's the incredible
subjective component.

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.300
There also is a need sometimes

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:03.400
to treat the injury at the
level of the pain receptors

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.220
at the site of the wound,

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:09.450
so please take the information,
do with it what you will,

01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:11.070
and in the meantime,

01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:13.400
thank you so much for
your time and attention.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.470
Before we go, I just want to remind you

01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:17.800

as well as any others on the Thorne site.

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:48.063
Once again,

01:37:48.063 --> 01:37:50.000
thanks so much for your
time and attention today,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.763
