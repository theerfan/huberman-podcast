00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.330
- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.258
for everyday life.

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:09.520
[energetic rock music]

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.590
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.100
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.160
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.080
Today I have the pleasure of
introducing Dr. Craig Heller

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.830
as my guest on The Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.820
Dr. Heller is a professor of biology

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.290
and neurosciences at Stanford.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.540
His laboratory works on a range of topics,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.460
including thermoregulation, down syndrome,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.180
and circadian rhythms.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.440
Today we talk about thermoregulation,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.890
how the body heats and cools itself,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.700
and maintains what we call homeostasis,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.810
which is an equilibrium of processes

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.350
that keeps our neurons healthy,
our organs functioning well.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.313
And as Dr. Heller teaches us,

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:50.190
thermoregulation could
be leveraged in order

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490
to greatly increase our performance

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.750
in athletics and mental
performance as well.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.230
Learning to control your
core body temperature

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.500
is one of the most,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.300
if not the most powerful
thing that you can do

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.600
to optimize mental and
physical performance,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.860
regardless of the
environment that you're in.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.470
He also dispels many
common myths about heating

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.940
and cooling the body,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.770
including the idea that putting
a cold pack on your head

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.330
or neck is the optimal
way to cool down quickly.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.570
And in fact,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.510
as Dr Heller tells us, it
actually can be counterproductive,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.790
and lead to hyperthermia.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.210
It's a fascinating conversation
from which I learned

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.540
a tremendous amount of new information,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.750
and we didn't even get into

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.740
the other incredibly interesting
work that Dr. Heller does

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.720
on down syndrome and
circadian rhythms and sleep.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.360
So we hope to have him back in the future

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.460
to discuss those topics.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.293
As you'll soon see,

00:01:39.293 --> 00:01:41.500
Dr. Heller is a wealth of knowledge

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.950
on all things human physiology,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.430
biology, and human performance.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.540
It's no surprise then that he's been chair

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.230
of the biology department
at Stanford for many years,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.300
as well as director of
the human biology program.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.300
So if you're interested
in human biology and how

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.900
to improve your performance in any context

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.370
or setting, athletic or otherwise,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.200
I think you'll very much
enjoy today's conversation.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.033
Before we begin,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.330
I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.560
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.393
It is, however,

00:02:10.393 --> 00:02:12.510
part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.530
to consumer information about science

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.370
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.450
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.310
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.360
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.320
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.890
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.290
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.010
and I can tell you that the
visual system has to go through

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.210
a lot of work in order to main clarity

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.800
of what you see when there are shadows,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.650
when you go into different
types of indoor lighting,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.483
and so on,

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:42.780
and a lot of glasses don't work
well because you put them on

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.980
and then you're in bright
light and you can see fine,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.490
but then you move into a
shadow and then you have

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.080
to take them off and they don't adjust,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.830
or they don't adjust quickly enough.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.750
With ROKA, their eyeglasses
and sunglasses are designed

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.390
with the visual system biology in mind.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.310
So you always see things
with perfect clarity.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.640
The glasses are also terrific,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.980
because they're very lightweight

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.310
and they won't slip off your
face if you're exercising,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.320
if you're running or biking.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.040
In fact, they were
designed for the purpose

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.310
of being able to be worn

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.630
while you're engaging in
those sorts of activities,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.480
or simply working at your desk.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.500
I happen to wear readers
at night when I drive

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.840
or when I work and I
love their sunglasses,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.330
'cause I can wear them anywhere.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.620
And also the aesthetics
of their sunglasses

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.950
and eyeglasses are terrific.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.810
Unlike a lot of other performance glasses

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.220
that frankly make people
look like cyborgs,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.040
the aesthetics on ROKAs
are really terrific.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.220
You could wear them
anywhere you'd like to go.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.360
If you'd like to try RAOKA
glasses, you can go to ROKA.com.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.731
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.000
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.650
that analyzes data from your blood

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.420
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.360
and help you reach your health goals.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.410
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.670
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.730
you can also analyze your
DNA to see what you ought

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.960
to be doing for your
immediate and longterm health.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.820
We hear a lot these
days about optimization,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.000
optimizing hormones,
optimizing your metabolism,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.450
optimizing this, optimizing that,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.490
but unless you know the
measurements of metabolic factors,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.000
hormones, and other things
that are in your blood and DNA,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.760
you don't know what to optimize.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.550
With InsideTracker, it
makes all of that very easy.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.760
They can come to your house to
take the blood and DNA test,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.870
or you can go to a nearby clinic.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.700
They send you the information
and you take those results.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.960
And unlike a lot of laboratories
doing blood work out there

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.230
and DNA tests, they
have a simple platform,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.100
a dashboard that walks
you through your results

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.730
and helps you identify what sorts

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.270
of nutritional or
behavioral or other types

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.640
of practices you might want
to incorporate into your life

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.200
in order to positively
impact your immediate

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.520
and longterm health.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.210
It's a very easy system to use,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.120
and you will gain a ton
of information simply

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.970
by doing that test,

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.370
whether or not you end up making changes

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.140
to what you're doing or not.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.960
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.550

Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.760
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.730
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.810
mineral, probiotic drink.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.340
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.850
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.267
The reason I started using Athletic Greens

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:22.490
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens once

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.890
or twice a day is because it covers all

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.500
of my nutritional bases.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.280
In fact, if people asked
me, and I often am asked,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.150
what supplements should I take?

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.020
I always recommend Athletic Greens.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.560
And in fact, if you were to
take just one supplement,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.190
I recommend Athletic Greens
for the simple reason

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.630
that the vitamins,
minerals, and probiotics,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.070
and adaptogens cover all
your nutritional bases.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.930
And the probiotics
optimize gut-brain health,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.620
which we now know is essential for mood,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.300
for immune system function,
for metabolic function.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.630
It's just got so many
great things in there.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.660
I really do feel better

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.310
when I'm drinking my Athletic Greens.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.627
I mix mine up with some water,

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:00.460
a little bit of lemon juice.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.740
And as I mentioned before,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.020
I'll drink it once or twice a day.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.240
If I travel, I might even
drink it a third time,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.760
just because of the additional
stress on my mind and body.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.070
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.930
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.530
to claim a special offer.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.380
They'll give you five free travel packs.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.360
So these little travel packs
that make it really easy

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360
to mix up athletic greens

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.080
if you're on the plane or in the car.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.090
And they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.470
There is now ample
evidence that vitamin D3K2

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.440
is supportive of the
immune system and a bunch

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.210
of other biological functions
and K2 has been shown

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.200
to be important for cardiovascular health.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.640
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.060
you'll get the Athletic Greens,

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.470
the five free travel packs
and the year's supply

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.410
of vitamin D3K2.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.820
And now for my discussion
with Dr. Craig Heller.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.800
Great to have you here.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.633
- It's good to be here.

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:52.470
- Yeah. It's been a long time coming.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.760
I know that I and many people have a lot

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.900
of questions about the use of cold.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.480
So one of the things that's
happened in recent years

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.660
is that for many reasons,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.110
people have become interested

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.830
in things like taking cold showers

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.810
and taking ice baths for
many different purposes.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.300
Sometimes this is introduced
as just a general health tonic,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.430
but other times people
get specific about how

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.900
it can improve resilience

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.703
or it can improve one's metabolism.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.950
Could you just tell me a little bit about

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.950
what happens when I get into
a cold shower or an ice bath?

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.970
What are some of the basic responses

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.900
at the level of metabolism?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.540
Obviously psychologically,
we don't know exactly.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.870
It'll vary from person to person,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.220
but what happens when I
submerge myself into an ice bath

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.273
if I've never done it before?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.230
- Well, first of all, you
get a tremendous shock.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.760
And what that's going to translate into

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.330
is a bit of a shot of adrenaline.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.300
And I think this is really
the so-called benefit,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.660
but I wouldn't call it a
benefit, of the cryo chambers.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.840
You go into a cryo
chamber and it's a shock.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.840
So you get a shot of adrenaline. So, sure.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.130
You're going to feel
different when you come out.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.930
You've had a shot of adrenaline.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.880
But it doesn't necessarily
translate into any benefit

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.080
in terms of your physiology
or performance, and so forth.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.440
Now if you take a cold
bath or a cold shower,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.020
a couple of things are happening.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.500
One is you're going to
stimulate vasoconstriction.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.470
So if anything,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.250
it's going to make it a
little bit more difficult

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.260
for your body to get rid of heat,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.260
because you're shutting off
your avenues of heat loss.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.560
If you're in a true cold bath,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.470
the overall surface area
of your body is so great

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.840
that it doesn't matter if
you're vasoconstricted,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.350
you're still going to lose heat.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.150
- Okay, so vasoconstriction,
the constriction of,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.820
is it capillaries, vessels
and arteries all constrict

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.710
or just one or two?

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.370
- Well, this is an area of controversy.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.900
In general, when people
talk of vasoconstriction,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.793
they talk of the overall skin
surface, and that is not true.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.190
The primary sites of heat loss,

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.140
which we're going to get into,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.890
are the palms of your hands,

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.650
the soles of your feet, and
the upper part of your face.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.780
And the reason these are
avenues for heat loss

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.900
is they're underlain by
special blood vessels.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.810
And these blood vessels
are able to shunt the blood

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.810
from the arteries, which
are coming from the heart,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.500
directly to the veins,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.990
which are returning to the heart,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.930
and bypassing the capillaries,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.600
which are the nutritive
vessels, but high resistance.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.270
So you can tell when
you shake someone's hand

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.750
what his or her thermal status is.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.450
The hand's hot or it's cold.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.810
- Do you think that's part of the reason

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.995
why humans evolved this
practice of shaking hands?

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:56.828
[Craig chuckles]

00:09:56.828 --> 00:09:58.540
Assessing each other's level of anxiety?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.780
We all know that a limp
shake is pretty indicative

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.310
of something and a firm handshake

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.560
is indicatives of something,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.420
as is the crushing handshake
for that matter, right?

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.960
- Yeah, I really don't know
what the evolutionary origin

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.700
of handshaking is, other
than to get your hand away

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.800
from your weapon, [chuckles] perhaps.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.760
- Right, a couple of questions

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.370
before we get into these
specialized vascular compartments

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.890
on the soles, the palms
and the upper face.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.840
You mentioned whole body immersion,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.420
like into an ice bath or very
cold water up to the neck

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.920
versus a cold shower.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.590
Is there something fundamentally
different about those two,

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.330
besides the fact that they both provide

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.810
their release of adrenaline?

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.310
Is there anything that's really important

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.360
to understand about the difference

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.490
in the physiological response evoked

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.540
by cold shower versus immersion in cold?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.420
- Well, there are differences
that are more physical

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.420
than anything else.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.460
So if you are in a cold
bath and you're still,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.790
you develop a boundary layer.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.760
If you're in a shower,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.750
you can't develop a boundary layer.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.830
- Could you explain what
a boundary layer is?

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.440
- Yes, it's best to explain it in terms

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.040
of a hot bath, 'cause
everybody's experienced that.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.080
You get into a hot bath and, oh my God,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.150
it's really hot, almost painful.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.570
And then you sit down and
eventually it doesn't feel

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.680
so hot anymore, because the still water,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.900
which is close to your skin,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.230
is coming into equilibrium with your skin.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.410
So it's like having a blanket
on you or an insulator on you.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.170
And then if you move around,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.260
you disturb that still water layer.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.910
You feel the hot temperature again.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.800
- I see, so if I were to
get into a cold ice bath

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.050
or very cold body of water
of some kind and stay still,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.457
I'd likely feel warmer at least until I-

00:11:45.457 --> 00:11:47.730
- You're not going to
be losing as much heat.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.563
- I see.
- Right.

00:11:48.563 --> 00:11:49.630
- And then when I move in-
- If you flail around,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.480
if you flail around, then
you're going to lose more heat.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.550
- Got it.
- Yeah.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.710
But I think getting back

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.390
to your original question about benefits,

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.670
you have to keep in mind
whether you're talking

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.370
about aerobic activity
or anaerobic activity,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.270
if you're referring to
performance and exercise,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.490
and so forth.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.020
So if you're doing aerobic activity

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.450
that you can sustain for a long time,

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.670
your production of heat
is rising gradually

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.650
and is being distributed
throughout your body.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.100
So eventually your body
temperature is going to come up

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.270
to a level that's going to
impair your performance.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.210
So the benefit of a cold
bath or a cold shower

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.600
before aerobic activity
is that you increase

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.020
the capacity of your body mass
to absorb that excess heat.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.000
- I see, so could you say that,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.270
in a rough sense, that a
protocol that one might use

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.690
if they're going to
head out for a long run?

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.523
- Yep.

00:12:45.523 --> 00:12:48.640
- Even on a reasonably
warm day, not super hot,

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.730
or maybe it is super hot,

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.010
would be to take a cool
shower before they go run.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.843
Would that be beneficial?

00:12:53.843 --> 00:12:55.840
- Sure, it'll take them longer to get

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.820
to the sweat point and to heat up.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.490
- And what will that translate to in terms

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.003
of a performance benefit?

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.270
- Well, could increase your speed,

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.920
or it depends on how you use that benefit.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.670
Some people are pacers.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.090
They will go at the same pace
and then they will go farther.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.633
Or some people are,

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:18.510
I'm going to say pacers
and regulators and, no, no.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.370
Pacers or forcers.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.700
They will take that
advantage and use it up

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.910
as fast as they can.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.470
So they will go faster, but
not necessarily farther.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.450
- I see, as far as I
know, not many athletes,

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.790
at least not the ones that I know,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.620
are getting into cool bodies of water,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.270
taking cold showers before
they head out to train.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.310
But it sounds like there could be

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.180
a real performance benefit there.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.670
- It could be a benefit.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.730
I know we're going to
talk about our technology

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.750
for cooling, but at one point our,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.020
I don't know if they're using it now,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.640
but our cross-country team,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.770
when they would go to
compete in a very hot place,

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.200
they would do their warm-up
exercises, their stretching.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.820
Then they would extract heat

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.790
before the beginning of the race.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.260
So I like to think of it
as you have greater scope

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.840
for heat absorption.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.310
- Interesting, about
how long would one need

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.590
to take one of these showers

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.250
or cold immersions before
heading out for a run?

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.400
Roughly speaking, we don't
have to get into details,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.650
because everyone's performance level

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.080
and regimen is going to be different,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.070
where they live is going
to be different, et cetera.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.650
- It's not as long as
you think. It's minutes.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.160
- Couple minutes?
- Yeah.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.670
Because what's going to happen is

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.970
as your core temperature goes down,

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.960
you will eventually
shut off your heat loss.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.250
And that keeps it from going below normal.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.970
So if you've warmed up
and your temperature

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.560
has risen by half a degree,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.740
let's say, it doesn't take
more than a few minutes

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.450
to extract that heat
if you're vasodilated.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.970
- Interesting, and what about
for the anaerobic athlete?

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.040
The strength athlete.
- Right.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.020
For the anaerobic athlete,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.950
and let's say

00:14:58.017 --> 00:14:59.033
they're doing several
sets and how many reps,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.940
whatever they're doing,

00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:05.380
their core temperature's
not going to rise that fast,

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.870
because it's only certain
muscles which are being used,

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.870
but the temperature of
those muscles will go up.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.130
- So it's a local effect.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.780
- It's a local effect, right.
- Okay.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.990
So let's say, for sake of today,

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.560
maybe for this discussion,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.220
if we assume that the basic workout,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.783
even though people do variation on this is

00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:26.390
5 sets of 5 or 10 sets of 10.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.223
So for those listening,

00:15:27.223 --> 00:15:32.010
it would be 5 sets of
10 of 5 rep repetitions,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.710
or 10 sets of 10 repetitions,
10 by 10, 5 by 5.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.980
Yeah, so if somebody, let's say,

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.400
is doing a large body compound movement,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.680
like barbell squats where

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.080
there are a lot of large body movements,

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.743
hip hinging, et cetera.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.823
But for instance,

00:15:50.848 --> 00:15:53.350
the biceps are not, they're involved,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.750
but more or less indirectly.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.640
- Right.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.450
- So the effect is going to
be to heat up the quadriceps,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.460
heat up the hamstrings,
heat up the glutes,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.293
this kind of thing.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:02.620
- Right.
- I see.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.790
- And then during rest, that
heat will leave the muscle,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.880
but it's not fast.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.550
And certainly the heat can't
leave the muscle very fast

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.500
while you're working out, because
when the muscle contracts,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.480
it squeezes the blood vessels.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.490
And the only way heat gets out
of a muscle is in the blood.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.970
And your muscle metabolism can go up 50

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.900
or 60-fold during anaerobic activity.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.500
That means the heat production
in the muscle goes up 50

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.040
or 60-fold.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.430
The blood flow to that
muscle cannot go up 50

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.630
or 60-fold.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.234
So you literally have the
capacity to cook your muscles.

00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:39.120
[Craig chuckles]

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.770
- So this is probably an appropriate time

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.880
to just mention briefly what
the underlying mechanism

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.400
of this is.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.240
We will return to the
specifics of what one can do

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.360
to mitigate this heating up,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.300
but could you just
explain the relationship

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.880
between energy production ATP

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.080
and pyruvate kinase and
the role of heat there?

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.080
- Sure. We don't get
something for nothing.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.230
So like a steam engine,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.020
most of the energy in
our food is lost as heat.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.150
So we are roughly about 20% efficient.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.860
So of the energy that
we take in in our food,

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.470
about 20% of that can go into doing work,

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.920
and the rest of it is lost as heat.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.560
Now we're mammals.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.750
We use that heat to keep our
body temperature considerably

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.530
above the environment.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.190
But if you raise body
temperature a few degrees higher,

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.860
you're in trouble, that's hyperthermia.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.780
So individual muscles can
reach hyperthermic limits

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.550
before you might experience
it in the whole body.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:50.550
So to keep you from damaging
your muscle by hyperthermia,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.610
we have fail-safe mechanisms.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.390
And one of those fail-safe
mechanisms is an enzyme

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.600
which is critical for getting fuel.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.440
In other words, the results
of metabolism of glucose,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.870
getting that fuel into the mitochondria,

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.640
which is making our major coinage

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.790
of energy exchange, ATP, okay?

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.870
So that particular enzyme
is temperature-sensitive.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.700
So when the muscle temperature
gets above 39 or 39.5,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.170
it shuts off.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.340
And that essentially
shuts off the fuel supply

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.440
to the mitochondria.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.960
That's when you cannot do one more rep.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.780
- So failure, could we say that-

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.613
- Muscle failure.

00:18:31.613 --> 00:18:33.310
- One component of muscular failure

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.960
is overheating of the muscle locally?

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.793
- Right.
- There're probably

00:18:36.793 --> 00:18:38.000
other things too.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.600
- Well, if you, yeah, if you lack oxygen,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.410
but our oxygen delivery is pretty good

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.070
to the muscle.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.840
If you run out of glucose, yeah.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.250
That's going to impair you.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.220
But the most immediate,

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.870
the most immediate impairment
of muscle activity,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.630
muscle fatigue, in other words,

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.710
is the rise in temperature of the muscle.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.970
- Interesting, I want to talk about how

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.310
that muscle fails locally,

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.500
but I have this burning
question in my mind

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.010
that I cannot seem to answer for myself.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.460
I'm hoping you can answer it for me.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.073
So let's say I'm doing five
sets of five with squats.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.360
I hit fit muscular
failure at a given weight.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.450
And according to what I now know,

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.870
it's my quadriceps and
the muscles associated,

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.100
I mean, with the squat that have failed

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.600
because of this heat triggering,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.700
this mechanism triggered by
heat that shuts off the muscle.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.700
But my biceps are nice and
cool, you're telling me.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.540
They're not doing too much
work. It's only indirect work.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.230
So why is it that I can't set

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.120
the bar down in the squat rack,

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.040
walk over and do barbell curls

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.680
with the same intensity that I could

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.090
if I were to do those barbell curls fresh,

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.030
not having done anything prior?

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.490
- Well, you will still
have a fatigue curve

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.778
with your upper body, okay?

00:19:58.778 --> 00:20:00.740
And that will be influenced by any rise

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.220
in temperature that has been generated

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.130
by your lower body exercise.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.740
- So temperature in both
cases is the limiting factor?

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.120
- It's one limiting factor.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.690
It's one limiting factor.
- I find that amazing.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.740
I find that amazing because
I always thought naively

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.030
that the reason muscles fail

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.950
is because, quote, don't have the strength

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.265
to do another repetition.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.070
That you lack glycogen or some ability

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.600
to access that glycogen.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.020
But of course, we still have glycogen.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.210
It's naive for me to think that,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.540
because if I wait three
minutes and go back,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.960
I can do those repetitions again.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.600
So the glycogen wasn't
restored in that three minutes,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.920
obviously it was there.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.753
- Right.

00:20:40.753 --> 00:20:43.040
- So I realized there might
be other mechanisms involved.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.970
Sounds like heat is, if
not the dominant mechanism

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.270
that prevents more work.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.550
It's one of them.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.140
- It's one of them. And it's a quick one.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.253
It's a fast one.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.450
So it can happen with,

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.870
let's say you are a really
experienced weightlifter, okay?

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.230
You may be doing very,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.580
very high weights with
sets of five or six.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.780
- Yeah, to be clear for the audience,

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.193
I'm not doing very high weights
for sets of five. [chuckles]

00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:13.040
[Craig laughs]
I'm not particularly strong.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.840
I'm not super weak,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.750
but I'm not particularly strong,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.367
but Craig's referring, in
the general sense, to you.

00:21:19.407 --> 00:21:24.407
So why is it that if I
finish a set of squats,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.430
I can't simply cool off
my quadriceps by throwing

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.433
a nice cool towel on my quadriceps.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.540
Why is that not the
best way to go about it?

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.880
- Because your body surface
is a very good insulator.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.890
Okay, we think we don't have fur,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.020
and therefore we're not insulated,
but the skin, the fascia,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.813
the muscles underneath,

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.020
they're all very good insulators.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.260
And that's why I said earlier
that the way the heat gets out

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.610
of the muscle is in the blood.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.530
- So I want to step through
a couple other portals

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.190
by which one might think that heating

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.310
and cooling would be ideal.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.270
And then get back to these.
- Sure.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.188
- Specialized surfaces on the
hands, the feet and the face.

00:22:09.188 --> 00:22:10.021
- [Craig] Yeah.

00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:11.980
- So if throwing a cold towel or

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.720
even ice cold towel on my quadriceps

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.500
isn't going to work or
standing in front of the fan,

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.240
because I'm insulated from that cool,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.360
I can't cool off my blood fast enough.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.720
What about drinking 16
ounces of ice water?

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.553
- Sure. You can do that.

00:22:23.553 --> 00:22:27.818
But you can calculate how much
heat that can absorb, okay?

00:22:27.818 --> 00:22:31.070
And you can't continue
drinking liters of ice water.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.520
You're going to dilute your
blood and have other problems.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.010
But yes, it'll help. Sure, it will help.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:42.010
But it doesn't have the
full capacity you will need.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.560
- What about an ice pack
to the back of my neck

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.670
or to my head or squeezing
the cold sponge over the head?

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.290
I'm deliberately moving
through these options,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.480
because these are the ones
that we see most often.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.240
We were actually just
watching the Olympic track

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.410
and field trials last night up in Oregon.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.860
I'm a huge track and field fan.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.970
And there were a lot
of sponges on the backs

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.390
of necks before, in
between, and after events.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.550
And how good is that

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.900
or how poor is that as a strategy?

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.810
Since now we know that
being overheated locally

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.800
and systemically throughout the body

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.360
is a serious limiting
factor on performance.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.100
- Well, you have to understand something

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.940
about our thermoregulatory system.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.660
We have a thermostat

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.890
just like you have a
thermostat in your house.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.200
And that thermostat is in the brain, okay?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.700
- Do we know the specific site?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.533
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:35.620
- It's called the preoptic
interior hypothalamus.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.350
It does many things in terms
of physiological regulation,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.810
but it serves as a thermostat.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.100
Now that thermostat has
to have information.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.440
It has to have input. Where
does that input come from?

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.550
It comes from our overall body surface

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.090
where we sense temperature, okay?

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.800
So one of the things that can
happen when you're overheated

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.250
is that you can send in a cold
stimulus to your thermostat

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.380
and that sort of like wanting
to cool your house by putting

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.793
a wet washcloth over your thermostat,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.890
it's doing the wrong thing.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.750
So we've actually had experiences

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.040
where we've had people exercising,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.050
getting overheated, and then
cooling the body surface,

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.010
and they say it feels great.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.660
This is fantastic. And their
core temperature is going up.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.180
- Well, I think this is
such an important point.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.050
First of all, I was weaned in a laboratory

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.640
where there were always
battles over the temperature

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.680
in the lab.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.090
So people were always putting
ice packs on thermostats

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.180
or putting fans towards thermostats

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.570
and trying to play this game.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.610
Good to know we were all being foolish,

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.410
even though we were neurobiologists.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.290
Putting a cold towel over
my torso or putting ice

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.000
on the back of my upper back,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.900
you're saying could
actually heat up my core?

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.170
- It'll at least decrease your heat loss,

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.000
your rate of heat loss as

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.900
you're going to raise the
issue a little later, I know,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.160
and that is our natural
portals for heat loss.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.640
So you can think of the natural portals

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.550
for heat loss as our
air conditioners, okay?

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.190
The thermostats in the
brain and the information

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.460
to the thermostat is coming
from the overall body surface.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.770
So what can happen if you, let's say,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.420
cool the torso with an ice vest,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.680
you can actually cause
vasoconstriction of your portals,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.200
your heat loss portals.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.590
So that's what impairs the rate
at which you're losing heat.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.870
It feels good.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.020
Now back to the head,
that's really interesting.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.630
The major blood flow to the brain comes up

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.490
four arteries through the neck.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.110
There's the carotid arteries

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.270
and there's the vertebral arteries.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.110
So when you put a cold
towel around the neck,

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:53.110
you're going to be putting a
cold stimulus into the brain.

00:25:53.137 --> 00:25:55.370
And that's great for protecting the brain.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.130
You want to protect the brain,

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:01.490
but it's also going to make
you feel cooler than you are.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.660
So you will think you're
ready to go again quickly

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:09.230
when you've just essentially
cooled the thermostat.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.540
- This is an important point.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.360
And there's a lot of interest nowadays,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.670
and people doing marathons,

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.110
and even some people do
these ultras, ultra running,

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.443
which I guess is everything
longer than a marathon.

00:26:19.443 --> 00:26:22.410
And last man standing, last man,

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.630
last woman standing kind of things.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.520
So you're saying that if
somebody's hyperthermic,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.450
they could trick themselves
into subjectively thinking

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.910
that they are cooling
off by putting a towel

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.430
and that they can go further,
but their brain could cook?

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.050
- Well, if they stop the cooling,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.950
then that hot blood from the body core

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.410
is going to go to the brain.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.910
- Interesting, well,
it's a bit of a tangent,

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.970
but many people report after
long bouts of exercise,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.790
or even just very intense
bouts of exercise,

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.763
feeling a kind of brain
fog or mental fatigue.

00:26:56.983 --> 00:26:58.210
I assumed that that was due

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.920
to lowered brain
oxygenation post-exercise,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.110
but is it possible that there
is some post-exercise effects

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.890
on heating and cooling of the brain

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.100
that might impact cognition,

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.600
or I should say negatively
impact cognition?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.690
- It's certainly possible
because we know that

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.833
rise in temperature
decreases cognitive capacity.

00:27:20.698 --> 00:27:22.347
I mean, you can experience that yourself.

00:27:22.347 --> 00:27:24.220
You can get on a treadmill,

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.470
and follow your temperature,

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.440
and then just do a simple activity

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.400
like adding and subtracting.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.360
You get to about 39 degrees,
you can't do that anymore.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.180
You can't just calculate

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.900
how long you've been on the treadmill.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.030
- So the phrase cool,
calm and collected is-

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.060
- Cool, calm and collected.
- That's the goal

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.230
in all pursuits.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.650
- That's right.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.100
- So I want to talk about these portals,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.200
because you've mentioned them a few times.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.290
Before I ask about what
the portals are exactly

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.123
and how they work

00:27:54.123 --> 00:27:56.541
and how they can be
leveraged for performance,

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.520
there's a question that

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.393
my neurobiologist self
can't resist, but ask.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.120
We have this thermostat
in the preoptic area

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:05.953
of the hypothalamus,

00:28:05.953 --> 00:28:07.960
which is interesting to me,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.540
the medial preoptic area
is also one that's known

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.680
to be sexually dimorphic,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.830
depending on testosterone
exposure early in life,

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.440
or et cetera.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.220
Although people should just note that

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.620
it's not actually testosterone

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.300
that creates these sexual
dimorphism, these differences.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.070
Actually testosterone
converted into estrogen.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.990
It's actually estrogen is the effector,

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.520
which is fascinating.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.430
Nonetheless, we've got this
area that acts as a thermostat.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.960
And you said it's collecting information

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.880
from the whole body.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.190
Does that mean that there are pathways,

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.540
as the neuroscientists like
you and I refer to them,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.290
as these afferent or input
pathways from the body

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.640
to the preoptic area,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.680
is there a map of our
body in the preoptic area?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.050
'Cause I have to imagine
that you can't have

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.390
the information just coming
from the left shoulder,

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.580
just from the right toe.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.230
It sounds like you need a pretty,

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.500
probably a pretty crude map,

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.200
but that you need a complete
map of the body surface there.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.410
- Well, you don't need a
complete map in the hypothalamus.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.141
I mean, that thermal afferent information

00:29:11.141 --> 00:29:11.974
that you've mentioned,

00:29:11.974 --> 00:29:14.830
it also goes to the somatosensory cortex.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.973
So you know if an ice cube
has touched you on the back,

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:24.050
but that doesn't necessarily
translate into a change in,

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.393
let's say you're shivering or sweating.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.650
So the information that's
going to the hypothalamus

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.400
is more integrated representation
of body temperature.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.710
- So it's sort of an average of

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.800
what's happening-
- It's an average.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.633
- Across the body.

00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:42.610
So if I were to, let's
say I get hot on a hot day

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.227
and Popsicles, when we
were in summer camp,

00:29:44.227 --> 00:29:46.470
I went to a sports camp
near here actually,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.930
and we'd run around like crazy.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.360
And then we'd get into
the shade if we could,

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.770
but we were, Popsicles.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.930
It was all about Popsicles.
- Brain freeze.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.740
- Or the kids were putting ice cubes

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.723
down each other's shirts or something.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.160
But that's an average,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.650
because other parts of
the body aren't exposed,

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.030
the mouth is exposed to the
ice in the Popsicle case

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.680
or the cold cubes are in the hands.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.500
As you said, it feels really good.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.360
- It feels good. Yeah.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.690
- But it sounds like it
feels deceptively good,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:16.650
because in reality could still
be quite warm internally.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.310
- Absolutely. Yeah.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.143
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

00:30:19.143 --> 00:30:21.510
You can feel great and have

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.480
a dangerously hyperthermic temperature,

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.260
but I should say that when
you get into the danger zone,

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.710
things get bad fast.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.650
- What are some of the
symptoms that people could be

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.300
on the lookout for for hyperthermia?

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.140
- Essentially, it's almost ironic that

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:42.140
if individuals are
transitioning into heat stroke,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.613
they actually vasoconstrict
and they stop sweating.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.320
And that's a pathological situation.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.130
I couldn't begin to explain it.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.980
But essentially you are
just feeling exhausted.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.333
You're feeling miserable.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.130
The heart rate is very high.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.363
Your heart rate goes up as
your core temperature goes up,

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.883
called cardiac drift.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.933
So you just feel rotten.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.440
But that's why since

00:31:20.455 --> 00:31:23.250
it's not a danger signal that
you can translate immediately

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.940
into, oop, I'm going into heat stroke,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.150
that's why people can
overcome their bad feeling

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.590
with motivation to continue
going, to work harder.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.590
So there've been a number of
high profile athletic deaths

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.160
due to heat stroke that
were during practice.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.390
Not in competition when people
are really trying to do it,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.920
but in practice,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.520
which shows they were
just motivated to push.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.920
- So let's talk about
these magnificent portals

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.730
that not just humans,

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.830
but other animals,
mammals are equipped with.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.370
So if putting cold on
the neck or on the head

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.463
or on the torso is not optimal,

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.480
what is optimal?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.060
And maybe walk us through a theory as

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.320
to why we would have these
portals located where they are.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.950
And then we can talk about how one

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.200
might leverage them for performance.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.200
- Okay, where the portals
are, are in the glabrous skin,

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.440
big word, okay?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.120
Glabrous just means no hair.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.620
So it's the hairless skin.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.060
You say, well,

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.010
most of my body is without hair.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.920
No, most of your body has hair follicles.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.900
We are mammals, mammals have fur.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.910
We've lost the fur,

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:45.160
but we still have that
hairy skin phenotype

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.590
all over our body, except,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.140
except for those skin surfaces

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.920
where our mammal
relatives didn't have fur.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.020
So the pads of the feet.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.980
And for the primates,
upper part of the face.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.300
For rabbits, no portions of the ears,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.458
the inner surfaces of the ears-

00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:04.291
- Ah, never thought about that.

00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:06.840
For bears, the tongue.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.040
Bears have big tongues,
huge tongues. [chuckles]

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.920
- I didn't know that either.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.695
I haven't been that close to a bear yet.

00:33:14.695 --> 00:33:16.250
- Haven't had a leaking match with a bear.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.540
- Not yet. No.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.540
- So anyway, our mammalian
relatives can't lose heat

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.540
over their overall body surface.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.210
So probably very early on
in mammalian evolution,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.650
they evolved these special blood vessels

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.230
in the limited surface
areas that don't have fur.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.890
And as I said, what
these blood vessels are

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:42.190
are shunts between the
arteries and the veins.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.570
Arteries and veins are both
low resistance vessels.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.500
So you can have high flow rate.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.270
Capillaries, which normally
are between arteries

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.050
and veins are high resistance

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.280
because they're very tiny, okay?

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.620
- Is it fair to say that

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.314
what I was taught is that blood flows

00:33:59.314 --> 00:34:01.680
from arteries, then to capillaries,

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.167
and then to veins, and
then back to the heart.

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.970
So it's sort of like from
the heart through arteries,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.780
then through these little capillaries,

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.100
which are like little
estuaries and streams and then

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.750
to the veins, back to the heart.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.330
Is that generally true?
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.524
- Okay, so what I learned in
basic physiology is still?

00:34:16.524 --> 00:34:17.357
- Is still-

00:34:17.357 --> 00:34:18.750
- I wouldn't get an F in your class?

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.830
- No.
- Maybe a D or C,

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:21.663
but not F.

00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:24.050
- So that's excellent.
- Okay.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.560
And so you're saying that in this glabrous

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.323
or beneath the glabrous skin.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.930
- There are these shunts.

00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:33.900
- And those go directly
from arteries to veins?

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.729
So you skip the

00:34:35.729 --> 00:34:36.990
capillaries-
- Capillaries, yep.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.230
- And is it actually,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.580
as long as I'm, say that in the skin,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.943
when I feel the pads of my hands,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.070
how deep to the surface
do these vessels reside?

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:54.070
- They're below the,
obviously the epidermis.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:00.150
So if you are warm and you look
at the palms of your hands,

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.380
they are fairly red and the
backs of your hands aren't.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.810
You don't have these vessels
in the backs of your hands.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:11.810
Now if you take a glass,
like a water tumbler, right?

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.720
And you grab it, you can see
if you squeeze a little bit,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.990
the hand goes white.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.570
That's because you've
shut off that blood flow.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.720
- Oh, interesting. I'm going to
do that little home experiment.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.280
- So if you're bicycling on a hot day,

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.900
you don't want to to be grabbing
your handlebars all the time.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.800
You want to periodically. [chuckles]

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.650
- Well, this is important.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:35.350
I know you're privy to
some really amazing results

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:36.183
that we're going to talk about,

00:35:36.183 --> 00:35:37.720
but I actually heard you say this

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.510
during this lecture
recently that Stanford held

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.290
about human performance
that we were both part of.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.270
And you mentioned this,

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.820
that if you're cycling
and you're working hard

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.840
and you want to be able to do more work,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.790
we now know why you want to
remain cool in order to continue

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.660
to do work, and if you get too warm,

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.230
that's bad, that gripping
the handlebars too tightly

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.200
will actually limit your performance.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.033
- Right.

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:03.270
- And that's probably
also true on the Peloton

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.330
or any other kind of device or the skier

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.600
or anything like that.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.433
- Right.

00:36:07.433 --> 00:36:09.510
- So loosen the grip,
or if you safely can,

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.480
you want to actually expose
your hands to the world?

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.250
Now what about for people wearing gloves?

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.280
What about the,

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.270
to me that just seems crazy based

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.630
on everything you're telling me.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.430
- Well, gloves definitely
impede heat loss from the hands,

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.060
just as socks impede heat
loss from the feet, okay?

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.530
So if you want to maximize your heat loss,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.490
you want to have as thinner
protectors as possible

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.780
on your hands.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.480
And of course the feet
are more problematical,

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.870
because you have to be
using them in certain ways.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:39.703
- Some people run barefoot.

00:36:39.703 --> 00:36:41.430
- Yeah. Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.760
That's become somewhat popular.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.020
It seems like it kind of came and went.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.850
They had those toe shoes things,

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.193
but they looked so ridiculous
that I think most people

00:36:49.193 --> 00:36:50.300
just were willing to take

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.740
the performance hindrance
of regular shoes.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.870
- Actually we had a track
coach here at Stanford

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:59.390
who for a while was famous
for introducing training

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.320
without shoes, running.
- Interesting.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.760
- And he thought it was
because it changed the posture

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.920
of the runner.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.840
And I think it was just due to the fact

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.210
that he was increasing the capacity

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.600
of his runners to lose heat.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.030
- Interesting, yeah, so heating up

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.380
at the level of the hands obviously

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.400
is going to hinder performance.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.860
So how about with running?

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.070
I noticed, I ran cross country
briefly in high school,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.080
and not particularly well at that,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.580
but that we were told to run as

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.780
if we were holding crackers

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.830
in our fingers or something
like very lightly,

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.010
and to keep hands kind of loose.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:32.620
So running like this would actually

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.660
be more beneficial performance
than, or gripping a phone,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.060
which is probably what most people

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.710
are doing nowadays, right?

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.860
- Right.
- Interesting and-

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.010
- Once, I'll tell you a
experience I had once.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:44.960
I was in Alaska

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.590
in the winter and I went out running

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.410
and I absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.560
And I realized this after
a short period running,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.780
because the backs of my hands
were aching from the cold,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.410
the palms of my hands were
sweating and were hot.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.950
- Oh, amazing. Amazing.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.780
So these compartments are a real thing.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.807
And you mentioned the
upper half of the face-

00:38:05.807 --> 00:38:09.090
- The upper part, that's
where our primate ancestors

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.390
don't have fur.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:11.640
- And the bottoms of our feet.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.100
So let's just take a
moment and talk about some

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.860
of the more amazing results
that have been associated

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.650
with proper cooling of these
glabrous skin surfaces.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.140
- Let me introduce one more thing.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.270
- Sure.
- Because you asked earlier

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.160
about the pouring of
water on the head, okay?

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.440
One of the things which
is not appreciated fully

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.110
is that the blood

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.520
which is perfusing these
special blood vessels

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.750
in the face above the beard line,

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.313
that's the non-hairy skin,

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.250
that blood then returns in the
venous supply to the heart,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.240
but it actually does it
in a very strange way.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.363
It actually goes through what are called,

00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.270
I'm blocking on the name now.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.220
- Take your time.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.530
- These are blood vessels that
go through the skull, okay?

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.790
And that's why the scalp bleeds a lot

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.610
if you cut the scalp.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.830
And these blood vessels which are called,

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.900
I want to say emergent,
but it's not emergent.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.640
It's a word that means leaving.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.610
These blood vessels were primarily thought

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.330
to be ways that blood
is leaving the brain.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.450
But when you're overheated,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.240
the direction of flow in
those blood vessels reverses.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.240
So the cool blood that's coming
from your facial region goes

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.920
into that circulation and actually

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.310
is a cooling source for the brain.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.120
So you can cool the brain.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.920
You can have a cooling effect on the brain

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.950
by pouring water on your head.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.110
- Interesting, so that practice,
which we, at least for me,

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.500
I most commonly associate
with combat sports,

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.550
where the fighter goes to their corner.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.960
They usually sit down on a stool,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.310
unless they're trying to
do some mental warfare

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.360
from the corner, in which case,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.330
they don't even take a seat.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.421
And their corner crew

00:40:08.421 --> 00:40:10.590
will squeeze a glove, excuse me,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.493
a sponge full of cold water over them,

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.470
that you're saying is somewhat effective

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.550
in cooling the brain?

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.780
- Yeah, it's one of the natural mechanisms

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.420
for cooling the brain.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.710
- I want to return to this
at some point as well,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:27.550
but is there any known
benefit to cooling the brain

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.110
in terms of offsetting physical damage,

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.500
offsetting the negative
effects of concussion.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.670
Because one of the reasons why fighters

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.343
will often get, on the back,

00:40:38.343 --> 00:40:40.040
a cold item on the back of the neck

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.150
or on the head is not
just to cool them down,

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.500
but the theory is that
it might offset some

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.543
of the damage of neurons.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.790
- I just can't comment on that.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.470
I'm aware of those ideas,
but they're controversial.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.630
One of the things that
you want to do for injury

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.930
to the brain is to decrease swelling.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.250
And one of the ways that
you decrease swelling

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.823
in many parts of the body is to cool.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:14.110
It decreases inflammation.
It decreases the blood flow.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.600
So I think it's a really interesting topic

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.820
and it's something that
should be investigated.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.450
It's kind of hard to investigate.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.620
- Yeah, interesting. Okay.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.440
So I hear these stories.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.730
And I've seen the data.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.560
So I believe the stories.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.560
Maybe tell us a story about
an observation that your group

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.880
has made with respect
to anaerobic exercise

00:41:43.775 --> 00:41:47.310
and proper cooling of
these glabrous surfaces.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.900
And we can talk about the technology.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.604
Maybe give us the dips example first.

00:41:52.604 --> 00:41:53.760
- Okay.
- So of course,

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.280
I think most people
are familiar with dips.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.953
You're supposed to, I guess-
- Raise and lower your body.

00:41:57.953 --> 00:41:59.080
- Yeah, raise and lower your body,

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.470
raise and lower your body mass usually

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.580
with your legs dangling down.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.230
Sometimes people strong enough
to attach a weight there

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.110
and they'll do, it's essentially

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.706
a compound upper body exercise.

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:09.539
- Right.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.630
- One dip would not be
particularly impressive

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.690
for most people.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.350
100 would be very impressive.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.260
20 would be impressive
for some, et cetera.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:24.060
What happens when a skilled
athlete comes in and does dips

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.180
for multiple sets.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.780
And then what happens when
they cool properly using

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.483
the glabrous skin surface?

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.610
- This was a story that occurred early on

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:34.960
in our investigations

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.550
when we first made the
discoveries that cooling has

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.690
a benefit to increase your work volume,

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.080
your capacity to do more reps, okay?

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.137
So the word got over, I think,

00:42:47.137 --> 00:42:48.993
to the 49ers camp.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.720
And one of their players, Greg Clark,

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.110
who was a tight end at the time.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.313
He had been tight end at Stanford.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:00.300
He decided, or I don't
know if he was asked,

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.020
or what, to come over and check it out.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.417
So Greg came over and we said,

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.630
"Greg, what are you good at?

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.900
What activity do you like to do?"

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:10.890
He said, "Dips.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.480
I can do a lot of dips.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.290
I can do 40 dips in a first set.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.980
And I can probably do five sets.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.190
That's a usual workout for me."

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.460
And we said okay.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.860
So he came over to the gym one day

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.490
and that's exactly what he did.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.680
He did 40 dips the first set,

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.630
and then maybe 25 and 15 and down, down-

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.370
- Do you recall roughly what kind

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.130
of rest periods he was
taking between sets?

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:40.060
- Yeah, we standardized the
rest period to three minutes,

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.940
because that's what we had set
on for cooling as the injure-

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.980
- That's a good long rest period.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.240
- Yeah. It is.
- It's still a lot dips.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.240
- Yeah, it's actually a longer rest period

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.110
than many people would
prefer during workouts.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.943
They want to make the most of the time-

00:43:54.943 --> 00:43:56.860
- Not me. I prefer to take as much rest

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.790
as I possibly can, yeah.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.120
- So several days later he
came back and his first set,

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.100
he did, I think, maybe
42, a little bit better,

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.030
but now people were standing
around and watching.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.053
So there was a little
impetus there to show off.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:15.850
So then his second set was,
I don't remember the numbers,

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:19.730
but very much above the
second set on the control day.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.760
This was after we cooled his-

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.483
- Okay, so when is he doing the cooling?

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.330
- He's sitting down and putting his hands

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.900
in the devices that we had built,

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.800
which were cooling the palms of hands.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.450
- For how long does that cooling take?

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.520
Can he do it inside of a
three-minute rest period?

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.690
- Yeah, that's what we were doing.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.910
We standardized the interval
for resting or cooling

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:42.560
to three minutes, okay.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.850
But the point is he got to his fifth set

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:48.180
and all of the sets were above

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.590
what he had done on the previous day.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.340
And he said, "I'm not tired.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.950
I can do another set."

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.370
And then I can do another set.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.670
I can do another set.
I can do another set.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.520
So from one day to two or
three days later with cooling,

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.500
he doubled the total work volume.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.720
He doubled the total number of dips.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.210
- By adding more sets and
more repetitions to each set?

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:17.210
- Right, so then he kept coming
back for four more weeks,

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:18.950
twice a week.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.030
And by the end of that month,

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.870
he was doing 300 dips.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:25.790
- Wow. So what percent-

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.401
- So he tripled.
- He tripled.

00:45:27.401 --> 00:45:30.470
- Tripled, and so here
is a professional athlete

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.280
at peak physical conditioning,

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.890
and he triples what he can do.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.083
- Amazing, and in terms
of his ability to recover,

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.120
was that explored or discussed at all?

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.570
Because my understanding is
that if we cause enough stress

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.690
to a muscle during anaerobic training,

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.030
we provide the stimulus
for compensatory regrowth,

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.870
et cetera, but if we do more work,

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.250
we essentially scale up
the amount of recovery

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.730
that's needed or the recovery time.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.160
I'm very curious about whether
or not he needed longer

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.980
to recover between these
super-performing workouts?

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.540
- That's very interesting.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.770
That was a major discovery,

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:13.490
which we didn't realize we
were making at the time.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.560
There is this phenomenon
you're referring to

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.060
as delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.380
And this is due to those little
micro tares, and so forth,

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.360
that are happening as we extend

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.360
our workout capacity volume, okay?

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:34.220
So we've had this experience
so many times that an athlete

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.270
or anyone will come in to
the lab and they will exceed

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.260
what their previous goals were,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.160
their previous expectations.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.857
And I can always see the words
coming out of their mouth,

00:46:44.857 --> 00:46:47.690
"I'm going to be so sore tomorrow."

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.320
They never are.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.153
- Interesting.

00:46:50.153 --> 00:46:53.410
- And we've actually demonstrated
that with a naive group.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:58.170
We had a class, a physical
conditioning class.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:03.010
And we had half of the, the
first days of the class,

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:07.210
we had to establish their true
capacity, what they could do.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.290
So these were pretty heavy
workouts for these new recruits.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.880
And we gave half of them the benefit

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.180
of cooling and the other half not.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.350
And then we had them record
their subjective levels

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.220
of delayed onset muscle soreness.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.460
And those that were cool,

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.920
didn't have significant muscle soreness.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.420
- Amazing, and I know there
are also published results,

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.000
and we will provide links to some

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.020
of these papers for people
seeing similar effects,

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.820
I should say, similar
performance enhancing effects,

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.130
using bench presses, the
bench press, or pushups,

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:42.750
or other sorts of things.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.330
Maybe you could give us
an example from the realm

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:50.050
of endurance work or aerobic
work, running, cycling,

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:51.720
things of that sort.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.460
- Well, one of the problems with,

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.460
for us, is that our equipment
now is not really portable.

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.540
I mean, it's portable in
the sense that you can carry

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.010
it to the gym or to the football field.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.039
- But you're not going
to run or run with it.

00:48:05.039 --> 00:48:07.024
- But you're not going
to run with it, right.

00:48:07.024 --> 00:48:07.857
- Or equip a bicycle with it.

00:48:07.857 --> 00:48:11.320
Although when are the cooling
handles on bicycles coming?

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.153
- That would be good,

00:48:12.153 --> 00:48:15.810
but one itinerant activity is golfing.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.079
And people have put it
on their golf carts, and-

00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:20.950
- Do people really heat
up that much in golf?

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:21.783
- They do.

00:48:21.783 --> 00:48:23.140
- Not to be disparaging of the golfers,

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.300
but the way I conceptualize golf,

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.610
it's like a swing and then a walk

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.530
and then a cart ride and then a meal.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:31.770
I probably just offended
all the golfers out there.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.400
- Well, one time we were doing work

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:39.030
for the Department of Defense.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.620
And they wanted to check it out,

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.770
whether or not what we were
doing was really worthwhile.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:45.720
So they sent out a team of

00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:51.560
special ops soldiers to be
our subjects and test it out.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:56.090
They were here for a week.
So they that was a fun week.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:57.920
- Yeah, I do some work with those guys.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.140
They're hard driving guys.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.690
They also know how to have fun.

00:49:02.547 --> 00:49:04.950
But yeah, they definitely have,

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.750
if they have an off or a quit switch,

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.440
it's buried deep within
their nervous system.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.690
They don't like to hit that quit switch.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.340
- So the guy who wrote the final report,

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.710
he gave an addendum to the
report and he said, "Well,

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:20.810
I'll tell you this.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.720
After I've gotten home,

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.300
it's added that technology,"

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.820
they took the technology with them.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.170
They wanted to keep it.
- Oh, Yeah.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.370
That sounds about right.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.660
- And using it, it has added 20 yards

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.220
to every club in my bag.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.300
And that's no effin' small deal.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.180
- Wow, so it's allowing
people to hit further,

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.340
hit their golf ball further?
- Right. [chuckles]

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.150
- Interesting. All right.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.703
So for the golf players out there,

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.480
that's the reward you get back from Craig

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.233
for all my little knocks on golf.

00:49:55.246 --> 00:49:56.130
I don't have any knock on golf.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:59.720
I just don't think about it
as a sport where heating up

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.020
is a limiting factor.

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:05.000
So since they're getting
more out of their drive,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.350
what do you think's going on there?

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.643
- Well, they can be heating up.

00:50:08.643 --> 00:50:09.804
- And they wear gloves, right?

00:50:09.804 --> 00:50:11.930
- They're wearing glove on
a hot day, and so forth.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.700
But let me just tell you
one more serious story

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.400
about golfers and that is individuals

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.450
with multiple sclerosis

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.760
are exceedingly temperature-sensitive.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.820
- I didn't know that.
- So they may still be mobile,

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.060
but they have to stay in cool locations

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.260
and not increase their
exercise to any great extent.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.450
But we've had subjects
with multiple sclerosis

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.590
who have just essentially put the device

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.580
on their golf cart and
they're back out playing golf

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.570
in the middle of the summer.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.690
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.010
- That's great.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.230
Anything that allows people
to have normal levels of

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.680
livelihood and recreation is great.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.520
We always think about performance

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.510
at these kinds of like
peak and elite levels

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.690
and pushing harder, but yeah,

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:57.700
anything that allows people

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.490
to be mobile and functional is great.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:04.900
So what's your favorite
example of endurance,

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.820
and feel free to give us the extreme one

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.520
and then we'll talk about averages

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:10.580
to make sure we're thorough

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.900
about averages versus exceptions.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.760
- Right. We haven't
done a lot in the field.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.700
I mean outdoors.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:22.320
Most of our endurance
has been in a hot room

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.100
with treadmill work, and so forth.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.410
So the very first experiment we had,

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.340
I think, maybe 18 subjects
just off the street.

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.140
Maybe we just recruited
people in the hallways,

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.520
come on in and do this.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.930
And what we found is we could,

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.930
for this group with one trial
with and without cooling,

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.650
we could double their endurance,
walking on the treadmill,

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.010
walking uphill on the
treadmill in the heat,

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.400
like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature,

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.600
40 degrees centigrade.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.970
- So what does the experiment look like?

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.120
You're having people walk on
an incline. It's really warm.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.700
Some people are just going to
hit the quit button and say,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.010
I've had enough and get off the treadmill

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:00.560
with proper cooling.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.560
When are they doing the cooling?

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.270
- They're doing it continuously.

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.570
- I see.
- Because in the laboratory,

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:10.500
we can suspend devices from
the ceiling, for example.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.290
Now we do have prototype wearable devices.

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:18.290
We did them in response to
emails from Ebola workers

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:22.010
a number of years ago in Sierra Leone.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.170
They said, "We've read about
your work with athletes.

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:25.510
Can't you do something for us?

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.650
I mean, we're in the
personal protective gear,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.860
and we can't be in the
hot zone for more than 15

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.550
or 20 minutes."

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.800
So that was started us on the challenge

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.913
of developing wearable systems
that could go under the PPE.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.820
We've published that work now, but-.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:42.140
- That's great, and I'm guessing

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.610
the military special operators
that are out in the desert

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:46.690
and other locations are probably excited

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.990
about this technology.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.205
- Well, once they get it.
- Once they get.

00:52:50.205 --> 00:52:52.050
It's coming, it's coming.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:55.640
Yeah, I think some people might wonder,

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.790
if there are all these studies

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:59.230
and there are these incredible
results over the years

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:00.640
on why haven't we heard more about it?

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.960
And I will ask your
opinion on that as well.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.970
But I'll just editorialize a little bit.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:09.500
Is that the best laboratory work

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.090
in its practical applications

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:13.913
oftentimes requires many studies.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:19.440
And oftentimes there isn't
a portal, so to speak,

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.180
to get that information out
into the technology sector.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.780
So there is a company that's
developing this technology

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.480
for people to use, to purchase and use.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.470
You might as well just tell us now,

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:33.410
what is the name of that company?

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.870
And do they have a website?

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:36.250
People are going to want to know

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.210
where can they get this
magical technology?

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.040
And is there a poor man's
version of it as well?

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.270
- Well, the company is
Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A,

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.947
and the website is www.coolmitt.com.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.980
So CoolMitt is just
C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:58.260
- It's a great website.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.150
When I went there, it says that right now,

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.700
the technology is only available

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.060
to professional sports teams and military.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:04.893
Is that true?

00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:05.990
- Well, where we stand now

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.720
is the new version of the technology

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.660
is sort of in beta test versions.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.560
We got it into the hands of people

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.550
who had used the technology before.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:18.300
So there's NFL teams that are using.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.060
There's college teams. There's Olympics.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.093
There's the Navy SEALs,

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.690
Major League Baseball, the NBA,

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.480
the National Tennis Association.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.940
They have locations where
now they are trying this out

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.600
and reporting back, how's it working?

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.560
How could you change it?

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.900
How could you improve it? And so forth.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.660
So that's where we are.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.940
But on the website,

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:47.000
you can actually sign up for
being one who will be able

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.720
to get one [chuckles]

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.550
when they are finally manufactured.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.970
They're now being made
in fairly small lots,

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:56.160
because you want to change
things as you realize how

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.090
it can be improved.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.460
- Yeah. This is Stanford after all.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.470
You want to get the technology right.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:03.290
I like to joke that one of
the reasons I like being

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:04.580
at Stanford so much is that,

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.310
not only are my colleagues amazing

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:07.680
and they're so forward thinking,

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.330
but they're all perfectionists.

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.320
And so that the perfectionist mindset

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.960
is it has to be perfect before
it can go live, so to speak.

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.440
Well, I think there will
be a lot of interest.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.910
Let's talk about the technology in

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.230
a little more detail for a moment.

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:25.270
And then let's talk about
whether or not cruder forms

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.870
of that technology exist
either for sake of safety

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:29.173
and/or performance.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:34.460
So what is, the CoolMitt,
as I understand is

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.670
it's a mitt, it's a glove.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.610
You put your hand into,

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.400
you hold on to a surface.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.330
And that surface cools your hand

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.160
and thereby through
this specialized portal,

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.627
cools your core body temperature

00:55:47.627 --> 00:55:50.090
and all the muscles of the body.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.240
Subjectively, if I were
to do this right now,

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.300
would I think that it was ice cold

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.300
or would I think it was just cool?

00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.550
- Just cool.
- I see.

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:01.630
- Ice cold is too cold.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.100
So people always ask, well,

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.840
why can't you just stick your
hand in a bucket of ice water?

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.150
It's too cold.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.520
What that does is that causes reflex,

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.880
a vasoconstriction of the very
portals that you're trying

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.620
to maximize the heat loss from.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.867
So you stick your hand in cold water,

00:56:18.867 --> 00:56:20.330
and when it comes out, it's cold.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.100
- You just sealed up all the heat

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.933
in your body.
- Yeah.

00:56:22.933 --> 00:56:26.410
Right, so what I sort of recommended

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:27.850
to someone at one point,

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.340
they said, "Well, when I'm running,

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.970
can't I just carry a frozen juice can,

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:33.410
and it will gradually melt?"

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:34.310
And I said, "Well, no,

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:37.240
because that's going to
decrease the heat loss

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.073
from that hand.

00:56:38.073 --> 00:56:40.544
But if every couple
minutes you switched hands,

00:56:40.544 --> 00:56:41.720
[chuckles] it might work.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.310
- Well, I have a feeling that there

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:46.790
are people now doing that
as well as trying this.

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:51.590
So how long, in the CoolMitt
at the proper temperature,

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:55.460
how long are people putting
their hands into the Mitt?

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.330
- We, once again, had just
standardized them three minutes.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.280
And part of the reason for that is that

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.230
the rate of heat loss is

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.640
an exponentially declining curve, okay?

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.640
And three minutes sort of gets
the best part of the curve.

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.280
So you can go longer and get more benefit,

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.870
but the biggest bang for the buck

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:18.550
is in the first two, three minutes.

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:22.190
- Okay, you mentioned a number
of impressive organizations,

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.560
sports teams, and military
that are using this.

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.360
This is not something that I typically see

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.120
on the sidelines of games.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.220
Although to be honest, I
haven't looked very carefully.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.320
I'm guessing that they
are probably keeping

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:37.090
the technology somewhat under wraps.

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:38.650
Where, and how are they doing this?

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:40.210
Are they running back to the locker room?

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:41.790
I mean, the military special operators

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:42.623
are doing their thing,

00:57:42.623 --> 00:57:44.400
but in terms of the athletes,

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.460
is it possible, hypothetically,

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:51.070
that athletes are doing
this somewhat incognito?

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.910
- It's possible, but I really don't know.

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:56.420
People have mentioned here at Stanford,

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.060
they don't see the football team using it.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.030
Well, the football team here at Stanford

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:04.770
is mostly playing in cold
weather, cool weather.

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.410
The night games are cool.

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:09.440
Even day games are not
very hot frequently here.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.993
But when they go to a hot
place like Arizona or Utah,

00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:15.650
at least our coach,

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:17.910
Shaw, says that they take it with them

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.190
and that's when they find the benefit.

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:21.260
That's when they use it.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:26.260
- Interesting, so is
there a poor person's,

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.800
poor man or woman's version of this?

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.710
You mentioned the juice
can passing back and forth.

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:33.310
You mentioned cooling the hands.

00:58:34.709 --> 00:58:37.340
A number of people said
to me after learning

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.810
a little bit about this
science and technology

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:43.300
that they've experienced some big effects,

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.410
positive effects of cooling by,

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:47.450
and I confess, I've done this,

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:50.430
taking a package of frozen blueberries,

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:51.400
and just kind of passing it back

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.250
and forth between my hands.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:53.167
Now talking to you,

00:58:53.167 --> 00:58:55.730
I realize I probably
didn't do it long enough.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:56.563
I probably was,

00:58:56.563 --> 00:58:59.580
I was only doing maybe 30
seconds passing it back

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.450
and forth between my hands
and then going back into sets.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:06.380
I did see a performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.950
But I realized I probably
wasn't optimizing the protocol.

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:14.610
If you were going to give
a crude protocol for it,

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:15.750
let's just say for the gym,

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:17.560
because with running,
it's a little bit tricky,

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.700
but what would that look like

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.570
if people wanted to just play with this

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.960
in some sort of fashion?

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.810
- Well, it would be experimental.

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:31.380
- Sure. Yeah, none of
that is very controlled.

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.180
- Your idea of frozen peas is a good idea.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:38.160
And I think since there's
been no actual study of that,

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.870
it would have to be you working out

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:42.910
what is the best for you.

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:46.130
But one way to figure it out is that if,

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:50.420
after you hold the cold peas in one hand

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.390
and you switch it to the other hand,

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:55.180
if someone then comes in, feels your hand,

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:56.920
is it warm or cold?

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.970
If it's cold, it means
you vasoconstricted.

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:04.440
If it's warm, it means the hot
blood is still going there.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.380
Okay. So we do that in the lab.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.740
- And the key is for it
to not vasoconstrict?

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.870
- Right.
- Okay.

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.240
So there's a test out there, folks.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.460
If you're going to try this
in kind of a crude fashion,

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.293
at least until

01:00:15.516 --> 01:00:17.416
the CoolMitt is available more broadly

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.883
to the general public,

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:23.400
you want to assess whether or not

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.066
your palms actually feel cool
to the touch by somebody else.

01:00:28.066 --> 01:00:28.899
And if it does,

01:00:28.899 --> 01:00:30.460
that means you've essentially
shut down the portal.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.680
You're sealing in more heat, which is bad.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.860
What about putting this
cold pack of some sort

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.330
on the face or-

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:40.440
- Or the feet?
- Or the feet?

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.273
I work out at home.

01:00:41.273 --> 01:00:43.160
I don't often work out barefooted,

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.770
but I suppose I could,
like they did in the 70s.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.380
When those guys were
walking around without shoes

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.400
and squatting without
any shoes or socks on.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.770
Could I put my feet on them?

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:54.653
- You could.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.060
If you simply had a water-profused pad

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.750
and you were circulating
cool water through it,

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.243
you could just put your feet on it, okay?

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.380
Part of the problem is
that you don't want,

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.690
if, let's say you have just
a cold pack of something.

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:19.730
The problem is back to
boundary layers again.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:24.200
If you don't have a convective
stream of the cooling medium,

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.000
the heat sink is not as effective,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.660
because there'll be a
boundary layer developed

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.760
between the heat sink
material and your skin.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.360
So that decreases its efficacy.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.490
- I see, maybe we should
just for a moment,

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:39.210
talk about convection,

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:41.410
radiation, and convection,
and just make that clear.

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:43.610
Like if I put my hands,

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:45.850
let's say it's a cold
night and I'm at a campfire

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:48.050
and I take my hands and I
put them out to the fire-

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.520
- You're getting radiation.
- You're getting radiation.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.353
- Right.
- Okay.

01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:52.630
- Right.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:55.210
- And then if it's a windy warm night, no,

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:56.610
I don't know if that's the best example.

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:58.970
Give us a good example of convection.

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.800
- Convection, sure, is in a cool breeze.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.340
The wind chill factor. That's
due to convection, okay?

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:10.210
But in terms of heat
transfer between two objects,

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:13.210
if you have convection of the medium,

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:17.820
whether it's blood on the
inside and water on the outside,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.810
you increase the heat exchange

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:23.100
if you have conviction on both sides.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.580
- Right, so this is why
just planting my feet

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.530
on two packages of froze,

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:29.830
my bare feet on two
packages of frozen peas,

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:33.760
there's really no opportunity
for circulation of,

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.900
and therefore heat transfer.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.570
So it's not really optimal, which, and I-

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:38.880
- But once again,

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.080
it depends on the surface area
to get any benefit at all.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.270
We have a study that we published,

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:49.230
which was investigating
the standard treatment

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.440
for hyperthermia in the field.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.093
And the standard treatment,

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:58.330
as recommended by medical organizations,

01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:00.930
is you take cold packs and you put them

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:03.180
in the axilla, the groin.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.210
- The axilla or the armpit.

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:08.133
- The armpits, the groin, which is-

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.650
- Thin-skinned, lots of vasculature.

01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:14.480
- Right, and the neck.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.760
So what we did is we did studies

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.740
in which we made people hyperthermic.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.860
And then we measured the rate
at which we cool call them

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:27.560
by putting those positions
in those heat exchange bags,

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.790
in the recommended location
versus on the glabrous skin

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:33.980
versus palms, soles, and face.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.530
The cooling rate was double.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:37.627
- Wow.

01:03:37.627 --> 01:03:39.980
- And we put the same ice packs,

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.370
the same cold packs on the heat portals,

01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:47.920
rather than the axilla,
the groin and the face.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.870
- Wow.
- Or the neck.

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:53.320
- Wow, so face, hands and bottoms of feet

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.320
will cool you twice as
fast as putting cold packs

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.000
into your armpits, your
groin, or back of neck?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.850
- So I like to give the analogy of

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.220
if your car is overheating, okay?

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.080
And you have a hose, a garden hose,

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.110
where should you spray
your cooling system?

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:14.960
Should you spray the
radiator or should you spray

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.720
the tubes going in and
out of the radiator?

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.230
Well, the rationale with
putting these cold packs

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:22.160
in the axilla, the groin, and the neck,

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.460
is that you're getting close
to the major arteries, okay?

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.410
Sure. That's going to be effective.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:30.650
But it's much more effective
if you actually increase

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:32.050
the heat loss capacity

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.450
of the radiating surface, the radiators.

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:38.710
- So you cool the hot stuff
heading toward the core?

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.500
- That's essentially what

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.253
the standard operating procedure is.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.610
That you hit the arteries.

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:48.060
- Amazing.
- And the veins.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:48.950
Arteries and veins.

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:52.510
- I'm going to just tell a
brief story that illustrates

01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:56.150
how almost everybody
gets this stuff wrong.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.610
And I'm going to use
that as an opportunity

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:00.300
to ask you about heating,
deliberate heating,

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.120
as opposed to deliberate cooling.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.460
So about four months ago,

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.540
a friend of mine, incidentally,

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.930
a guy who did nine
years in the SEAL Teams,

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.870
really skilled cold water swimmer.

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.770
We went out for a swim in the morning.

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:16.580
I'm not nearly even close to the being

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.780
in the same universe of
his output potential.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.870
We do these swims. I'm familiar with them.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:24.480
I got enough blubber on
me that I stay warm enough

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.100
in the cold Pacific, no wetsuits.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.220
We do the morning cold swim
for about a mile or so.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.940
And we brought with us up a
young kid that I know real well

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.440
that hangs out with us
sometimes and trains with us

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.760
who's got very little body fat.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.030
He's just exceptionally lean,

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.530
despite eating everything in sight, right?

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:47.530
Teenager, great athlete,
great kid, great swimmer.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.140
So we're out there swimming

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.500
and at some point we're talking to him

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.050
and it's clear that he's gone hypothermic.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.320
He's slurring his words.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.570
He's not doing well. So
we get him onto the beach.

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.823
His teeth are turning
yellow. He's quaking.

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:06.250
His saliva is taken on that
consistency that's clear,

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:07.930
like he's hypothermic.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.170
We go to the lifeguard station.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:12.550
Lifeguard says, "Okay,
let's get his vitals.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.383
Let's do all this."

01:06:13.383 --> 01:06:16.453
Meanwhile, trying stand next to him,

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:19.700
and heat him up by heating up his torso.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:24.020
So there we are, pressing
against this guy, our friend,

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:24.990
trying to heat him up.

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:26.413
They get a blanket on him.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.950
I'm realizing he was barefoot.
His face was exposed.

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:32.780
Although we did cover his
head with the blanket.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.750
And he eventually came back.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.740
We got some warm liquids
into him and he was okay.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.730
He was fine.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:38.700
I don't know whether his mother's

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.240
ever going to let him swim with us again.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.800
If I ever disappear and go missing,

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.550
it's because of that incident.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:48.820
Anyway, he did great.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.780
He recovered. He's back in
the water and doing well.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.970
But I realized that pretty
much everything from the point

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:59.470
where we got back on the
beach until he was back

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:01.410
to normal, we did incorrectly.

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:03.240
We heated his torso.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.750
We left his extremities exposed.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.230
And we assumed we were
doing the right thing.

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.100
And the lifeguard is a skilled lifeguard

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.310
at a major public beach.

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:15.500
So I guess the simple question is,

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.980
did we get everything wrong?

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.870
Did we get anything right?

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:21.090
And what would have been the better option

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:24.960
to heat up a hypothermic person in that,

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.850
or similar situation?

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:28.440
- Well, it's interesting you asked that,

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.040
because that is the way we got

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.393
into this area of investigation.

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.860
I worked on how the hypothalamus

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.970
regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology.

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:45.680
And one day we were having a
discussion with a colleague

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.070
in the department of anesthesia.

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:51.990
And he jokingly said to my
colleague, he said, "Yeah,

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:54.610
you guys think you know
so much about temperature.

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.740
I bet you couldn't solve a problem we have

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.430
in the recovery room."

01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:59.890
What's that?

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:01.700
Well, the patient's come out of surgery.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.910
They're hypothermic and it takes us hours

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:06.380
to get them to stop shivering.

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.070
What do they do in the recovery room?

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:09.820
Exactly what you suggested.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:13.123
They put on warm blankets,
they put on heat lamps,

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:18.030
and it takes them an hour or
two hours to get these patients

01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:20.630
to stop shivering, to bring them back up.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.770
So we said, "Ah, it's a trivial problem."

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:24.980
No. It's a hard problem.

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.930
It's a hard problem,

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:29.870
because when you're under
anesthesia, you're vasodilated.

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.590
When you come out of anesthesia,

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:33.640
you're hypothermic and you vasoconstrict,

01:08:34.613 --> 01:08:38.280
and that makes it very difficult
to get heat into the body.

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.440
So we got the idea that, well,

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.840
if we could just take one
appendage, like an arm,

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.930
and we put it in a environment wrapped

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:50.380
in a heating pad and a negative pressure,

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.690
suction, that would pull
more blood into that limb,

01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:55.060
that blood would get heated

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.400
and it would warm the body up faster.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.060
So my colleague built a prototype device.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.440
You couldn't get such a device
into the hospital these days.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.273
[Craig laughs]

01:09:06.273 --> 01:09:09.670
But we were with our
anesthesiologist friend,

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.760
we took it into the recovery room.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.780
And the first thing that
patient said, "No way,

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:17.660
you're not going to put
that on my patient."

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:22.660
But he prevailed and first
patient didn't shiver at all,

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.350
First patient was back
to normal temperature,

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.160
core temperature in, I
think, it was eight minutes.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.310
- Amazing.
- Eight or nine minutes.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.860
- Is this now standard practice

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.530
in hospitals?
- No. No, no.

01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:34.100
- So this is another example where,

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.270
I don't get upset about the,

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:38.990
although it's upsetting
to know that it's not,

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:42.030
but I think that it's
yet another case where

01:09:43.026 --> 01:09:44.820
a fundamental problem exists.

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:49.820
There's a science-based
solution that makes sense

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.150
at the level of physiology,
engineering and practice,

01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:55.940
and yet it's not being done.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.850
- [Craig] Right.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:58.070
- And, I mean,

01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:59.590
that's a whole other discussion as to

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:00.730
what the limitations are.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:01.827
Well, perhaps in,

01:10:01.827 --> 01:10:03.460
and I know a number of our listeners are

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.250
in the healthcare and medical profession,

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.410
as well as military, athletes,

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:08.850
and just also standard
other types of jobs,

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.470
civilians doing other types of work.

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:14.050
It would be wonderful if
people understood this.

01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:15.613
So once again,

01:10:17.186 --> 01:10:20.040
is there a homegrown technology
that people could use?

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.040
If somebody is hypothermic,

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.960
what is going to be the best
way for them to warm up?

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.030
Is it going to be holding
a nice warm mug of cocoa

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.890
or something like that?

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.940
But not too hot, I
guess, is again the idea.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.000
- Yeah, well, actually you can go hotter

01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.900
on the glabrous skin.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.900
- Oh, because it'll dilate?

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:42.560
- Because it takes the
heat away faster, okay?

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.330
But back to the anesthesia,

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:47.760
what you can do is you can use warm pads.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.840
They have them in all hospitals,

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.850
they have circulating
water, perfused pads.

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:54.996
- Hot water bottle type stuff.
- Put them on the feet.

01:10:54.996 --> 01:10:55.829
Put them on the feet.
- So typically they'll

01:10:55.829 --> 01:10:57.970
slide them under your lower
back or something like that?

01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:00.220
- Yeah, put them on the feet.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.660
Okay, sure. That will do it.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.410
But it turns out that we
discovered through this work

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:09.640
that it had nothing to
do with the whole arm.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.440
It was only the hand.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.580
And that's when we came to the realization

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.440
of these special blood vessels.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.190
We didn't discover the blood vessels

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.230
that are described in "Grey's Anatomy,"

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.377
but nobody knew what they were for.

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.180
- And you mentioned bears earlier

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.903
and other hairy animals.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.463
Do they have

01:11:27.463 --> 01:11:29.595
these AVAs as well?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:29.595 --> 01:11:31.020
- And I suppose we haven't defined AVAs.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.740
We've been pretty good about
the no acronyms rule. AVAs is?

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.900
- Arteriovenous anastomosis.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.530
So a connection between the
arteries and the veins. Yeah.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:41.870
- I actually used this technology.

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:43.520
I have a bulldog, bulldog mastiff.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.900
He has a very high
propensity for overheating,

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.760
because they're terrible at dumping heat.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.070
And bulldogs are great
at pushing themselves

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:54.780
to the point of exhaustion or death.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:59.590
It happens, and so now we do
what we call palmar cooling.

01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:01.000
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.750
Where I'll take Costello
and lower him into

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.190
a cool body of water.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.860
Just the bottoms of his paws,

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.510
although I think animals
instinctually know

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:13.720
to do this and will go and
stand in bodies of water.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.173
They don't often lie down
all the way. Some do.

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.060
But they seem to know that's a great way

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.280
to cool themselves off.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.750
- Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah.

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.220
- And they get the advantage

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.900
that their palms and
their feet are essentially

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.020
the same thing.

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.990
- We actually built devices for dogs.

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:31.520
Did you really?
- And tried them on.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.830
I did a lot of sled dogs
and it worked beautifully.

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:39.050
They had little backpacks
with the equipment and pads

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:42.655
on all their feet and
it worked beautifully.

01:12:42.655 --> 01:12:46.190
- Amazing, amazing, along
the lines of heating,

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:50.980
deliberate heating, wearing a knit cap

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.920
is something that you see more
of that on the East Coast:

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.550
people run around Boston and New England

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.190
with a knit cap.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:12:59.023
I've always done that

01:12:59.023 --> 01:13:01.990
at the start of my runs to
try and warm up more quickly.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:04.603
And then I take it off.
I shed layers as I go.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.950
Is that a rational practice?

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.190
The way I just described it?
- Oh, sure.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.023
Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:13:10.023 --> 01:13:11.990
'Cause warming up is important too.

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:14.840
There's a certain amount
of quote/unquote warming up

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.090
that's required to lubricate joints

01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:19.430
or at least to get the sense
that joints are lubricated

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.214
and to be able to move more easily.

01:13:21.214 --> 01:13:22.047
- Yeah.

01:13:22.047 --> 01:13:24.440
- Do you still recommend
that people warm up?

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.840
- Yeah, but I think we're
misled by the term warm up

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.163
as if the major purpose
is to raise temperature.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.010
I'm not aware of any data on this,

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:39.640
but I do think that the major contribution

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.740
is increasing flexibility.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.900
So you're going to avoid
having damage of joints

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.303
and tendons and ligaments and so forth.

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:54.900
But also the ability of the mitochondria

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.900
to produce energy can be
impaired at lower temperatures.

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:01.980
And you have to keep in mind

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.000
that we say our body
temperature's 37 degrees,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.560
but that's not true.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.300
- Yeah. It varies across the day.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.920
- Well, it varies in parts of your body.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.530
I mean, my hands and arms are
not at 37 degrees right now.

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:16.848
They're much lower, okay? [chuckles]

01:14:16.848 --> 01:14:18.490
- So that raises an interesting question.

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:22.520
What is the best way to
measure core body temperature?

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.640
- Well, the best core temperature is that,

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.060
what we use is esophageal.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.730
So we put a thermocouple
up the nose about two feet

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:32.910
down the esophagus.

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:34.880
So that is about the level of your heart.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.258
- Not gym or home-practical, although-

01:14:37.258 --> 01:14:38.091
- No.

01:14:38.091 --> 01:14:38.924
- I don't know.

01:14:38.924 --> 01:14:40.340
Some of those COVID swab
tests go pretty far.

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.170
I can't even imagine going any further.

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:44.253
I felt like my brain was getting tickled.

01:14:45.789 --> 01:14:48.371
- The tympanic is pretty good.

01:14:48.371 --> 01:14:50.170
- So the ear?
- The ear.

01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:52.640
It's not foolproof because you have

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.220
to actually have it aimed
properly at the tympanum

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.800
and frequently what you're getting

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.290
is you're getting sort of a mixture

01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:02.350
of tympanic plus ear canal temperature.

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:04.590
- And for those listening
and for those watching,

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:06.950
the tympanic is not going to be the pinna,

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:08.567
this part of the ear, the
outer part of the ear.

01:15:08.567 --> 01:15:11.870
The tympanic is going to heading
towards the tympanic membrane.

01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:13.720
And yes, I'm sticking my finger in my ear,

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.860
because that's where the
laser would actually have

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.586
to go to measure your temperature.

01:15:18.586 --> 01:15:19.419
- Right.

01:15:19.419 --> 01:15:20.252
- So when we're walking into restaurants

01:15:20.252 --> 01:15:21.390
and other places nowadays,

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.010
and they're shining the
laser at our forehead,

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:23.890
that's probably giving

01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:25.780
a pretty crude readout of temperature.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.470
- It is, but there's much less insulation

01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:31.040
between your brain and your forehead skin

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.520
than there is between your
biceps and your arm skin.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.940
So if you're going to measure
a surface temperature,

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.090
that's where you would do it.

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:42.730
And we do temperatures in the infrared.

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:45.150
We take infrared videos of athletes

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:46.900
and our subjects.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.390
And of course the face lights up.

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:51.340
- Okay, so if we're not,

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.430
I imagine there's going to
be a technology coming soon

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:56.190
where you can point your smartwatch

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:57.475
or your smartphone at yourself,

01:15:57.475 --> 01:15:58.936
and you're going to get a heat map.

01:15:58.936 --> 01:16:00.080
- Right, right.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.530
- If somebody out there
hasn't already invented this

01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:04.850
for the typical folks outside military,

01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:06.110
somebody please invent that,

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:08.880
because I think there's growing interest

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.650
in temperature based on
the work that you're doing.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.490
And also for sake of something
I do want to touch on,

01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:16.540
which is sleep and metabolism.

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:19.440
Although we don't want to open
up those portals all the way,

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.590
because we'd need
several days to cover it.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.363
Okay, so putting on the cap,

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.970
what about some of the helmets and gloves

01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:30.680
that are used in typical sports?

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.640
Do you think that those
can be improved in order

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.780
to improve performance in terms

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.210
of their ventilation ability

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:40.160
or keeping palmar surfaces
open for instance?

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.890
- Well, you mentioned about
the knit cap in cold weather,

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:46.310
especially, and that is significant,

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:50.253
because you do lose a lot
of heat from your head,

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:53.300
but it's a constant heat loss.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.580
It's not variable like your glabrous skin.

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:59.800
So if you decrease that heat loss,

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.723
you're going to be warmer.

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:06.480
So, sure. That has an impact.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.580
Now in terms of helmets,
they should be ventilated.

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.170
I mean, they should have enough space

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:17.210
in them and holes in them
so that air can circulate.

01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:19.540
You don't want to insulate,

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.490
thermally insulate your scalp.

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:25.460
That's going to decrease
heat loss quite considerable.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.430
Just for a resting individual,

01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:30.220
the brain is about 20% of your metabolism.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.180
So that's a lot of heat production.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.990
- Yeah, absolutely, I
realized there was a question

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.550
that I failed to ask earlier

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:41.800
that is burning in my mind now.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.770
And I think is likely burning in the minds

01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:45.783
of some of the listeners, which is,

01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:49.910
so if you do this cooling
in between sets in the gym,

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:52.720
you get this performance enhancing effect.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.110
You don't get the delayed
onset muscle soreness,

01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:56.580
which is great.

01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.120
So presumably the body is adapting.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.310
You're getting better as a
consequence of being able

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:04.720
to do more work per unit
time or to go harder

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.193
in some way of course.

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.070
You get that adaptation.

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:12.660
Does that mean that you see a
performance-enhancing effect,

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.860
even when you don't cool,

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.360
if you've previously done
the cooling workouts?

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.770
So for instance, let's say
I can do 10 sets of 10 dips,

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.367
which I like to think I can.

01:18:21.367 --> 01:18:22.560
But maybe I need to go try.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.040
I dunno if I've done that recently.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.230
I do the cooling.

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:27.410
I cool for three minutes between sets.

01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:32.260
And let's say I get to the
point where I can do 20

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:35.750
for 10 sets, 10 sets of 20 repetitions.

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.393
And then I don't cool.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.020
Will I be able to match

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.477
or approximate my new, better performance?

01:18:42.477 --> 01:18:46.300
- You keep your gains. It's
a true conditioning effect.

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:49.840
You respond to the increased work volume

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.620
by all of those mechanisms you mentioned.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.453
- [Andrew] Amazing.

01:18:53.453 --> 01:18:55.180
- You increase the number
of contractual elements

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.250
in your muscles.

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.700
- Amazing.
- The muscles get bigger.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.533
- Amazing.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.600
- We had an experiment that involved some

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.670
of our female students.

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:08.340
Not athletes, but just regular,
they were freshmen actually.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.510
And the experiment was 10 sets of pushups

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:15.260
to muscle failure with or without cooling.

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.350
- Same regimen, three minutes of cooling

01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:18.680
in between sets of pushups?

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.620
- Right.
- Okay.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:24.620
- Some of those young ladies
reached over 800 pushups.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.870
- Now the total duration of the workout

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.700
could be getting much
longer as a consequence

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.650
of doing more work.
- No.

01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:31.330
- No, it doesn't take you longer.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:34.890
Well, minor, I mean, a
push-up is pretty fast.

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:35.723
- Yeah. It's pretty fast.
- Yeah.

01:19:35.723 --> 01:19:40.120
So you do 10 sets, the
maximum 45 minutes total.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.900
The most-
- That's a lot of pushups.

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.347
- That's a lot of pushups.
- Yep.

01:19:43.347 --> 01:19:45.497
- And so the interesting
thing is they came in one day

01:19:45.497 --> 01:19:48.467
and they said, "Dr. Heller,
you cost us a lot of money."

01:19:48.467 --> 01:19:51.250
"Why?" "Well, we had a
formal dance this weekend.

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:53.340
We all had to buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:54.225
- Nice.

01:19:54.225 --> 01:19:55.058
[Craig laughs]

01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:56.373
It's a good problem to
have. Good problem to have.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.873
Let's talk about steroids,
anabolic steroids.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.110
We're heading into an Olympics.

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:07.270
Every time the Olympics rolls around,

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:10.120
you hear about these cases
of people getting popped,

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.010
as they call it, or caught
for anabolic steroids.

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.470
There are some accusations out there.

01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:16.300
Now they'll be out more.

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:19.880
This'll get handled in the press

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.050
and in the various organizations.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:26.200
Clearly athletes and non-athletes
use anabolic steroids.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.960
And typically anabolic steroids are

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.260
of the testosterone variety.

01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:32.780
There are derivatives, et cetera.

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.900
And those derivatives do different things

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.960
in the anabolic versus
androgenic, et cetera.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.380
But typically the idea is,

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.510
at least as I understand it,

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:43.510
in talking to some of these individuals,

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:47.570
is that they allow people to train more,

01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:49.763
because they recover faster.

01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:53.150
They are able to synthesize more protein,

01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:55.710
because they're basically
getting a second puberty,

01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:57.380
because as we all know during puberty,

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.180
there's a lot of growth of the body.

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:03.450
And of course there are a lot
of negative effects of abuse

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.820
of these things and they are banned

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.870
from various sports organizations,

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:10.170
especially, I should
mention, in combat sports,

01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:13.790
it's especially concerning,
because in combat sports,

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:16.810
a performance enhancement means
that you can harm somebody

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:20.040
more than you would be able to otherwise

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.980
as opposed to in other sorts of sports.

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.924
Just to conceptualize it.

01:21:23.924 --> 01:21:25.900
And I'm not taking a moral
stance on any of this.

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:28.110
I just want to ask you,

01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:33.000
when you compare palmar
cooling to anabolic steroids

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
in terms of gym performance,
what do you see?

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.930
- Well, we do not do research
on steroids, [chuckles]

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.820
but there is a lot of
research in the literature.

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:51.230
A lot of that research in
the strength conditioning

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.360
magazines is not very scientific.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.771
- No.
- Okay?

01:21:56.771 --> 01:21:58.350
- Or it might not even
be scientific at all.

01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:59.183
- Right.
- Right.

01:21:59.183 --> 01:22:02.810
- But we did do an analysis
of reputable papers

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:07.020
and we did find, I think it
was probably eight or nine,

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.730
10 studies on bench press,

01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:12.930
increase in bench press performance

01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:16.210
on steroids or not, okay?

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:18.040
- These were males or females?

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.660
- Well, these were all males,

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.673
but I'll get back to the females, okay?

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:28.450
The bottom line is that in all
of these independent studies,

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:33.450
their rate of improvement was
approximately 1% per week.

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.380
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:38.380
Now I've just told you about studies

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:42.703
in which we've had 300%
increase in a month.

01:22:44.028 --> 01:22:44.970
[Craig chuckles]

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:45.803
So.

01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:49.670
- It's an enormous, enormous difference.

01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:51.970
- So why would you endanger your health

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:54.300
as well as your legal ability

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.320
to compete with such an ineffective tool?

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.780
- Yeah, no, I think it's the notion

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.930
of performance enhancement
is a really interesting one,

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:07.890
because people clearly pay
attention to nutrition.

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:10.860
Sleep is now something
that I think everybody,

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.870
but especially athletes
are paying attention to.

01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:14.260
- Right.

01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.430
- And I predict that
temperature will be one

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:22.120
of the more powerful parameters
that people are going

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.210
to be focusing on.

01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:24.974
- Yeah. That's true.

01:23:24.974 --> 01:23:25.860
- Because of the magnitude of the effects

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:26.960
that you're describing

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
and also because so
much of the variability

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.510
around performance, as you mentioned,

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:35.870
has to do with when you
go to a new environment,

01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:39.410
everyone has their home
environment worked out pretty well.

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:40.910
Sleep well in your own bed at home.

01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:42.660
When you can control everything,

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.633
your performance is always great.

01:23:43.633 --> 01:23:45.770
This is why I think
military special operators

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:48.060
are particularly interesting group,

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.620
because their whole world
is centered around elite

01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.020
and high performance with very high risk,

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:58.260
high consequence under
variable conditions.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.430
The essence of their work

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.950
is variable unpredictable conditions.

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.300
So you mentioned female
athletes and steroids.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.630
I'm curious about this.

01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:09.110
- Yeah, because everybody
has always said to us, well,

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.330
you only use male subjects

01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:14.500
and obviously they have this
testosterone background.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.360
They have higher levels of testosterone.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.240
That's why you get these results.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.810
So we did a comparative study on females.

01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:22.950
We get the same results.

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:26.030
- Impressive, and these are
Stanford athletes or also-

01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:27.290
- No, these were not Stanford athlete,

01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:29.440
they were Stanford students.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.030
But not athletes.

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:34.040
Well, we have done, of
course, work on some athletes.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.460
But in general, we don't
do research on our teams,

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.540
our varsity teams.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.620
So they have their own protocols.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.460
They have their own training program.

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.673
- Yeah. They don't like us
to get too close to them.

01:24:44.673 --> 01:24:46.720
I work with some of these
folks in the coaches

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.797
and they are very skeptical,
with good reason also.

01:24:49.797 --> 01:24:52.030
And the reason I ask is that

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:56.370
when you see these Pac-10 or
Division I college athletes,

01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:58.150
and then you see their peers,

01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:01.330
there's clearly a difference, right?

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:05.053
I mean, they are pedigreed
at throughout, right?

01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:10.380
And more typical folks
also have different goals.

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.240
They may not want to
get infinitely stronger

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.883
or perform more endurance work.

01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:18.240
So I want to ask you a couple of things

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.950
about shivering and metabolism,

01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:23.010
'cause I think they're very interesting

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:25.230
and sufficiently related.

01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:28.340
So my understanding is that shiver

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.610
is an adaptation that's
designed to heat us up.

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:32.740
- Yes.

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.910
- That we have brown fat
that's in compartments

01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:39.710
around our body that
are activated by shiver

01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:41.930
or co-activated by shiver.

01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:46.630
And that shivering is useful
for increasing metabolism.

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:50.810
Is that true? And does it require
that cold be the stimulus?

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:53.310
So two scenarios. I'll
give you an experiment.

01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:56.100
I put someone into cold
water of some sort,

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.560
and then I make them get out
or I have them stand near it,

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.880
and then they start shivering.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.780
My understanding is that their
metabolism will increase.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.940
What if I take someone and
I just have them shiver,

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.170
but they're not exposed by cold,

01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:09.970
it's kind of a deliberate shivering.

01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:14.770
Will that also create a
substantial increase in metabolism?

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:19.220
- Sure, so deliberate
shivering without cold

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:21.683
is essentially what happens
when you get a fever.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.420
Your set point goes up
in your hypothalamus

01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.560
and you actually,

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.800
even though you're a
normal body temperature,

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.110
your thermostat is telling
you you're too cold,

01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:32.430
increase your metabolism.

01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:34.570
So shiver, right?

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:39.190
So, sure, shivering is a good
way of increasing metabolism,

01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:41.750
but it only can take
metabolism up maybe three

01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:43.740
or four times resting.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:44.573
- Okay, but it seems like-

01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:48.170
- Whereas exercise can
take you up 10 times.

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.003
- Got it. All right.

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:51.160
I'm going to ask a couple
of more random questions

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.760
and seemingly random.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.430
Do bears actually hibernate?

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:56.263
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:56.263 --> 01:26:58.230
- The true hibernation?

01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:00.570
- Well, it depends on how you define true.

01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:05.046
A bear, actually, we've
done a lot of work on bears.

01:27:05.046 --> 01:27:06.380
[Craig chuckles]

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.630
- Do you also put the
nose thermal couple down

01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:09.470
in the esophagus?

01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:11.300
- We implant them surgically.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:12.830
- They're anesthetized
when you implant them?

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:13.710
- Yes.

01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:14.543
- Khat kind of bears are these?

01:27:14.543 --> 01:27:15.376
- Black bears.
- Okay.

01:27:15.376 --> 01:27:18.260
- And did this with colleagues
at University of Alaska.

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:19.970
And we're analyzing the data now,

01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:21.070
but what we've done is

01:27:22.473 --> 01:27:25.890
we've had now a total of 18
bears and we implant them

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:29.310
with EEG, EKG, temperature sensors,

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.880
and sometimes we actually
measure their oxygen consumption.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.940
- These are bears in the wild?

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.140
- These are bears in the wild,

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.850
but they're brought in
to University of Alaska

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:38.990
where we keep them in
an outdoor enclosure.

01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:42.610
So they're hibernating in
a nest box in an enclosure,

01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:45.400
and we're recording this
electrophysiological data

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.250
continuously for six months.

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.404
- Amazing. How do I get on this protocol?

01:27:49.404 --> 01:27:50.237
[Craig chuckles]

01:27:50.237 --> 01:27:51.270
[Andrew chuckling]

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:53.560
Craig and I are doing some
work together going forward.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.230
And maybe you can slide me

01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:57.350
onto this protocol too, it sounds amazing.

01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:00.710
- Right now, it's a matter of
just analyzing the gigabytes,

01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:03.890
terabytes of data that
have been collected.

01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:05.920
But anyway, you asked about hibernation.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.080
So bears only go down to about 33,

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.693
34 degrees centigrade in core temperature.

01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:15.450
And that's been argued that, well,

01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:18.290
they can't go lower because
they have so much insulation.

01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:21.110
They're so big, their surface
volume ratio, and so forth,

01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:22.640
and that's not true.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.380
They shiver, so if we have
a day like a minus 40,

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:30.540
which you get up in Alaska,

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.810
they will go through periods of shivering.

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:35.990
And maintain a core temperature on 33-34.

01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:38.700
Now the ground squirrels and the marmots,

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.193
which are smaller animals,

01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:44.380
they will drop down to a body temperature

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:47.670
maybe within a degree of the environment.

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:50.650
So they can go down to one
or two degrees centigrade

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:54.360
just above freezing during
bouts of hibernation.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.760
So they'll stay in hibernation
for seven or eight days

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.720
and they'll come back up
to normal body temperature

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.070
for a day, then they'll go back down,

01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:01.060
and do another about-
- What do they do during

01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.740
that day when they're warming up again?

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:03.739
Do go around-

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:07.260
- They rearrange their nests,
eat, if they've stored food.

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.160
Some species store lots of food.

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.930
Others just depend on their fat.

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:14.810
- A former mentor of mine,
my master's degree mentor,

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:18.600
and a colleague and friend
of yours, Irving Zucker

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.370
at UC Berkeley told me a story once,

01:29:21.370 --> 01:29:23.270
told me a lot of stories,
he tells great stories,

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:24.103
as you know.

01:29:24.103 --> 01:29:26.180
He told me that when an animal comes out

01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.750
of hibernation periodically,

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:31.490
that it's a very dramatic
thing to observe.

01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:33.240
That it's not like they wake up

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.370
and yawn and look around,

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.700
but it's like a complete
epileptic seizure.

01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.430
- Right.
- What what's going on?

01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:40.263
- Shiver.

01:29:40.263 --> 01:29:42.050
- It's just a very traumatic shiver.

01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:44.240
- So at the low temperatures,

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.620
they cannot shiver because
the effect of temperature

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.930
on the conduction of the
nerves and the muscle fiber.

01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:52.150
- So they're shut down basically?

01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:52.983
- They're shut down.

01:29:52.983 --> 01:29:54.350
So there they use brown fat.

01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:55.720
So they activate brown fat

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.070
and then when they get up to
a temperature of maybe 15,

01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:59.870
16 degrees centigrade,

01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:02.670
then the shivering starts and
it gets very, very violent,

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:05.363
but they're still asleep.

01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:08.143
- Do we shiver in our sleep?

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:12.400
- I would imagine we do,
but it probably wakes us up.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:16.190
- Interesting, So the brown
fat is kind of like kindling?

01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:19.610
- The brown fat is a tissue

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:24.040
which has lots of stored
energy, 'cause it's fat,

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.960
but unlike our white fat, our regular fat,

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.810
it also has lots of
these little powerhouses,

01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:32.790
mitochondria, and lots of blood supply.

01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:36.930
So essentially it is a
tissue just to produce heat.

01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:38.300
That's what it's there for.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.300
Now in these hibernators,

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.610
there are big patches of
brown fat at certain locations

01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:46.840
that are critical, like
around the heart, for example.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.810
For us, the brown fat
is sort of distributed.

01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:51.790
So for many, many years,

01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:54.340
it was thought humans
don't have brown fat,

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.600
but indeed we do.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.080
It's just not localized
into discrete fat pads,

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.010
like it is in ground squirrels, marmots.

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:05.910
- I don't know why the phrase
fat pads is so satisfying

01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:08.500
to say, but it is fat pads.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.660
Speaking of fat pads,

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:12.803
I was taught that we have,

01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:15.070
by the internet, I should say,

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:18.130
I was taught by the internet
that we have brown fat

01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:20.280
between our scapulae and our upper neck.

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.460
Is that truly a source of
brown enrichment for brown fat?

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.009
- If you're a ground squirrel.

01:31:26.009 --> 01:31:26.842
[Andrew scoffs]

01:31:26.842 --> 01:31:29.070
- So this is all the drawings out there?

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:32.240
Okay, so what I'm hearing
you say is that brown fat

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.800
is actually distributed in patch-

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:38.480
- In humans, it's distributed
along with other fat tissue.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.120
It's not as discreet.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.920
- So the reason I'm kind of shocked

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:47.580
and amused and troubled by this is

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:52.580
because there is a
somewhat standard protocol

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.660
in the performance,
wellness, whatever world,

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:56.810
whatever you want to call it,

01:31:56.810 --> 01:32:00.210
of putting ice packs on
the upper back as a way

01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:04.520
to stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.130
I'm hearing some inhales of concern

01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:09.100
from the physiologist.

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:10.630
So tell me why,

01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:12.590
it sounds like that's
probably not the best way

01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:14.930
to stimulate brown fat activation.

01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:17.140
- Well, let's put it this way-

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.800
You're not attacking anyone specifically,

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.750
because the whole little believes this.

01:32:21.697 --> 01:32:26.160
- But it may not be
totally facetiae or false.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.610
Think of what that's doing.

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:31.140
If you put ice right there
where your spinal cord

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.840
is close to the surface,

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.460
that's where you're going to
hit the vertebral arteries.

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:39.070
So you're essentially putting
a cold source into the brain,

01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:40.390
to the hypothalamus.

01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:43.360
The hypothalamus is you're too cold.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:47.463
So it is going to turn on
shivering and brown fat so.

01:32:49.190 --> 01:32:50.690
- Would there be a better site

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.093
for sake of activating brown fat?

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.113
Palmar cooling?

01:33:01.124 --> 01:33:03.730
- I can't say because the
activation of brown fat

01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:07.670
is a sympathetic nervous system response.

01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:10.730
So any lowering of core temperature

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:15.260
that will let the thermostat
say you're too cold

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:17.010
is going to turn on sympathetic.

01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:22.010
Now people will have perhaps
different amounts of brown fat.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.110
So newborn have more
brown fat than adults.

01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:27.968
- 'Cause the newborns
can't shiver. Correct?

01:33:27.968 --> 01:33:29.436
- I don't know.
- Okay.

01:33:29.436 --> 01:33:30.269
That's what I read.

01:33:30.269 --> 01:33:32.140
I don't know if that's true.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.920
I read that in what I believe
to be credible sources.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.558
- Yeah, it could be.

01:33:36.558 --> 01:33:40.200
I just don't know, it depends
on if it's really newborn,

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.520
I can agree because you don't have all

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.370
of the motor pathways connected up yet.

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.840
That's something that
occurs in early days of life

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:52.340
and is probably one of the
functions of REM sleep,

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.840
which infants have a lot of.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.210
- Right.
- Okay.

01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:59.590
But how to activate brown fat

01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:02.920
if you are consistently exposed to cold?

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:07.110
So if you live in the Arctic
and you go out jogging

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:08.120
in the winter,

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.090
maybe that will increase the
amount of brown fat you have.

01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:13.960
If you live in the tropics,
maybe you have less brown fat.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:14.793
I don't know.

01:34:14.793 --> 01:34:17.850
I don't know of any studies
which have looked into that.

01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:20.470
- Okay. Ice headache.

01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:22.670
Sometimes I'll drink a
cold beverage or I'll

01:34:23.848 --> 01:34:25.930
eat ice cream in my head will-

01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:27.730
- Brain freeze.
- Brain freeze.

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:30.800
And speaking of special
forces, I was talking to,

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.660
we all see the images of the SEALs,

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.340
SEAL training slash screening in Coronado

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:37.720
where they're going in
and out of the Pacific,

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.980
which is very cold.

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.440
But I know they also spend some
time in the very cold waters

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.780
of Kodiak, Alaska.

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.720
You mentioned Alaska.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.300
Brain freeze, so-called ice headache,

01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:54.300
is a common occurrence
there in those situations.

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.260
But we all have experienced this.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:58.620
We eat ice cream, and you
get that brain freeze.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.000
I can feel it right now a
little bit subjectively.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.900
I can induce it.

01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.050
What's going on there?

01:35:04.050 --> 01:35:06.240
And I would always just rub my tongue

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.433
on the roof of my mouth.

01:35:07.433 --> 01:35:09.790
Is there something that I'm
doing that's functional there

01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:11.360
just to try and alleviate it?

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.730
- Good question, the
thing is that the roof

01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.830
of your mouth is very
close to your hypothalamus.

01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:20.050
So if indeed it's a Popsicle

01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:21.650
that's giving you the brain freeze,

01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:25.300
it may be a direct cooling
effect from the roof

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:26.900
of your mouth and if you
put your tongue there,

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.880
you're insulating the roof of your mouth.

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.752
I don't know, I'm guessing.

01:35:30.752 --> 01:35:32.770
- But what's the source
of the brain freeze?

01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:35.260
It at vasoconstriction?

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.850
- It's a vasomotor change.

01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:38.010
Whether it's constriction,

01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:41.850
I think it's more likely an
increase in blood pressure,

01:35:41.850 --> 01:35:45.630
which will essentially cause
an expansion of the arteries

01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:48.250
and activate pain receptors.

01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:50.900
We don't have pain receptors
in the neural tissue

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:51.733
in the brain.

01:35:51.733 --> 01:35:53.330
We have them in the meninges

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:56.340
and predominantly associated
with the blood vessels,

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:57.930
the walls of the blood vessels.

01:35:57.930 --> 01:36:00.930
So if you have something
which will dramatically

01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:05.870
increase your blood
pressure going to the brain,

01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:07.070
you're likely to get...

01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:11.090
We've had some preliminary data.

01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:12.460
I even hate to mention this,

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:16.420
because we have not been able
to pursue it systematically,

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:20.640
but we've had some experience with people

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.830
with migraine that say,

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:27.010
if they use one of our devices to heat,

01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:28.410
that the migraine goes away.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.090
And I don't know.

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:34.400
- Yeah. It's very, and a lot
of people suffer from migraine.

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.820
I know there are a lot of
different types of migraine.

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.700
I've been reading a lot about this lately,

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:42.670
because I get so many
questions about migraine but.

01:36:42.670 --> 01:36:44.040
- I'd hate to say anything.
- Sure.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.180
And we'll just underscore
this as preliminary

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:49.450
and people have been
great about understanding

01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:50.750
that when we say preliminary,

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:52.440
we mean it has not passed through

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.440
the required filters to
call it hard fact yet.

01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:00.003
- We don't even have a decent dataset.

01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:03.300
These are anecdotal report.
- Yeah, anecdata,

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.133
as people like to call it,

01:37:04.133 --> 01:37:06.530
but I don't even like
to call it that because

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:08.120
we don't want to give it
more weight than it deserves,

01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.940
but that's interesting.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.570
The ice headache and the
increase in blood pressure

01:37:12.570 --> 01:37:14.700
is interesting because the only thing

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.230
that I've heard is similar

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:19.390
to it is something that comes from,

01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:21.100
they have these competitions
where people eat

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.190
these very hot chili peppers.

01:37:23.190 --> 01:37:25.370
It's kind of an ego thing,

01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:28.350
I guess, for reasons that escaped me,

01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:29.890
that eating really hot peppers.

01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:30.830
And every once in a while,

01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:32.270
someone will eat one of these and get

01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:33.950
what's called thunderclap headache,

01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:37.990
where a headache comes on
extremely quickly and so quickly

01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:39.550
that it's caused,

01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:43.160
so severe rather that it's
been known to cause stroke

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.560
and brain damage.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.740
So these very, very hot peppers,

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:49.610
if you're not acclimated to
them, and maybe even if you are,

01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:52.300
have been shown to actually
cause brain damage.

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.233
Yeah. Some good evidence for this.

01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:58.390
I do want to talk about something

01:37:58.390 --> 01:38:03.163
that we have not touched
on yet, which is NEAT.

01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:07.173
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right?

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.320
So non-activity associated thermogenesis.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:12.980
And the fidgeters, right?

01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:15.930
So the classic work of
like Rothwell and Stock.

01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:19.860
And the idea that some people who overeat

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:22.460
are burning off that energy by way

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:25.053
of shaking their knee
or moving around a lot.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.060
The quote/unquote nervous types.

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.980
But they quoted in those studies,

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:34.063
a huge degree of caloric burn,

01:38:34.063 --> 01:38:38.350
800, 2500 calories per
day burned above those

01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:40.020
who sit rather still.

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.180
Does that seem farfetched?

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.670
Those are older data but

01:38:43.670 --> 01:38:48.470
any comment on NEAT or
non-exercise induced thermogenesis?

01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:50.690
- Well, I do think it's
pretty straightforward

01:38:50.690 --> 01:38:53.280
that if you increase muscle
activity of any kind,

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.780
you're increasing your energy consumption

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.500
and your heat production.

01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:02.500
And the really extreme example
is hyper and hypothyroidism.

01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:05.730
People that are hyperthyroid or fidgety

01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:07.680
and they have a high metabolic rate

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.420
and they're hot.

01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.283
And people that are hypothermic are cool.

01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:15.250
They don't move very much.

01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:17.850
So any kind of muscle activity increases,

01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:20.580
and when you say it's not much activity,

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:23.480
but remember it's only 20% effective.

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:26.943
80% of the energy is going to heat.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.280
So it may not exert much energy
to tap your foot. [chuckles]

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.320
But four times the amount
of energy that is going

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.400
into the movement is being lost as heat.

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.900
- That's very interesting.

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.120
A couple more quick questions.

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.340
There's a lot of excitement these days

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:48.970
or at least usage these days
of so-called energy drinks

01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:50.640
or pre-workout drinks.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.380
Many of these contain
thermogenic compounds.

01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:55.580
So caffeine, things,

01:39:55.580 --> 01:40:00.580
there's a culture now of taking arginine,

01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:01.920
things that support arginine.

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.310
So beet juice and L-citrulline,

01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:08.090
things to dilate the blood vessels.

01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:10.580
Sometimes this is for sake
of increasing blood flow

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.250
to the muscles during resistance exercise.

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:14.230
But a lot of these are thermogenic,

01:40:14.230 --> 01:40:16.350
is to increase body temperature.

01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:19.190
And is it possible that
some of these energy drinks

01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:21.700
are actually, or similar,

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.640
six espresso or whatever it is,

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:27.600
are acting to prevent optimal performance

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.390
or reduce performance?

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:31.890
- I don't think that

01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:34.893
the temperature rise is
that, I really don't know,

01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:38.850
but what it does is it
makes you more jittery

01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:40.940
and you're going to increase that NEAT

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.343
that you were talking about.

01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.187
There's another thing.

01:40:44.187 --> 01:40:48.750
And that is that when you
are exercising your muscle

01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:52.370
and it becomes slightly hypoxic,

01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:56.830
I mean the oxygen suppliers is not enough,

01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:59.800
the muscle releases adenosine.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.920
And what adenosine does in the muscle

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.710
is cause the blood vessels
to open up, to dilate.

01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:09.270
So it's a way of increasing
the blood flow to the muscle

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:11.650
and therefore the oxygen
supply to the muscle.

01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:15.130
- And caffeine is essentially
an adenosine antagonists.

01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:17.064
- An adenosine antagonist. Right.

01:41:17.064 --> 01:41:20.170
- So under the strict logic,

01:41:20.170 --> 01:41:23.520
ingesting caffeine will
reduce adenosine release

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.160
and will reduce oxygen
utilization of the muscle?

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:27.993
- Right.

01:41:27.993 --> 01:41:30.020
- So that would lead me to believe that,

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:33.380
motivational support aside,

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.593
that caffeine will hinder
muscular performance?

01:41:37.593 --> 01:41:38.441
- I would think so,

01:41:38.441 --> 01:41:43.220
but I can't give you an
authoritative answer on that.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.370
- Okay, we're just going through the logic

01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:48.113
and the gymnastics around that.

01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:52.530
I think it's a fascinating
area that deserves attention

01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:56.440
because the question
of what one can ingest

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.023
in order to perform better,

01:41:58.930 --> 01:42:00.950
to say nothing of hormone augmentation,

01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:05.950
but often leads back to stimulants.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.100
And if those stimulants,

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.800
most of which include
caffeine of some sort,

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.130
are inhibiting the adenosine system

01:42:13.130 --> 01:42:15.390
and the adenosine system is
supporting the oxygenation

01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:19.990
of muscle, then I would
imagine that avoiding them

01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:21.900
might be the better option.

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.573
- Yeah, I just, I'm not
aware of data that would,

01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:31.930
so this is a general phenomenon
of adenosine and blood flow.

01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:32.763
It has of course,

01:42:32.763 --> 01:42:34.580
a different effect in the brain.

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.870
Adenosine causes sleep.

01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:38.660
So caffeine keeps you awake.

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.330
And if you stay awake,

01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:42.030
you're going to have a
higher metabolic rate

01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:44.563
than if you go to sleep.

01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:49.010
And the thing is you say, energy drinks,

01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:52.380
the question is, what really is in them?

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.370
- It's usually a cocktail of things.

01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:56.060
I don't take these, I
don't like them at all,

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.853
but they're usually a
combination of vasodilators,

01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:00.933
caffeine, some sort of stimulant.

01:43:00.933 --> 01:43:02.810
- And source of glucose usually.

01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:05.050
- Sometimes a source of
glucose and sometimes not.

01:43:05.050 --> 01:43:06.530
And oftentimes

01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:11.467
there are vasodilators and there are

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.060
compounds that are thought
to be so-called nootropics,

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.880
smart drugs that basically
increase acetylcholine

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:21.113
or norepinephrine transmission.

01:43:23.235 --> 01:43:24.185
In the 80s and 90s,

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.720
the beta-3 agonist like
clenbuterol were very popular,

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.140
but they were all banned.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.360
So those were all banned from,

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.970
although people used them recreationally,

01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:35.620
which I do not recommend.

01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.110
There were actually a number of deaths due

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:41.693
to dehydration, overheating,
as well as cardiac effects.

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:44.233
Before we wrap up,

01:43:45.136 --> 01:43:46.830
I know you've done a ton of work on sleep.

01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:48.750
I think we're going to
have to do another episode

01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:50.240
about your work on sleep,

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.760
because the amount of data
that you produce there

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.120
is vast actually.

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:57.580
So I first got to know
you and your work related

01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:59.450
to sleep and temperature.

01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:03.010
We all hear nowadays that
it's good to keep the room

01:44:03.010 --> 01:44:04.230
that you sleep in cool.

01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:05.540
Keep it dark.

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:08.500
I've talked a number of
times on podcast episodes

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:11.823
about the role of light and
shifting circadian rhythms.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.170
I have two questions related to sleep.

01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:19.500
One is, are there any things that may

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.460
or may not relate to temperature,

01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:26.040
but that you think are very
useful for getting better sleep,

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.053
that you don't hear that much about,

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.150
that people might want to consider or try?

01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:34.210
Realizing that there are a lot

01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:36.500
of reasons why people don't sleep great,

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:39.320
but what are some things
that you don't hear

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.140
that much about these days
that you wish people knew?

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.590
- Well, the sleep medicine
community now puts

01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:50.830
a lot more emphasis on
cognitive behavioral therapy

01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:53.170
than on pharmacology.

01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:55.970
So what cognitive behavioral therapy does

01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:59.760
is it essentially increases
your sleep hygiene.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.750
So there are certain just general rules.

01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:06.220
So have a regular bedtime
and a regular arousal time.

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:08.900
Don't be skipping back
and forth all the time.

01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:10.220
- Arousal, you mean wake-up time?

01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.210
- Wake-up time, yeah.

01:45:11.210 --> 01:45:12.860
- Spoken like a true physiologist.

01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:15.654
- Right. [laughs]

01:45:15.654 --> 01:45:19.100
Yeah, another thing is don't use screens

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.550
within a couple hours of bedtime,

01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:26.900
because screens are
predominantly rich in blue light.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.610
And what that does, as you
mentioned, the circadian system,

01:45:29.610 --> 01:45:31.620
that affects your circadian system.

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:36.620
That pushes off your circadian
stimulus for sleep, okay?

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.530
Another thing is of course relax.

01:45:40.530 --> 01:45:42.110
I mean, don't work right up until

01:45:42.110 --> 01:45:44.290
the time you're going to bed.

01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:46.633
Take some time to do something relaxing.

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:50.180
And then temperature,
you've mentioned that.

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.910
And for many people, a warm bath

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.830
is really conducive to good sleep.

01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:59.700
And people are now swearing by

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:02.560
a cooler environment for sleep.

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.100
And that makes sense in
terms of the circadian effect

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:07.710
on body temperature.

01:46:07.710 --> 01:46:12.710
So our circadian clock is
effecting our thermostat.

01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:14.900
So at the time we go to bed,

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.470
our thermostat is on its way down

01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:19.893
to a lower set point, okay?

01:46:19.893 --> 01:46:20.726
So what happens?

01:46:20.726 --> 01:46:24.050
You go to bed and you're
feeling a little bit cool.

01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:27.100
So you pile on lots of blankets.

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.990
And then what happens is you
wake up a little bit later

01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:31.614
and you're hot, so you throw them off.

01:46:31.614 --> 01:46:35.210
It's because your
thermostat has set downward.

01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:37.790
Now why is it better to
have a cooler environment?

01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:39.390
It's better to have a cooler environment,

01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:42.513
because it's easier to thermoregulate.

01:46:42.513 --> 01:46:44.720
So you can go to Europe in the summertime

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.970
and the hotel rooms still
have these big comforters,

01:46:47.970 --> 01:46:50.040
these down comforters.

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.810
So how do you deal with that?

01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:54.990
You stick out your hands
and your legs, okay?

01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:56.000
- I've always slept with,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.990
I have one leg that just kind
a hangs out of the, yeah.

01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:03.410
- But they're your heat
loss surfaces, right?

01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:04.870
So if you're in a cool environment,

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:06.640
you can take advantage of that.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.390
You can take advantage by passively

01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.020
regulating your body temperature.

01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:13.970
You don't have to get
up and wake up and say,

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:16.690
oh my God, I've got to change
the covers or blankets,

01:47:16.690 --> 01:47:17.730
or what have you.

01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:20.510
If you're in a warm
environment, what can you do?

01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:22.777
- You need to sleep with
one hand in the CoolMitt.

01:47:22.777 --> 01:47:23.650
- Right.
- Right?

01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:25.447
And right now that's not available yet.

01:47:25.447 --> 01:47:27.010
- Right. It's not available.

01:47:27.010 --> 01:47:28.790
- I've never heard about it that way.

01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:31.190
I've always heard you want
to sleep in a cool room

01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:32.593
or keep the room cold.

01:47:32.593 --> 01:47:33.426
- Yeah.

01:47:33.426 --> 01:47:36.800
- But I never realized why
that's useful, which is,

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.820
you're saying, then you can
move these glabrous surfaces

01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:41.680
in and out.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:44.580
You could even also wake up
under the blanket completely.

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:47.160
- Your face. Yeah, yeah.
- Very, very interesting.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.980
That finally a rational
science grounded explanation

01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.670
for why we need to sleep in a cool room.

01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:54.503
'Cause I always thought, well,

01:47:54.503 --> 01:47:56.270
if your temperature is going down anyway,

01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:57.660
why do you have to sleep in a cool room?

01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.440
What about wearing socks while you sleep?

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:01.070
That was big a few years
ago where they said,

01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:02.850
you should put socks on.

01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:05.350
Now I would think that's
probably the wrong advice.

01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:06.183
You probably just-

01:48:06.183 --> 01:48:08.300
- Well, I don't know if it's wrong advice.

01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:12.260
There's an old, old study
that was supported by,

01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.480
I think, Eddie Bauer,

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.110
the sleeping bag company.

01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:19.040
And what the study showed,

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.200
what the study was asking is

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.370
what are the most temperature-sensitive
spots in the body?

01:48:24.370 --> 01:48:26.050
Where do you feel cold?

01:48:26.050 --> 01:48:29.410
And what that showed was it was the toes.

01:48:29.410 --> 01:48:30.243
- That makes sense.

01:48:30.243 --> 01:48:31.760
So when you sample water with your toe,

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.908
you always see that.

01:48:32.908 --> 01:48:33.741
[Craig laughs]

01:48:33.741 --> 01:48:37.630
- So the socks essentially
are promoting thermal comfort

01:48:37.630 --> 01:48:40.940
by insulating that area
that's quite sensitive.

01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:42.160
Now of course, if it's too warm,

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.460
you're not going to put socks on.

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:47.030
- Right, well, Craig, thank you so much.

01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:49.840
You gave so much information

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.800
that's actionable and interesting.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.110
I know a lot of people are
going to be really interested

01:48:55.110 --> 01:48:58.600
in the palmar cooling
technology from CoolMitt.

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:01.050
We will be sure to provide
resources to the website

01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:03.070
so that people can register interest.

01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:08.070
I do encourage people to play
around with, so to speak,

01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:12.640
the palmar cooling
technology that we all have,

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:15.070
which are these glabrous surfaces.

01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:17.500
And I also just want to
thank you for taking time out

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.230
of your busy schedule to

01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:20.570
share this information.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:22.970
It was fun. It was lots of fun.

01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:25.360
- I certainly learned a lot
and I know a lot of people

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.920
are going to learn a lot
that's useful to them.

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.753
- Good questions.

01:49:28.753 --> 01:49:30.370
- Well, fabulous answers.

01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:31.367
Thank you.

01:49:31.367 --> 01:49:32.200
- Thank you.

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.260
- Thank you for joining for my discussion

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:35.060

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.820
in supporting research in
the Huberman Lab at Stanford,

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:13.340
you can go to
hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving.

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.610
And there you can make a
tax-deductible donation

01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:18.310
to support research in
my laboratory on stress,

01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:20.870
human performance, sleep and trauma,

01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:22.320
and topics of that sort.

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.810
If you're not already
following us at Huberman Lab

01:50:24.810 --> 01:50:26.420
on Instagram or Twitter,

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:27.630
you're welcome to do so.

01:50:27.630 --> 01:50:31.160
On Instagram, I do short
neuroscience tutorials

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.480
that are separate from
the tutorials that I tend

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.520
to do on the podcast.

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.070
Often on this podcast,
we discuss supplements.

01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:39.670
One of the really important things,

01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:41.160
if you're going to take supplements,

01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:42.140
is that the supplements be

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:43.940
of the highest quality ingredients

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.360
and that the amount of those ingredients

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.620
that's listed on the
label actually matches

01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.930
what is in those supplements.

01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:53.320
We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.810
because thorn has the
highest levels of stringency

01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:58.940
in terms of quality and
how much of each supplement

01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.910
they put in their products.

01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:02.660
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:03.720
you can go to Thorne,

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.850
T-H-O-R-N-E.com/the letter U/Huberman.

01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:09.640
And there, you can see what I take.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.940
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.950
if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal.

01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:16.370
And even if you navigate to other products

01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:18.770
and other product pages
within the Thorne site,

01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:20.820
you can still get that 20% off.

01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:25.820
So it's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:28.180
And last, but certainly not least,

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:30.130
thank you for your interest in science.

01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:34.740
