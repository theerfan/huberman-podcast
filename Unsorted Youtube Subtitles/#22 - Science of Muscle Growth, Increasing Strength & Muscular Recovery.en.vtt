00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.310
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.983
for everyday life.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.180
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.340
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.510
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.910
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.040
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.860
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.820
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.990
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.930
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.880
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.220
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.680
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.260
to help you better understand your body

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200
and reach your health goals.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.840
I've long been a fan of
getting blood work done

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.480
for the simple reason
that many of the things

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.860
that impact our immediate
and long-term health

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.850
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.840
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.010
we can also get insight into things

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.520
like metabolic factors
that tell us whether

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.350
or not we metabolize caffeine
well or certain proteins well,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.690
what our fat metabolism genes are like.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.580
Things of that sort can only be analyzed

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.270
from quality blood and DNA tests.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.520
In addition, many of the factors
that impact our hormones,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.810
our metabolism our brain health,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.270
those come back in a blood and DNA test

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.260
and there are many blood
and DNA tests out there,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.370
but with InsideTracker, they
give you a lot of clear insight

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.540
into what those markers
mean and how to adjust them.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.210
They have this terrific
platform that doesn't just

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.600
give you the numbers back and tell you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.560
if you're higher or low in some factor,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.080
but rather it tells you
what your levels are

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.020
of all those factors and
gives you very simple

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.400
and clear directives of changes
you might make in your diet,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.780
changes that you might make
in your exercise regimen,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.620
or sleep, et cetera in
order to get those markers

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.740
where they ought to be

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.950
and where you would like them to be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.230
in order to optimize yourself.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.350
So they make everything
very easy, start to finish.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.350
They can even come to your home

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.800
to take the blood and
DNA tests if you like.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.360
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.800
Today's podcast is also brought to us

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.420
by Belcampo Meat Company.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.520
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.150
that raises organic grass fed

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.080
and finished certified humane meats.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.600
While I don't eat a lot of meat, when I do

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.340
I insist that that meat
be a very high quality.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.880
How the animals were cared for
is extremely important to me

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.930
and the life that the animal
had and what it consumed

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.340
is very important to me.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.930
So the way that I eat I've
discussed on this podcast before

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.470
but very briefly, I basically
fast until about noon,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.630
then I eat a piece of
beef or chicken with lunch

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.660
and a salad.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.650
So that's basically my lunch.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.810
That's what optimizes
my levels of alertness

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.440
for work throughout the day.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.020
Then in the evening I shift over

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.100
to eating primarily carbohydrates.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.520
That's what allows me to sleep very well.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760
So I'm not eating huge volumes of meat

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.560
but am eating meat every day.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.860
Conventionally raised animals
are confined to feed lots

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.640
and need to diet of inflammatory grains

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670
which is bad for them and it's bad for us

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.260
when we eat their meat.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.360
Belcampo animals graze on open pastures

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.040
and seasonal grasses resulting in meat

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.070
that is higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.030
And I've talked before
about the importance

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.380
of omega-3 fatty acids for
both brain and body health

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.930
and Belcampo meats are high
in omega-3 fatty acids.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.580
The way Belcampo raises its
animals isn't just better

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.870
for your health, it also
has a positive impact

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.710
on the environment.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.090
It's what's called climate
positive and carbon negative

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.500
which means good for the
planet and good for us.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.070
My favorite meats from Belcampo

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.200
are the rib eye and the flank steaks.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.350
That's typically what I eat.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.070
I think I probably eat about three or four

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.670
of those across the week
and then I'll eat chicken

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.180
on some other days.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.140
They're really delicious,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.570
and as I mentioned,
they're very good for us.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.890
You can order Belcampo
sustainably raised meats

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.970

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.280
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.140
Headspace is a meditation app backed

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.120
by 25 published studies

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.810
and has over 600,000 five star reviews.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.810
So I've been meditating on and off

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.410
since I was about 15, 16 years
old, mostly off at first.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.680
What I found is that I'll sometimes

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.830
start a meditation practice but
it's very hard to stay with.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.440
And then a few years ago
I discovered Headspace

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.190
and I started meditating more regularly.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.080
In fact, very recently because
I've had an exorbitant amount

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.780
of work on my plate and
I've been getting less sleep

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.760
than I would like in order
to complete that work,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.490
I've brought back a regular
meditation practice twice a day

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.440
not just my usual once a day.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.040
Headspace makes it really easy.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.150
They have so many meditations on there

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.960
and they guide you into the meditation

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.630
and out of the meditation in a way

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.610
that just makes it very simple

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.950
and makes maintaining the
practice really straightforward.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.690
Right now if you want to try Headspace

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.790
you can go to headspace.com/special offer.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.900
And if you do that, you'll
get a free one month trial.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.230
So that's totally free

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.210
with their full library of
meditations for every situation.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.760
So there's no meditations
that you can't get access

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.740
to with this offer.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.710
You can get access to
everything they've got.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.720
You just go to
headspace.com/special offer.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.350
You get a free one month trial

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.950
and hopefully you'll
decide to stay with it.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.810
I've found that staying with meditation

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.140
has been immensely beneficial
for all aspects of my life.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.880
Today's episode of the Huberman
Lab Podcast is our fourth

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.530
and final episode in this month

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.770
which is all about skills
and athletic performance.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.360
Now, in a previous episode,
we talked about science-based

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.710
in particular neuroscience-based tools

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.250
for accelerating fat loss.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.150
Previous to that, we talked about ways

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.750
to improve skill learning, motor movements

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.160
which also included things like music

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.750
and piano playing not
just athletic performance.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.260
And we've also been
exploring other aspects

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.160
of physical performance
throughout the entire month.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.930
Today I want to talk about something

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.890
that is vitally important for
not just athletic performance,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.630
but for your entire life and
indeed for your longevity,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.490
and that's muscle.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.280
Now, many of you, when
you hear the word muscle

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.000
think muscle growth and
building big muscles.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.320
And while we will touch
on muscle hypertrophy

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.510
muscle growth today, and
science-based protocols

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.630
to enhance hypertrophy,
we will mainly be talking

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.840
about muscle as it relates
to the nervous system.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.480
And I can't emphasize this enough

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.700
the whole reason why you have a brain is

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.250
so that you can move.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.730
And one of the things that's
exquisite and fantastic

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.290
about the human brain,
is that it can direct

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.870
all sorts of different kinds of movement,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.800
different speeds of movement,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.830
movement of different durations.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.190
We can train our
musculature to lift heavier

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.830
and heavier objects or we
can train our musculature

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.750
to take us further and
further so-called endurance.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.730
We can also build smoothness
of movement, excuse me,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.670
smoothness of movement as
well as speed of movement,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.950
suppleness of movement.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.810
All of that is governed
by the relationship

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.440
between the nervous system, neurons

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.090
and their connections to muscle.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.160
So when you hear the science of muscle

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.527
and muscle hypertrophy,
you might think, oh, well

00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:25.750
I'm not interested in building muscle

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.640
but muscle does many critical things.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.600
It's important for movement.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.840
It's important for metabolism.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.210
The more muscle you have
and not just muscle size

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.520
but the quality of muscle,
that's a real thing,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.770
the higher your metabolism is,

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.150
and indeed the healthier you are.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.900
It turns out that jumping ability

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.700
and ability to stand up quickly

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.540
and to get up off the floor quickly

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.580
is one of the most
predictive markers of aging

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.830
and biological aging and no
surprise that is governed

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.760
by the brain to muscle connection.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.320
In addition, muscle and
musculature is vital for posture

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.290
and we don't talk about posture enough.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.220
We all have been told we
need to sit up straight

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.910
or stand up straight, but
posture is vitally important

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.560
for how the rest of our body works.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.310
It's vital to how we breathe.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.490
It's actually even vital to
how alert or sleepy we are.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.470
So we're going to talk about
the musculature for posture.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.380
We also are going to talk about muscle

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.660
as it relates to aesthetic things.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.110
Now, these are all linked.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.160
Muscle for metabolism,
movement, posture and aesthetics

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.570
of course are linked, right?

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.900
As our posture changes,
our aesthetic changes.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.380
As our posture and aesthetic
changes, how we move changes.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.284
And as we improve muscle quality

00:08:45.284 --> 00:08:48.730
whether or not that's
increasing muscle size or not,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.320
that changes the way
that our entire system

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.000
not just our nervous system
and our muscular system

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.680
but our immune system and the
other organs of the body work.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.840
So today, as always we're going to talk

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.410
a little bit of mechanism.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.940
I'm going to explain how
neurons control muscle

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.160
and then we're going to
look at muscle metabolism,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.810
how muscle uses energy.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.740
I promise to make all of this very simple.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.090
I'm actually going to keep it very brief

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.030
probably about 10 minutes total.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.050
And by the end of that 10
minutes, you will understand a lot

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.060
about the neuromuscular connection,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.580
how your brain and nervous
system control your muscle

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.730
and how those muscles work.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.730
Then we are going to talk
about how muscles use energy

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.240
and can change how they use energy

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.040
for sake of getting stronger, if you like

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.880
for also increasing the size
so-called hypertrophy of muscle

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.830
and for improving endurance as
well as for improving posture

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.970
and how you move generally.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.163
We will touch on some nutritional themes

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:50.410
and how that relates
to muscle in particular

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.200
a specific amino acid that

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.400
if it's available in your
bloodstream frequently enough,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.770
and at sufficient levels,
can help you build

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.770
and improve the quality of muscle.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.640
And we'll talk about
specific exercise regimes

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.620
as well as of course, supplementation

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.700
and things that can enhance

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.310
neuromuscular performance overall.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.960
We are also going to talk about recovery.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.860
Recovery as everybody knows,
is when things improve.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.350
That's when neurons get
better at controlling muscle,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.670
that's when muscle grows,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.090
that's when muscle gets more flexible.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.210
None of that actually
happens during training.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.510
It happens after training and
there is a lot of confusion

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.260
about how to optimize
recovery and how to measure

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.940
whether or not you are recovered
and ready to come back in

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.740
for another neuromuscular
training session.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.800
So we'll talk about that as well.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.410
Today is going to have a lot of protocols

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.390
and you're going to come away
with a lot of understanding

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.960
about how you move, how you work

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.370
in these incredible organs
that we call the nervous system

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.560
and the musculature, the
so-called neuromuscular system.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.800
Before we dive into today's topic,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.140
I want to just take about three minutes

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.770
and cover some essential
summary of the previous episode.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.840
In the previous episode,
we talked about fat loss.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.630
Talked about shiver induced fat loss.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.130
We talked about neat non-exercise
activity thermogenesis

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.830
for increasing caloric
burn and fat oxidation.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.000
And we talked about how
to use cold specifically

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.160
to enhance fat loss.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.620
I described a protocol
involving getting into cold

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.970
of some sort, whether or not
it's ice bath, cold shower,

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.520
some form of cold could
even be a river or an ocean

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.250
if you have access to
that and inducing shiver

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.160
and then getting out, not
crossing your arms or huddling

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.010
but allowing that cold to evaporate

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.410
off you and continuing to shiver

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.810
and then getting back into
the colder environment

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.023
of water or stream or shower, et cetera.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.640
All of that is described

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.220
in a beautifully illustrated protocol

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.890
that I didn't illustrate.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.550
That's why it's beautifully illustrated

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.470
at the coldplunge.com.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.150
They've made that protocol for you

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.090
and they've made it available
free of charge for you.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.770
So there's no obligation
there of any kind financially.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.010
You can go to the coldplunge.com.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.800
There's a little tab that says protocols

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.980
and you can download that
protocol, someone there

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.000
I don't know who exactly illustrated it,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.400
and you can come away with a PDF

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.537
of what I described in
the previous episode.

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:20.270
So I just want to make sure

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.570
that you are aware of that resource.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.750
The other announcement
I'd like to make is that

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.540
many of you have asked how you
can help support the podcast.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.030
And there's a very straightforward
zero cost way to do that.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.580
And that's to subscribe
to our YouTube channel.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.240
So if you go to YouTube,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.410
if you're not already
there watching this now

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.390
hits the Subscribe button
that helps us tremendously

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.430
to get the word out more
broadly about the podcast.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.540
And we thank you for your support.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.690
Most people, when they
hear the word muscle

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.470
they just think about strength.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.110
But of course muscles are
involved in everything that we do.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.380
They are involved in speaking,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.320
they're involved in
sitting and standing up,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.180
they're involved in lifting
objects, including ourselves.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.020
They are absolutely essential

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.290
for maintaining how we breathe.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.000
They're absolutely essential
for ambulation, for moving,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.930
and for skills of any kind.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.220
So when we think about muscle,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.430
we don't just want to think about muscle

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.290
the meat that is muscle, but
what controls that muscle.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.020
And no surprise what controls
muscle is the nervous system.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.560
The nervous system does that

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.890
through three main nodes of
control areas of control.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.180
And I've talked about these
before on a previous podcast.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.923
So I will keep this very brief.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.280
Basically, we have upper motor
neurons in our motor cortex.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.300
So those are in our skull

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.310
and those are involved
in deliberate movement.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.270
So if I decide that I'm
going to pick my pen

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.550
up and put it down, which
is what I'm doing right now,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.220
my upper motor neurons were involved

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.950
in generating that movement.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.210
Those upper motor
neurons send signals down

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.090
to my spinal cord where there
are two categories of neurons.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.880
One are the lower motor neurons

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.920
and those lower motor
neurons send little wires

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.660
that we call axons out to our muscles

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.400
and cause those muscles to contract.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.630
They do that by dumping
chemicals onto the muscle.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.140
In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.260
I've talked before about
acetylcholine in the brain

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.650
which is vitally important for focus

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.980
and actually can gait neuroplasticity,

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.200
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.520
But in the neuromuscular system,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.920
acetylcholine released from
motor neurons is the way

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.280
the only way that muscles can contract.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.680
Now, there's another category of neurons

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.900
in the spinal cord called
central pattern generators

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.000
or CPGs.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.980
And those are involved
in rhythmic movements.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.030
Anytime we're walking or doing something

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.550
where we don't have to think about it

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.870
to do it deliberately, it's
just happening reflexively

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.330
that central pattern
generators and motor neurons.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.465
Anytime we're doing
something deliberately,

00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:56.070
the top-down control as we call it,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.980
from the upper motor neurons comes in

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.090
and takes control of that system.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:00.923
So it's really simple.

00:15:00.923 --> 00:15:02.160
You've only got three ingredients.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.250
You've got the upper motor
neurons, the lower motor neurons

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.370
and for rhythmic movements
that are reflexive,

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.830
you've also got the
central pattern generators.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.940
So it's a terrifically
simple system at that level,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.650
but what we're going to focus on today is

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.000
how that system can control muscle

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
in ways that make that system better.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.270
Now, when I say better, I
want to be very specific.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.840
If your goal is to build larger muscles,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.260
there's a way to use your nervous system

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.000
to trigger hypertrophy
to increase the size

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.130
of those muscles.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.350
And it is indeed controlled
by the nervous system.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.160
So you can forget the idea
that the muscles have memory

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.940
or that muscles grow in
response to something

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.800
that's just happening within the muscle,

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.540
it's the nerve to muscle connection

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.120
that actually creates hypertrophy.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.260
I'll talk exactly about how
to optimize that process.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.600
In addition, if you want
to improve endurance

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.490
or improve flexibility or
suppleness or explosiveness,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.360
that is all accomplished by the way

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.740
that the nervous system
engages muscles specifically.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.450
And so what that means is
we have to ask ourselves

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.980
are we going to take control
of the upper motor neurons,

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.900
the central pattern generators,
or the lower motor neurons

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.740
or all three in order
to get to some end point

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.210
of how the nervous system controls muscle.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.370
So neurophysiology 101.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.880
I'll give you one piece of history

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.340
because it's important to know.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.040
Sherrington, who won the Nobel prize

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.330
called movement, the final common path.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.900
Why did he say that?

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.070
Well, the whole reason for
having a nervous system

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.720
the whole reason for having a brain is

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.740
so that we can control our
movements in very dedicated ways.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.630
That is one of the reasons,
perhaps the predominant reason

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.320
why the human brain is so large.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.070
You might think, oh it's
so large for thinking

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.330
and for creativity.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.020
Ah, no when you look at
the amount of real estate

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.420
in the brain that's devoted
to different aspects of life,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.190
it's mainly vision, our ability to see

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.870
and movement, our ability to engage

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.770
in lots of different kinds of movements.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.730
Slow movements, fast movements,
explosive, et cetera.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.474
Other animals don't have that ability

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:17.790
because they don't have
the mental real estate.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.880
They don't have the neural
real estate in their brain.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.460
They have neuromuscular junctions.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.740
They have central pattern generators

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.900
what they don't have

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.730
are these incredible upper motor neurons

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.140
that can direct activity the
muscles in very specific ways.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.720
So we can all feel blessed
that we have this system.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.670
And today I'm going to teach
you how to use that system

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.740
toward particular end points.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.070
So if we decide that we are
going to direct our muscles

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.690
in some particular movement of any kind.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.810
Whether or not it's a
weightlifting exercise,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.440
or whether it's a yoga movement

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.560
or simply picking up
and putting down a pen,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.140
we are engaging flexors and extensors

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.630
and our body is covered with
flexors and extensors all over.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.760
So for instance, our bicep is a flexor

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.130
and our tricep is an extensor.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.950
Those are what are called
antagonistic muscles.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.480
They move the limbs in
opposite directions.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.540
So if you bring your wrist
closer to your shoulder,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.670
that's flection using your bicep.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.200
If you move your wrist further
away from your shoulder,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.230
that's extension, using your tricep.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.870
And without getting into a lot of detail

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.220
the way that the nerves and
brain are wired up to muscle

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.950
make it such that when
a flexor is activated,

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.060
when the nerve dumps
chemical acetylcholine

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.660
onto the muscle to activate the biceps,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.250
the triceps is inhibited.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.279
It's prevented from engaging.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.010
There are ways to bypass this

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.910
but that's the typical mode of action.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:44.180
The converse is also true when
our tricep is in activated,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.460
when we move our wrist
away from our shoulder

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.200
our bicep is inhibited.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.120
And we have flexors like
our abdominal muscles.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.090
And we have extensors in our lower back.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.500
Many of you probably know this

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.610
but some of you probably
don't that your spine

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.130
has flexors to move basically
your chin toward your waist.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.860
And it has, those are your
abdominal muscles among others.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.710
And you have extensors that
move your chin, basically back

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.980
like looking up toward the ceiling.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.480
And those are your extensors.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.870
You have other muscles that
are stabilizing muscles

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.703
and things of that sort

00:19:14.703 --> 00:19:17.070
but those movements of
flection and extension,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.880
and the fact that they are

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.140
what we call reciprocally
innovated or mutual inhibition,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.790
you hear different language around this

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.790
is characteristic of most
of our limb movements.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.610
So hamstring and quadriceps,
the hamstring brings the ankle

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.030
closer back towards the glutes.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.690
Basically it's lifting your heel up

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.840
which is almost always
done toward the back.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.550
Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.840
opposite to the hamstrings.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.730
So you get the idea.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.170
So there's flexors and extensors

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.330
and it's the neurons that
control those flexors

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.670
and extensors that allow us
to move in particular ways.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.250
So, now you have heard a
neuromuscular physiology

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.990
in its simplest form, but I
do want this to be accessible.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.160
I want to get just briefly, just briefly

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.180
into some of the underlying metabolism

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.650
of how muscles use and create energy.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.930
Because in doing that, we
will be in a great position

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.350
to understand all the
tools that follow about

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.400
how to optimize the neuromuscular system

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.870
for your particular goals.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.900
So in the previous episode about fat loss,

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.360
we talked about lipolysis.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.930
The breakdown of fat into fatty acids

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.900
so it can be used as fuel.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.870
And it ended in a step where we got ATP,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.980
which is the bottleneck
and final common path

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.010
for all energy producing
functions in the body.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.630
There are other ways but basically ATP

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.550
is the key element there.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.830
Now with muscles, they don't
function on fats normally

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.820
what they are going to function
on their ability to move

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.420
and their ability to do
things and allow us to move

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.470
in any way that we want to,

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.920
is based on a process of glycolysis,

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.180
the breakdown of things like glycogen

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.490
and glucose into energy.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.600
And it's a very simple process.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.030
You don't have to know any chemistry.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.050
So if I say the words carbon or hydrogen

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.470
or something like that, don't freak out.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.100
You don't have to
understand any chemistry.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.350
But basically what
happens is you've got this

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.100
available sugar resource
that stored in muscle.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.810
And that's glucose.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:23.810
And that glucose has six carbons
and six waters, basically.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:30.670
That can be broken down into
two sets of three carbons.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.613
All right.

00:21:32.613 --> 00:21:34.460
So basically you take
glucose and you break it

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.130
into these two little batches of carbons

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.370
that we call pyruvate.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.920
So six divided by two is three.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.690
So you get three and three pyruvate.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.560
And that generates a
little bit of ATP of energy

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.450
but just a little bit.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.413
Now, if there's oxygen available,

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.400
if there's sufficient oxygen there,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.050
what can happen is that
pyruvate can be brought

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.230
to the mitochondria and
through a whole set of things

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.370
that you probably don't
want to hear about right now

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.170
like the electron transport
chain and citric acid cycle.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:10.170
What happens is it's broken
down and you get 28 to 30 ATP,

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.090
which has a lot of ATP.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.830
So the only things you need to know,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.560
the only things you need
to know about this process

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.470
is that glucose and glycogen
are broken down into pyruvate.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.973
You a little bit of energy from that.

00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:23.760
And when I say energy, I
mean the ability to move.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.500
It's fuel, literally just gets burned up.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.930
But if there's oxygen
available and that's key

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.070
then within the mitochondria,
you can create 28 to 30 ATP

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.020
which is a lot of ATP.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.070
Now, what does this mean?

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.070
This means that movement of muscle

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.920
is metabolically expensive
and indeed compared

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.170
to other tissues compared
to fat, compared to bone,

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.580
compared to almost all other
tissues, except brain tissue

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.480
muscle is the most metabolically demanding

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.710
which is why people who
have more muscle relative

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.900
to adipose tissue to
fat, they can eat more

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.020
and they're more of a furnace.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.570
They just kind of burn that up.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.840
So even if you didn't understand
anything that I just said,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.840
what you probably did hear,
and that I hope you heard

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.100
is that if you have oxygen
around, you can create energy

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.250
from this fuel source that
we call glycogen and glucose.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.970
But what if there isn't oxygen around?

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.290
And what is that like?

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.560
Well, you've experienced that.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.450
I'm not talking about
oxygen in the environment.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.220
I'm talking about oxygen in the muscle.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.110
So if you've ever carried
a box while moving,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.290
or you're carrying heavy
groceries to the car,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.410
or you're exercising particularly hard

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.870
and you felt the burn, well, that burning

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.870
which most people think is
lactic acid is actually a process

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.980
by which pyruvate, which as I said before

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.660
normally could be converted
into ATP if there's oxygen,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.380
well, if there's not enough oxygen

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.260
'cause that muscle is
working too hard or too long,

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.880
what ends up happening is that

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.200
a hydrogen molecule comes in there

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.140
and you get something called lactate.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.600
So believe it or not, humans
don't make lactic acid.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.053
That's another species, we make lactate.

00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:07.660
And we hear that lactate is bad.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.000
We need to buffer the
burn or avoid the burn.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.220
That lactic acid and
lactate are what prevent us

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.630
for performing as well
as we ought to be able to

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.390
or going as far as we possibly could

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.030
in an endurance event.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.220
Guess what, that's not true at all.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.990
Lactate has three functions,

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.550
all of which are really
interesting and really important.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.810
First of all, it's a
buffer against acidity.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.640
You don't want muscle to get too acidic

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.680
because it can't function.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.920
You don't want any body
tissue to get too acidic.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.600
So that burn that you feel is
acidity in that environment

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.350
and lactate what most
people call lactic acid,

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.810
but again, we don't make lactic acid.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.080
Lactate is there to buffer that

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.960
to reduce the amount of burn.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.760
So, most people have
this exactly backwards.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.610
So when you feel that burn
that is not lactic acid,

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:02.120
that is lactate that's
present to suppress the burn,

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.683
to suppress acidity.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.530
It's also a fuel.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.160
When you feel that burn,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.540
lactate is shuttled to
those areas of the muscle,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.380
and there's an actual fuel burning process

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.160
where in the absence of oxygen

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.010
you can continue to generate
muscular contractions.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.100
Now, this is informative
'cause it also tells us that

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.230
that burning that acidity that we feel

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.430
can inhibit the way that our muscles work

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.900
but that lactate comes
in and allows our muscles

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.790
to continue to function.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.360
So we'll talk a little bit more about

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.550
what this whole lactate
thing and the burn means

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.050
but it's a really important process.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.900
And it's amazing to me that
most people understand it

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.890
in exactly the incorrect way.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.480
They think a lactic acid
is bad and the burn is bad.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.980
No, it reveals a number
of really important things

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.780
are going on with this
vital molecule lactate,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.700
which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.980
as well as act as a fuel.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.240
Now, here's where it
gets really, really cool.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.830
And if you don't have enough
of an incentive to exercise

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.370
based on all the information out there

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.140
about how it'll make you live longer

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.270
and make your heart better, et cetera,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.810
here's a reason that regardless

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.220
of what kind of exercise you do,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.830
if it's weight training, or
running, or cycling, or swimming

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.940
that every once in a while,
about 10% of the time

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.890
you should exercise to
the point of intensity

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.583
where you start to feel
that so-called burn.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.370
The reason for that is
that lactate shows up

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.570
to the site of the burn, so to speak,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.536
and it acts as a hormonal
signal for other organs

00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:40.363
of the body in a very positive way.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.920
As you may recall, from
a very early episode

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.870
of the Huberman Lab
Podcast, I talked about

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.700
what a hormone is and how it works.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.840
We have lots of different
kinds of hormones

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.820
but hormones are chemicals that
are released in one location

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.980
in the body and travel,
have effects on lots

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.590
of other organs of the body.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:02.273
So when I say that lactate
acts as a hormonal signal,

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.520
what I mean is that it's in a
position to influence tissues

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.670
that are outside of the muscle.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.080
And basically it can send signals

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.780
to the heart, to the
liver and to the brain,

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.930
and it can have effects
on the heart, the liver

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.670
and the brain that are very positive.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.210
So just to zoom out for a second

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.450
I promise we won't get any
more technical than this.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.240
We will get into tools and protocols

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.860
that are really straightforward

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.630
but what I'm telling you is that

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.473
if you feel a burn from a
particular exercise or movement,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.290
that burn is going to be buffered

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.820
by this molecule we call lactate.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.900
Lactate will then provide additional fuel

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.010
for additional work.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.750
So this is a good incentive
provided you can do it safely

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.070
to "Work through the burn."

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:56.070
That burn acts as a beacon to the lactate

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.540
which comes in and allows
you to do more work.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.820
It's not a signal to stop necessarily.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.580
I mean, stop if you're
doing something unsafe

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.520
but it's a signal that
lactate should come in

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.810
and allow you to continue to do work.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.880
And it can act as a hormonal signal.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.170
Lactate can then travel to the heart

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.060
and to the liver and to the brain

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.450
and can enhance their
function in positive ways,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.730
not just in those moments,

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.780
but in the period of time that follows.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.960
So many people are curious
about how they can exercise

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.290
to make their brain better.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.830
That's one of the most
common questions I get.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.730
What I'm telling you is that
provided you can do it safely

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.510
by engaging the so-called burn

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.530
which is at a different
threshold for everybody,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.670
your hill run will be
different than my hill run

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.030
to generate the burn,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.620
but provided you can do that for about 10%

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.921
of your workouts or of
an individual workout,

00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:54.190
or activity of any kind, you
are generating the activity

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.740
of this lactate based hormonal signal

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.400
that can improve the function of neurons.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.780
And it does that if you want
to know for the aficionados

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.650
by improving the function
of another cell type

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.530
called the astrocytes which
are a glial cell type.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.070
Which are very involved in clearance

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.400
of debris from the brain,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.610
they're involved in the
formation of synopsis

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.470
connections between neurons in the brain.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.390
So put simply, if you are an exerciser

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.800
if you're doing movement of
any kind, and you're interested

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.330
in allocating some of that
movement toward enhancing

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:29.330
brain, heart and liver
health, there is a nice set

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.770
of scientific data that points to the fact

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.180
that getting a lactate
shuttled to the muscles

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.050
by engaging this burning
sensation is advantageous

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.960
for the health of those other tissues.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.170
So, as I mentioned that burn is present

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.010
from lack of oxygen being present.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.200
And then the hydrogen comes
in and you get this lactate.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.760
But this process of
lactate acting as a buffer

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.900
of fuel and a positive hormonal
signal for other tissues,

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.110
occurs only if there's oxygen.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.740
So if you feel the burn,
you definitely want to focus

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.320
on your breathing at that point.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.970
That would be the time
to take deep inhales

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.413
and try and bring more
oxygen into your system.

00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:12.550
It's definitely not a
time to hold your breath.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.080
And if ever you've run to
the point of feeling the burn

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.870
and then you were exercised
in any way on the treadmill

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.960
or on the bike or whatever,
and felt that burn,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.920
and then you held your breath,

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.830
it feels much more intense.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.900
By breathing you bring lactate to the site

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.240
and you are able to
allow lactate to act more

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.910
as a buffer, a fuel,
and a hormonal signal.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.850
And the reason I brought this up today is

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.250
because as I mentioned so
many people are interested

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.220
in using exercise not just for sake

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.940
of improving physical health
and wellbeing and performance,

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.340
but also for enhancing their brain.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.280
And there are a lot of
data out there speaking

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.720
to the findings that
exercise of various kinds

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.640
can increase neurogenesis,
the creation of new neurons.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.420
Well, the unfortunate news is that

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.950
while that's true in mice,

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.670
there is very little evidence
for enhanced neurogenesis

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.060
from exercise or otherwise in humans.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.790
There's a little bit,
and there are a few sites

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.380
within the brain, such
as the dentate gyrus

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.860
of the hippocampus, which may be involved

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.270
in the formation of new
memories, to be clear

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.900
the dentate gyrus is definitely involved

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.200
in the formation of new memories,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.370
whether or not the new
neurons that are added there

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.700
in humans are involved in new memories.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.960
The evidence for that
is weak at best, frankly

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.710
whereas an animals the
data are quite strong,

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.960
but most of the data points to the fact

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.530
that hormonal signals,
things that are transported

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:41.530
in the blood during exercise
are beneficial for the brain

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.901
and that those signals are
not causing the increase

00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:49.550
in the number of neurons in
the dentate gyrus or otherwise.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.470
That it's more about the
health of the connections

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.020
between the neurons growth
factors of various kinds

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.890
things like IGF-1, there's
a long list of these things.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.160
So if you've heard the
exercise increases the number

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.487
of neurons in your brain,
well, that's not true.

00:32:01.487 --> 00:32:03.600
And that probably is a good thing, frankly

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.180
because we always hear
more neurons, more neurons

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.840
as if it's a good thing, but
the brain doesn't do so well

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.290
with bringing in entirely new elements.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.650
It has a hard time negotiating that

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.140
and making use of those new elements.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.350
We know about this from things
like the cochlear implant

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.950
where deaf people are given a device

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.380
where they suddenly can hear.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.610
Some people really like that,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.730
deaf people really like that
and can benefit from it.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.640
Other deaf people find
that it's very intrusive.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.600
That is hard to take an existing
neural circuit in the brain

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.140
and incorporate a lot of
new information into it.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.040
So new neurons, as great as that sounds

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.510
more neurons, more neurons,

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.640
it actually might not be the best way

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.940
for the nervous system to
change and modify itself

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.520
and to promote its own longevity.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.300
So when I tell you not such great evidence

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.510
from new neurons past puberty,

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.440
that's what the data
really show in humans.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.360
And I sort of knocked back the data

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.350
on exercise and neurogenesis,

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.620
don't let that depress you.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.233
If you have dementia in your family,

00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:06.840
don't translate that into necessarily

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.390
that you will develop dementia.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.820
Understand the exercise
is still beneficial

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.510
for the brain and other
aspects of the nervous system

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.710
but that it's going to be doing it

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.440
through these hormonal signals.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.600
Things like IGF-1, things
like this lactate pathway

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.610
when you experience
the burn from exercise.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.730
And again, you don't want to try

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.420
and get this feeling of a burn

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.620
throughout the entire episode of exercise,

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.410
there'll be far too intense and
would inhibit your recovery.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.240
I don't think it'd be good
for performance either.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.360
It's only about 10% of your total effort

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.160
in any one exercise about

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.110
that's going to give you
this positive effect.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.020
So now you know how to
devote a small portion

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.878
of your exercise, 10% in
order for muscle and lactate

00:33:46.878 --> 00:33:48.650
to benefit other tissues

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.690
namely your heart, your
liver, and your brain.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.190
I'd now like to shift our attention

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.350
to how to use specific aspects
of muscular contraction

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.440
to improve muscle
hypertrophy, muscle growth,

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.280
as well as improving muscle strength.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.520
There are a lot of reasons
to want to get stronger.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.340
And I should just mention
that it's not always the case

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.270
that getting stronger involves
muscles getting bigger.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.330
There are ways for muscles to get stronger

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.480
without getting bigger.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.210
However, increasing the size of a muscle

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:22.410
almost inevitably increases
the strength of that muscle

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:24.180
at least to some degree.

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.710
Reasons why most everyone should want

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.260
to get their muscles stronger is that

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.050
muscles are generally
getting progressively weaker

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.660
across the lifespan.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.940
So when I say getting
stronger, it's not necessarily

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.040
about being able to move increasing mounts

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.610
of weight in the gym.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:41.960
Although if that's your goal

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.970
what I'm about to discuss
will be relevant to that,

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:49.970
but rather to offset some of
the normal decline in strength

00:34:49.991 --> 00:34:53.450
and posture and the ability
to generate a large range

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.580
of movement safely, that occurs as we age.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.930
As I mentioned at the
beginning of the episode

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.440
we just tend to lose function
in this neuromuscular system

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.570
as we get older.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.910
And doing things to offset that

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.115
has been shown again and
again, to be beneficial

00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:11.470
for the neuromuscular system
for protection of injury,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.860
for enhancing the strength
of bones and bone density.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.000
So there are a lot of reasons
to use resistance exercise

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.340
that extend far beyond just the desire

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.020
to increase muscle size
because I know many

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.760
of you are interested in
increasing muscle size,

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.850
but many of you are not.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.480
So there's an important
principle of muscle physiology

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.810
called the Henneman size principle.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.410
And the Henneman size
principle essentially says

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:40.090
that we recruit what
are called motor units.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.830
Motor units are just the connections

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.230
between nerve and muscle from in a pattern

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.270
that staircases from low
threshold to high threshold.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.880
What this means is when you
pick up something that is light,

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.340
you're going to use the
minimum amount of nerve

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.100
to muscle energy in
order to move that thing.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.474
Likewise, when you pick
up an object that's heavy,

00:36:03.474 --> 00:36:06.200
you're going to use the
minimum amount of nerve

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.280
to muscle connectivity and energy

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.820
in order to move that object.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.830
So it's basically a conservation
of energy principle.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:19.430
Now, if you continue to
exert effort of movement,

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.120
what will happen is you will tend

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.830
to recruit more and more
motor units with time.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.670
And that process of
recruiting more neurons,

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.360
more lower motor neurons

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.470
if you recall from the
beginning of the episode,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.260
these lower motor neurons
are in our spinal cord

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.760
and they actually dump a
chemical acetylcholine on muscle,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.520
caused the muscles to contract.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.880
As you recruit more and
more of these motor units,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.040
these connections between these

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.810
lower motor neurons and muscle,

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:48.760
that's when you start to
get changes in the muscle.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.030
That's when you open the
gate for the potential

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.860
for the muscles to get
stronger and to get larger,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.460
if that's what your goal is.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.020
And so the way this process works

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.730
has been badly misunderstood

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.190
in the kind of online
literature of weight training

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.100
and bodybuilding, and
even in sports physiology.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.080
The Henneman size principle is kind of

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.500
a foundational principle
within muscle physiology

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.210
but many people have come
to interpret it by saying

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.740
that the way to recruit
high threshold motor units,

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.290
the ones that are hard to get to

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.800
is to just use heavy weights.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.980
And that's actually not the case

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.290
as we'll talk about the research supports

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:35.290
that weights in a very large
range of sort of a percentage

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.220
of your maximum, anywhere from 30% to 80%.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.150
So weights that are not very
light but are moderately light,

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.740
too heavy can cause
changes in the connections

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.240
between nerve and muscle that lead

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.520
to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:57.290
Put differently, heavyweights
can help build muscle

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.890
and strength but they are not required.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.710
What one has to do is adhere

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.450
to a certain number of parameters,

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.520
just a couple of key variables
that I'll spell out for you.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.330
And if you do that, you can greatly

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:12.190
increase muscle hypertrophy, muscle size

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.820
and or muscle strength if
that's what you want to do.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.680
And you don't necessarily
have to use heavy weights

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.770
in order to do that.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.250
Now, I'm sure the power lifters

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.490
and the people that like to
move heavy weights around

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.500
will say, no, if you want to get strong

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.630
you absolutely have to lift heavy weights.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.630
And that might be true if
you want to get very strong

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.830
but for most people who are interested

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.300
in supporting their muscular
such that they offset

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.980
any age related decline in strength,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.190
or in increasing hypertrophy
and strength to some degree,

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.720
there really isn't a need

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.410
to lie about the Henneman size principle

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.070
which many people out there are doing

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.240
and claiming that you absolutely need

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.740
to use the heaviest weights possible

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.430
in order to build strength and muscle.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.950
So I'm going to explain all
of this works in simple terms.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:02.410
So first of all, let's just
talk about what hypertrophy is

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.389
and what strength changes
in the muscle are.

00:39:05.389 --> 00:39:07.800
We can make this very simple as well.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.570
If this were a muscle physiology class

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.320
we would talk all about myofibrils

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.770
and sarcomeres and all that stuff.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.603
We're not going to do that.

00:39:14.603 --> 00:39:17.210
That's not the purpose
of today's conversation.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.670
If you're interested in that

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.620
as well as a lot of the other information

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.520
that I'm going to discuss in more detail,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.340
I highly encourage you to
check out the YouTube channel

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.310
and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.570
He's a PhD and a full professor
in exercise physiology.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.780
He's extremely knowledgeable
in this entire area

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.590
of science-based tools for hypertrophy,

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.670
how strength and hypertrophy really work.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.140
His lab does everything
from biopsy on muscles,

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.890
working with athletes and
typical folks as well.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.550
A lot of the information
that you're going to hear

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.410
from me in the next 15 minutes or so

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.960
comes from an extensive
exploration of the work

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.010
that he and his colleagues
have done as well

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.570
as folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic who's superb

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.620
in this whole space of muscle physiology

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.170
and from a lengthy conversation
that I had with Andy,

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.200
Dr. Galpin prior to this episode.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.660
So if we want to think
about muscle hypertrophy,

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.430
we have to ask what is changing

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.260
when muscles get larger or stronger.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.830
And there are really just three ways

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.520
that muscles can be stimulated to change.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.860
So let's review those three ways

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.350
and talk about what
happens inside the muscle.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.380
So there are three major stimulate

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.460
for changing the way that muscle works

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.540
and making muscles stronger,
larger, or better in some way.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.913
And those are stress, tension, and damage.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.400
Those three things don't
necessarily all have to be present

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.690
but stress of some kind has to exist.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.540
Something has to be different

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.400
in the way that the nerve communicates

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.650
with the muscle and the way
that the muscle contracts

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:55.010
or performs that makes
the muscle need to change.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.080
So this is very reminiscent of
neuroplasticity in the brain.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.160
Something needs to happen.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.810
Certain chemicals need to be present.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.810
Certain processes need to happen

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.600
or else a tissue simply
won't change itself.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.700
But if those processes
and events do happen,

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.220
then the tissue has
essentially no option except,

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.710
but to change.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.950
So muscles move, as I mentioned

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.700
because nerves dump
chemical onto the muscles

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.550
but they move because they
have these things called myosin

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.580
and actin filaments.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.040
And if you want to read up on this,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.360
you can look on the internet

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.240
you can put the sliding filament theory

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.430
of muscle contraction if you
really want to go deep down

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.380
that rabbit hole.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.340
It's interesting.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.100
You can learn about this in
a muscle physiology class.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.308
But basically, along
the length of the muscle

00:41:41.308 --> 00:41:43.230
you have, what's called myosin.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.798
And just think of myosin
as kind of like a wire.

00:41:46.798 --> 00:41:49.610
It's like a bunch of beads and wires

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.230
that extend across the muscle.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.460
I think that's the simplest
way to describe it.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.100
And the myosin is surrounded

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.293
by these little beads called actin.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.630
The way muscles get bigger is

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.770
that basically the myosin gets thicker.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.649
It's a protein and it gets thicker.

00:42:07.649 --> 00:42:10.330
So put this in your mind
if you're listening to this

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.330
or even if you're watching it on YouTube,

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.987
the way to think about this
whole actin myosin thing

00:42:13.987 --> 00:42:16.150
and thing and muscles
getting bigger is imagine

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.940
that you're holding a bouquet of balloons,

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.130
a bunch of balloons by their strings

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.730
except you're not holding the
strings all at their bottom.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.390
So the bouquet isn't nicely arranged.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.080
It's not like some balloons
that are all up at the top

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.520
and you're holding the
strings down at the bottom.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.130
Imagine that one of the
balloons that is very close

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.360
to your hand and other one
is a little bit higher up.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.350
And so this bouquet is very disorganized.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.730
In other words, the string
extending out of your hand

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.610
the strings rather
extending out of your hand

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.070
are all different lengths.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.950
And so the balloons
are all over the place.

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:49.280
That's essentially what myosin
looks like in the muscle.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.920
And those strings are what
we call the filaments,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.060
and then the myosin head is the balloon.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.630
When you stress a muscle properly,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.950
or you give it sufficient tension,

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.340
or you damage the muscle just enough,

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.650
there's an adaptive
response that takes place

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.470
where protein is synthesized.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.400
And it's a very specific
protein, it's myosin.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.950
The myosin gets thicker.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.440
In other words, the balloons get bigger.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.830
So the way to think about muscle growth

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.230
and the way to think about
muscles getting stronger is

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.940
that those balloons get bigger
and the muscle gets thicker.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.240
Now, the question then should be as always

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.400
how does that happen?

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.710
I mean, the muscle doesn't
really know anything

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.370
about what's happening
in the outside world.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.590
The way it happens is
the nerve, the neuron has

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.220
to tell the muscle to get stronger.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.310
And it does that through what
we call a signaling cascade.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.070
It talks to the muscle
in terms of chemicals.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.630
It doesn't whisper to it or
shout or Hey, get bigger.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.900
What it does it release
a certain chemicals

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.219
that within the muscle,

00:43:53.219 --> 00:43:55.150
there are certain
chemicals released rather

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.940
that make those balloons
as I'm referring to them,

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.570
the myosin get thicker.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.260
So let's talk about the
stimulus for doing that.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.760
And if already in your
mind, you're imagining

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.297
oh my goodness, these balloons of muscle

00:44:06.297 --> 00:44:07.940
are going to get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick,

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.760
and it's just going to
spiral out of control,

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.720
don't worry about that.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.630
People invest a ton of time and energy

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.700
into trying to make their muscles larger.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.830
It's actually much harder for people to do

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.080
than you might think.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.000
But I do want to give one
exception because it illustrates

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.930
an important principle of
where we're headed next.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:29.930
Everybody has imbalances
in how muscles can grow.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.240
How well muscles can grow, or how poorly,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.870
or how challenging it is
for their muscles to grow.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:41.750
Now, many people who are afraid
of like getting too bulky

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.750
for instance, are afraid
of lifting weights.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.780
But I think the research
shows now that every one

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.450
of pretty much every age should be doing

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.180
some sort of resistance exercise

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.540
even if that's body weight exercises

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.229
in order to offset this
age-related decline

00:44:55.229 --> 00:44:57.470
in muscle contractile ability,

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.600
muscle strength, et cetera,
improve bone density.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.100
There's nothing good about
getting frail and weak over time.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.416
And people who invest the effort

00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:10.980
into doing resistance
exercises of some kind

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.590
whether or not it's with
bands or with weights

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.820
or with body weight,
really benefit tremendously

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.270
at a whole body level at a systemic level

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.363
as well as in terms of muscle strength.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:25.490
There is a good predictor of how well

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.577
or how efficient you will
be in building the strength

00:45:28.577 --> 00:45:32.220
and or if you like the
size of a given muscle.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.860
And it has everything to do
with those upper motor neurons

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.280
that are involved in
deliberate control of muscle.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.490
You can actually do this test right now.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.660
You can just kind of March
across your body mentally

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.970
and see whether or not you
can independently contract any

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.370
or all of your muscles.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.820
So for instance, if you
are sitting in a chair

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.640
or a you're standing,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.640
see whether or not you can
contract your calf muscle

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.560
just using those upper motor
neuron, sending a signal down

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.780
and deliberately
isolating the calf muscle.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.090
If you can contract the calf muscle hard

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.480
to the point where that
muscle almost feels

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.390
like it's starting to cramp

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.430
like it hurts just a little bit,

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.290
that can be extremely painful

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.670
nor is it going to have
no sensation whatsoever,

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:17.400
chances are you have very good

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.330
upper motor neuron to calf control.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.740
And chances are, if you can isolate that

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.610
what they call the brain
or mind muscle connection,

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.590
and you can contract the muscles

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.840
to the point where it cramps a little bit,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.080
that you hold a decent to high potential

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.370
to change the strength and
the size of that muscle

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.980
if you train it properly.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.020
Now, if you have a hard time doing that,

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.330
chances are you won't be able to do that.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.730
If for instance, you
focus on your back muscle.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.170
Like we all have these
muscles called the lat.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.020
The latissimus dorsi muscles,
which basically are involved

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.947
in chin ups and things like that,

00:46:53.947 --> 00:46:58.240
but their function from a more
of a kinesiology standpoint

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.560
is to move the elbow back behind the body.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.049
So it's not about flexing your bicep.

00:47:03.049 --> 00:47:05.330
It's about moving your
elbow back behind your body.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.570
If you can do that, mentally

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.380
or you can do that physical movement

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.260
of moving your elbow back behind your body

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.160
and you can contract that muscle hard,

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.730
chances are that you have the capacity

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.580
to enhance the strength and or size

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.310
of that particular muscle

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.580
because you have the neural
control of that muscle.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.770
This is a key feature of
the neuromuscular system

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.310
to appreciate as we begin to talk more

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.530
about specific protocols.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.210
Because everything about
muscle hypertrophy,

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.100
about stimulating muscle growth is

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.290
about generating isolated contractions

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:47.290
about challenging specific
muscles in a very unnatural way.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.150
Whereas with strength, it's
about using musculature

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.500
as a system moving
weights, moving resistance,

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.683
moving the body.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.290
The specific goal of hypertrophy is

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.290
to isolate specific
nerve to muscle pathways

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.380
so that you stimulate the chemical

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.490
and signaling transduction
events in muscle

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.380
so that those muscles
respond by getting larger.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.030
So there's a critical distinction

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.570
in terms of getting stronger versus trying

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.870
to get muscles to be
larger hypertrophy per se.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:21.400
And it has to do with how much
you isolate those muscles.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.480
Muscle isolation is not
a natural phenomenon.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.840
It's not something that we normally do.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.830
When we walk we don't think,
okay, right calf contract,

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:29.940
left calf contract.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.110
No, you just generate
those rhythmic movements.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.640
And of course, there's no
reason for them to get stronger

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.750
or larger in response to those movements.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.430
Let's say you were to do a
kind of strange experiment

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.640
of attaching 30 pound
weights to your ankles.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.650
And you were to do those movements.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.930
Well, if you weren't specifically
contracting your calves

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.280
in each step, there's
no reason for the calves

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.510
to take on the bulk of the work.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.130
And you would distribute that
work across your hip flexors

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.560
and other aspects of your musculature.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.530
Your whole nervous system
seeks to gain efficiency.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.240
It seeks to spread out the effort.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.760
So you can nest this as
a principle for yourself

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.810
which is if you want to get stronger

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:10.580
it's really about moving
progressively greater loads

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.130
or increasing the amount
of weight that you move.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.260
Whereas if you're specifically interested

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.570
in generating hypertrophy,
it's all about trying

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.810
to generate those really hard,

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:24.210
almost painful localized
contractions of muscle.

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:25.820
Now, of course, how much weight you use

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.550
in order to generate those contractions

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.860
will also impact hypertrophy.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.930
But I think most people
don't really understand

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.140
the mind muscle connection.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.660
It sounds like a great thing,

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.660
but it's actually one of
the things you want to avoid

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.470
if your goal is simply
to become more supple

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.860
or to become stronger.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.940
You want to do the movements
properly and safely, of course

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.860
but it's the opposite of hypertrophy

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.890
where with hypertrophy
you're really trying to make

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:53.810
that particular muscle
sometimes two muscles

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.610
do the majority, if not all the work

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.410
whereas in moving force loads

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.100
in trying to generate activity of any kind

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.530
like lifting a bar, doing
a chin up or something

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.760
those so-called compound
movements involve a lot

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.018
of muscle groups.

00:50:08.018 --> 00:50:10.930
If your goal is to be better at those,

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.700
you want to avoid isolating
any one particular muscle.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.010
Now, I know this probably comes across

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.760
as a kind of obvious duh,
especially to the folks

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.290
who have spent a lot of time in the gym

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:24.220
aimed at getting hypertrophy.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.770
But I think most people don't appreciate

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.710
that it's the nerve to muscle connections

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.210
and the distinction
between isolating nerve

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:33.190
to muscle connections
versus distributing the work

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.800
of nerve to muscle connections,

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.850
that's vital in determining whether or not

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.070
you generate hypertrophy isolated nerve

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.818
to muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:41.818 --> 00:50:44.200
and offsetting strength loss

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.430
which would be distributed
nerve to muscle connections.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.870
If ever there was an
area of practical science

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:53.290
that was very confused,
very controversial,

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.570
and almost combative at times,

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.290
it would be this issue
of how best to train.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.010
I suppose the only thing
that's even more barbed wire

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:04.080
of a conversation than that
is how best to eat for health.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.070
Those seem to be the two most common areas

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:11.370
of online battle and the
scientific literature

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.720
has a lot to say about
both of those things.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.470
Again, my sources for
what I'm about to tell you

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.261
are Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues.

00:51:19.261 --> 00:51:21.470
I know there are other
excellent people out there

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.610
in the field, but I really trust his work.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.420
He does very controlled studies.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.790
He spent a lot of time in this space

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:29.540
and what's really exciting is that

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.873
in just the last three years or so,

00:51:31.873 --> 00:51:34.340
there's been a tremendous
amount of information

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.100
to come out about the practical
steps that one can take

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.059
in order to maximize the benefits

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:43.320
of resistance exercise of any kind.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.760
So I'm going to talk about those

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.340
and I'm going to talk about the research.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.270
I will provide some links,
a couple of the more

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.580
in-depth tutorials from
Dr. Galpin, as well as some

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.620
of the papers that the
information I'm about

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.853
to tell you stems from.

00:51:58.679 --> 00:52:00.870
There's a lot of information saying

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:05.150
that you need to move
weights that are 80 to 90%

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.810
of your one rep maximum
or 70%, or cycle that

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.840
for three weeks on and then
go to more moderate weights.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.700
There are a lot of
paths as some people say

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.190
there are a lot of ways to
add up numbers to get a 100.

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.790
There's a near infinite number of ways

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.260
to add up different
numbers to get to a 100.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.330
And what's very clear now

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.730
from all the literature that's transpired

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:27.240
and especially from the literature
in this last three years,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:32.240
is that once you know roughly
your one repetition maximum,

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.570
the maximum amount of
weight that you can perform

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.880
an exercise with for one repetition

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.960
in good form, full range of motion,

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.370
that it's very clear that moving weights

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:51.180
or using bands or using
body weight, for instance

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.760
in the 30% to 80% of one-rep maximum.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.450
That is going to be the
most beneficial range

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.680
in terms of muscle
hypertrophy and strength.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.550
So muscle growth and strength.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:04.100
And there will be a bias
if you're moving weights

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.040
that are in the 75%, 80% range

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.780
or maybe even going above that 85 and 90%,

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.460
you're going to bias your improvements

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.830
towards strength gains.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.010
This is true.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.470
And if you use weights that are in the 30%

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:20.970
of your one-repetition
maximum or 40% or 50%

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:23.400
and doing many more
repetitions, of course,

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.760
then you are biasing towards hypertrophy

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.970
and what some people like
to call muscle endurance.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.990
But that's a little bit
of a complicated term

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:33.040
because endurance, we almost
always think of as relating

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.530
to running or swimming or
some long bouts of activity.

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.470
So 30% to 80% of one-repetition maximums,

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:41.850
it doesn't really seem to matter

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.800
for sake of hypertrophy,
except at the far ends

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.360
when you're really trying
to bias for strength.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.350
Now, it is clear, however

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.280
that one needs to perform those sets

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:57.724
to failure where you can't
perform another repetition

00:53:57.724 --> 00:54:01.780
in good form again or near to failure.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.710
And there's all sorts of
interesting nomenclature

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.490
that's popping up all over the internet.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.980
Some of which is scientific,
some of which is not scientific

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.700
about how you are supposed to perceive

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.060
how close you were to failure, et cetera.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.960
But there are some very
interesting principles

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.380
that relate to how the
nerves connect to the muscles

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.780
that strongly predict
whether or not this exercise

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.510
that you're performing will
be beneficial for you or not.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:24.930
So here's how it goes.

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:27.500
For individuals that are untrained

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.280
meaning they have been
doing resistance exercise

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.150
for anywhere from zero,
probably out to about two years,

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.910
although for some people, it
might be zero to one year,

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:39.580
but those are the so-called beginners.

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.350
They're sort of untrained.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:44.150
For those people, the
key parameter seems to be

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:47.640
to perform enough sets of a given exercise

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.380
per muscle per week.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.680
The same is also true for
people that have been training

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.670
for one or two years or more.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:58.019
What differs is how many sets to perform

00:54:58.019 --> 00:55:00.110
depending on whether or not
you're trained or untrained.

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:00.943
So let's say you're somebody

00:55:00.943 --> 00:55:03.830
who's been doing some
resistance exercise kind of

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.280
on and off over the years
and you decide you want

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.140
to get serious about
that for sake of sport

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.863
or offsetting age related
declines in strength,

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.670
the range of sets to do in
order to improve strength

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.220
to activate these cascades
in the muscle ranges anywhere

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.600
from two, believe it
or not to 20 per week.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.110
Again, these are sets per week

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.530
and they don't necessarily
all have to be performed

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:28.747
in the same weight training session.

00:55:28.747 --> 00:55:31.290
I will talk about numbers of sessions.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:36.290
So it appears that five sets
per week in this 30% to 80%

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.360
of the one repetition maximum range,

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.590
getting close to failure,
or occasionally actually

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:47.650
going to full muscular
failure, which isn't really

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.350
full muscular failure, but the inability

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.890
to generate a contraction of the muscle

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.550
or move the weight in good form.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.860
I'll go deeper into that in a moment.

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.190
But about five sets per
week is what's required

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:58.940
just to maintain your muscle.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:59.860
So think about that.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.230
If you're somebody who's kind of averse

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.970
to resistance training,
you are going to lose

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.360
muscle size and strength.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.480
Your metabolism will drop.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.130
Your posture will get worse.

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.300
Everything in the context of nerve

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.963
to muscle conductivity
will get worse over time,

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:18.850
unless you are generating
five sets or more

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:24.090
of this 30% to 80% of your one
repetition maximum per week.

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.360
So what this means is
for the typical person

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.790
who hasn't done a lot of weight training,

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:31.550
you need to do at least
five sets per muscle group.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.480
Now, that's just to maintain.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.090
And then there's this huge range

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:36.380
that goes all the way up to 15

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.670
and in some case, 20 sets per week.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:41.830
Now, how many sets you
perform is going to depend

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:45.130
on the intensity of the
work that you perform.

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:47.160
This is where it gets a
little bit controversial

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.040
but I think nowadays most people agree

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.960
and Dr. Galpin confirmed
that 10% not to be confused

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.900
with the 10% we discussed
earlier, but 10% of the sets

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:04.900
of a given workout or
10% of workouts overall

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.560
should be of the high-intensity sort

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.770
where one is actually
working to muscular failure.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:11.770
Now I say not true muscular failure

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:14.510
because in theory you
have a concentric movement

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:15.960
which is the kind of
lifting of the weight,

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.380
and then you have the ecentric portion

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.260
of muscle contraction,
which is the lowering.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.660
And ecentric movements because of the way

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.410
that muscle fibers lengthen
and that sliding act myosin

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:26.560
that we talked about before,

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.900
you're always stronger
in lowering something

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.550
than you are in lifting it.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:34.640
But the point being that
most of your training

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.760
most of your sets should
be not to failure.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.170
And the reason for that is it
allows you to do more volume

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:46.130
of work without fatiguing
the nervous system

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.700
and depleting the nerve
to muscle connection

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.710
in ways that are detrimental.

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:52.940
So we can make this simple.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.100
Perform anywhere from 5 to 15 sets

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.313
of resistance exercise per week,

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.790
and that's per muscle, and
that's in this 30% to 80%

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:05.530
of what your one-repetition maximum.

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.830
That seems to be the most
scientifically supported way

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:12.580
of offsetting any decline
in muscle strength

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.550
if you're working in the
kind of five set range

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:17.140
and in increasing muscle strength

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:21.400
when you start to get up
into the 10 and 15 set range.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.420
Now, the caveat to that is everyone varies

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.513
and muscles vary in terms
of their recover ability.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.390
Depending on how well you
can control the contraction

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:33.650
of muscles deliberately.

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:36.020
And you can actually figure
that out by sort of marching,

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:36.980
you might take five minutes

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.360
and just kind of March across your body

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.680
and mentally try and
control the contractions

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.400
of muscles in a very deliberate way

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.650
to the point where you can
generate a hard contraction.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.770
And you may have to move a limb

00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:47.850
in order to do this, by the way.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.790
I'm not talking about just
mentally contracting your bicep

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:51.710
without moving your wrist.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.060
I'm talking about doing
that without any weight

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.830
in hand or any band or any resistance.

00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:59.450
If you can generate a
high intensity contraction

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:00.780
using these upper motor neuron

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.843
to lower motor neuron pathways to muscle,

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:09.350
you might think, well I
should perform many more sets.

00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:12.121
But actually, the opposite is true.

00:59:12.121 --> 00:59:15.520
If you can generate high-intensity
muscular contractions

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.760
using your brain, using your neurons,

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:22.300
it will take fewer sets in
order to stimulate the muscle

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.560
to maintain itself and
to stimulate the muscle

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.200
in order to grow or get stronger.

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.250
So the more efficient you are
in recruiting motor units,

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.030
remember, Henneman's size principle

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:36.180
the recruit men have more motor units

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:37.460
which isn't just muscles,

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.180
it's nerve to muscle connections.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.360
The better you are at doing that, the more

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.940
you will recruit these so-called
high threshold motor units

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.510
the ones that are hard to get to,

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:47.680
the more you will kick
off the cascades of things

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:52.250
within muscle that stimulate
muscle growth and strength.

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:56.310
So if you have muscles that
are challenging to contract,

00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:58.220
it's going to take more sets

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.490
in order to stimulate the desired effect

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:04.460
in those muscles not fewer.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.320
If you have muscles that you are very good

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.580
at generating force within,
it's going to take fewer sets.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.620
Now, how many sets you are
going to have to determine that

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.520
it's going to depend for
those of you that are using

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.520
like 50% of your one-repetition maximum,

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.350
because you're doing a lot of repetitions,

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.170
you might find that
three or four, five sets

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.140
will maintain the muscle.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.610
You might decide to do that once

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:28.530
at one point in the week
and then do it again.

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:29.760
So if you're going for 10 sets a week

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.290
you can divide that among two sessions.

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:33.830
You could do that all in one session.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.800
The data really show it doesn't matter.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.860
There are some differences in terms of

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.410
whether or not you're trying
to generate maximum intensity

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.430
within a workout or whether or not

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.270
you want to spread that out.

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.200
But in general, resistance workouts

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.329
of any kind tend to be best favored

01:00:48.329 --> 01:00:50.530
by workouts that are somewhere

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.750
between 45 minutes and 60 minutes.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.720
And generally not longer than 60 minutes

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.200
because that's when all
the things like cortisol

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.710
and some of the inflammatory
pathways really start

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:04.090
to create a situation in
the muscle and in the body

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:05.460
that's not so great for you.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.690
So it's not a hard and fast rule.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.170
The ax doesn't drop at 60 minutes

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.680
but it's pretty clear
that performing this five

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.700
to 15 sets per week, whether
or not it's in one workout

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.010
or whether that's divided
up across multiple workouts

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.560
is really what's going
to be most beneficial.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.790
And please do keep in mind
Henneman's size principle

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:24.100
and the recruitment of motor units.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.700
And remember the better you are

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.200
at contracting particular muscles

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.740
in an isolating those muscles,

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.910
the fewer sets likely you need to do

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:33.300
in order to get the desired effect.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.460
Now, what about people who
have been training for a while?

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.730
If you're somebody who's been doing

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:40.490
weight training for a while,
the data points to the fact

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:43.920
that more volume can be
beneficial, even for muscles

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.210
that you are very
efficient at contracting.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:50.450
Now, the curve on this, the graph on this

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.840
begins again at about five sets per week

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.580
for maintaining a given muscle group,

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:59.180
and extends all the way out
to 25 or 30 sets per week.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.710
However, there are individuals
who for whatever reason

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.300
can generate so much force.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.524
They're so good at training muscles

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:10.970
that they can generate so
much force in just four

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:14.140
or six or eight sets that
doing this large volume

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.690
of work is actually going
to be counterproductive.

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.240
So everyone needs to
figure out for themselves.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.720
First of all, how often you're willing

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.220
to do resistance exercise of any kind.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.230
And again, it doesn't
matter if you're using bands

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.540
or weights or body weight.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.380
For instance, if you're
doing chin-ups chances are

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.520
unless you are very strong
that you're not using weights.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.820
You're just using something
that you can hold onto.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:38.020
Or if you're doing pushups,
some of you will be working

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.680
in that 30% to 80% of your
one-repetition maximum range.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.940
It doesn't necessarily mean

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:46.260
that you have to be moving
weights in a gym for instance.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.170
So the purpose here is to figure out

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.930
what muscles you're trying to train.

01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:53.150
That's an issue that we'll
talk about in a moment.

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:54.870
And then it does appear that somewhere

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:59.870
between five and 15 sets
per week is going to be

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:01.890
the thing that's going
to work for most people.

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:03.960
Now, this is based on a
tremendous amount of work

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.720
that was done by Andy
Galpin and colleagues,

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.570
Brad Schoenfeld and colleagues
and others, Mike Roberts.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.610
There's a huge group of people

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.830
out there doing exercise
physiology and a small subset

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:20.270
of them that are linking them
back to real-world protocols

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:22.220
that don't just pertain to athletes.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.000
So that's mainly what
I'm focusing on today.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.200
And surely there will be exceptions.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.530
Now, if you are going to
divide the sets across the week

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:32.560
you're not going to do
all 10 sets for instance

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.580
for a given muscle group in one session,

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.170
then of course, it's imperative

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:38.240
that the muscles recover
in between sessions.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.070
And we are going to talk about recovery

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:43.270
both at the systemic level,
the whole nervous system

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.080
and at the local level the nerve to muscle

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.820
and local even muscle level.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.416
We'll talk about that in about 10 minutes

01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:51.580
when we talk about recovery.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.590
I do want to mention
something very important

01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:55.740
which is that everything
I'm referring to here

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.800
it has to do with full range of motion.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.140
And you might ask, well, what
about the speeds of movements?

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.080
This is actually turns out

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.210
to be a really interesting dataset

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:08.030
for generating explosiveness and speed.

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.640
So for sprinters or throwing sports,

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.680
or for people that want to
generate a lot of jumping power,

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.220
it does appear that
learning to move weights

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.330
as fast as you safely can,
especially under moderate

01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:24.900
to heavy loads, can increase
explosiveness and speed.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.900
And most of that effect is
from changes in the neurons.

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:31.970
It's not from changes in the muscle.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:34.900
It's from changes in the way
that the upper motor neurons

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.250
communicate with the lower motor neurons

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:41.110
and generating a pathway, a
neural circuit, as we call it,

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:44.490
that is very efficient at
generating action potentials,

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:46.380
which are the electricity within neurons

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.320
to trigger the muscle.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.700
Now, of course there
are events that happen

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.920
from nerve to muscle

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.660
but the takeaway from that
enormous literature, frankly

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.480
is that if you want to get faster,

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.560
yes, it can be beneficial to get stronger.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.070
But if you want to dedicate
resistance training specifically

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:08.070
to jumping higher, to running
faster, to throwing further

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.380
and these sorts of things that
learning to generate force

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.973
with increasing speed is
going to be beneficial.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.980
On the flip side of that

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.690
for people that want to get stronger,

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:22.030
it appears that the
slowing down of the weight

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.590
as things get harder is a key parameter

01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:27.050
in recruiting those high
threshold motor units.

01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:29.450
So let me phrase that a
little bit differently.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:31.030
Think about a set in the gym

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.610
or think about a set of
pushups or a set of pull-ups.

01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:36.780
Initially you can move
very fast if you like.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.300
If you want to generate hypertrophy,

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.860
the goal really is not
necessarily to move super slow

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:41.693
but to isolate the muscle

01:05:41.693 --> 01:05:43.680
and therefore not to use momentum rather

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.890
than lift weights, as they
say, challenge muscles.

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.100
If you want to get stronger,

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.700
you're going to be
distributing that effort

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.320
over more muscles and more
of your nervous system.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.720
For generating explosiveness and speed,

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.210
it's very clear that learning
to generate forces quickly

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:03.080
and to move heavy or
moderately heavy loads quickly

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.880
is going to be beneficial
because of the way

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.270
that you train the motor neurons.

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:09.320
And of course changes in the muscle.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.280
But this could look different
for different sports.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.310
And obviously you want
to make safety paramount.

01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:15.660
If you're injured, you're
not going to be able

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:19.710
to train at all for sport
or for any purpose that is.

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:23.590
And so what this would involve
is something like 60% to 75%

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:26.530
of a one-repetition maximum,
and then in a controlled way

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:30.330
moving that as quickly as one
can throughout the entire set.

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:32.470
And certainly not going to failure

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:33.980
because as you approach failure,

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.180
the inability to move the
weight with good form,

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.270
the weight inevitably slows down.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:41.130
In fact, there are a lot
of new technologies now

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.880
that are focused on informing people

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.460
of how quickly the bar
or weight is moving.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.940
I saw an advertisement
for this the other day.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.460
There are things that
people can attach to bars

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.293
that will literally speak to you

01:06:52.293 --> 01:06:54.380
as you're doing a set and inform you

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:58.370
whether or not you're moving
four times more slowly per rep

01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:59.520
than you were at the beginning.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.440
And trying to hone in on
the exact speed of movement.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.600
In talking to these experts
prior to this episode

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.560
it does appear that for
sake of hypertrophy,

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.410
as long as you're not
moving the muscle so quickly

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:12.980
that you start to distribute the effort

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:15.070
to lots of other muscles,

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:20.070
it doesn't really matter
because as the set gets harder,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.760
the motor units that you
recruit will increase the number

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.620
of neurons that you recruit

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.470
and the number of muscle
fibers and particularly

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:28.580
these high threshold muscle
fibers will increase.

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.810
And so it's really only
for purposes of hypertrophy

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:34.450
that you really need to be concerned about

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.120
how quickly the weight is slowing down.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.900
However, if you're trying to
get faster, more explosive

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.300
and generate more speed and
jumping power, throwing power

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.520
things of that sort, you never
really want to use a weight

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.210
or get to a portion of the set

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:51.390
where you're moving the
bar very, very slowly.

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:52.620
And I'm sure as I say that some

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.810
of the exercise physiologists

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.640
and advanced trainers out there will come

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.320
after me with pitchforks, which is fine.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.950
I'd love to see the literature that shows

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.870
that low gear slow movements
with very heavy weights

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.750
can indeed improve explosiveness.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.480
And that may in fact be the case,

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.210
but the data that I was able
to access was essentially

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.010
as I described just a moment ago.

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.790
So as you're probably
starting to realize you need

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:16.330
to customize a resistance practice

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:18.350
for your particular needs and goals.

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.100
And I certainly am not
the first to suggest

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.150
that people periodize their training.

01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:24.250
That they do things from anywhere

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.757
from one month to six months,
and to see how it goes

01:08:26.757 --> 01:08:29.380
and to make modifications as they go.

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:31.430
Because the nervous system in particular

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:34.220
the neuromuscular system
changes very quickly

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.390
at the beginning of training.

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:37.930
In fact, some of the
changes that one can see

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:42.930
when they first embrace or
start resistance training

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:46.430
can be very remarkable, but
they tend to slow over time.

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:47.890
So we've talked about a few principles.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.820
The fact that you need
to get sufficient volume,

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.440
you need at least five sets to maintain

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.580
and you probably need about
10 sets per muscle group

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.400
in order to improve muscle.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.900
That moving weights of moderate

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.160
to moderately heavy weight quickly

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.650
is going to be best for explosiveness.

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:04.430
The isolating muscles and
really contracting muscles hard

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.470
something that you can test by just

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:08.190
when you're outside the training session,

01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:10.200
seeing whether or not you
can cramp the muscle hard

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.070
will tell you your capacity
to improve hypertrophy

01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:18.090
or to engage strength
changes in that muscle.

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:21.010
That your ability to
contract a muscle hard is

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:24.100
inversely related to the number
of sets that you should do

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.620
in order to isolate and
stimulate that muscle.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.520
And there are some other
things that can enhance

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.260
the whole process of building
nerve to muscle connections,

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.780
making them more efficient
and generating if you like

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.120
more strength and hypertrophy.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.740
One of them I loath to say I was told

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.620
is in between set contractions.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.560
The other name for this is the people

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.290
in the gym does typically
seem to be guys in the gym

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:54.470
flexing their muscles in between sets.

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:57.680
And indeed the research supports the fact

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.250
that contractions have about 30 seconds

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.270
in between the actual work sets,

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:05.320
they're not going to
favor better performance

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.207
on the work sets, if anything

01:10:06.207 --> 01:10:07.890
they're going to compromise them.

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:10.720
But those hard contractions
in between sets

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.450
for a variety of reasons related
to local muscle metabolism

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:16.100
as well as what we talked about before

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.090
which are stress, tension, and damage,

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.920
they seem to improve
stress, tension, and damage

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.490
and the nerve to muscle contraction

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:24.500
in ways that facilitate hypertrophy.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.020
In other words, if you
see that person flexing

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.720
in between sets in the gym,

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.490
provided that they're
really isolating that muscle

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:35.260
and provided it's one that
they ought to be improving,

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.380
not one of these people

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.070
that always skips leg day type of people.

01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:40.830
These people are highly asymmetric

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:42.560
although that's up to them,

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.290
that process of flexing
in between sets does seem

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.900
to improve the nerve to muscle connection

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.050
and enhance hypertrophy.

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:54.070
And I say I was low to say it
because nowadays with phones

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:58.500
it seems like the end of
every set includes a selfie

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.350
sort of like the 11th rep of every set.

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:01.183
I like to joke.

01:11:01.183 --> 01:11:03.670
It seems like very few people
are capable of actually going

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.910
into the gym and doing a workout

01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:07.150
without taking a picture of themselves,

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:10.060
which I think is fine
if that's your thing.

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.010
Although I must say that
the athletes that I know

01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:15.270
and even the recreational
athletes that I know

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.540
who seem to get the most
out of their training

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.130
and who also seem to get the most out

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:20.320
of other aspects of their life,

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.180
seem to be able to control
their phone behavior

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.140
both in the gym and outside of the gym.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.920
But that's more of an
editorial point there.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.050
In an earlier episode,

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.760
I talked about estrogen and testosterone.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.670
And during that discussion, I talked about

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.370
the use of resistance
exercise specifically

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:39.310
for increasing testosterone,
both in men and in women.

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:44.130
And indeed that is a powerful
effect of resistance exercise.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:48.680
And indeed it's mediated by the
nerve to muscle connections.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.270
We talked about that in
that earlier episode.

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.140
I just want to briefly
mention that protocol

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.640
since it's distinctly different

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.030
from the other protocols
I've talked about today.

01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:59.870
The protocols I've talked
about today thus far

01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:04.470
of explosive movements or of
hypertrophy-based training

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.520
provided the training
is 60 minutes or less

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.410
will cause increases in serum testosterone

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:12.970
that's been shown over and over again.

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:16.610
And if the session extends
too long, past 75 minutes

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:19.650
and is of sufficiently
high intensity chances are

01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:22.010
testosterone levels will start to drop

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:24.430
and cortisol levels will go up

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.500
in ways that can be
detrimental to recovery

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.720
and the goals of the training.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.140
But that's different than training

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.790
that's specifically geared
toward increasing testosterone.

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:36.810
Duncan French, who's one of the directors

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.770
of the UFC Performance Center,

01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:40.250
when he was a graduate student

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:43.090
at University of Connecticut
Stores did some beautiful work.

01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:46.690
He and his colleagues found
the ideal training protocols

01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:48.810
for stimulating testosterone release

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:50.910
which is something that
many people want to do

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:52.620
for a variety of reasons.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:57.620
And that involved doing
six sets of 10 repetitions

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.270
even if it requires lightening the weight

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:06.060
on one set to the next,
with about two minutes

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.290
120 seconds rest in between sets.

01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:12.580
Which if you think of about
it is pretty short rest

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.530
and is pretty darn hard work.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:16.830
Now, what's interesting is that

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.780
there's a very limited threshold

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.160
for increasing testosterone.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.110
That protocol of six sets
of 10 repetitions led

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:28.010
to these big increases
in serum testosterone.

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:29.900
But if people did 10 sets of 10

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.290
so just four more repetitions per set,

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:34.470
then testosterone did not increase.

01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:35.560
In fact, you got more of this

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.330
catabolic cortisol like pathway.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.250
You get other benefits from this

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:41.200
so-called 10 sets of 10 protocol,

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.080
but not the testosterone increase

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.990
and maybe even reductions in testosterone.

01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:47.090
Now, it's important to point out that

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:50.330
that six sets of 10 was done
with big compound movements.

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:53.060
So things like squats,
or deadlifts, or chin-ups

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.140
or things of that sort.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:56.380
And those were done as single sessions

01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:00.517
not in concert with a bunch
of other exercise, although

01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:03.000
if athletes are doing
that, there's no reason

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.600
why they couldn't also do other types

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.780
of training elsewhere in the week.

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.430
I asked Duncan about this
and he mentioned that

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:11.400
that done twice a week
is probably the maximum

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.190
that anyone could do that

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:16.570
and still maintain this
increase in testosterone.

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:18.630
It's a very interesting protocol

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:22.750
because as a neuroscientist, it's amazing

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.653
to me that six sets of 10
repetitions with something,

01:14:28.217 --> 01:14:30.350
causes a distinctly different result

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:32.000
in terms of hormone output

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.950
than 10 sets of 10 of
the exact same movement.

01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:38.680
And it speaks to the
exquisite way in which nerve

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.500
to muscle connections
dictate the whole physiology

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.010
of your entire system.

01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:46.560
If there's a theme that I really
want to bring forward today

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.410
is that weight training or
resistance training of any kind

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:53.740
is really used for
either systemic effects.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.180
10% of training done where
you're feeling that burn

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.920
which means lactate will be present

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.450
and sending signals to your brain,

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:01.970
and your heart and your
liver that are beneficial

01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:05.250
or isolating muscles
which may also generate

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:10.250
a kind of a lactate which is
associated with the burn result

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:13.100
but that isolation of
muscles distinctly different.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.280
So systemic versus isolated.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.030
Those are the two general ways

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.620
in which resistance
training can be applied.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.500
So I just wanted to mention
that earlier protocol

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.390
because it's well supported
by the literature.

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:26.700
If you were to incorporate that protocol,

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.330
you might ask, well, then can you do any

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:29.650
other weight training during the week?

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.410
And sure, of course you can
provided you're recovering.

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.360
So let's talk about how you
know if you're recovering.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.000
How you know if a muscle is recovered

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.500
and how you know if your
whole system is recovered.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.045
Because recovery is what
dictates whether or not

01:15:42.045 --> 01:15:44.820
you can come back and do more
work of a different kind.

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:48.430
Meaning, I don't know, you
do a leg training one day,

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:49.940
can you and should you come back

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.350
and do the upper body training day?

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:55.140
And it dictates whether or
not you'll see any improvement

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.030
from session to session at all.

01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:58.310
Before I talk about recovery

01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:00.480
I just want to make sure
I nailed down the details

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.190
that I was able to extract
from the literature

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:05.610
and from my conversation with Dr. Galpin.

01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:08.950
If you're wondering how
quickly to perform repetitions

01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:11.520
for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.120
anywhere from a half a
second per repetition

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.200
all the way up to eight
seconds per repetition,

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.260
it doesn't seem to matter.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.170
Again, if you're thinking
about explosiveness

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.190
or building speed, or you're specifically

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:24.500
using resistance training
to build endurance,

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.420
that's a separate matter.

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.210
We talked about explosiveness and speed.

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:29.420
I'll talk about endurance
in a few moments.

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.407
We also talked about in
between set contractions

01:16:32.407 --> 01:16:34.780
the so called selfie effect

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.970
of people flexing a particular muscle,

01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:39.380
isolating a particular
muscle between sets,

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.040
just want to mention that
would be a terrible thing to do

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.230
if your goal is performance on sets.

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.940
So moving a particular amount of weight.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.050
That's actually going to
diminish the amount of weight

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:50.010
that you can move.

01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:51.678
It's going to enhance muscle growth

01:16:51.678 --> 01:16:53.500
and it's going to enhance the nerve

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.080
to muscle isolation of
that particular pathway.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.500
So again, that flexing
between sets is going

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.820
to favor hypertrophy, not performance.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.230
If you're trying to get stronger,

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:07.590
you're trying to move more weights,

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:09.140
you're trying to distribute work,

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.070
and you're trying to
do maybe skill training

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:13.590
with resistance then flexing between sets

01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:16.560
is absolutely the wrong thing
to do for obvious reasons

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.190
you're fatiguing the muscle further.

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:21.150
Just remaining still or
walking around a little bit

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:23.540
has been shown to be beneficial in terms

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.890
of moving some of the
lactate out of the muscle

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:28.150
as well as just recovering between sets.

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:30.810
Now, how long to recover
between sets, is a question.

01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:33.680
For the testosterone protocol,
Duncan French and colleagues

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.350
found that it was about
two minutes keeping

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:38.580
that really on the clock,
two minutes not longer.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:41.120
For hypertrophy and for strength gains,

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.760
it does seem that resting
anywhere from two minutes

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.170
or even three or four,
even five or six minutes

01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:48.210
can be beneficial.

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.980
And if you're interested
in expanding the volume

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.900
of work that you can do in a given session

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.280
at high capacity at high
intensity, with a given weight,

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.810
please see the episode that I did

01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:02.120
on cold and performance about
supercharging performance

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.640
which is based on the work of my colleague

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.230
Craig Heller in the Biology
Department at Stanford,

01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:07.840
which talks about Palmer Cooling,

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.590
about how you can cool
the core of the body best

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:14.160
through the palms using these
particular venous portals

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.730
that are only present in your hands.

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:20.070
People are now doing this with
ice packs or with gel packs.

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.500
There are a number of
different ways one can do this.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.260
I talk all about that in that episode.

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.320
It allows you to do more repetitions

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.120
and more work at a given weight over time.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.580
So rather than getting 10 repetitions

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.820
and then eight and then seven and then six

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.850
through proper use of palmer cooling,

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:39.117
one can do 10, 10, 10,
10, and even add sets.

01:18:39.117 --> 01:18:41.380
And that's one way that one can accomplish

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.040
higher volume work without having

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.141
to drop the weight considerably.

01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:48.060
So that's where you can
hit that really sweet spot

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.270
if that's your goal of getting strong

01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:52.240
and generating some hypertrophy.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.210
Because as soon as you have
to drop to lighter weights,

01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:58.337
then you're shifting
more towards hypertrophy

01:18:58.337 --> 01:19:01.470
and endurance and less toward
strength of any given muscle.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.270
So check out that episode.

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:06.690
The last thing besides
between set contractions

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:08.760
and whether or not
you're distributing work

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.350
or whether or not you're really
trying to isolate muscles

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:14.370
is this notion of pre-exhausting muscles.

01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:16.369
It's been shown over and over again

01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:20.400
that for instance, if you
want to generate force

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.480
in a given muscle and really isolate that,

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.190
doing the isolation work
before a compound movement.

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:28.090
So this would be leg extensions

01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:28.923
the thing where you sit

01:19:28.923 --> 01:19:31.400
and you extend your toes
up toward the ceiling.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.090
Leg extensions before
squats will allow the squats

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.500
to target that muscle
group more effectively.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.174
And that makes perfectly
good sense based on

01:19:40.174 --> 01:19:43.060
the Henneman's size principle
and fatiguing motor units.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.810
It should be obvious why that's the case.

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:48.330
But of course that's going
to be anti performance

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:50.050
in terms of how much weight you can lift,

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:51.750
and maybe even the form
that you can maintain

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:53.810
when you move to the
bigger compound movement.

01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:56.160
So you really have to ask
yourself a number of questions.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.030
How good are you at
isolating a given muscle?

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.200
Therefore, how many
sets do you want to do?

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.730
How often are you willing to train

01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:05.540
therefore, how many
sets are you going to do

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.740
in a given session versus
how many are you going

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.490
to distribute across the week?

01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:10.920
Are you aiming for performance?

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.480
Are you going to distribute that work

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.550
across the nervous system and musculature?

01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:15.710
Are you trying to move weights?

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.210
Are you trying to challenge muscles?

01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:18.830
If you're trying to challenge muscles,

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:20.660
then you really want to focus on things

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.550
like this pre exhausting the isolation

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:24.580
of a muscle before the compound movement.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.410
Your performance on compound movements

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:29.420
will absolutely suffer but your ability

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.529
to isolate that muscle
and generate hypertrophy

01:20:31.529 --> 01:20:34.410
through the accumulation of larger myosin,

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:36.950
those bigger balloons, will benefit.

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:39.540
And once again, if you're
trying to get faster

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.480
than the speed of the
movement really matters.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.990
So how do we know if we've recovered?

01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:45.600
How can we test recovery?

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.980
And this is not just recovery
from resistance training,

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:51.270
this is recovery from running,
recovery from swimming.

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:53.220
Up until now I've been talking
about resistance training

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.720
more or less in a vacuum.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.780
I haven't even touched on the fact

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.970
that many people are running

01:20:57.970 --> 01:20:59.440
and they're doing resistance training

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.550
or they're swimming and they're
doing resistance training.

01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:06.110
It's not simply the case that
if a given muscle is fatigued

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:07.620
you can just work other muscles.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:11.440
Because even if you've
beautifully isolated a muscle,

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.420
let's say you have incredible abilities

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:17.020
to isolate just your
quadriceps for instance

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.340
and you do a workout where
you isolate your quadriceps

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.040
you do your six sets of intense work

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.280
or maybe use palmer cooling,

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.820
and you're able to do
12 sets of intense work

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.710
and you're done, and that muscle group

01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:30.670
the next day is certainly
not going to be recovered

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:33.270
unless you're somebody who's
extraordinary at recovery

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:36.060
or you're enhancing your
recovery through chemical means

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.080
which we'll talk about at the end.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.610
Well, you can assess systemic recovery

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.700
meaning your nervous system.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.980
And your nervous system's
ability to generate force

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.310
both distributed and isolated
through three main tests.

01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:54.310
And fortunately, these
tests are very simple

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.460
and two of them are essentially zero cost,

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.733
require no equipment.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.670
HRV, heart rate variability
has made its way finally

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:07.240
into the forefront of exercise physiology

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.420
and even into the popular discussion.

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:11.320
I've talked about HRV before.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.470
How when we exhale, our
heart rate slows down

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:14.710
because of the way that our diaphragm

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:16.480
is connected to our heart and to our brain

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.920
and the way our brain is
connected to our heart.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.430
When we inhale our heart rate speeds up

01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:24.010
and that is the basis of
heart rate variability.

01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:26.210
Heart rate variability is good.

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:28.520
It means that you're breathing properly,

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.310
and when I say it's good it means

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:32.350
you want a lot of heart rate variability.

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:34.910
You don't want a heart rate that is high

01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:37.280
or low consistently over time.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.230
That might come as a bit
of a surprise for you

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:41.150
endurance athletes,
who probably are trying

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:44.200
to accomplish your endurance
work at a steady cadence

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.690
to really hit that nice sweet spot

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:47.090
where you're breathing rhythmically,

01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:48.360
your heart rate's going rhythmically.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.850
You're in that steady heart rate,

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:51.020
and then away from exercise,

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.260
you have a nice low
heart rate as they say.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.920
Well, nice low heart rate isn't
necessarily always so nice.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.580
Turns out the introducing bouts

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.600
of increasing your heart
rate during exercise

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.390
and even through your waking day,

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:04.993
through stressful events
even is provided their brief

01:23:04.993 --> 01:23:06.450
is beneficial.

01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:10.800
A good nerve to heart system benefits

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.530
from being able to increase heart rate

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:13.470
and decrease heart rate.

01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:15.810
Heart rate variability is good.

01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:17.010
So you don't want high heart rate,

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:20.000
you don't want low
heart rate all the time.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.980
But heart rate variability is difficult

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.320
for a lot of people to measure.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.420
There are some devices that
will allow you to do that.

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.970
Various watches and devices.

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:31.140
There are more devices becoming
available all the time.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.770
Hopefully soon, some that are integrated

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:34.750
with your phone that involve no contact

01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:36.700
or anything on your body.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:41.330
But those do carry some costs
and they are not perfect yet.

01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:44.240
The measures of heart rate
variability that one can use

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:47.880
while in movement are still in that phase

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.310
I would say of technology development

01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:52.370
where everyone isn't using
them, let's leave it at that.

01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:53.620
There are two measures however,

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.520
whether or not you
recovered that you can use

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.690
first thing in the
morning when you wake up,

01:23:57.690 --> 01:23:59.670
maybe after five, 10 minutes, if you like,

01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:02.060
but ideally right when you wake up

01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.760
in order to assess how
well recovered you are

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.710
and therefore whether
or not you should train

01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:09.040
your whole system at all that day.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.957
The first one his grip strength.

01:24:11.957 --> 01:24:15.500
Grip strength, the
ability to generate force

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.260
at the level of squeezing the fist

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.520
or squeezing down on something,

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.440
might seem like kind of a trivial way

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.980
to assess recovery but
it's not because it relates

01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.730
to your ability to use
your upper motor neurons

01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:28.280
to control your lower motor neurons

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.760
and to generate isolated force.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.560
So that's really what you're
assessing when you do that.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.670
Some people will use
one of these grip tools

01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:41.670
or Costello has this toy
that's shaped like a donut

01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:43.770
and it's this hard rubber.

01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:45.110
And I've tried this before.

01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:47.690
If I've been working really
hard, not sleeping very well,

01:24:47.690 --> 01:24:48.800
or I've been training a lot

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.580
any one or combination of
those things, my grip suffers.

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:53.330
I can't actually squeeze that thing down

01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:55.520
as much as I can Costello
because he was born

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.046
with like a 24 inch neck

01:24:57.046 --> 01:24:59.300
even though he's never touched a weight

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.380
somehow he can just
clamp down on that thing,

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.720
and he can turn it into
a pancake with ease

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.080
and he likes to chuckle while
I struggle with this thing.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.680
But on a good day, I
can squeeze this thing

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.280
so that I eliminate the hole
in the donut so to speak.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.280
You can also take a floor
scale and squeeze the scale

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:18.490
and see how much force you can generate.

01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:20.830
I would do that as a baseline to establish

01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:23.010
what you can do when you're well rested.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:24.220
And then if you do that in the morning,

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.670
you can see whether or not you're able

01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:27.440
to generate the same amount of force

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.410
or you could use over the
rubber donut or something.

01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:30.820
A lot of this is very subjective

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.800
with a scale you're
really trying to assess

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.100
whether or not you can generate
the same amount of force.

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:39.100
If you start seeing a 10% or
20% certainly reduction in that

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.290
that's concerning, it
means that your system,

01:25:41.290 --> 01:25:43.230
your nervous system as a whole

01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:46.720
it's not necessarily
fatigued, is that the pathways

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.640
from nerve to muscle
are still in the process

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.750
of rewiring themselves in
order to generate force.

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:55.150
And you might think, well, I
train one muscle group one day.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.620
Why am I having a hard time doing this

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.180
for a completely different muscle group?

01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:59.390
It doesn't make any sense.

01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:01.480
But there's something about
the upper motor neuron

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.070
to lower motor neuron pathway generally

01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.440
that allows you to use
something like grip strength

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:09.170
as a kind of a thermometer, if you will

01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:11.140
of your ability to recover.

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:13.570
So look for your ability
to generate force in grip

01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:14.870
when you first wake up.

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.370
It's not going to be as
good as it is at 3:00 PM

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.760
after a cup of coffee and a couple meals

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.690
but the point isn't performance overall,

01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:24.100
the point is to assess whether or not

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:27.210
you're getting better, worse
or the same from day to day.

01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:28.560
The other one that's really terrific

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.640
and the Andy Galpin's group is using.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.660
And I'm delighted about
this because it relates

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:34.950
to something that my lab is
very excited about as well

01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:36.950
is carbon dioxide tolerance.

01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:38.730
So this is a really interesting tool

01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:41.740
that endurance athletes, strength athletes

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.160
I think can all benefit from.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.166
In fact athletes and people of all kinds.

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:46.640
Even if you're not an athlete,

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.400
even if you're not exercising at all,

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.300
there's a good question of
whether or not your system

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.510
as a whole is doing okay or not.

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:54.870
We rely on the thermometer.

01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:56.090
Do we have a fever or not?

01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:58.040
We rely on subjective things.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.400
Do I feel good or not?

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.740
Am I digesting well or not?

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.930
Those are all subjective.

01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:06.480
The carbon dioxide tolerance test is,

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.950
its objective in that it
measures your capacity

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:12.270
to engage the so-called
parasympathetic arm

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:14.630
of your nervous system
which is the calming aspect

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:15.480
of your nervous system.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.730
And it measures your ability
to consciously control

01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:21.890
a particular skeletal muscle,
which is your diaphragm.

01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:24.560
So here's how you do the
carbon dioxide tolerance test.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.770
You wake up in the morning.

01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:27.840
If you have to use the
restroom first, do that,

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.290
but try and stay away from your phone.

01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:32.440
If you have your phone,
put it on airplane mode,

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.520
go to the timer or use a
hand watch or some other way

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.270
of measuring time, stay off social media

01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:40.540
for just a few seconds.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:41.810
It'll be okay.

01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:43.990
And what you're going to do
is you're going to inhale

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:45.900
through your nose as deeply as you can,

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.360
you can do this lying
down, sitting, whatever

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.733
inhale through your nose
and then exhale all the way.

01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.940
So that's one.

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.310
You're going to repeat that four times.

01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:02.050
So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

01:28:02.050 --> 01:28:05.140
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale four times.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.560
And ideally you're
inhaling through the nose

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.090
and you're exhaling through the mouth.

01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:10.840
That's just the beginning

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.380
of this carbon dioxide tolerance test.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:15.660
Then you take a fifth inhale

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.340
as deep as you can through your nose.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:19.095
Fill your lungs as much as you can,

01:28:19.095 --> 01:28:21.430
and if you can try and expand

01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:23.920
make your stomach go
out while you do that,

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.040
that means that your
diaphragm has really engaged.

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.100
So you're inhaling as
much as you possibly can.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:32.900
Then hit the timer and
your goal is to release

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.940
that air as slowly as
possible through your mouth.

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.570
So it looks like you have
a tiny, tiny little straw

01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:41.520
in your mouth and you're letting it go.

01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:47.000
As slowly as you possibly can.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.730
Measure what we call the
carbon dioxide blow off time

01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:52.053
or discard rate.

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.710
I know you can all sit with lungs empty

01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:59.900
after you eliminate all that
air, but don't lie to yourself.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.590
Don't stop the timer
when you've been sitting

01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:04.100
with your lungs empty for a while,

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.410
stop the timer when you
are finally no longer

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:09.943
able to exhale any more air.

01:29:11.176 --> 01:29:13.350
So you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:16.010
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly.

01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:18.010
I just said it quickly for sake of time

01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:21.630
then you can do this fifth
big inhale through your mouth,

01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:24.990
and then [deep exhale]

01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:28.440
And I'm not going to do
it for the full duration.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.540
And then you're measuring that time.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.880
Your carbon dioxide discard
rate will be somewhere

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.360
between one second and
presumably two minutes.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.563
Two minutes would be a heroic
carbon oxide discard time.

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.430
30 seconds would be more typical.

01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:47.800
20 seconds would be fast.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.240
If your carbon dioxide discard time

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.550
is 20 or 25 seconds or less,

01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:58.630
you are not necessarily recovered

01:29:58.630 --> 01:30:01.550
from your previous days activities.

01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:02.900
There's ways to push through this

01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:05.180
but hold onto that thought for a moment.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.890
If your carbon oxide
discard time is somewhere

01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:12.023
between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds,

01:30:12.976 --> 01:30:16.840
you are in what we would
call kind of the green zone

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:21.223
where you are in a position
to do more physical work.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.610
And if your carbon dioxide
discard time is somewhere

01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:28.520
between 65 and 120 seconds,

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.100
well then you have almost certainly

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.160
recovered your nervous system.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.650
I'm not talking about
the individual muscles

01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:37.700
but your nervous system is
prepared to do more work.

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.110
And Andy's Lab has great data on this

01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:41.920
as it relates to exercise physiology.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.070
I think that story should be out

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:44.840
in the not too distant future.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.400
My lab has been using
carbon oxide discard time

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.660
to look at anxiety and
recovery from bouts of anxiety.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.970
So two totally independent projects

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:54.710
but using the same measure.

01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:58.120
So you've got HRV, which
requires some technology usually.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.710
You've got grip strength,

01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:02.250
which you can assess subjectively

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:04.600
or you can use a floor scale

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.800
and now you have carbon dioxide tolerance.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.920
You want to do this in the
morning when you wake up

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.470
and keep track just write
down in a little book,

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:13.890
or maybe just keep tracking your mind

01:31:13.890 --> 01:31:15.860
of your carbon oxide discard time.

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:19.170
If you find that your
discard times are dropping

01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:22.810
even if they're in the
42nd range or 52nd range,

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:26.410
but normally you can do
75 seconds or 120 seconds.

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:30.880
If they're starting to drop
by anywhere from 15% to 20%,

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.480
you're veering in the
direction of not recovering.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.710
And I'm really keen on this tool

01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:38.870
because everybody has
different recovery abilities.

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:41.300
Some people are eating really
well and sleeping really well.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:42.610
Some people have minimal stress

01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:44.850
or can buffer stress really well.

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:48.880
Other people they dissolve
into a puddle of tears

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.800
if they read one text message
that's troubling or whatever.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.480
And I realize, and I
say that with sympathy,

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.250
I realize people have
varying levels of stress

01:31:57.250 --> 01:31:58.560
and demand in their life.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.430
It's just to to prescribe
an entire protocol

01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:03.840
that says, okay, yes
you should train today

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.500
and this is exactly what you should do.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.333
No, you shouldn't.

01:32:06.333 --> 01:32:08.870
Use carbon dioxide discard rate because a,

01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:10.940
it's valuable, it's informative.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:15.020
b, it's zero cost and c,

01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:17.460
it's something you can
track objectively over time.

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.780
And that's really the key.

01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:21.830
And I'd be remiss if I didn't say

01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:25.040
that what carbon dioxide
discard rate is tapping into

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.040
is your ability to mechanically
control your diaphragm

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.150
certainly that's one aspect of it,

01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:33.380
but that relates in a very
direct way to your ability

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:36.750
to put the brake on your stress system.

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:39.170
To engage the so-called parasympathetic

01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:41.940
or calming arm of your
autonomic nervous system.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:45.530
And another thing that Andy
Galpin's group is testing

01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:49.010
is at the offset of
training after your run,

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:50.890
after your weight training session,

01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:53.580
maybe even after your plyometrics session,

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.950
we didn't really talk
about jumping and throwing

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:57.210
and that sort of thing.

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:59.660
Maybe we'll talk about
it in a future episode.

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:04.660
But they and other groups,
including some elite athletes

01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:06.670
and other groups that are very interested

01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:10.230
in physical performance are using a tool

01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:12.780
where they deliberately disengaged

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.770
for five minutes at the end of training.

01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:18.620
They deliberately engage this
calming or parasympathetic arm

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:19.670
of the nervous system.

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:22.080
And you can do that through
any number of different tools.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.490
I'm a big fan of respiration tools

01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:25.780
'cause they're always available to you.

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.530
Your breathing is always there.

01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:29.850
I talk about some of these
tools in previous episodes

01:33:29.850 --> 01:33:32.830
but you could use things like
non sleep deep rest and SDR

01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:34.280
at the end of a training session.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.290
You could do 10 physiological size,

01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:40.220
double inhales through the
nose followed by long exhales,

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.470
that will definitely engage the

01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:44.690
parasympathetic nervous
system at the end of training.

01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:46.600
So rather than finish
your training session

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.623
and then just hop onto your phone,

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.720
serious athletes and people
who are serious about recovery

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:56.720
initiate that recovery at the
very end of their training

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.550
and they start to kickstart
that recovery process rather

01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:02.470
and they measure CO2
tolerance in the morning.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.210
So there are several
groups that are doing that.

01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:07.350
In fact, I know several
groups because I'm working

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:11.020
with them that are using
physiological size between sets

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.910
in order to recover their nervous system

01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:16.360
and maintain nerve to
muscle contractibility.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.950
Maintain focus throughout
their training session

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:22.240
enhance their focus by doing
a few physiological size.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.190
So double inhale, exhale in between sets.

01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:27.800
So they're getting very
focused and very intense

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.770
about their strength work
or explosiveness worker,

01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:31.430
muscle isolation work during their sets.

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:33.810
And then in between sets,
they're deliberately

01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:35.320
disengaging the nervous system,

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.620
and then they're re-engaging it again.

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.530
So I just wanted to emphasize that.

01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:41.560
So recovery is a complex process.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.000
It's got a lot of things

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.150
but the CO2 tolerance set
should be a valuable tool.

01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:47.810
Now, another tool for recovery

01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:49.500
that people are very excited about

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.570
is the use of cold and the ice bath.

01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:53.010
And this is important.

01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:56.500
If you are somebody who uses
cold through cold shower,

01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:59.330
or ice bath, or jumping
in a lake, or a river

01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:01.280
whatever it is that used to generate cold

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.660
as a recovery tool, you should be aware

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.730
that there are data
starting to emerge that

01:35:05.730 --> 01:35:09.070
if your goal is recovery
or strength improvements,

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:13.060
using cold within the four
hours following a workout.

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.533
I'm not talking about
palmer cooling, I'm talking

01:35:14.533 --> 01:35:17.980
about whole body cooling or
cooling from the neck down.

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.880
Yes, it will reduce inflammation.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.740
Yes, it will reduce the amount

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:24.610
of delayed on muscle soreness one readout

01:35:24.610 --> 01:35:27.100
of how intense or damaging
a given workout was

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.690
not the only readout,

01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:30.920
but it does seem to interfere with some

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.680
of the things like mTOR pathways,

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.800
the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.110
and other pathways
related to an inflammation

01:35:38.110 --> 01:35:41.480
that promote muscle
repair and muscle growth.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.930
Remember, stress, tension, and damage

01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:46.547
or the stimulus for nerve to
muscle connections to change

01:35:46.547 --> 01:35:49.260
and for muscles to get
bigger, stronger, and better.

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:52.180
And so if you're getting into
the ice bath after training

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:53.590
or taking a really cold shower

01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:55.350
after doing resistance training,

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:58.050
you are likely short-circuiting
the improvements

01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.620
that you're trying to create.

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.220
Now, athletes who are
trying to recover quickly

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:06.130
so that they can get back
into more training sessions,

01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:07.820
or let's say you're
somebody who doesn't really

01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:12.080
want to gain much strength or hypertrophy

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.910
and you're mainly focused on endurance

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:15.360
and you want to do more endurance work

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.220
and you've been weight training,

01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:19.050
well then exposing yourself
to cold can be beneficial,

01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:21.750
but you're not going to
get as great of benefits

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:23.520
from the resistance training.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.690
In other words, cold
after resistance training

01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:27.590
seems to short circuit
some of the benefits

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:29.120
of that resistance training.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.070
There are some other things

01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:31.650
that can short circuit the benefits

01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:33.283
of resistance training as well.

01:36:34.210 --> 01:36:37.010
One of those is anti-histamines.

01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:38.978
Some interesting data
were published recently.

01:36:38.978 --> 01:36:41.950
I believe it was in
scientific reports, yes

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:46.230
that showed that
anti-histamines can prevent some

01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:48.900
of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.180
of endurance type work
as running, swimming

01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:53.890
of fairly long duration
or even sprint type work,

01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:56.960
as well as inhibit some of
the processes associated

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.210
with resistance training.

01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:01.880
Remember, it resistance
training or endurance training,

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.280
that's a stimulus for stress

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:07.430
and the adaptation to that
stress is how you get better.

01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:08.880
That you can run further, faster,

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.730
lift more weight, hypertrophy
the muscle, et cetera.

01:37:12.730 --> 01:37:14.340
So anti-histamines can be a problem.

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.070
Obviously don't compromise your ability

01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:19.870
to breathe completely, but
anti-histamines generally work

01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:22.960
by blocking what are called
mast cells and M-A-S-T.

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.620
Mast cells are really interesting cells

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:27.950
that we'll talk about in our
month on neuro immune function.

01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:29.220
They travel in the bloodstream

01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:31.160
and these little packets that burst open

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.483
it sites of inflammation.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.230
Muscle damage and inflammation is a signal

01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:37.660
that something needs to change.

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.000
And so taking it to histamines
it appears can disrupt

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.650
some of that inflammatory process.

01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:44.170
So you actually want inflammation

01:37:44.170 --> 01:37:46.110
during and immediately after a workout,

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:48.930
then you want to bring
inflammation down later

01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:50.310
and I'll mention how to do that.

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:52.990
The other thing are non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs

01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:54.260
you know their trade names.

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.510
These are painkillers
that many people take.

01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:58.360
Those as I've mentioned
in a previous episode

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.960
can interfere with the
benefits of endurance training

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.000
and the benefits of resistance training.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.290
In addition to that,
they block pain signals

01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:09.090
and pain is a very good signal

01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:11.150
that you might be doing something wrong.

01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:13.540
And so while nobody likes to be in pain,

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:14.880
I suppose there are probably
a few people out there

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.610
like to be in pain, but
that's a different story

01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:18.420
but nobody likes to be in pain.

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.870
The non-steroid
anti-inflammatory the NSAIDs

01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:23.350
as they're called, and
the anti-histamines seem

01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:25.390
to prevent a lot of the gains

01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:28.370
the improvements in
endurance, strength and size

01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:31.660
that people are specifically
using exercise for.

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:33.360
So be cautious about your use

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.980
of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.510
especially within the four hours preceding

01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:41.560
or the four hours following exercise.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.330
So I hope you're starting
to get the picture.

01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:46.050
In order to change the
nerve to muscle connectivity

01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:47.849
in ways that will better serve you,

01:38:47.849 --> 01:38:51.870
you need a stressor
during the actual training

01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:54.770
which particular stressor
depends on your training goals.

01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:57.920
But that stressor is almost always going

01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.372
to be associated with inflammation,

01:38:59.372 --> 01:39:01.410
and then after the
training, you want to try

01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:03.620
and get into a state of
reduced inflammation.

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:07.030
And that's why you would
do some sort of protocol

01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:09.790
non sleep depressed which we
will link to in our caption

01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:12.330
or perhaps you would use the hypnosis app

01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:16.840
that we've talked about before
Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.500
There's a great app for
accessing deep rest states

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.060
or the physiological side
to try and get your system

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:27.120
to calm down after training.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.780
There are also tools that one
can use to reduce inflammation

01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:33.720
at a kind of foundational
level away from training.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.610
And these are tools that I've talked

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:39.560
about many times before, but
I'll just restate them again.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.160
The kind of Golden Three
according to Andy Galpin

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.870
and the ones that he recommends are

01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:46.520
sufficient omega-3s again,
that can be accomplished

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.590
through diet, through whole food intake

01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:50.390
or through supplementation or both.

01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:52.890
So in general, getting
above a 1,000 milligrams

01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:57.610
of EPA per day to keep
inflammation low or relatively low.

01:39:57.610 --> 01:40:01.970
Vitamin D and in some
cases, magnesium malate.

01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:04.350
Magnesium malate seems to
be particularly effective

01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:07.630
in offsetting delayed
onset muscle soreness.

01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:10.090
Soreness itself is not required

01:40:10.090 --> 01:40:13.890
for improvements in strength,
improvements in explosiveness,

01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:15.710
improvements in hypertrophy.

01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:16.543
That's a myth.

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:19.290
Now, if you do experience
delayed onset muscle soreness,

01:40:19.290 --> 01:40:23.300
chances are you stressed that
particular muscle pretty well

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:26.290
or even maybe to well, maybe
you stressed it too much

01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:28.460
and you need longer recovery.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:30.960
There's a total debate
out there about whether

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:33.410
or not you should train again
when a muscle is still sore.

01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:34.940
I think the general takeaway is, no

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.210
that means it's not recovered.

01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:38.710
And there are things
of course like massage,

01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:41.080
like fascial release
and things of that sort

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:46.080
sauna, cold that can perhaps
accelerate the movement

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.400
from soreness to not sore.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.660
But in general, the omega-3, vitamin D,

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:55.850
and magnesium malate trio
seemed to be an effective way

01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:58.530
to reduce inflammation at
kind of a systemic level.

01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:00.520
But remember you want
inflammation provided

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.890
you're not damaging the muscles so much

01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:04.200
that you're injured during
the training session

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.350
because that's the stimulus
for change in those muscles.

01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:10.250
I want to talk about a few other things

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:13.195
that support the process of
nerve to muscle communication

01:41:13.195 --> 01:41:15.850
and touch on some of the things that a lot

01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:19.230
of people are doing to try
to "enhance their workouts"

01:41:19.230 --> 01:41:20.820
and evaluate whether or not those are

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.480
in fact enhancing workouts or not.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:26.970
Because weight training,
unlike a lot of other forms

01:41:26.970 --> 01:41:30.950
of exercise has a unique aspect to it,

01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:33.330
which is this feature
that I guess some people

01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:35.720
call it the pump which is
the fact that blood goes

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:38.350
into the muscle when you
train, it's the only gun

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:40.010
of training where you
actually get a window

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:42.760
into what the result
might actually look like

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.560
before you actually
accomplish that result.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.560
So if you think about when
you go out for a hard run

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.270
and let's say you go
out for a two mile run,

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:50.970
let's say your goal is to break

01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:52.500
you want to do a sub ten two mile.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.750
Actually, when I went to university

01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:57.940
I was running cross country,
my senior year of high school

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:01.430
and I wanted to walk on
for the cross country team.

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:03.760
And so I went out there and turned out

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.430
you had to do a sub 10, two mile.

01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:09.410
And I think the best mile
I ever ran in high school

01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:11.350
was a 457, which isn't terrible.

01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:12.670
I can't do that now.

01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:14.638
It's not even close to what

01:42:14.638 --> 01:42:17.160
the best high school athletes can do now.

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.730
But that would have meant
doing it back-to-back.

01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:22.940
So it was sub 10 minute two
mile didn't even come close.

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.570
I told Costello this story the other day

01:42:24.570 --> 01:42:26.000
and he just kind of laughed at me.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.880
He was like, why would you
even want to run two miles?

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.610
Because Costello is
built almost exclusively

01:42:31.610 --> 01:42:33.450
of these type two fast twitch muscles

01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:35.050
they're designed for moving objects.

01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:36.610
He's incredibly strong.

01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:38.620
He has been since he was a puppy.

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.120
I mean that dog could
probably drag a tractor

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.350
if he wanted to, but
he can't really go far.

01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:46.631
Whereas a Greyhound or a Whippet

01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:48.800
or some of these other
sight hounds or scent hounds

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.633
can go, go, go.

01:42:49.633 --> 01:42:50.600
They have a higher percentage of the

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.810
so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers.

01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:55.030
They are much better at endurance.

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:58.830
So a sub-10 two mile would have
been very, very challenging,

01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:00.480
no chance I could have done that.

01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:03.350
I don't think even with a lot of training.

01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:08.300
But let's say that you want
to improve your performance

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.770
in a given type of exercise.

01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:12.370
Let's talk about some of
the things that seem to work

01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:17.050
across the board to improve
strength, improve hypertrophy,

01:43:17.050 --> 01:43:20.720
and improve nerve to muscle
communication and performance.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.640
The first thing that's absolutely key

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:25.890
for nerve to muscle communication
and physical performance

01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:28.630
of any kind might not
sound that exciting to you

01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:30.750
but it is very exciting.

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:32.033
And that's salt.

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:36.560
Nerves cells, neurons
communicate with each other

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:39.840
and communicate with
muscle by electricity.

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.530
But that electricity is generated
by particular ions moving

01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:45.160
into and out of the neuron.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:50.160
And the rushing in of a
particular ion, sodium, salt

01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:52.890
is what allows nerve cells to fire.

01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:55.880
If you don't have enough
salt in your system

01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.740
your neurons and your brain and your nerve

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.620
to muscle communication will be terrible.

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:03.720
If you have sufficient
salt, it will be excellent.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.320
How much salt will depend on
how much water you're drinking,

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.610
how much caffeine you're drinking,

01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:09.390
and how much food you're ingesting.

01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:11.960
And whether or not you're
taking any diuretics

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.270
how hot it is, et cetera,
how much you're sweating.

01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:16.040
So you want to make sure
that you have enough salt,

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:18.160
potassium and magnesium in your system

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.700
if you want to perform well.

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:23.370
I realized that salt isn't
very glamorous performance tool

01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:24.800
but it is a vital.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.040
Its absolutely vital.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.010
And the endurance athletes
and the people that train

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:30.950
in high heat can speak to the fact that

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:34.360
when your electrolytes are low,
your brain doesn't function,

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.070
your body doesn't function nearly as well.

01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:39.210
In fact, even for mental
work, for studying

01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:42.530
and for writing and for
doing math and coding,

01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:43.870
doing analytic work of any kind,

01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:46.870
even a hard conversation
that's important to you,

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:48.870
having sufficient electrolytes
is really going to help

01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:51.040
and being low on electrolytes won't help

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.360
and just drinking water won't help

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.640
because you need electrolytes.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.860
The other thing that's been
shown over and over again,

01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.940
a numerous well-controlled studies

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:03.370
to improve muscle performance is creatine.

01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:06.150
Early on there was a lot of
controversy about creatine

01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:08.610
but there are many studies
if you want, you can go

01:45:08.610 --> 01:45:10.900
to this website that
everyone now knows I love

01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:13.900
which is this free website examined.com

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:17.300
that there are no fewer
than 18 studies there.

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.350
66 studies...

01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:22.280
So 18 studies supporting
that muscle creating content

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.300
can be increased by ingesting creatine.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.250
How much creatine?

01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:28.440
Well, I asked the experts and they tell me

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:31.810
that for somebody who is about 180 pounds,

01:45:31.810 --> 01:45:35.160
five grams a day should
be sufficient or so.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.870
Heavier than 180, so if you got like

01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:39.740
if you're a 220 pound or 230 pound person,

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.610
10 to 15 grams of creatine.

01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:43.110
People lighter than 180 pounds

01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:45.900
maybe three to five grams of creatine

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.350
or even one to three grams.

01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:52.350
Creatine is a fuel source for
early in bouts of activity

01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.800
for high intensity activity.

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.970
It is also a fuel source
for neurons in the brain

01:45:57.970 --> 01:46:01.620
and it can have some
cognitive enhancing effects.

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.350
So creatine is a very
interesting molecule.

01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:06.103
Early on when it was
released as a supplement,

01:46:07.644 --> 01:46:09.620
it was thought that you had to load it

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.160
in higher dosages for a few days

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.210
and then maintain it at lower dosages.

01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:16.040
So you'd take 20 or 30 grams a day

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:17.900
then back off to five or 10.

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.030
It doesn't seem to be the case

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:20.010
that you can get all the benefits

01:46:20.010 --> 01:46:22.970
from taking the dosages at the low level.

01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:24.960
I just mentioned a few moments ago

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:27.010
as they relate to body weight throughout.

01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:30.290
So salt and electrolytes absolutely key.

01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:31.123
You need those present.

01:46:31.123 --> 01:46:32.490
You need to be well hydrated.

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:36.560
Creatine seems to have a
performance enhancing effect.

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.550
There are 66 studies, 66
showing that power output

01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:46.200
is greatly increased
anywhere from 1%2 to 20%.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.600
And this is sprinting and running

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.670
and jumping as well as
weightlifting by creatine.

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:54.530
The ability to hydrate
your body is improved

01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:58.120
by creating because of the
way that it brings more water

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.410
into cells of various kinds.

01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:03.610
As an indirect effect, it
can help in increasingly mass

01:47:03.610 --> 01:47:05.600
because of the way that it
brings more water into muscle

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.610
and probably also because of the way that

01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:09.360
if you get stronger, you
can generate more force

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.530
and generate more hypertrophy.

01:47:11.530 --> 01:47:13.030
It reduces fatigue.

01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:16.430
Seven studies have shown
that it reduces fatigue.

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:18.124
There are even some interesting effects

01:47:18.124 --> 01:47:20.650
on improving cognition after
traumatic brain injury.

01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:23.030
Although that's a serious
medical condition in situations

01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:25.860
you absolutely should talk to
a board certified physician

01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:28.860
before adding anything
or taking anything out

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.000
of your current regimen.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.740
There are a few other
effects that are interesting

01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:36.110
and notable, but the big ones
are the ones that I referred

01:47:36.110 --> 01:47:39.120
to before about increased
power output, et cetera.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.940
And I just want to emphasize

01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:43.260
that creatine can increase this hormone

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.130
that we talked about in
the testosterone episode,

01:47:45.130 --> 01:47:49.490
dihydrotestosterone which
is testosterone converted

01:47:49.490 --> 01:47:52.710
by five alpha reductase
into dihydrotestosterone.

01:47:52.710 --> 01:47:56.240
It's the more dominant androgen in humans.

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.280
Leads to increases in strength
and libido and so forth.

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.670
It also can increase
male pattern baldness.

01:48:01.670 --> 01:48:04.860
Some people, not everybody
experience some hair loss

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:06.520
with creatine other people don't.

01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.610
Some people experience
accelerated beard growth

01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:10.480
because basically [mumbles]

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.680
has the opposite effect on
hair follicles on the face

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:15.410
as it does on the scalp,
some people don't.

01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:18.600
Women who ingest creatine

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.320
there are essentially no data showing

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:23.920
that it increases hair
loss or facial hair growth,

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.560
but of course, everyone is different.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.980
So you can go to examine.com.

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:28.410
You can explore those studies.

01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:30.550
So creatine definitely a powerful

01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:32.280
performance enhancing molecule.

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:35.130
The other one, one that
personally I've never tried

01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:37.830
but that seems to have a very strong

01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:41.220
and well-supported
effects is beta-alanine.

01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:43.590
Now, beta-alanine is interesting

01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:45.210
because when you hear
about weight training

01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:47.220
you think about heavy
deadlifts and bench presses

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.130
all that kind of stuff
that people are doing.

01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:53.040
But beta-alanine seems to support exercise

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.080
that is of slightly longer duration.

01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:00.074
So a mix of anaerobic and
aerobic type movement.

01:49:00.074 --> 01:49:04.350
These are physical performance
in the 60 to 242nd range.

01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:07.090
So you can use your mind
and kind of figure out.

01:49:07.090 --> 01:49:09.940
Things that weights that limit you

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:11.693
to 8 to 15 repetitions.

01:49:11.693 --> 01:49:13.880
Cardiovascular exercise of the sort

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.130
like rowing or sprinting.

01:49:16.130 --> 01:49:18.940
So interval work, it seems to
help with that kind of work.

01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.100
So we're not talking about long runs,

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:21.880
we're not talking about heavy deadlifts.

01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.260
The standard dose is somewhere
between two and five grams,

01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:26.360
again, as always check with a doctor,

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.290
make sure these things are safe for you.

01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:29.570
I'm not responsible for your health.

01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:30.403
You are.

01:49:30.403 --> 01:49:31.480
I don't say that just to protect me.

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:34.290
I'd say that also to protect you

01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:38.150
but it really seems to
improve muscular endurance,

01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:41.980
improve anaerobic running
capacity, reduce fatigue.

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:43.090
There are even some interesting effects

01:49:43.090 --> 01:49:46.010
on reduction of body fat and
improvements in lean mass.

01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:49.350
So creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes,

01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:51.960
these are kind of the core three things

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.880
that seem to improve performance

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.920
and are well supported by
the scientific literature.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.760
And in the earlier episode
on supercharging performance

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.210
we talked about palmer cooling.

01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:03.900
That's certainly a
performance enhancing tool.

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.650
It's nothing you ingest
your cooling your palms

01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:07.000
in a very specific way.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:07.990
That's very powerful.

01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:10.450
Now, what about for longer
duration bouts of exercise?

01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:12.660
We've mainly been focusing
on resistance training,

01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.940
but what about for long runs, long swims,

01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.090
these kinds of things?

01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:19.330
Well, it does seem that
juice and ingesting things

01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:22.540
like arginine and citrulline
can improve performance

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.330
for those long bouts of exercise

01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:27.380
that's mainly going to be due to effects

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:29.700
of those compounds on vasodilation.

01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.300
It's going to open up the vasculature

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.750
and allow more blood flow.

01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:36.250
Do note that things like
citrulline and arginine

01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:39.960
can have some side effects if you will.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.130
They can increase the likelihood

01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:45.860
of having herpes cold sore
outbreaks on the mouth.

01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:48.650
The arginine is in the
pathway by which I don't know

01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:50.670
if people know this, but
the herpes virus lives

01:50:50.670 --> 01:50:54.120
on neurons of the trigeminal
nerve that innervates the lips

01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:57.570
and the eyes and the mucus
membranes of the face.

01:50:57.570 --> 01:51:00.070
So this is the herpes
type 1 simplex virus.

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:03.510
The virus lives on those neurons

01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:05.930
and then periodically
inflames those neurons,

01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:08.570
and that's what leads to the
cold sores seems like arginine

01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:12.350
and citrulline can lead
to increases in cold sores

01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:15.700
and canker sores, and
outbreaks of those kinds.

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:17.473
So you want to be aware of that.

01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:23.480
That's not everybody, and not
everybody is caring HSV-1,

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.370
just be aware that I think
it's now 80% or 90% of people

01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:31.900
by time they're 12 years old,
they've contracted HSV-1.

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:35.870
It's very contagious and
typically one outbreak,

01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:37.940
and then only under conditions of stress

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.960
or heightened arginine
or citrulline ingestion

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.420
we'll have them later.

01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:46.420
Again, this is not necessarily an STI,

01:51:48.442 --> 01:51:49.860
a sexually transmitted infection.

01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:52.850
This is an infection that
is passed very easily

01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:55.140
from mucous membranes, just
in terms of touching objects

01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:56.120
and things of that sort.

01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:59.010
Very common in the general population.

01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:03.200
Any discussion about muscle
and muscle performance

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.330
would not be adequate if
we didn't mention something

01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:06.400
about nutrition,

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.500
but rather than have a whole
discussion about nutrition,

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:11.370
'cause there's lots of
information about that online,

01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:12.790
for instance, if you want to gain muscle

01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:17.790
that you need to have a calorie
surplus of about 10 to 15%.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.600
You could have a calorie surplus of more.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:22.160
If you want to avoid gaining weight

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.730
then you would not create a
calorie surplus, et cetera.

01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:26.300
You can find all that information online.

01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:28.780
That's not what this
podcast is really about.

01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:31.400
We had a month where we talked a lot

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.410
about hormones and food and moods.

01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:35.300
We talked about foods, but more

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:36.810
as they relate to the nervous system.

01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:40.050
When it comes to supporting muscle.

01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:43.380
So supporting the synthesis of larger

01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:46.400
what I called myosin
balloons, it does seem

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.120
that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.360
of the essential amino acid leucine

01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.650
with each meal is important.

01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:56.890
Now, that does not necessarily
mean from supplements.

01:52:56.890 --> 01:53:01.620
In fact, most people recommend
that you get your protein,

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:03.100
you get your amino acids,

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:04.860
including your essential amino acids

01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:06.670
and your leucine from whole foods.

01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:10.260
High quality proteins aren't
high density proteins.

01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.093
What do you mean by that?

01:53:11.093 --> 01:53:15.010
Well, it is true that a lot of
sources of protein are found

01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:17.680
in things like beans and
nuts and things like that

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.820
that all the essential amino
acids can be found there

01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:25.470
but per unit calorie, if
it's in your practice,

01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:28.140
if it's in your ethics to
ingest animal proteins,

01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:31.700
it's true that for instance, 200 calories

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:34.450
of steak or chicken or fish or eggs

01:53:34.450 --> 01:53:37.150
will have a higher density
of essential amino acids

01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:40.880
than the equivalent amount of
calories from nuts or plants.

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.540
That's just simply the way it works.

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.320
So for the vegans and vegetarians

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.520
I'm certainly, I'm not
saying there's no way

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.170
that you can support muscle growth.

01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:49.430
You absolutely can.

01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:51.730
Some of them might want
to supplement leucine

01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:55.940
but this 700 to 3000
milligrams of leucine per meal

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:57.830
is one of the best ways that's been shown

01:53:57.830 --> 01:54:01.010
to support the synthesis of more myosin

01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:02.544
if your goal is hypertrophy

01:54:02.544 --> 01:54:05.730
and it's also the way that you
would support muscle repair

01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:07.360
if your goal is strength.

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.510
So that's specifically geared

01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:11.000
towards muscle hypertrophy and strength.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.380
And I encourage you to think

01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:15.440
about this protein density issue.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.440
And whether or not you ingest
animal proteins or you don't,

01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:23.610
to think about whether or
not you're getting sufficient

01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:27.030
essential amino acids, especially leucine.

01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:30.440
Now, many people have
addressed the question

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.410
of whether or not you need to
eat six or seven times a day.

01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:34.300
It turns out that you don't

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:35.950
that's kind of the old school thinking

01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:37.370
that you need to eat very frequently.

01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:40.610
I think for certain
athletes were very active

01:54:40.610 --> 01:54:42.790
for drug assisted meaning people

01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:44.410
that are enhancing their
testosterone levels

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:45.820
to super physiological levels,

01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:48.090
where they are experiencing
very heightened levels

01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:50.380
of protein synthesis and
they can utilize all that.

01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:51.260
That might make sense.

01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:52.670
Again, I'm not supporting the use

01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:54.240
of those performance enhancing drugs

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.530
but there are people doing that.

01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:59.030
And that's one of the reasons
why they eat so frequently.

01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:01.470
And so much protein for typical people

01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:04.340
who are not doing that, I
imagine most of you are not.

01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:07.657
Then it does appear that you need to eat

01:55:07.657 --> 01:55:10.420
but you don't need to eat
six or seven times a day.

01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:13.240
It does seem like not eating
once a day is also important.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.350
So somewhere between one meal
a day and six meals a day,

01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:18.300
lies the more reasonable two or three

01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:20.560
or maybe four times a day.

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.840
I think that a whole discussion
about this is warranted

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.000
and we'll have this
discussion with Dr. Galpin

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.990
at a future time of whether or not

01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:30.280
eating protein more frequently

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.050
can enhance this myosin synthesis.

01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:34.770
But I think the simple takeaway

01:55:34.770 --> 01:55:36.212
from the literature that
I was able to extract

01:55:36.212 --> 01:55:38.540
and from my discussion with him is,

01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:40.000
eating two to four times a day,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.581
making sure you're getting
sufficient amino acids

01:55:42.581 --> 01:55:45.140
in a way that's compatible
with your ethics

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:46.700
and with your nutritional regimen

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:50.490
is going to support muscle
repair, muscle growth

01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:53.550
strength improvements,
et cetera, just fine.

01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:55.670
There's one more thing
that I'd like to cover

01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:56.810
which is the relationship

01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:58.900
between particular kinds of exercise

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:02.653
and our ability to think and
perform cognitive functions.

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:06.720
We all hear that exercise
is so vital for our brain

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.670
that it supports our brain
health and our body health.

01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:12.440
And indeed that's true
provided it's done correctly.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.060
However, many of us are
familiar with the experience

01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:18.260
of going for a run or going for a swim

01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:20.158
or working out hard in
the gym, and then not

01:56:20.158 --> 01:56:23.180
being able to use our brain
to be essentially useless

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:26.260
for cognitive functions
for the rest of the day.

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.440
I discussed this with
Dr. Galpin this morning,

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.810
and I learned something very interesting,

01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:33.750
which is that hard bouts of exercise

01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:35.780
of the sort where you're
training near failure

01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:39.570
or you're generating focused
muscular contractions,

01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:42.120
for obsession that lasts anywhere

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.000
from, I don't know, 30, 45
minutes, maybe 60 minutes

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.900
or a long run where you're engaging

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.570
in some interval training during that run,

01:56:49.570 --> 01:56:53.570
after exercise, there's a
reduction in oxygenation

01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:54.403
of the brain.

01:56:54.403 --> 01:56:56.760
So there's actually a quite
significant dip in the amount

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.096
of oxygen that your neurons are getting

01:56:58.096 --> 01:57:00.460
and therefore your ability to think.

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:02.795
So it's important that
you control the intensity

01:57:02.795 --> 01:57:04.894
and the duration of your
training sessions so

01:57:04.894 --> 01:57:07.650
that you're still able to do well in life

01:57:07.650 --> 01:57:09.910
and lean to life the way you need to,

01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:12.190
because I'm guessing most of you are not

01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:14.380
in a position to just prioritize
your physical training

01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:16.780
you also need to use your minds.

01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:19.100
I'm certainly familiar with
wanting to get exercise

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.480
but also the requirement of needing

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:23.623
to perform cognitive
work throughout the day.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.810
It also turns out that you can leverage

01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:29.220
something interesting
about exercise and nerve

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:31.990
to muscle work in ways that can benefit

01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:33.950
cognitive function and focus.

01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:36.330
And it has to do with
the way that your body

01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:38.580
and your nervous system predict bouts

01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:40.360
of intense focused effort.

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.660
So let's say you're doing
resistance training two

01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:44.800
or three times a week,
maybe even four times a week

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.293
and you're doing it
consistently at a given time.

01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:51.830
There are clocks,
literally biological clocks

01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:54.040
within the liver and within the brain

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.973
that learn to predict that
focus and that intense work.

01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:02.843
If you are trying to get
intense cognitive work done,

01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:06.470
you might try scheduling
that cognitive work

01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:09.340
on the days when you
don't do physical training

01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:11.630
at the same time when
you normally would do

01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:14.740
that intense, focused physical training.

01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:16.560
Because the systems of the body

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.170
that generate acetylcholine release

01:58:18.170 --> 01:58:20.130
and other neuromodulators, the systems,

01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:22.713
of the body and brain that
generate focused effort,

01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:26.230
those are on this sort of clock mechanism

01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:28.800
in a way that you likely will find

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:31.160
that after just a week of
training at regular times

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.780
you will be able to focus
readily on other things

01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:36.840
when you're not training
provided you do it

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.679
during the period of time of day

01:58:38.679 --> 01:58:40.910
when you normally would train.

01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:43.440
So is kind of an indirect positive effect.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.400
You're harnessing the focus
and the expectation of focus

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.950
in your nervous system for
that particular time of day.

01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:50.740
And of course, we'd be remiss

01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:53.210
if we didn't talk about
time of day for training.

01:58:53.210 --> 01:58:56.810
It turns out that whether or
not you train in the morning

01:58:56.810 --> 01:58:59.460
or in the afternoon, it
doesn't really seem to matter

01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:02.790
for sake of things like hypertrophy
and strength, et cetera.

01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:04.210
Everyone seems to have a time of day

01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:06.020
that they prefer to train.

01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:07.820
I've said before and their reasons

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:10.460
based on body temperature rhythms

01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:14.790
and cortisol release
that training 30 minutes,

01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:17.940
three hours or 11 hours
after your normal waking time

01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:20.040
can be very beneficial and can provide

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.890
a sort of predictability or regularity

01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:25.300
to when your body will be ready to train

01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:27.840
and best apt to train well.

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:29.040
There is some evidence that training

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.450
in the afternoon is
better for performance,

01:59:31.450 --> 01:59:33.363
whereas training for
body composition changes

01:59:33.363 --> 01:59:35.640
and strain changes, et cetera

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:37.160
doesn't really matter when you train.

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.910
So you also want to make
it compatible with sleep,

01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:40.580
compatible with work that really gets

01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:42.600
down into the wits of optimization.

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.130
But I think it's interesting to note

01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:47.180
that if you're going to
train at a regular time,

01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:50.260
you can take the days when you don't train

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:52.930
and use that to enhance
your cognitive focus

01:59:52.930 --> 01:59:55.390
for things that have
nothing to do with exercise.

01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:56.620
So this might be writing, or reading,

01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:58.750
or music, or math, et cetera.

01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:00.997
Typically, I restrict
these podcast episodes

02:00:00.997 --> 02:00:02.730
to about 90 minutes.

02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:04.660
So called ultradian cycle for learning.

02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.983
Today was a bit longer.

02:00:05.983 --> 02:00:09.580
And I admit that I tried
to pack a lot into this.

02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:11.750
It is the last episode in this month

02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:12.900
on physical performance.

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:15.380
I figured in this case more is better

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:18.200
especially since everything
is time-stamped for you.

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:20.450
You certainly don't have
to watch it all at once

02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:22.460
and you can come back to
it over and over again

02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:25.170
into the precise locations
in the episode that you like

02:00:25.170 --> 02:00:27.870
in order to take notes or
extract the information

02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:29.250
that you need.

02:00:29.250 --> 02:00:32.800
I'd like to point you
to Dr. Andy Galpin page.

02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:35.540
I highly recommend looking into the work

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:37.700
that he's doing if you want more details.

02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:40.310
He's very, very skilled,
excellent communicator.

02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:41.490
He superb at what he does.

02:00:41.490 --> 02:00:42.323
He's a professor.

02:00:42.323 --> 02:00:43.330
He works with athletes.

02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:45.720
He works with typical
folks in the exercise

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:47.360
and muscle physiology world.

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:48.420
Brad Schoenfelds work.

02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:49.630
I also have a lot of respect for.

02:00:49.630 --> 02:00:50.463
I've never met him.

02:00:50.463 --> 02:00:51.296
I don't know him.

02:00:51.296 --> 02:00:52.550
There's no paid endorsement here.

02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:55.290
They're not sponsors are related
to the podcast in any way.

02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:57.810
I just think the work
is of very high quality

02:00:57.810 --> 02:00:59.280
and they're both on the academic side

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.197
and the practical side.

02:01:00.197 --> 02:01:02.780
And of course there are
other people out there

02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:04.993
doing fabulous work in this area as well.

02:01:06.230 --> 02:01:08.130
If you like this podcast
and you're benefiting

02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:09.700
from the information that you're learning

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:11.800
and you want to support us, the simplest

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.320
and most straightforward way
to do that is a zero cost way

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:18.910
which is subscribe to
the podcast on YouTube.

02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:20.730
Click the Subscribe button

02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:23.870
and to subscribe on Apple
and Spotify as well.

02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:24.820
That really helps us.

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.460
It helps us get the
message about the podcasts

02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.360
out more broadly generally,

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.950
and it ensures that you
don't miss any episodes.

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:34.090
We release episodes every
Monday, but starting soon,

02:01:34.090 --> 02:01:35.350
and from time to time,

02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:37.790
we release shorter episodes in between.

02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:40.330
So you'll be sure to hear those episodes.

02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:42.400
In addition, check out the
sponsors that we mentioned

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.370
at the beginning of the podcast.

02:01:44.370 --> 02:01:46.530
If you like and if you're
able to, supporting us

02:01:46.530 --> 02:01:48.240
through those sponsors is a terrific way

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.440
to support our production staff
and the podcast generally.

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.190
A zero cost way to support the podcast

02:01:53.190 --> 02:01:55.900
is to tell your friends, tell
your neighbors, tell anyone

02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:57.840
that you think might benefit
from the information.

02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:01.630
The way this podcast is set
up, the information is batched

02:02:01.630 --> 02:02:04.490
into four or five episodes, all centered

02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:07.890
around a given theme or topic
like hormones, like sleep.

02:02:07.890 --> 02:02:09.510
So the episodes on sleep, for instance

02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:11.050
that were way back in January,

02:02:11.050 --> 02:02:13.450
and what seems like way back

02:02:13.450 --> 02:02:15.680
are still every bit as relevant today

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.170
as they were back in January for somebody

02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:19.590
that has challenges with sleep

02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:21.720
and wants to understand
sleep and get better at sleep

02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:24.610
or wants to understand their
dreams or how to use sleep

02:02:24.610 --> 02:02:27.950
and dreaming to leverage
neuroplasticity and learning.

02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:30.210
So if you pass information
along about the podcast,

02:02:30.210 --> 02:02:31.043
that's great.

02:02:31.043 --> 02:02:31.930
We also have a Patreon.

02:02:31.930 --> 02:02:35.360
You can go to patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.870
There, you can support the podcast

02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:38.820
at any level that you like.

02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:42.190
And as always, please
put your questions about

02:02:42.190 --> 02:02:45.790
the podcast episodes and
suggestions for future episodes.

02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:46.860
In the comment section.

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.520
I really do read through
all those comments.

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:51.530
It takes me some time, but
I do read through those.

02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:54.620
I reply to as many of them
as I can, but I do read them.

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.940
And they're great way
for us to get feedback.

02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:59.010
On Apple you can give
us a five-star review

02:02:59.010 --> 02:03:00.400
if you think we deserve that.

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.910
And if you want to do all
these things you're welcome to,

02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:05.260
if you want to do just one
of them, we understand.

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:07.310
And if you do none of
them, we still appreciate

02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:09.230
that you come here to
digest the information

02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:11.570
about science and science-related tools.

02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:15.010
In today's episode, I
mentioned various supplements,

02:03:15.010 --> 02:03:17.990
various compounds that
if you deem it right

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:21.710
and safe for you can
benefit athletic performance

02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:24.750
and muscle physiology, et cetera.

02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:27.510
We've partnered with Thorne T-H-O-R-N-E

02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:29.630
because Thorne supplements we believe are

02:03:29.630 --> 02:03:32.610
of the highest possible
stringency in quality.

02:03:32.610 --> 02:03:35.010
What you see on the bottle
is what's in the bottle

02:03:35.010 --> 02:03:36.938
and the quality of
ingredients that they include

02:03:36.938 --> 02:03:38.530
are excellent.

02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:40.730
So much so that they
partner with the Mayo Clinic

02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:42.470
and all the major sports teams.

02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:47.470
If you go to Thorne
T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman,

02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:50.590
you can see all the
supplements that I take

02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:53.170
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

02:03:53.170 --> 02:03:56.370
as well as 20% off any
of the other supplements

02:03:56.370 --> 02:03:57.590
that Thorne sells.

02:03:57.590 --> 02:04:02.590
So if you go to thorne.com/u/huberman

02:04:02.850 --> 02:04:04.440
any of those supplements listed there

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.900
and then if you navigate
through their site

02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:07.380
and you find something else that you like

02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:09.390
will be 20% off at checkout.

02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:11.110
Last but not least, I want to thank you

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.580
for your time and attention today.

02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.729
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

02:04:14.729 --> 02:04:17.896
