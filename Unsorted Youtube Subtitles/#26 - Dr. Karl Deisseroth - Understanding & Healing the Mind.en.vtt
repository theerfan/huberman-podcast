[gentle upbeat music]
- [Andrew] Welcome

00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:03.437
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
where we discuss science,

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.973
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.970
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.570
Today, I have the pleasure of
introducing the first guest

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.420
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.070
My guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.340
Dr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical doctor,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.900
he's a psychiatrist and
a research scientist

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.940
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.450
In his clinical practice, he sees patients

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.560
dealing with a range of
nervous system disorders,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.320
including obsessive
compulsive disorder, autism,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.460
attention deficit disorders,
schizophrenia, mania,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.370
anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.710
His laboratory develops and explores tools

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.320
with which to understand
how the nervous system works

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.940
in the healthy situation,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.160
as well as in disorders of the mind.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.350
Dr. Deisseroth's laboratory
has pioneered the development

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.460
and use of what are called channelopsins,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670
proteins that come from algae,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.330
which can now be introduced
to the nervous systems

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.530
of animals and humans, in
order to precisely control

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.810
the activity of neurons
in the brain and body

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570
with the use of light.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.030
This is a absolutely
transformative technology,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.100
because whereas certain drug treatments

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.560
can often relieve certain
symptoms of disorders,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.000
they often carry various side effects.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.610
And in some individuals,
often many individuals,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.920
these drug treatments simply do not work.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.670
The channelopsins and their
related technologies stand

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.940
to transform the way that we
treat psychiatric illness,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.360
and various disorders of
movement and perception.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.080
In fact, just recently,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.870
the channelopsins were
applied in a human patient,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.620
to allow an adult fully blind
human being to see light,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.100
for the very first time.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.220
We also discuss Dr. Deisseroth's
newly released book,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.000
which is entitled "Projections:
A Story of Human Emotions".

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.640
This is an absolutely remarkable book,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.470
that uses stories about his
interactions with his patients,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.470
to teach you how the brain works

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.310
in the healthy and diseased state,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.720
and also reveals the
motivation for and discovery

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.270
of these channelopsins
and other technologies

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.300
by Karl's laboratory,
that are being used now

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.560
to treat various disorders
of the nervous system,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.060
and that in the future,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.730
are certain to transform
the fields of psychiatry,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.020
mental health, and health in general.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.050
I found our conversation to be
an absolutely fascinating one

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.230
about how the brain functions
in the healthy state,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.930
and why and how it breaks
down in disorders of the mind.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.730
We also discuss the
current status and future

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.730
of psychedelic treatments
for psychiatric illness,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.810
as well as we're understanding

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.810
how the brain works more generally.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.080
We also discuss issues of consciousness,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.090
and we even delve into
how somebody like Karl

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.890
who's managing a full-time
clinical practice

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.320
and a 40 plus person laboratory,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.380
and a family of five children
and is happily married,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.610
how he organizes his internal landscape,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.590
his own thinking in order to
manage that immense workload

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.410
and to progress forward
for the sake of medicine

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.400
and his pursuits in science.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.370
I found this to be an
incredible conversation,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.790
I learned so much.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.380
I also learned, through the course

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.650
of reading Karl's book, "Projections",

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.210
that not only is he an
accomplished psychiatrist,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.990
and obviously an accomplished
research scientist

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.747
and a family man, but he's
also a phenomenal writer.

00:03:19.747 --> 00:03:22.340
"Projections" is absolutely
masterfully written.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.110
It's just beautiful, and
it's accessible to anybody,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.440
even if you don't have
a science background.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.900
So, I hope that you'll
enjoy my conversation

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.060
with Karl Deisseroth as much as I did,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.440
and thank you for tuning in.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.380
Before we begin, I want to point out

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.180
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.100
and research roles at Stanford.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.160
In my desire and effort to bring zero cost

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.537
to consumer information about science

00:03:42.537 --> 00:03:45.060
and science related tools
to the general public,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.000
I'd like to acknowledge the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.240
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.090
Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.370
that in my opinion, are the
very highest quality out there.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.650
The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.200
from Stanford, and everything
about the eyeglasses

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.820
and sunglasses was developed
with performance in mind.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.700
One of the things I really
love about Roka sunglasses,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.900
is that unlike other sunglasses
that make it hard to see

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.710
when there's a lot of cloud cover,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.010
or when the shadows change

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.780
or environmental conditions change,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.410
with Roka sunglasses,
they clearly understand

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.020
the signs of the visual system,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.860
because when I put them
on for the first time,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.250
I noticed that as I moved into shadows

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.650
or the cloud cover changed
or the day got brighter

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.520
or dimmer, everything
was still crystal clear.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.020
And that's also because the lenses

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.570
are tremendously high optical clarity,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.630
and the glasses are really lightweight.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.630
You don't even notice that they're on.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.180
The other thing is that the eyeglasses,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.800
I wear readers at night,
they're incredibly lightweight,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.680
and for both the
sunglasses and eyeglasses,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.450
the aesthetic is terrific.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.650
Unlike a lot of performance eyewear,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.830
which frankly can look kind of cyborg-like

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.840
and kind of ridiculous, the
aesthetic of the glasses

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.220
is such that you could
really wear them anywhere,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.990
indoors or outdoors.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.680
If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.800
you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.400
and enter the code "Huberman",

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.010
That's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.190
and enter the code
"Huberman", at checkout.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.820
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.190
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.920
that analyzes data from
your blood and DNA,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.510
to help you better understand your body

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.340
and reach your health goals.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.220
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.300
And now with the advent
of good genetic DNA tests,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.160
I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.650
The simple reason for this
is that many of the factors

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.920
that impact our immediate
and longterm health,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.030
can only be measured and evaluated

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.550
with a quality blood test.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.390
And now, the DNA tests
further inform our immediate

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.830
and long-term health.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.490
One of the problems with a lot
of DNA tests and blood tests

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.170
out there however, is that
you get the information back,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.190
and you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.390
With InsideTracker, you
get the numbers back

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.030
of different metabolic
factors, hormones, et cetera,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.200
but it also provides simple directives,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.120
as to how perhaps you might want to change

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.010
your nutritional intake
or your exercise regimen,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.900
or other lifestyle factors,
to bring those numbers

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.574
into alignment with where
you'd like them to be.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.670
InsideTracker also makes this really easy.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.650
They have a dashboard that
makes organizing that all

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.470
very simple, and they can
even have someone come

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.900
to your house to take
the blood and DNA test.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.360
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.370

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.650
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.180
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.540
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.520
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.530
and I've taken it ever since,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.070
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.657
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:42.890
and that I continue to
take Athletic Greens,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.760
is that it covers all my
vitamin and mineral bases,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.290
and it covers my probiotic needs.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.110
There's now a wealth of data showing

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.040
that probiotics support
a healthy gut microbiome,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.210
and that a healthy gut microbiome supports

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.070
the gut brain access for healthy mood.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.910
It also supports
metabolism, immune function,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.700
endocrine, that means hormone function,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.910
and a host of other important
biological functions.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.730
I drink it once or twice a day.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.630
I mix it with water and a
little bit of lemon juice

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.110
or some lime juice, and
it's absolutely delicious.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.690
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.760
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.460
and if you do that, you
can claim a special offer,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.720
where they will give you a
year's supply of vitamin D3.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.250
In addition, they'll give
you five free travel packs.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.780
Vitamin D3 as we all
know, is very important

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.010
for a huge range of biological
functions and health.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.800
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.040
for your Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.420
and the year's supply of vitamin D3.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.913
And now, my conversation
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.110
Well, thanks for being here.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.580
- Thanks for having me.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.960
- It's been a long time coming for me,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.250
because you may not know this,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.870
but one of the reasons
I started this podcast

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.947
was actually so I could
have this conversation.

00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:54.840
[Karl laughs]

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.470
It's but one, there are other reasons,

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.400
but one of the goals is to
be able to hold conversations

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.590
with colleagues of mine that
are doing incredible work

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.710
in the realm of science,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.580
and then here we also have
this really special opportunity

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.270
because you're also a clinician.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.670
You see patients and have for a long time.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.080
So for people that
might not be so familiar

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.630
with the fields of
neuroscience, et cetera,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.932
what is the difference between
neurology and psychiatry?

00:08:22.932 --> 00:08:26.700
- Well, I'm married to a
neurologist and I am a psychiatrist

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.850
and we make fun of each
other all the time.

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:33.840
A lot of neuroscientists and
a lot of brain clinicians

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.532
actually think these two
should be in the same field

00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:38.240
at some point in the future,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.890
they were in the past,
they started together.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.350
Psychiatry though, focuses on disorders

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.690
where we can't see something
that's physically wrong,

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.030
where we don't have a measurable,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.510
where there's no blood test
that makes the diagnosis,

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.977
there's no brain scan that
tells us this is schizophrenia,

00:08:54.977 --> 00:08:57.513
and this is depression
for an individual patient.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.150
And so psychiatry is much more mysterious,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.640
and the only tools we have are words.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.820
Neurologists are fantastic physicians.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.180
They see the stroke on brain scans,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.620
they see the seizure and
the pre-seizure activity

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.360
with an EEG, and they can measure

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.580
and treat based on those measureables.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.940
In psychiatry, we have
a harder job, I think.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.140
We use words, we have
rating scales for symptoms,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.940
we can measure depression and
autism with rating scales,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.360
but those are words still.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.190
And ultimately, that's what
psychiatry is built around.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:42.190
It's an odd situation because
we've got the most complex,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.253
beautiful, mysterious,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.350
incredibly engineered
object in the universe,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.220
and yet all we have are
words to find our way in.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.530
- So, do you find that if
a patient is very verbal or

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.130
hyper-verbal, that you have an
easier time diagnosing them,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.680
as opposed to somebody who's
more quiet and reserved?

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.960
Or it's, I could imagine the
opposite might be true as well.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.620
- Well, because we only have words,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.810
you've put your finger on a key point.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.090
If they don't speak that much,
in principle, it's harder.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.860
The lack of speech can be a symptom.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.160
We can see that in depression,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.820
we can see that in the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.320
we can see that in autism.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.220
Sometimes by itself, that is
a symptom, reduced speech,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.570
but ultimately you do need something.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.360
You need some words to help guide you

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.100
and in fact, there's challenges
that I can tell you about

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.303
where patients with depression

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:38.150
were so depressed, they can't speak.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.420
That makes it a bit of a challenge
to distinguish depression

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.670
from some of the other reasons
they might not be speaking.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.630
And this is sort of the art
and the science of psychiatry.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.970
- Do you find that there are patients

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.480
that have, well, let's call
them comorbidities or conditions

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.070
where they would land in both
psychiatry and neurology,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.130
meaning there's damage to a
particular area of the brain

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.490
and therefore they're depressed?

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.100
And how do you tease that
out as a psychiatrist?

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.180
- Yeah, this happens all the time.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.303
Parkinson's disease is a great example.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.540
It can be debilitating in so many ways.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.980
People have trouble moving,
they have trouble walking,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.650
they have trouble swallowing,

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.650
and they can have a
truly severe depression.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.990
And this is where you
might say, "Oh, well,

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.450
they've got a life-threatening illness",

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.390
but there are plenty of
neurological disorders

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.390
where depression is not a
strongly comorbid symptom,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.050
like ALS, Lou Gehrig's
disease, for example,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.020
depression is not strongly
comorbid in that disease,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.860
but in Parkinson's, it
is extremely common.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.380
And as you know, in Parkinson's disease,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.400
we have loss of the dopamine
neurons in the midbrain.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.040
And this is a very specific
population of cells

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.450
that's dying, and probably that leads

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.670
to both the movement
disorder and the depression.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.190
There are many examples of that

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.830
where these two fields come together

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.270
and you really need to work as a team.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.130
I've had patients in my clinic,
that I treat the depression

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.610
associated with their Parkinson's,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.580
and a neurologist treats the movement

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.780
associated with the Parkinson's
and we work together.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.210
- Do you think we will
ever have a blood test

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.740
for depression or schizophrenia or autism?

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.993
And would that be a good or a bad thing?

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.100
- I think ultimately there
will be quantitative tests.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.910
Already, efforts are being made

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.800
to look at certain rhythms in
the brain using external EEGs

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.940
to look at brain waves effectively,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.450
look at the ratios of certain frequencies

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.080
to other frequencies,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.510
and there's some progress
being made on that front.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.310
It's not as good as it could be.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.140
It doesn't really give you the confidence

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.240
for the individual patient
that you would like,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.440
but ultimately, what's
going on in the brain

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.760
in psychiatric disease is physical,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.700
and it's due to the
circuits and the connections

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.460
and the projections in the
brain that are not working

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.970
as they would in a typical situation.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.340
And I do think we'll have those
measureables at some point.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.766
Now, is that good or bad?

00:13:14.766 --> 00:13:15.687
I think that will be good,

00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:19.380
and one of the challenges
we have with psychiatry

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.980
is it is an art as well as a science

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.510
to elicit these symptoms in a precise way.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.370
It does take some time,
and it would be great

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.910
if we could just do quick measurements.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.240
Could it be abused or misused?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.073
Certainly.

00:13:36.073 --> 00:13:38.430
But that's I think true,
for all of medicine.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.370
- I want to know, and I'm
sure there are several,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.700
but what do you see as
the biggest challenge

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.463
facing psychiatry and the
treatment of mental illness today?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.330
- I think we're making progress

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.970
on what the biggest challenge is,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.300
which I think there's
still such a strong stigma

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.680
for psychiatric disease

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.420
that patients often don't come to us,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.420
and they feel that they
should be able to handle this

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.533
on their own.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.770
And that can slow treatment.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.720
It can lead to worsening symptoms.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.610
We know, for example,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.910
patients who have
untreated anxiety issues.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.430
If you go for a year or more

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.690
with a serious untreated anxiety issue,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.400
that can convert to depression.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.770
You can add another problem
on top of the anxiety.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.210
And so it would be...

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.730
Why do people not come for treatment?

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.210
They feel like this is
something they should be able

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.300
to master on their own, which can be true,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.230
but usually, some help is a good thing.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.710
- That raises a question
related to something

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.400
I heard you say many
years ago at a lecture,

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.360
which was that, this
was a scientific lecture

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.810
and you said, "We don't
know how other people feel.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.648
Most of the time, we don't
even really know how we feel."

00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:58.481
- [chuckles] Yeah.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.290
- [Andrew] Maybe you could
elaborate on that a little bit

00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:06.665
and the dearth of ways that we
have to talk about feelings.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.000
I mean, there's so many words.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.120
I don't know how many,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.920
but I'm guessing they're more
than a dozen words to describe

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.330
the state that I call sadness,
but as far as I understand,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.760
we don't have any way of comparing that

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.910
in a real objective sense.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.520
As a psychiatrist, when
your job is to use words

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.870
to diagnose, words of
the patient to diagnose,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.650
do you maneuver around that?

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.240
And what is this landscape

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.263
that we call feelings or emotions?

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.453
- This is really interesting.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.240
Here there's a tension between
the words that we've built up

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.010
in the clinic that mean
something to the physicians,

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.200
and then there's the
colloquial use of words

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.280
that may not be the same,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.600
and so that's the first
level we have to sort out

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.660
when someone says, "I'm depressed",

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.340
what exactly do they mean by that?

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.520
And that may be different
from what we're talking about

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.500
in terms of depression.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.920
So part of psychiatry is
to get beyond that word,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.425
and to get into how
they're actually feeling,

00:16:05.425 --> 00:16:09.850
get rid of the jargon and
get to real world examples

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.000
of how they're feeling.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.680
So, how much do you look
forward into the future?

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.010
How much hope do you have?

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.060
How much planning are
you doing for the future?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.270
So here now you're
getting into actual things

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.270
you can talk about that are unambiguous.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.190
If someone says, "Yeah, I can't
even think about tomorrow.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.707
I don't see how I'm going
to get to tomorrow".

00:16:34.778 --> 00:16:36.950
That's a nice, precise
thing that you know,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.947
it's sad, it's tragic, but
also, that means something.

00:16:40.947 --> 00:16:42.240
And we know what that means.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.060
That's the hopelessness
symptom of depression.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.900
And that is what I try to do

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.140
when I do a psychiatric interview.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.810
I try to get past the jargon,

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.010
and get to what's actually
happening in a patient's life

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.410
and in their mind.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.287
But as you say, ultimately,

00:16:55.287 --> 00:16:57.810
[chuckles] and this shows up across...

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.970
I address this issue every day in my life,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.980
whether it's in the lab where
we're looking at animals,

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.700
whether fish or mice or rats
and studying their behavior,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.230
or when I'm in a conversation
with just a friend

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.810
or a colleague, or when
I'm talking to a patient,

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.640
I never really know what's going on

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.573
inside the mind of the other person.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.950
I get some feedback, I get words,

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:27.250
I get behaviors, I get actions,
but I never really know.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.720
And as you said at the very
beginning of the question,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.500
often we don't even have
the words and the insight

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.990
to even understand what's
going on in our own mind.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.900
I think a lot of psychiatrists
are pretty introspective.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.080
That's part of the reason
they end up in that specialty,

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.210
and so, maybe we spend a little more time

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.050
than the average person

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.660
thinking about what's going on within,

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.480
but it doesn't mean we have the answers.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.640
- So in this area of trying to figure out

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.970
what's going on under
the hood through words,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.930
it sounds like certain words would relate

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.070
to this idea of anticipation and hope.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.170
Is it fair to say that
that somehow relates

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.930
to the dopamine system in the sense

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.490
that dopamine is involved
in motivated behaviors?

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.190
I mean, if I say for instance,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.970
and I won't ask you to
run a session with me here

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.950
[chuckles] for free.
[Karl laughs]

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.110
- We'll do that off camera.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.760
- [Andrew] Off camera. Right.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.760
If I were to say, "I just
can't imagine tomorrow.

00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:28.920
I just can't do it."

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.140
So that's not an action-based,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.730
that's purely based on
my internal narrative,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.280
but I could imagine things like, you know,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.630
I have a terrible time
sleeping, I'm not hungry,

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.510
I'm not eating, so statements
about physical actions,

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.459
I'm guessing also have validity.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.292
- Absolutely.

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:50.290
- And there are now ways to measure

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.830
the accuracy of those statements.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.730
Like for instance, if
I gave you permission,

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.890
you could know if I slept last night,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.110
or whether or not I was just saying

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.350
I had a poor night's sleep.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.470
- Yes. That's right.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.750
- So in moving forward through 2021

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.730
and into the next 10 and
100 years of psychiatry,

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.730
do you think that the body
reporting some of the actions

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.290
of a human are going to become useful

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.930
and mesh with the words in a way

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.020
that's going to make your job easier?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.970
- I do think that's true.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.590
And the two things you've
mentioned, eating and sleeping,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.340
those are additional criteria

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.910
that we use to diagnose depression.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.280
These are the vegetative signs,
we call them of depression,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.540
poor sleep, and poor eating.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.480
And if you have a baseline for somebody,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.060
that's the real challenge there.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.730
What's different in that person?

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.760
Some people with
depressed, they sleep more.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.560
Some people who are
depressed, they sleep less.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.650
Some people who are depressed,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.970
they're more physically agitated,
and they move around more.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.060
Some people who are depressed,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.190
they move less even while they're awake.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.270
And so you need...

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.860
Here's the challenge is
that you can't just look

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.230
at how they are now.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.320
You have to get a baseline,
and then see how it's changed.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.320
And that can be a challenge
that raises ethical issues,

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.740
and how do you collect
that baseline information

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.770
from someone healthy?

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.610
I don't think that's
something we have solved.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.920
Of course, with phones and
accelerometers and phones,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.980
you could in principle,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.970
collect a lot of baseline
information from people,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.130
but that would have to be treated

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.550
very carefully for privacy reasons.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.623
- And in terms of measuring
one's own behavior,

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:25.456
I've heard of work that's going on.

00:20:25.456 --> 00:20:30.456
Sam Golden up in the
University of Washington

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.120
who works on aggression in animal models

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.640
was telling me that there's
some efforts that he's making,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.590
and perhaps you're involved
in this work as well,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.200
I don't know, of devices
that would allow people

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.630
to detect, for instance,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.790
when they're veering
towards a depressive episode

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.260
for themselves, that they
may choose or not choose

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.850
to report that to their clinician,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.230
maybe they don't even have a clinician.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.410
Maybe this person that you
referred to at the beginning,

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.830
this person who doesn't feel comfortable

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.930
coming to talk to you,

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.120
maybe something is measuring
changes in the inflection

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.130
of their voice, or the speed

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.590
at which they get up from a chair.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.970
Do you think that those kind of metrics

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.840
will eventually inform
somebody, "Hey, you know,

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.030
you're in trouble"?

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.980
This is getting to back to the statement

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.070
that I heard you make and
it rung in my mind now,

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.410
I think for more than a decade,

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.020
which is, "Oftentimes, we
don't even know how we feel."

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.853
- Yeah.

00:21:17.853 --> 00:21:19.080
You know, that I do like,

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.120
because that gives the
patient the agency to detect

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.190
what's going on, and even
separate from modern technology,

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.410
this has been part of
the art of psychiatry

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.080
is to help patients realize

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.060
that sometimes other people observing them

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.000
can give them the earliest
warning signs of depression.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.930
We see this very often in family.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.530
They'll notice when
the patient is changing

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.070
before the patient does.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.910
And then there are things
the patient may notice,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.520
but not correctly ascribe
to the onset of depression.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.840
And a classic example of that

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.250
is what we call 'early morning awakening'.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.520
And this is something
that can happen very early

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.270
as people start to slide into depression.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.800
They start to wake up earlier and earlier,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.860
just inexplicably, they're awake at-

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.150
- This is like 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM awakening?

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:02.983
- It could start...

00:22:02.983 --> 00:22:05.645
Yeah, it could start at
5:00 AM, could go to four,

00:22:05.645 --> 00:22:06.478
and three-
- And are unable

00:22:06.478 --> 00:22:07.311
to fall back asleep?

00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:08.890
- Unable to fall back asleep. Exactly.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.420
And they may not know
what to do with that.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.130
It could just be, [chuckles]
from their perspective,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.870
it's just something that's happening.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.110
But if you put enough of
that information together,

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.417
that could be a useful
warning sign for the patient

00:22:20.417 --> 00:22:22.046
and it could help them seek treatment.

00:22:22.046 --> 00:22:24.910
And I think that is something
that could be really valuable.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.950
- Interesting.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.950
So, in this framework of
needing words to self-report

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.377
or machines to detect how we feel

00:22:34.377 --> 00:22:38.513
and maybe inform a psychiatrist
how a patient feels,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.170
touch on some of the technologies

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.120
that you've been involved in building,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.013
but as a way to march into that,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.230
are there any very good treatments
for psychiatric disease?

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.650
Meaning, are there currently
any pills, potions,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:00.110
forms of communication that
reliably work every time,

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.570
or work in most patients?

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.920
And could you give a couple
examples of great successes

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.420
of psychiatry if they exist?

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.290
- Yes.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.430
Yeah, we are fortunate.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.400
And this [chuckles] coming
back to my, you know,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.850
the joking between my wife and myself

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.330
in terms of neurology and psychiatry,

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.670
we actually in psychiatry,
despite the depths

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.100
of the mystery we struggled with,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.110
many of our treatments are actually...

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.180
We may be doing better
than some other specialties

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.000
in terms of actually
causing therapeutic benefit

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.030
for patients.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:34.770
We do help patients, the
patients who suffer from...

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.710
By the way, both
medications and talk therapy

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.430
have been shown to be extremely
effective in many cases,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.670
for example, people with panic disorder,

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.210
cognitive behavioral therapy,
just working with words,

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.320
helping people identify the early signs

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.610
of when they're starting to
move toward a panic attack,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.110
what are the cognitions
that are happening?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.200
You can train people to derail that,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.540
and you can very potently
treat panic disorder that way.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.430
- How long does something
like that take on average?

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.420
- For a motivated, insightful patient,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.983
you can have a very
cookbooky series of sessions,

00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:09.670
that's six to 12 sessions, or even less

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.060
for someone who's very
insightful and motivated

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.660
and it can have a very
powerful effect that quickly.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.530
And that's just with words,

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.590
there are many psychiatric medications

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.430
that are very effective for the conditions

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.970
that they're treating.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.680
Anti-psychotic medications,
they have side effects,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.970
but boy, do they work!

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.300
They really can clear up
particularly the positive symptoms

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.340
of schizophrenia for example,
the auditory hallucinations,

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.170
the paranoia, people's lives
can be turned around by these-

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.820
- We should clarify positive symptoms.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.810
You mean not positive in
the qualitative sense,

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.430
you mean positive meaning
that the appearance

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.650
of something abnormal.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.510
- Exactly. Yeah.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.800
Thank you for that clarification.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.470
When we say positive symptoms,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.210
we do mean the addition of something

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.130
that wasn't there before,

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.080
like a hallucination or a paranoia,

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.760
and that stands in contrast
to the negative symptoms

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.450
where something is taken away,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.650
and these are patients who are withdrawn.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.250
They have what we call thought blocking.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.443
They can't even progress forward
in a sequence of thoughts.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.170
Both of those can be
part of schizophrenia,

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.420
the hallucinations and the paranoia

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.960
are more effectively treated right now,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.220
but they are effectively treated.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.420
And then, this is a frustrating,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.950
and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.256
There are treatments like
electroconvulsive therapy,

00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:31.150
where it's extremely
effective for depression.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.490
We have patients who
nothing else works for them,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.390
where they can't tolerate medications,

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.810
and you can administer under a very safe,

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.530
controlled condition,

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.620
where the patient's body is not moving.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.590
They're put into a very safe situation

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.650
where the body doesn't move or cease,

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.820
it's just an internal process
that's triggered in the brain.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.860
This is an extraordinarily
effective treatment

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.940
for treatment-resistant depression.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.610
At the same time, I find it [chuckles]

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.235
as heartening as it is to
see patients respond to this

00:26:02.235 --> 00:26:06.210
who have severe depression,
I'm also frustrated by it.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.730
Why can't we do something
more precise than this,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.650
for these very severe cases?

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.000
And people have sought
for decades to understand,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.410
how is it that a seizure is leading

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.080
to the relief of depression?

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.460
And we don't know the answer yet.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.570
We would love to do that.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.450
People are working hard on that,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.366
but that is a treatment
that does work too.

00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:28.270
In all of these cases
though in psychiatry,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.680
the frustrating thing
is that we don't have

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.840
the level of understanding
that a cardiologist has

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.950
in thinking about the heart.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.240
You know, the heart is,
we now know it's a pump.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.980
It's pumping blood. and so
you can look at everything

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.430
about how it's working or not working,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.170
in terms of that frame,
it's clearly a pump.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.240
We don't really have that level

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.653
of, what is the circuit really
there for in psychiatry?

00:26:55.256 --> 00:26:56.930
And that's what is missing.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.640
That's what we need to find,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.200
so we can design truly effective
and specific treatments.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.970
- So, what are the pieces
that are going to be required

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.970
to cure autism, cure
Parkinson's, cure schizophrenia?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.270
I would imagine there are several
elements and 'beens here',

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.860
understanding the natural biology,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.450
understanding what the
activity patterns are,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.430
how to modify those, maybe
you could just tell us

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.163
what you think, what is the
Bento Box of the perfect cure?

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.670
- I think the first thing
we need is understanding.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.560
Almost every psychiatric treatment

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.670
has been serendipitously identified,

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.510
just noting by chance that
something that was done

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.200
for some person also had a side effect-

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.090
- Like lithium or something-

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.800
- Like lithium, is a good example.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.268
- Is it true that it was
the urine of guinea pigs

00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:50.180
[Karl laughs]
given lithium

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.880
that was given to manic patients
that made them not manic?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.750
Is that true?

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.220
- I don't have firsthand
knowledge of that,

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.280
but I would defer that,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.700
but it's true for
essentially every treatment,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.090
that the antidepressants originally arose

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.561
as anti-tuberculosis drugs, for example.

00:28:05.561 --> 00:28:06.394
- I did not know that.

00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:10.520
- Yeah, and so this is a
classic example for illnesses

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.800
across all of psychiatry,

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.390
and of course there's
the seizures as well.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.430
That was noticed that
patients who had epilepsy,

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.380
they had a seizure there
and also had depression,

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.440
that they became much,
at least for awhile,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.630
they were improved after that seizure.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.463
- That's amazing.

00:28:24.463 --> 00:28:26.491
I don't want to take you
off course of the question

00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:27.324
answering the question I asked,

00:28:27.324 --> 00:28:31.320
but I've heard before that if
autistic children get a fever,

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.850
that their symptoms improve, is that true?

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.870
- I've done a fair bit
of work with autism.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.230
In my clinical practice,
I work with adult autism

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.460
and I have heard statements like that

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.773
and descriptions like that from
patients and their families.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.300
That is very hard to study quantitatively

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.600
because often with the
children, you have this

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.840
not as quantitative as you'd like

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.750
collection of symptom
information from home.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.000
But I have heard that enough that I think

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.800
there may well be something to that.

00:29:07.104 --> 00:29:08.960
And anytime you have a
fever, what's going on?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.527
Well, we know all the cells in the brain,

00:29:11.527 --> 00:29:13.580
and I know this as an electrophysiologist,

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.620
if you just change the
temperature by a few degrees,

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.570
everything changes about how neurons work

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.510
and that's even just a single neuron.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.420
It's even more likely to
be complex and different

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.120
with a circuit of neurons that
are all affecting each other.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.770
Just elevate the temperature a little bit,

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.680
everything's different.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.500
And so, it's plausible for sure,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.950
that things like that
could happen and do happen.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.693
And yet, when you think about
autism, to take your example,

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.800
yes, we see changes,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.260
but what is the elements of
the brain that's analogous

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.630
to the pumping heart?

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.313
When we think about the
symptoms of depression,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.990
we think about motivation
and dopamine neurons.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.223
When we think about autism,
it's a little more challenging.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.240
There's a deficit in social interaction

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.963
and in communication.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.397
And so where is that?

00:30:07.397 --> 00:30:09.870
[chuckles] Where is that situated?

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:14.870
What is the key principle
governing the social interaction?

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.780
This is where we need the basic science

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.400
to bring us a step forward,

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.830
so we can say okay, this is
the process that's going on.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.180
This is what's needed for
the incredibly complex task

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.010
of social interaction,

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.560
where you've got incredibly
rich data streams of sound

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.130
and meaning, eye contact, body movement,

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.260
and that's just for one person.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.130
What if there's a group of people?

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.587
This is overwhelming
for people with autism.

00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:41.940
What's the unifying thing there?

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.534
It's a lot of information,

00:30:43.534 --> 00:30:48.520
and that maybe is unmatched
in any realm of biology,

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.900
the amount of information coming in

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.980
through a social interaction,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.903
particularly with words and language.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.030
And so then, that turns our
attention as neuroscientists,

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.110
we think, okay, let's think
about the parts of the brain

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:04.800
that are involved in dealing with merging

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.330
complex data streams that
are very high in bit rate

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.853
that need to be fused together
into a unitary concept.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.346
And that starts to guide us,

00:31:15.346 --> 00:31:17.537
and we know other animals
are social in their own way,

00:31:17.537 --> 00:31:19.080
and we can study those animals.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.150
And so that's how I think about it.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.410
There's hope for the future,

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.670
thinking about the symptoms
as an engineer might,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:30.190
and trying to identify the
circuits that are likely working

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.410
to make this typical behavior happen,

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.150
and that will help us understand
how it becomes atypical.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.530
- So that seems like the first to me,

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.010
the first been of this,
what I call the Bento Box

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.020
for lack of a better analogy,

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.690
that we need to know the circuits.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.870
We need to know the cells
in the various brain regions

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.608
and end portions of the body

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:52.280
and how they connect to one another,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.500
and what the patterns of activity are

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.820
under a normal 'healthy interaction'.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.100
- [Karl] Yeah.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:04.100
- If we understand that, then
it seems that the next step,

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.480
which of course could be
carried out in parallel, right?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.130
Though that work can
be done alongside work

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.110
where various elements within
those circuits are tweaked

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.190
just right, like the tuning
of a piano in the subtle way,

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.310
or maybe even like the
replacement of a whole set of keys

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.656
if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak.

00:32:20.656 --> 00:32:21.490
- Right.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.660
- You've been very involved

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.993
in trying to generate those tools.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.670
Tell us about channelopsins,

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:34.440
why you created them,
and where they're at now

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.570
in the laboratory and
perhaps also in the clinic.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.146
- Well, first of all, I
give nature the credit

00:32:42.146 --> 00:32:43.970
for creating channelrhodopsins.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.150
These are beautiful little
proteins that are made by algae,

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.310
single-celled green algae.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.190
And there's a great story in basic science

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.510
that our understanding of animal behavior,

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.710
sensation, cognition
and action in our brains

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:05.710
all the way back to a botanist
in the 1850s and 1860s

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.550
in Russia, is where the story begins.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.340
So this was a botanist
named Andrei Famintsyn

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.900
who worked at St. Petersburg,

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.900
and he had noticed in the
river near his laboratory,

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.700
that there were algae
that he could look at

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.170
in a dish, in a saucer.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.270
He could put them there and he had light

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.493
shining from the side.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.770
The green tinge in the saucer of water

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.820
would move to a particular
distance from the light

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.420
that he was shining from the side,

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.470
which was an amazing thing.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.880
If he made the light brighter,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.100
the green tinge would
back off a little bit

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.430
to a more optimal location,
so just the right light level.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.020
So this was plant behavior.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.690
It was light-driven plant behavior,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.210
and he delves into this a little bit.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.730
He identified that with microscopy,

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.060
he could see that there were
little single-cell algae

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.380
with flagella that were swimming
to the right light level.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.920
So behaving plants, and
this has been the secret

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.900
that's helped us unlock so many principles

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.840
of animal behavior.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.633
So turns out,

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.420
these algae achieve this amazing results

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.420
with a single gene that
encodes a single protein.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:26.783
What's a protein?

00:34:26.783 --> 00:34:30.350
It's just a little bio-molecule
that does a job in a cell.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:34.280
And these are proteins that
sit in the surface of cells

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.280
in their surface membrane,

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.490
and when a photon, a
light particle hits them,

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:42.280
they open a little pore, a
little hole in the membrane

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.540
and charged particles, ions like sodium

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.363
rush across the pore.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.670
Now, why do they do that?

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.360
They do that to guide their
flagella, that signal coming in,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.230
those ions coming in through the pore

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.500
in response to light,
guide their flagella motor,

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.383
that guides them to a
particular spot in the saucer.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.830
Now, that's plant
behavior, but it turns out,

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.910
as you know, this movement
of ions across the membrane,

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.500
this happens to also be a neural code

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.120
in our brains for on or off.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.190
Sodium ions rushing into
the cells, turns them on.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.470
It makes them fire away, fire
action potentials communicate

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.500
to the next cell down the chain,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.020
and this is an amazing opportunity

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.320
because we can borrow these proteins.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.850
In fact, we can take the gene

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.360
that directs the creation of the protein,

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.580
and we can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.273
to put that gene into neurons
in the brains of mammals,

00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:46.570
and then use light to turn those cells,

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.290
the specific cells that
we put this gene into,

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.250
turn them on.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.980
There are other opsins, we call them,

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.300
that you can use to turn cells off.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.920
It's all fast, real time.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.700
You can play in patterns
of activity in real time

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.000
into cells or kinds of
cells, just as a conductor

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.770
elicits the music from the orchestra,

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.700
the strings and the woodwinds.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.800
And you can see what matters.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.270
What matters for sensation,
what matters for cognition,

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.360
what matters for action, and
we call this optogenetics.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.570
- Beautiful, and I must
say it was quite an honor

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.020
and a privilege to watch optogenetics move

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.820
from idea to discovery to the laboratory.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.783
I think we were postdocs at the same time,

00:36:28.783 --> 00:36:29.616
- We were, huh?

00:36:29.616 --> 00:36:32.340
- which is living proof that
people move at different rates,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.015
because [laughs] it's a joke
at my expense by the way,

00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:37.750
[Karl laughing]

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:38.810
but it's really-

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.643
- We end up in the same spot. [laughs]

00:36:39.643 --> 00:36:41.770
- That's right, [laughs]
yeah, more or less.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:44.210
Physically, if not professionally,

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:48.460
but nonetheless, it's been
a marvelous story thus far.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.960
And I'd like to...

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.793
Maybe you could give us...

00:36:50.793 --> 00:36:53.270
I'd like to just touch
on a couple examples

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.850
of where the technology
resides in laboratories now,

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:59.230
so maybe the range of animals
that it's being used in,

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.710
and some of the phenomenon

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:05.630
that channelrhodopsins
and their related genes

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.853
and proteins are starting
to elicit, what you've seen,

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.460
and then I'd like to talk
about their applicability

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.950
to the clinic, which is I
think the bigger mission,

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.040
if you will.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:18.873
- Yeah.

00:37:18.873 --> 00:37:22.700
So this whole thing, you know,

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.830
it's been about, now going on 17 years

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.460
that we've been putting
channelrhodopsins into neurons.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.803
It started just like Andre
Famintsyn's work in a dish,

00:37:33.733 --> 00:37:34.776
that was in 2004.

00:37:34.776 --> 00:37:38.220
In 2007, we were putting
these into behaving mice,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.000
and we were able to with
a flick of a switch,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.710
cause them to move one
direction or another,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.900
by 2009-

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.360
- So basically, you're
controlling the mouse's behavior?

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.650
- Yeah, exactly. In real time.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.310
So we could make a mouse
that was just sitting there

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.670
doing nothing, to then turn
left very consistently,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.990
in fact, go around in a circle

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.100
and as soon as we turn off
the light, it would stop.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.773
That was an eye-opening moment.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.030
It took really a few years
to make optogenetics work.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.130
There was a lot of putting all the...

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.680
There are a lot of problems
that had to be solved.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:14.190
These channelrhodopsins
actually don't move many ions.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.100
They have a small current,
small conductance, as we say.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.140
And so we had to figure out
ways to pack a lot of them

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.470
into cells without damaging cells,

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.210
and still make them targetable,

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.150
so we don't want them to
just be in all the cells,

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.530
'cause then it becomes
just like an electrode.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.260
You're just stimulating all
the cells that are nearby.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.650
We had to keep that specificity,

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:37.540
make them targetable to just
one kind of cell or another,

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.470
while still packing in
large numbers of them

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.970
into those cells.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.490
And we had to get in the light
in safe and specific ways,

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.420
and so it took probably
about four or five years

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.620
to really create optogenetics
between 2004 and 2009.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.840
By the end of that time though,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.840
we had all the basic light
delivery, gene delivery,

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.510
principles worked out, and
people started to apply

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.510
the technology to fish, to rats, to mice,

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:09.890
to non-human primates like monkeys,

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.270
and just a couple months ago,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.070
my colleague, Botond Rosca in Switzerland,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.890
succeeded in putting channelrhodopsins

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.690
into the eyes of human beings

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.870
and making a blind person to see.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.813
And so that's pretty cool.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.690
This was a patient with
retinal degeneration,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.960
and he provided a channelrhodopsin

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.667
into the eye of this patient

00:39:34.667 --> 00:39:36.910
and was able to confer
some light sensitivity

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.820
onto this patient that
wasn't there before.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.680
- An amazing paper and discovery.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.120
I realize it was one patient,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.110
but it's such an important milestone.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.870
- Well, as you say, it's
a very important milestone

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.850
and the history of that is very deep.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.520
Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca and I

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.080
had published a paper in
science in human retina,

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.640
but X plants taken from cadavers
from someone who had died,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.843
the living retina taken out,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.130
opsins put into this retinal tissue

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.640
and showing that it worked,
recording from the cells

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.210
showing that in these
human retinal neurons,

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.660
that you could get light responses.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.770
But then, from that moment,

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.090
almost 10 years of how
clinical development goes,

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:21.500
and this is a gene therapy

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.060
and so you've got all the regulations

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.270
and concerns and all that.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.830
It took almost 10 years
to get to this point now

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.890
where a living human being
has a new functionality

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.860
that wasn't there before.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.773
Now, that's incredibly inspiring,

00:40:37.092 --> 00:40:38.330
and it's a beautiful thing.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.163
I would say though,

00:40:39.163 --> 00:40:43.750
that the broader
significance of optogenetics

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:47.350
is really still understanding,
because once you understand

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.520
how the circuitry works and
which cells actually matter,

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.770
then any kind of treatment
becomes more grounded and logical

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.210
and specific and principled.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.390
And whether it's a
medication, or a talk therapy

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.820
or brain stimulation treatment

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.510
with electrical or magnetic means,

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.640
if you actually know what matters,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.810
[chuckles] that is incredibly powerful.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:07.643
And I think,

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.610
not intended to disparage
the beautiful retinal work

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.760
and conferring vision on
someone who couldn't see,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.110
of course that's wonderful,

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.570
and that's direct what you might call

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.180
direct optogenetics in patients.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.440
Indirect is everything that
comes from understanding.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.390
Okay, we know these cells
matter now, for this symptom.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.070
Well, how can we target those cells

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.610
and help them work better
in patients by any means?

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.670
And I think that's the
broader significance

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.314
of optogenetics, clinically.

00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:40.760
- I know Botond well,

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.760
and you and Botond share
this incredible big vision,

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.380
that I think only a clinician
can really understand,

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.610
being in close contact within
the suffering of patients

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.680
as a ultimate motivator of
developing technologies,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.380
which makes me have to ask,

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.940
did you decide to become a scientist

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.561
to find cures for mental disease?

00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:10.050
- [chuckles] No, I didn't.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.116
It's a really important
question to actually look back

00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:16.510
and see the steps that brought
you to a particular place.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:20.670
And that was not what brought
me initially to science

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.470
and it's okay I think,
to embrace [chuckles]

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:27.400
the twists and turns
that life brings to you,

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.090
but I was always interested in the brain.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.650
And so, that was something
that for me started

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.300
from a very early age.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.871
We talked about being introspective.

00:42:36.871 --> 00:42:41.530
I noticed very early on I
had a deep love of poetry

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:45.603
and stories, and I was a voracious reader,

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:51.620
and I was amazed by how
words could make me feel

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.555
in particular ways.

00:42:54.555 --> 00:42:58.420
Even separate from their, of
course, dictionary meanings,

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.190
the rhythm, and how they work together,

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.260
even separate from meaning.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.450
And I was stunned by poets that
could use words in new ways

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:10.480
that were even divorced
from their meaning at all,

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.500
and yet could still
trigger specific emotions.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.853
And this was always fascinating to me.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.830
So, I wanted to understand that,

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.320
and so I was interested and I
became interested in the brain

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.210
and I thought, well, I'm
going to to have to study

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:30.210
the human brain, because only
human beings can describe

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.233
what's going on inside enough.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:38.193
So in college, I began to
steer myself toward medicine,

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.930
with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:46.930
And so I came here to medical school,

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.933
and did an MD PhD program,

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.110
planning neurosurgery all the way through.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:55.840
The first rotation I did at
the end of medical school,

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.540
as you know, you do rotations,

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.090
you go through different specialties,

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.110
and some of these are required rotations,

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.870
everybody has to do this summary elective

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.853
where you can pick what you want to do.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.440
I elected to do the
neurosurgery first, [chuckles]

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.810
even before regular surgery.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.710
I was that sure I wanted
to do it, and I loved it.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.410
I had a fantastic time.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:17.630
There was an amazing patient
who had a thalamic damage,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.070
and there was a neglect syndrome

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.630
where the patient was not
able to be aware of something

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.860
that was right in front of him-

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.050
- Even though their
vision was perfectly fine?

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.603
- Even though their vision
was perfectly fine, exactly.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.480
And I loved the operating room,

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:36.307
I loved the rhythm of suturing
and the precision of it,

00:44:36.307 --> 00:44:39.053
and I loved being able to
help patients immediately,

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:44.243
but then a required
rotation was in psychiatry,

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.470
which I was not looking forward to at all.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.590
And that completely reset my whole life,

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.190
that experience in psychiatry.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:56.610
And it was at that moment that I saw

00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:00.170
this is first of all, the greatest need,

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.920
the depth of suffering

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.713
and the depth of the mystery together.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.240
And also it was, I almost feel
a little guilty about this.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.193
It's so interesting too.

00:45:11.193 --> 00:45:13.890
Yes, we can help.

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:17.260
Yes, there's need, but as a scientist,

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.850
this is amazing, that someone's
reality can be different

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.350
from my own, with everything physically,

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:29.100
as far as we can tell the same
with the measures we have,

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.520
and yet we've got a different reality.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.060
That is an amazing thing,
and if we can understand that

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:38.360
and help these people,
that would be just more

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.193
than anybody could ask for.

00:45:39.193 --> 00:45:42.500
And so that's how I ended
up taking this path,

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.300
just a required rotation in psychiatry.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.970
- It all started with poetry?

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.390
- And it started with poetry.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.350
- Out of respect for poetry,

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.950
are there any favorites
that you spend time with

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.540
on a regular basis?

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.950
- I mean, the ones who
got me down this path

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.943
early on, I remember in
childhood and high school,

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.443
Borges had an immense influence on me.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.100
I studied Spanish all the way
through and reading his work.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.600
He was a great writer.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.600
He wrote both in English and in Spanish

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.100
and being able to appreciate his poetry

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.170
both in English and in Spanish
was a pretty amazing thing.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:25.720
Not many poets can do that.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.860
- You're bilingual?

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.330
- I'm not, I wouldn't say.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.500
Now I became, at one point
I was effectively fluent

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.550
in Spanish, and I'm pretty
good with medical Spanish still

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:39.540
because we use Spanish all
the time in the clinic here.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.510
I wouldn't claim full fluency,
but it's something I can

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.424
definitely use all the time.

00:46:44.424 --> 00:46:45.950
And that's been very
helpful in the clinic.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.030
- Yeah, Borges is wonderful.

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:49.870
As the son of an Argentine,
I grew up hearing about it

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.600
and I learned that Borges'
favorite city was Geneva.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.380
So I spent time in Geneva
only for that reason.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.294
It's also turns out

00:46:57.294 --> 00:46:58.420
[Karl laughs]
to be an interesting city.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.253
- Yes.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.770
- So you developed
methods to control neurons

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:09.220
with these algae proteins using light?

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.300
- Yeah.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.380
- In 2015, there was what I
thought was a very nice article

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.230
published in the New
Yorker, describing your work

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.950
and the current state of your work

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.640
in the laboratory and the clinic,

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.470
and an interaction with a patient.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.350
So this as I recall, a woman
who was severely depressed,

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.390
and you reported in that article

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.500
some of the discussion with this patient,

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.860
and then in real time,

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.280
increased the activation of
the so-called vagus nerve,

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.410
this 10th cranial nerve that
extends out of the skull

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:43.323
and innervates many of
the viscera and body.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.880
What is the potential
for channelrhodopsins

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.330
or related types of algae engineering

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:56.200
to be used to manipulate the vagus?

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.390
Because I believe in that instance,

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.020
it wasn't channelopsin stimulation,

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.760
it was electrical stimulation, right?

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.280
Or to manipulate for instance,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.880
a very small localized
region of the brain?

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.460
Let me frame it a little bit differently

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.933
in light of what we were talking
about a couple minutes ago.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:14.030
My understanding is that if
somebody has severe depression

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:15.790
and they take any number

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.680
of the available pharmaceutical
agents that are out there,

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.920
SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine,

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.400
increased whatever, that
sometimes they experience relief,

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.250
but they're often serious side effects.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.970
Sometimes they don't experience relief,

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.120
but as I understand it,

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.690
channelopsins and their related
technology, in principle,

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.670
would allow you to turn on
or off the specific regions

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.420
of the brain that lead to
the depressive symptoms,

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.530
or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit,

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.820
or a positive anticipation circuit.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.430
Where are we at now in terms
of bringing this technology

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.010
to the nervous system?

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:58.960
And let's start with the body,
and then move into the skull.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.793
- Yup.

00:48:59.793 --> 00:49:01.470
So starting with the
body is a good example

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.710
because it highlights the opportunity

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.740
and how far we have to go.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.770
So let's take this example
of vagus nerve stimulation.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.140
So the vagus nerve, it's
the 10th cranial nerve.

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.130
It comes from the brain, it goes down

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.480
and innervates the heart
and innervates the gut.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.910
And by innervate, I mean it
sends little connections down

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.182
to help guide what happens in these organs

00:49:22.182 --> 00:49:24.603
in the abdomen and chest.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.860
It also collects information back,

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.760
and there's information coming
back from all those organs

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.720
that also go through this vagus nerve,

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.230
the 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:39.197
And so this is somewhat of a
super highway to the brain,

00:49:39.197 --> 00:49:40.320
and it was the idea.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.210
And maybe the idea is maybe
we could put a little cuff,

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:48.210
a little electrical device
around the vagus nerve itself,

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.710
and maybe have just like
a pacemaker battery,

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:53.410
have a little power source
here under the clavicle,

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.531
everything under the skin,
and have a little cuff

00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:59.410
and drive signals, and maybe
they'll get back to the brain.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:00.960
So a way of getting into the brain

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.760
without putting something
physical into the brain.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.810
- And why the vagus?

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:06.910
I mean, it's there and it's accessible-

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.765
- That's the reason.

00:50:07.765 --> 00:50:08.598
- [chuckles] That's the reason?

00:50:08.598 --> 00:50:09.431
- [chuckles] That's the reason, yes.

00:50:09.431 --> 00:50:10.264
- Really?

00:50:10.264 --> 00:50:11.097
- Yeah.

00:50:11.097 --> 00:50:11.930
- You're not kidding?

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:12.763
- [Karl] I'm not kidding.

00:50:12.763 --> 00:50:13.720
- So stimulating the
vagus to treat depression,

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.460
simply because it's accessible.

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.487
- It started actually
as an epilepsy treatment

00:50:19.487 --> 00:50:22.378
and it can help with epilepsy,
but yes, it's simple.

00:50:22.378 --> 00:50:23.700
- God, you got to love medicine.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.270
As a scientist, this is
where I get to chuckle

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.450
and you say, I'm in the field of medicine

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.260
from that perspective.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.200
From the perspective of
a scientist and outsider,

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.400
the field of medicine
is a field that goes in

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.513
and tickles pathways
because they're there.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.769
I don't know what to say.
It's a little shocking.

00:50:44.769 --> 00:50:46.743
- Yeah.

00:50:48.602 --> 00:50:50.070
And at least in my laboratory,

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.040
I always say you never do an
experiment because you can,

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.078
you do an experiment to
test a specific hypothesis.

00:50:56.078 --> 00:50:56.911
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:50:56.911 --> 00:50:59.640
I mean, there are stories people tell

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.910
so that the vagus nerve
lands on a particular spot

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.970
on the brain called the
solitary tract nucleus,

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:09.240
which is just one snaps
away from the serotonin

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.440
and dopamine and the norepinephrine-

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.310
- So there's a link to
chemical systems in the brain-

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.770
that make an irrational choice?

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:15.603
- Yes.

00:51:15.603 --> 00:51:16.436
It's not irrational,

00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:19.410
but I can tell you that
even if that were not true,

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:20.676
the same thing would have been tried.

00:51:20.676 --> 00:51:21.840
[Andrew laughs]

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.673
- You guys would have done it anyway.

00:51:22.673 --> 00:51:23.970
- Because it's accessible. Yeah.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.120
- [Andrew] I see. Okay.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:27.143
- And why?

00:51:27.143 --> 00:51:30.520
Well, it's again, not to disparage

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.970
what's been happening in
this branch of medicine.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.360
There's immense suffering,
many treatments don't work,

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.585
and we try things.

00:51:40.585 --> 00:51:43.000
And this is how so many
advances in medicine happen.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.670
When think about kidney dialysis

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:46.980
which has kept many people alive,

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.307
that was just started by someone saying,

00:51:48.307 --> 00:51:49.760
"Hey, let's try this.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.520
Maybe there's something
building up in the blood

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.430
and maybe we can dialyze
something and help them."

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.263
Yeah, it worked.

00:51:54.263 --> 00:51:56.693
And it was just sort of
a test pilot mentality.

00:51:57.613 --> 00:51:59.720
We can access the blood,

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.760
let's run it across a dialysis membrane,

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.950
put it back in the body, oh
my God, that actually works.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.970
And sometimes you do need
that test pilot mentality,

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.540
of course, to do it in a rigorous, safe,

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.373
controlled way-
- Sure.

00:52:10.373 --> 00:52:11.206
- which is what we do.

00:52:11.206 --> 00:52:14.590
And so, anyway, that's how we ended up,

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.880
but still with the vagus
nerve stimulation, okay,

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.783
so what is it? Does it work?

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.820
It has, it's FDA approved for depression,

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.560
this vagus nerve stimulation,
but on a population level,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.170
if you average across all people,

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:30.780
the effect sizes are pretty small.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.690
Some patients it has an amazing effect in,

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.560
but some patients it doesn't work at all,

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.220
and average across everybody,

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.540
the effect size is pretty small.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.880
- How do you think it's
working when it does work?

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.460
Is it triggering the activation of neurons

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.480
that release more serotonin or dopamine?

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.120
- It could be, but I would
say we don't have evidence

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.530
for that and so I just don't know.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.380
But what is clear, is
that it's dose-limited

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.720
in how high and strongly we can stimulate

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.970
and why, it's because it's an electrode,

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.490
and it's stimulating everything nearby.

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.700
And when you turn on the
vagus nerve stimulator,

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.250
the patient's voice becomes
strangulated and hoarse,

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.080
they can have trouble swallowing,

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.360
they can have trouble speaking for sure,

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.350
even some trouble breathing,
because everything in the neck,

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:16.420
every electrically responsive cell

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.340
and projection in the
neck is being affected

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.173
by this electrode.

00:53:20.173 --> 00:53:24.070
And so you can go up just
so far with the intensity,

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:25.740
and then you have to stop.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.020
So, to your initial question,

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:32.110
could a more precise stimulation
method like optogenetics

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.450
help in the setting?

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:34.410
In principle, it could,

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:38.180
because if you would target
the light sensitivity

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.823
to just the right kind of cell,

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.110
let's say cell X that goes
from point A to point B

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:47.440
that you know, causes symptom
relief of a particular kind,

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.290
then you're in business.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.530
You can have that be the only
cell that's light sensitive.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.490
You're not going to affect
any of the other cells,

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:54.950
the larynx and the pharynx

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:57.500
and the projections passing through.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.010
So that's the hope,
that's the opportunity.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.990
The problem, is that we
don't yet have that level

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.930
of specific knowledge.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.750
We don't know, okay, it's
the cells starting at point A

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:09.230
going to point B, that relieves
this particular symptom.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:11.080
- We want to fix this key on the piano?

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:11.913
- Yeah.

00:54:11.913 --> 00:54:14.990
- And then I see two other
steps that are required.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.570
One is to get the channelopsin
gene into the cell.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.070
In the case of Botond Rosca and colleagues

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:21.793
rescuing vision in this patient,

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.600
they did that by an injection of a virus

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.680
that doesn't damage the neurons.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.350
The virus itself is fairly innocuous,

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:33.120
but carries a cargo, and
it's a one-time injection,

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.350
the cells express, and then
they used light to stimulate.

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:41.180
So, let's say I'm depressed,
which I don't think I am,

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.508
although now sitting in
front of a psychiatrist,

00:54:42.508 --> 00:54:43.341
[Karl laughs]

00:54:43.341 --> 00:54:44.960
you probably can see signs that maybe I am

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.650
or maybe I'm not, but let's
say we put channelopsin

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:53.650
into a specific branch of
the vagus that we understand

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.620
is responsible for mood,

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.400
how are we going to get it in there?

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.350
And, then how are we going
to deliver the light?

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:01.810
'Cause we're not talking about sunlight

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.466
or standing in front of
a light bulb necessarily,

00:55:04.466 --> 00:55:07.080
what are the mechanisms for the body?

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:07.913
- Yeah.

00:55:07.913 --> 00:55:09.990
So we had to solve exactly
these questions you're saying.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.970
How do you get the light in?

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.100
How do you get the gene in,

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.690
in a potent and robust and safe way?

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.820
And that's now solved, and
that's not a challenge.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.500
So there are very safe,

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:27.450
well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:31.200
that are called
adeno-associated viruses, AAVs,

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.260
and these are things that are associated

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:35.810
with the common cold.

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.380
They themselves don't cause any symptoms.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.180
They've been engineered, and
there's been a broad community

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.700
of viral engineering that's
been going on for decades

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.340
making these safer,
well-tolerated, and so on.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.990
We can put the channelrhodopsin
gene into these

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:55.110
viral vectors that deliver the gene

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.600
and we can have little
bits of additional DNA

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.050
that govern expression
only in one kind of cell,

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:00.883
but not another.

00:56:00.883 --> 00:56:03.210
These are called promoters and enhancers,

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.080
all genetic tricks built up
by a very broad community

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.880
of great scientists over the decades.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.780
We can put these different bits of DNA,

00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.840
package them into this
AAV, this little virus,

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.630
and that can be then injected

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:20.075
into a particular part of the body,

00:56:20.075 --> 00:56:23.260
and sticking with this
vagus nerve example,

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.730
we know that there are
particular clumps of neurons.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.920
There's one called the nodose ganglion

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:32.090
that has a clump of cells
related to the vagus nerve,

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:34.780
and you could for example,
target a little injection

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:36.010
into that ganglion-

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.623
- Would that be an outpatient procedure?

00:56:37.623 --> 00:56:38.456
- Yep. Yep.

00:56:38.456 --> 00:56:40.280
- So you come in in the
morning, get your injection,

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.730
maybe walk out a few hours later?

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:42.630
- Yeah. That's right.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.223
And so that's the gene,

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:47.560
then the light delivery,
this is also something

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.700
that we've worked out.

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:51.753
We've worked on making very,
very light-sensitive opsins.

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:57.530
One challenge, and Botond would
be the first to state this

00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:00.140
in fact, [chuckles] in solving
this problem for the patient,

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:05.140
he had to build goggles that
created much brighter light

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.790
than the normal ambient light delivery,

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.640
because as I mentioned earlier,

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.970
you have to pack a lot of
these channelrhodopsins in,

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:15.690
they don't have much current.

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:17.260
You have to really make sure

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.560
that you've got a tense enough light

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.724
to activate enough of them
to cause a stimulation-

00:57:21.724 --> 00:57:23.234
- And it has to be the
right wavelength, right?

00:57:23.234 --> 00:57:24.067
- It has to be the right wavelength-

00:57:24.067 --> 00:57:25.440
- And going back to your
example of the algae

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.530
moving toward or away the light,

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:30.210
it has to be tuned just right.

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:34.450
So I'm imagining in my
mind as a non-engineer,

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.100
I know you're [chuckles]
also a bioengineer,

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:42.793
I'm imagining a little tiny
blue light-emitting object,

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.260
that's a little bigger
than a clump of cells,

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.410
or maybe about the size
of a clump of cells.

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:50.910
And for those that don't know,

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:56.610
your credit card is about 200
microns thick on the side,

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.800
and a micron is a
thousandths of a millimeter,

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.200
and so we're talking
about a little tiny stamp

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:08.420
that's basically half a
millimeter in size all around.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.400
Each edge, half a millimeter in size.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.780
I can imagine that
being put under my skin,

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:17.590
and then I would what, I'd
hit an app on my phone,

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:22.250
and I'd say, "Dr. Deisseroth,
I'm not feeling great today.

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:23.720
Can I increase the stimulation?"

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.810
And you'd say, "Go for it."

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:25.710
And then I'd ramp it up.

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:26.570
Is that how it would go?

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:28.260
- I mean, that's effectively
what we already do

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.907
with the vagus nerve stimulation.

00:58:29.907 --> 00:58:31.980
The doctor in this case, and I have this

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.310
in some of my patients in the clinic,

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:34.540
I do vagus nerve stimulation.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.950
I talk to them, I say, "How are you?"

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:39.130
I go through the symptoms, I
use the psychiatric interview

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.260
to elicit their internal states,

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:44.110
and then I have a radio
frequency controller

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.250
that I can dial in-

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:46.590
- Right there in real time?

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:47.423
- Right there in real time.

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:48.480
- You're holding the remote control

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.460
essentially to their brain,
although it's remote controlled?

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.857
- Yeah, through a couple
of steps, but yeah.

00:58:53.857 --> 00:58:56.531
And I can turn up the frequency,

00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:58.460
I can turn up the intensity,

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.240
all with the radio frequency and control,

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.733
and then it's reprogrammed or redosed,

00:59:05.733 --> 00:59:09.040
and then the patient can then
leave at this altered dose.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.100
- So this is happening now?

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.310
- This is happening
right now, electrically.

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.263
- You do this routinely?

00:59:12.263 --> 00:59:14.140
- I do it routinely in my
clinic, electrically, yeah.

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:17.190
- And you're getting the verbal content,

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:20.930
which as you described
earlier, is the indication

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:23.113
of how well something
is working in real time?

00:59:23.113 --> 00:59:23.946
- Yes.

00:59:23.946 --> 00:59:24.779
- So this is what, maybe
you could just describe

00:59:24.779 --> 00:59:27.175
a little bit of the interaction
with that particular patient

00:59:27.175 --> 00:59:30.100
or another patient, what's a typical arc

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.580
of narrative as you go from no stimulation

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.291
to increased stimulation?

00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:39.570
- In most patients, the
actual therapeutic effects,

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:43.050
the benefits actually
take many days to weeks,

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:46.640
and so what I'm mostly
focusing on in the office

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.460
in real time, is making sure

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.200
I'm in a safe, low side effect regime.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.931
And so first I talk to the patient

00:59:52.931 --> 00:59:56.260
who has been on a particular
dose of the stimulation

00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.560
for weeks or longer, and
I talk about symptoms,

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.760
how were things over the past month?

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.593
How was your hope?

01:00:03.593 --> 01:00:05.030
How was your energy level?

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.073
Sleep? What is your mood?

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.530
And then we talk with the patient

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:12.320
and we decide, well, this is
not yet where we'd like to be.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.780
And so then, I can turn up the
intensity of the stimulation

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.763
in real time in the office.

01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:21.150
In most patients, I don't
expect an immediate mood change.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:26.150
What I do, is I increase the
dose until a next level up,

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.130
while asking the patient for side effects.

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:29.510
Can you still breathe? Okay.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.850
Can you still swallow? Okay.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:32.270
And I can hear their voice as well.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.140
And I can get a sense-

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.973
- And you're looking at their face?

01:00:33.973 --> 01:00:34.806
- And I'm looking at their face.

01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:36.330
- Yeah.
- And so I can get a sense,

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.553
am I still on a safe side effect regime?

01:00:42.101 --> 01:00:45.920
And then, I stop at a particular
point that looks safe,

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.540
and then the patient goes
home, comes back a month later,

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.340
and I get the report on how
things were over that month.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.990
- I asked if you're looking at their face,

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:56.093
'cause in your book,

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:00.080
you describe the incredible complexity

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.900
of social interactions.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.380
And at one point,

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:09.150
you describe the incredible
amount of information

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:12.340
that the eyes inform about the brain

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.950
and the context of
somebody's inner experience,

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:16.639
whether depressed or happy or otherwise.

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:17.472
- Yeah.

01:01:17.472 --> 01:01:20.954
- I want to make sure that we
get back to how to maneuver

01:01:20.954 --> 01:01:23.290
and manipulate the nervous system

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:24.790
for the sake of mental health.

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.870
But, what are you looking for?

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:30.300
So as a vision scientist,

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.190
I think pupils dilating
is a sign of arousal,

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.810
but that could be a positive
arousal, positive valence,

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.310
like excitement, or it could be terror.

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:39.143
- Yeah.

01:01:39.143 --> 01:01:41.043
- You're going to get the
same dilation of the pupils.

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:43.703
And I'm always reminding people

01:01:43.703 --> 01:01:45.930
that these two little goodies
are two pieces of brain,

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:46.763
basically,
[Karl chuckles]

01:01:46.763 --> 01:01:47.960
they're just outside the cranial vault.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.820
So they're not unlike
the vagus in that sense,

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.360
but they're more of a
report than a control knob,

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.750
although I'd like to
think they could be used

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:55.863
as control knobs too.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.630
So, without putting you on the spot,

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:00.997
again, to diagnose me,
[Karl laughs]

01:02:00.997 --> 01:02:03.089
that's something I would
never ask you to do

01:02:03.089 --> 01:02:04.580
[Karl laughing]
with the cameras rolling,

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.000
but what are you looking for

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.200
that the patient might not be aware of?

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.600
In other words, can you see
depression in somebody's eyes?

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.250
And if you know a patient or if you don't,

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:19.173
can you see it in their body
posture when they walk in?

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.410
Realizing of course, that
a trained psychiatrist

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.310
like yourself, develops an intuitive sense

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.060
that's aggregating lots of
different features of a patient,

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.280
but what about the eyes?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.330
What's going on there?

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:32.163
- Yeah.

01:02:32.163 --> 01:02:34.620
The eyes are incredibly
rich in information.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:37.600
And as you alluded to though,

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.930
it's not as if any one measurable

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.480
conveys all the information you need.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.241
It's what an engineer would
say, joint statistics.

01:02:46.241 --> 01:02:49.040
It's many things all at once,

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.730
whether they're in synchrony
or out of synchrony,

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:54.740
that actually turns out to matter.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.010
And the eye contact question,

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:00.160
we all know eye contact
is incredibly important.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.650
You don't feel you've
connected with somebody,

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:06.473
unless there's eye contact, but
eye contact can go awry too.

01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:09.790
It can be too intense,

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:14.790
or it can be mistimed, or if
there's someone with autism,

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.330
it can be barely there at all.

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:21.220
And this is one of the most
striking symptoms of autism,

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.103
is the avoidance of eye contact,

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.940
almost as if it's a harmful quantity.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.830
And so there's an immense
amount of information

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.470
you get from the eyes,

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:40.420
but it's the pairing of
what's going on in the eyes,

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.210
with everything else going
on, the body language,

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:46.940
the verbal content of what's coming out.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.608
All that together is the art of psychiatry

01:03:50.608 --> 01:03:53.210
and social interaction.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.170
But sometimes you don't
have the eye contact.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.310
And this is an amazing thing

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.170
and I do talk about this
in the book as well.

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.670
In many cases in psychiatry,
sometimes it's over the phone

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.150
that you have to make key decisions.

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:09.150
And as I recall, vividly
being as a resident,

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.770
very often you have to
take these phone calls

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:17.100
from people who are not in the hospital,

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.327
people you can't see,
you can't see their eyes,

01:04:19.327 --> 01:04:21.710
you can't see their body
or anything about them,

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.240
just the sound of their voice.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.750
And you can ask them questions,

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.140
and you have to make, in some cases,

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.530
life or death decisions.

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.770
Is this person truly suicidal?

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:34.220
Something like that, as
it comes up all the time.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.933
And so I developed over
the course of training,

01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:41.890
and I think all psychiatrists do this,

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:45.020
is you develop a way that
data stream you have,

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.550
whether it's the eyes or
whether it's just the sound

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.570
of a voice coming over the phone,

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:51.760
you learn to hone in on
that data stream you have

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.211
and focus on it and identify changes

01:04:56.211 --> 01:04:58.620
and it's quite amazing.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.630
I found that you can actually...

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:05.290
If you know a patient, you can
detect very precise changes

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:07.220
in mood, just from the sound of the voice.

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.030
And you can have a realization

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:13.420
that oh, this patient's
depression has improved

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:18.630
by about half, just by
the tone of their voice.

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.440
And same with eyes, with enough practice,

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.810
you can get enough information
from a single data stream

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:26.430
to give you some information,

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.440
but when you do have the whole picture

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.900
of that, of course, is best.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.900
- So, so many theories out
there about excessive blinking

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:38.133
and lying, lack of
blinking and sociopathy.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.080
I like to remind people

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.666
that people have varying degrees
of lubrication of the eyes,

01:05:43.666 --> 01:05:44.590
[Karl laughs]
which also influence

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:47.330
the frequency of blinking and
presumably have nothing to do

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:50.650
with whether or not what
they're saying is true or not.

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:54.150
But incredible, nonetheless,
that the eyes are a portal

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:56.560
to overall arousal state.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.060
I'm fascinated by the effects
of light on circadian biology

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:02.633
and just overall desire to be
awake or asleep, et cetera.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.480
So the eyes are on the
outside of the cranial vault.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.863
The vagus is outside the
cranial vault, obviously.

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.563
What about the goodies in here?

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:19.090
Parkinson's, we know at
least one of the major sites

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:22.363
of degeneration and failure
that lead to those symptoms.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:25.900
I can name off any number of other things.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.810
In your book, you talk about
the beautiful work done

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:30.570
with optogenetics of active
versus passive coping,

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.380
that there are areas of
the brain like the habenula

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:36.430
that when active, make
animals and presumably people,

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:40.930
passive and unwilling, or
uninterested in fighting back

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.320
against pressures of life,
whereas another region,

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.040
the raphe, you stimulate
that, and they actively cope.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.560
They get their grit going,

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.910
and they are able to lean into life.

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:56.910
So, how does one get to those
structures in a focused way?

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:02.580
And what does the next two to
five, to 10 years look like?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.460
- Well, this is the promise on that,

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:08.260
and it is on a timescale

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.823
that I think things may start to play out.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.560
The specificity of optogenetics
is really only useful

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.500
if you have some idea of
how to use that specificity.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.760
And actually, it's a
frustrating aspect of psychiatry

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.960
that in many cases, the most
effective treatments we have,

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.970
have the least specificity,

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:33.330
electroconvulsive therapy
being a great example,

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:34.920
where you're causing a brainwide-

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.710
- Which looks barbaric, but
as you mentioned is effective.

01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:39.050
- I mean, it is.

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:41.680
These days, it's much
more clinically safe-

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.803
- It doesn't look like one
fluid there last seen in the lab

01:07:43.803 --> 01:07:45.300
[indistinct]
- No it doesn't.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.183
Now it's a very clinically
safe and stable procedure,

01:07:49.377 --> 01:07:51.503
but I would say yeah,

01:07:51.503 --> 01:07:56.270
it's got this almost
medieval lack of specificity,

01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:59.210
even if the procedure is
well-controlled and clinically safe

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:02.740
and stable, and it's not very specific.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.270
You're causing a brainwide seizure.

01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:06.260
How could you be less specific than that?

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.020
- And we don't know the
source of the relief.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:09.894
- [Karl] We don't know-

01:08:09.894 --> 01:08:11.350
- Presumably it's a
dump of neuromodulators

01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:13.541
like dopamine and serotonin,
but we don't really know-

01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:14.910
- There certainly is a
dump of neuromodulators.

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:18.210
We don't know that that's
the cause for the relief.

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:20.240
And likewise with medications,

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.290
this is an awesome and interesting thing.

01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:26.170
Some of the most
effective antidepressants,

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.240
some of the most effective anti-psychotics

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.740
are the ones that have
the most side effects

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.560
and there are many examples of this.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.200
For example, the most
effective anti-psychotic

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.700
is something called clozapine,

01:08:38.242 --> 01:08:39.790
which unquestionably has
the most side effects.

01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:40.887
It has terrible, terrible side effects.

01:08:40.887 --> 01:08:42.360
- The D4 antagonist?

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.880
- It has basically
every receptor. [laughs]

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.713
- Does it really?

01:08:45.713 --> 01:08:46.860
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:51.040
- Yeah, it has prominent
serotonin, prominent muscarinic,

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.880
certainly acts on dopamine receptors,

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.880
but it causes blood cell
counts change- [laughs]

01:08:58.047 --> 01:08:59.400
- How do people feel?

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.070
So if I were schizophrenic

01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:05.240
and I was getting auditory
hallucinations, et cetera,

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.240
and I took clozapine, what
could I expect to feel?

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.570
- Well, so you would notice side effects,

01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:16.550
and you would notice resolution
of symptoms both and-

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:17.870
- So the voices would go away?

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:18.703
- Yeah.

01:09:18.703 --> 01:09:19.674
- But in a good situation,

01:09:19.674 --> 01:09:21.430
the voices would go away?
- That's right.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.720
- But I would feel not good in my body?

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.290
- You might have dizziness,

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:31.040
you might have drooling,
you might have any number

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.040
of physical sensations
that would be due to these

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.390
off target effects, the medication acting

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:40.670
on these other receptors-

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:41.820
- I'm certainly not suggesting this,

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.180
but what if somebody without
schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.432
- They'd have the same side
effects presumably, yeah.

01:09:47.432 --> 01:09:50.621
And so it would not be something
that I would recommend.

01:09:50.621 --> 01:09:51.454
- Yeah.

01:09:51.454 --> 01:09:53.160
Do psychiatrists take the
drugs that they prescribe?

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:53.993
[Karl laughs]

01:09:53.993 --> 01:09:55.760
I just finished for the third time,

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.333
Oliver Sacks' autobiography
which is marvelous

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:02.120
and I highly recommend to people.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.873
He certainly took a lot of drugs,

01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:07.163
not as part of his professional role,

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:11.700
but just out of curiosity,
what is the interest

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.000
or kind of role of drugs
in the field of psychiatry?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.610
Because I would imagine for a group

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:19.200
of very curious introspective people

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.650
who are making recommendations
about what to take,

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.280
there could actually be some
benefit for understanding

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.490
what the experience of
those drugs was like

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:27.370
for their patients.

01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:29.017
- I think that's true.

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:32.240
And I will say that probably
many or most psychiatrists

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.430
have sampled the number of
these for exactly the reason

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:38.560
that you're saying is to understand better

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.305
and to help treat their patients better.

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:42.555
And I've spoken to people

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:47.060
who have found this very helpful to know,

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.350
okay, this sleep disruption
caused by this medication

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:53.270
or the libido disruption caused
by this other medication.

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:55.126
Wow, that is a big effect.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.680
And it really helps with empathy

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.514
for the patients to understand.

01:10:59.514 --> 01:11:03.250
- I'm not suggesting that
physicians or anybody

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:07.480
experiment with drugs, but
I am relieved to hear that,

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.820
because I think that when you're talking

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.580
about accessing somebody's mind
and their basic physiology,

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.540
as you've mentioned, relate
to appetite, libido and sleep,

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.740
really, one is acting as a mechanic

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.830
of the person's whole experience.

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:24.360
They walk out of the office
and they have a life experience

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.880
that extends beyond the script.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.060
- Yeah.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.420
And so at the same time though,

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.780
you can't let that completely
guide your clinical decisions,

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.360
because as I mentioned,
some of these medications

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.470
that have the most side effects,

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:38.200
they are also the most effective

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.620
and clozapine is a great example.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.510
That will work in patients
where nothing else works.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.590
And believe me, we don't take the step

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:46.810
of clozapine prescription lightly,

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.310
because of all these side effects.

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:50.680
You have to come in for
a weekly blood cell,

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.470
or every few weeks of blood cell check,

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:55.820
to make sure that the blood
counts are not off for example,

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.620
but there are patients where
no other medication works

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.734
for the schizophrenia and
clozapine works amazingly well-

01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:01.767
- That's marvelous.

01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:05.320
- And so we do it, even though
there are the side effects.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.340
And so then this comes
back to your question,

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.860
what if we had better
and better specificity?

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.757
Well, only if we know exactly
what we're doing is the point.

01:12:12.757 --> 01:12:15.920
And so because as we become more refined,

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.280
we'd better be right about
where we we're refining to..

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.050
- And do you imagine
a day where it will be

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:24.320
a single, maybe even
outpatient neurosurgery,

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.400
would go in through the
skull or the back of the ear,

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.607
deliver a small viral injection

01:12:27.607 --> 01:12:29.580
of one of these adenoviruses,

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.683
a little sticker of light-emitting diode,

01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:36.610
deep in the brain, is that
how you envision this someday?

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:37.720
- That certainly could happen.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.720
What I actually prefer as a
vision is still medications,

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.760
because those are minimally invasive.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.890
If we knew what we were doing,

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:53.970
we could make them more specific,
have fewer side effects,

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.130
but optogenetics, that will arm us

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:58.060
with true causal understanding.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.020
And so we'll know,

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.480
and we're already moving
rapidly toward this point,

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.563
we'll know okay, this symptom,

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:08.300
loss of pleasure in life
that we call anhedonia,

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.220
or the loss of motivation or energy

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.413
to overcome challenges, active coping,

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.540
these are largely subserved,
largely controlled

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.033
by this circuit or that
circuit or the cell

01:13:22.033 --> 01:13:24.210
that inhabits this other circuit.

01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:26.630
- And we will know that
because of the work done

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:27.463
with channelopsins?

01:13:27.463 --> 01:13:28.780
- Exactly.
- Yeah. I agree.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:32.300
- In ways that we never could
have the confidence otherwise.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.304
And so we'll know that this is the circuit

01:13:34.304 --> 01:13:38.610
that underlies the
symptom or its resolution.

01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:42.950
And then we'll get to understand
these cells very deeply,

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:46.560
okay, these cells that are
causal, that do matter,

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.860
who are they? What's their wiring?

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.170
What are the proteins that they make?

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:54.070
What are the little things
that are on the surface

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:57.620
of the cell that could be
receptors for specific medications

01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.330
or combinations of receptors

01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:02.870
that would give us the
specificity we need?

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:06.590
And then, armed with
that causal and precise

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:09.020
and rigorous knowledge,
then you can imagine

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.050
medication development
becoming totally different,

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:15.410
no longer serendipitous, but
truly grounded in causality.

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:16.243
- I see.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:19.190
So using channelopsins as a
way to probe the circuitry

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:22.970
and figure out the sites
that are disrupted,

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:24.910
what patterns of activity are required?

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:28.390
And then, by understanding the
constituents of those cells,

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.040
like what they express and what they make,

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.860
then developing drugs that
could target those cells,

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.310
not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:38.200
into the brain, or walking
around with wire packs

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.886
attached to our skull
or something like that.

01:14:39.886 --> 01:14:40.890
- [Karl] Right. Exactly.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:42.350
- That's fantastic.

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:46.450
And I realized no one has a crystal ball,

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:50.350
but what do you think the arc of that is?

01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:53.030
Meaning, are we going
to see that in a year?

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.410
In two years? Three years?

01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.423
Let me reframe that.

01:14:57.490 --> 01:15:00.870
How soon will a pill-based treatment

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:03.100
for a psychiatric disease be available,

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:06.370
that targets a specific set of cells

01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:10.200
that we know are important
because of the work done

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.950
with channelopsins?

01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:16.950
- I think that in some
ways it's already happening

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.123
at the level of individual patients-

01:15:20.045 --> 01:15:21.010
- Here at Stanford?

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:22.614
- Yeah. Yup.

01:15:22.614 --> 01:15:26.490
And more broadly in terms of new drugs,

01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:30.640
new multi-centered clinical
trials that will play out

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.203
over the next few years.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.320
And these could be drugs
that are already safe

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.420
and approved for other purposes,

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.830
but we might say okay, now we know

01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:45.950
that this medication,
based on what we know

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:49.230
from causal optogenetics,
this could be useful

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:52.740
for this other purpose,
this psychiatric symptom.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:56.530
And so the path to helping patients

01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:59.020
could be relatively swift.

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.750
- That's very exciting.

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:03.920
What are your thoughts about
brain machine interface

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.760
and Neuralink always comes up,

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.690
although I do want to point
out a tremendous respect

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:10.780
for the folks at Neuralink

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.530
including someone who
came up through my lab,

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:13.730
is now there as a neurosurgeon,

01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:16.970
but the brain machine
interface is something

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:19.210
that's been happening for a long time now,

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:22.580
some of the best work, among
the best work being done here

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.750
at Stanford and elsewhere too of course,

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.020
is what you just described compatible with

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.770
or different than brain machine interface,

01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:32.560
meaning devices, little
probes are going to stimulate

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.440
different patterns of activity
and ensembles of neurons?

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.730
And what are your general thoughts

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:40.233
about brain machine
interfaces going forward?

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:43.379
- I mean, first of all,

01:16:43.379 --> 01:16:47.280
it's an amazing scientific
discovery approach,

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.410
as you mentioned, we and
others here at Stanford

01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:52.180
are using electrodes,
collecting information

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.530
from tens of thousands of neurons-

01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:56.380
- In humans, I should
add. Yeah. [chuckles]

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.360
- And even, yes, it is quite even separate

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.170
from the Neuralink work as you point out,

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:05.150
many people have been
doing this in humans,

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:06.823
as well as in non-human primates.

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:10.840
And this is pretty
powerful, it's important.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.740
This will let us understand
what's going on in the brain,

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:18.180
in psychiatric disease
and neurological disease,

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.133
and will give us ideas for treatment.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.527
It is, of course still invasive.

01:17:24.527 --> 01:17:29.527
You still are talking about
putting a device into the brain.

01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:34.210
And that has to be treated

01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:36.810
as a situation that has some risks,

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:39.403
and a step that has to be taken carefully.

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:42.270
I see that as something

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:47.270
that will be part of
psychiatry in the long run,

01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:51.050
already with deep brain
stimulation approaches,

01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:54.680
we can help people with
psychiatric disorders.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.560
And that's putting just
a single electrode,

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.310
not even a complex closed loop system

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:02.830
where you're both playing in
and getting information back,

01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:06.000
even just a single stimulation
electrode in the brain

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.063
can help people with OCD, for
example, quite powerfully.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.710
And that will become much more powerful

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:15.010
when we get to a true
brain machine interface,

01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:17.370
collecting information back,

01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:18.940
stimulating only when you need to.

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:23.340
If we could identify a
pathological activity pattern,

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.670
a particular, almost like the prodrome

01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:27.140
or the early stage of a seizure,

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:30.340
maybe there are events
that happened leading up to

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:34.213
on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom

01:18:34.213 --> 01:18:37.300
that we could intervene
in a closed loop way

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.260
to detect what's happening,
what's starting to go wrong,

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:43.310
feed that back to the brain
stimulation electrode,

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:46.613
have it be in that way more
efficient and more principled.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.370
I think it's great.

01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:53.450
It's something that of
course will be grounded again

01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:55.130
and causal understanding,
we'll need to know,

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.640
what is that pathological
pattern that we're detecting?

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.050
And we need to know that it matters.

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:00.933
And so again, that's where
optogenetics is helping us.

01:19:00.933 --> 01:19:04.210
It's helping us know, okay,
this pattern of activity

01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:07.840
in these cells and these
circuits, this does mean

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.123
that there's a particular kind
of symptom that's happening.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.991
But armed with that knowledge, absolutely,

01:19:13.991 --> 01:19:17.600
even the simple closed loop
device detect and stimulate

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.352
is going to be part of
psychiatry in the future.

01:19:19.352 --> 01:19:22.640
And then of course, as
you get to more cells,

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.830
more connections, the ability
that we have to help people

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.130
will become more powerful.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.160
- One of the questions I get
asked a lot is about ADHD

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.020
and attention deficit of various kinds.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.210
I have a hunch, that one
reason I get asked so often

01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:44.010
is that people are feeling
really distracted and challenged

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:47.023
in funneling their attention
and their behavior.

01:19:49.501 --> 01:19:51.250
And there are number of
reasons for that, of course,

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:56.250
but what is true ADHD, and
what does it look like?

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.020
What can be done for it?

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:01.390
And what if any role for channelopsins

01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:04.750
or these downstream technologies
that you're developing,

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:08.470
what do they offer for
people that suffer from ADHD

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:11.493
or have a family member
that suffers from ADHD?

01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:16.333
- This is a pretty interesting
branch of psychiatry.

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:18.660
There's no question that
people have been helped

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.640
by the treatments, there's active debate

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.640
over what fraction of people
who have these symptoms

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:29.860
can or should be treated?

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:32.350
- This is typically Adderall
or stimulants of some kind?

01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:34.710
- Yeah, for example the
stimulants, that's right.

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:39.490
So ADHD as its name
suggests, it has symptoms of,

01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:41.910
it can have either a hyperactive state

01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:44.410
or an inattentive state,

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:48.070
and those can be completely
separate from each other.

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:51.720
You could have a patient who effectively

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.050
is not hyperactive at all,
but can remain focused

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.080
on what's going on around them-

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.470
- So the body can be still,

01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:00.630
but their mind is darting around?

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:01.463
- That's right.

01:21:01.463 --> 01:21:03.340
- Or they can be very
hyperactive with their body.

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.173
- Yeah, it happens both ways.

01:21:04.173 --> 01:21:06.120
- Probably rarely is somebody
hyperactive with their body

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.230
but their mind is still,

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.063
[Karl laughs]
although I have to say,

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:10.820
and this is a benevolent
shout out to Botond Rosca,

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:14.810
Botond has an incredibly
sharp and focused mind.

01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:15.643
- Yeah.

01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:16.568
- And his hand movements

01:21:16.568 --> 01:21:17.980
[Karl laughs]
are extremely exact also,

01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.630
so I do sometimes wonder, whether or not

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:22.463
our body movements and our head movements,

01:21:22.463 --> 01:21:24.330
whether or not they're coordinated or not

01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:28.540
is a readout of how
directed our attention is.

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:31.400
- I noticed, I have to think
complex, abstract thoughts.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.970
I noticed I have to be very still.

01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:36.020
So my body has to be
almost completely on moving

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.620
for me to think very
abstractly and deeply.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.620
Other people are different.

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:41.790
Some people, when they're running,

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:42.800
they get their best thoughts.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.100
I can't even imagine that.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.880
My brain does not work that way at all.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.860
I have to be totally motionless, [laughs]

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:48.870
which is kind of interesting.

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.040
- How do you go about that?

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:55.040
- I sit much like this, I
try to have time in each day

01:21:56.150 --> 01:22:01.150
where I'm literally sitting
almost in this position,

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.210
but without distraction and thinking,

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:07.440
and so it's almost
meditative in some ways,

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.440
except it's not true meditation,

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.134
but I am thinking, well, I'm not moving-

01:22:13.134 --> 01:22:15.644
- You're trying to structure
your thoughts in that time?

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:16.477
- Yeah.

01:22:16.477 --> 01:22:17.550
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:20.760
So, but everybody, as you
say is very different.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.610
And so with ADHD, the key
thing is we want to make sure

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:28.770
that this is present across
different domains of life,

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:31.050
school and home, to show that it really

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:34.200
is a pervasive pattern,
and not something specific

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.030
to the teacher or the home
situation or something.

01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:39.190
And then you can help patients.

01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:42.580
It's interesting that ADHD
is one of those disorders

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.910
where people are trying to work

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:46.630
on quantitative EEG-based diagnoses,

01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:48.360
and so there's some progress

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.750
toward making a diagnosis
looking at particular,

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:55.330
externally detectable brainwave rhythm-

01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:57.070
- So skullcap with some electrodes

01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:58.300
that don't penetrate the skull?

01:22:58.300 --> 01:22:59.133
- That's right.

01:22:59.133 --> 01:23:01.447
- And this can be done in
an hour or two-hour session?

01:23:01.447 --> 01:23:02.280
- Yeah, that's right.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.970
- It has to be done in a clinic, right?

01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:05.087
- Yeah, in the clinic, right,

01:23:05.087 --> 01:23:07.060
and you have to have the
right recording apparatus

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:07.893
and so on,

01:23:10.503 --> 01:23:13.420
but in principle, increase
in confidence comes

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:18.390
in exactly which measurements
one could even imagine

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.493
moving toward home tests,
but we're not there yet.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.293
- Amazing.

01:23:23.293 --> 01:23:25.160
I think one of the reasons
I get asked about it so much

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.010
is a lot of people
wonder if they have ADHD.

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:30.860
Do you think that some
of the lifestyle factors

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:34.510
that inhabit us all these days,

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:38.040
could induce a subclinical
or a clinical-like ADHD?

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.740
I look at people's phone
use including my own,

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:44.500
and I don't think of it like addiction,

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.130
it looks to me and feels
to me more like OCD.

01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:48.970
And I'll come clean here by
saying when I was younger,

01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:51.360
when I was a kid, I had a grunting tic.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.193
I used to hide it.

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.530
I actually used to hide in the closet,

01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:55.373
'cause my dad would make me stop.

01:23:57.536 --> 01:23:59.230
And I couldn't feel any relief of my mind

01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:00.590
until I [grunts] would do this.

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:02.950
And actually now, if I get very tired,

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:05.153
if I've been pushing long
hours, it'll come back.

01:24:05.153 --> 01:24:05.986
- Interesting.

01:24:05.986 --> 01:24:07.003
- I was not treated for it,

01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:11.270
but I will confess that
I've had the experience

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:14.490
of, I always liked sports where
I involved a lot of impact,

01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:16.960
fortunately not football,
because I went to a high school

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.470
where the football team was terrible.

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.093
Maybe that would have avoided more impact,

01:24:20.093 --> 01:24:20.926
[Karl laughs]

01:24:20.926 --> 01:24:23.010
but things like skateboarding, boxing,

01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:24.640
they bring relief.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.764
I feel clarity after a
head hit, which I avoid,

01:24:27.764 --> 01:24:28.597
[Karl laughs]

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:30.120
but I used to say that's the only time

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.740
I feel truly clear for a while.

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.230
And then eventually it dissipated.

01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:35.913
By about age 16, 17, it just disappeared.

01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:40.030
So I have great empathy
for those that feel

01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:41.650
like there's something contained in them

01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:42.880
that won't allow them to focus

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.620
on what they want to focus on.

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.530
And these days, with the phone

01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:50.810
and all these email, et cetera, I wonder

01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:53.260
and I empathize a bit
when I hear people saying

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:57.560
like, "I think I might have ADHD or ADD".

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.250
Do you think it's possible
that our behaviors

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.630
and our interaction
with the sensory world,

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.950
which is really what phones
and email really are,

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:08.744
could induce ADD or reactivate it?

01:25:08.744 --> 01:25:10.470
- This is a great question.

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:12.530
I think about it a lot,

01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:16.610
and you mentioned this
tic-like behavior in yourself,

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:19.330
it's very common that people who have tics

01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:21.870
have this building up of something
that can only be relieved

01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:25.380
by executing the tic which
can be a motor movement

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:27.943
or a vocalization or even a thought.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.630
And people do, I think
these days, do have this.

01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:34.350
If they haven't checked
their phone in a while,

01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:36.190
they do have a buildup
and buildup and buildup

01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:38.918
until they can check it and relieve it.

01:25:38.918 --> 01:25:41.110
And there's some similarities,

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:44.833
there is a little reward
that comes with the checking.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.860
But the key question in all of psychiatry,

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:51.030
what we do is we don't diagnose something

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:55.020
unless it's disrupting what we call social

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.340
or occupational functioning.

01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.230
Like you could have
any number of symptoms,

01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:03.660
but literally every
psychiatric diagnosis requires

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.710
that it has to be
disrupting someone's social

01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:08.440
or occupational functioning.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:11.070
And these days, checking your
phone is pretty adaptive.

01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:12.890
That pretty much helps your social

01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.030
and occupational functioning.

01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:18.810
And so we can't make [chuckles]
it a psychiatric diagnosis.

01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:19.643
- Interesting.

01:26:19.643 --> 01:26:22.040
- At least in the world of today.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.440
- Yeah, opting out of communication now,

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.440
makes you in some ways less adaptive,

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.850
though I would point to you as an example

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:34.530
of somebody who is quite good
at managing his interactions,

01:26:34.530 --> 01:26:36.790
at least from the outsider perspective,

01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:39.560
I do want to ask you a
little bit about you.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:44.560
And first of all, and I realize
this is only a partial list,

01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:48.130
but you're a clinician, you see patients,

01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:49.260
you run a big laboratory,

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:51.500
how many people are in
your laboratory now?

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.870
That's a huge laboratory.

01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:56.833
From experience, I can say
that's an enormous laboratory.

01:26:58.849 --> 01:27:00.980
You have a family of five children,

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.840
and you're happily married to
a wonderful colleague of ours

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:06.403
as well, who does incredible work.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.980
How do you organize at a
kind of conceptual level,

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.733
the day and the week?

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.790
And I should say, what stress
mitigation practices if any,

01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:21.750
do you incorporate?

01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:24.580
I've received emails from
you at three in the morning.

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.240
I sometimes send emails
at three in the morning,

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.450
but that's when I wake
up, maybe I'm depressed,

01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:30.100
but I go back to sleep.

01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.340
So, maybe just describe
the arc of the blocks

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.990
of the day, not hour by hour,

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:38.270
necessarily the details of
what are in those blocks,

01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:41.160
but how do you conceptualize the day?

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.580
How do you conceptualize the week?

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:47.960
And how do you feel
about how that's lined up

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.430
with your larger goals

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:53.940
of making sure these five
young people flourish?

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.143
Which I hear they are,

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.713
but how do you go about
this, what for most people

01:27:58.713 --> 01:28:02.163
would just be an
overwhelming set of items?

01:28:04.866 --> 01:28:09.380
- Well, of course sometimes
it's just take it day by day,

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.870
and so I don't claim-

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:13.160
- So you bring the horizon
into the unit of the day?

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.280
- I do, I do.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.780
The unit is the day, that's right.

01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:21.780
And I try to have in each
day, as I mentioned earlier,

01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:26.083
at least an hour of
time where I can think,

01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:29.834
and it can be when kids are napping,

01:28:32.367 --> 01:28:35.180
actually, because while
driving I can do that too,

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.020
because I'm sitting still, [clears throat]

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.370
but that's the one
thing I try to preserve.

01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:45.040
When I was writing the
book, I adapted that time

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.123
to be my writing time,
but it wasn't enough,

01:28:50.547 --> 01:28:52.180
so I had to add in a new block of time

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.423
which was sort of midnight
to 2:00 AM, writing time.

01:28:57.622 --> 01:29:02.622
[chuckles] And carving out
these, even small protected times

01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:03.743
are very important.

01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:08.340
Of course, obligations will expand

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.490
to fill the time available and
you have to be disciplined.

01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:13.411
At least I found I had to be disciplined

01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:18.190
in truly protecting those
times where one can think.

01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:19.660
- So that means no phone?

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.083
- That means no phone,
no checking of the phone.

01:29:24.346 --> 01:29:25.746
When I was writing the book,

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.630
there's a focus mode on the MacBook

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:35.980
which kind of rules the border,

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:39.550
and you just have your
documents and it's very pure,

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:43.790
and you don't have the
temptation of distraction.

01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:47.720
- I'm a big believer in because
the vision and the eyes play

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.760
such a prominent role in
directing our cognition,

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.320
something you talk about in the book,

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.020
really beautifully, and with
a lot of depth and rigor,

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.740
using visual tools

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:01.860
to harness one's complete
mental attention.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.510
When you do this practice of
sitting and just thinking,

01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:07.683
sitting still and thinking,
you said your eyes are open.

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:11.730
Are you hearing your own verbal voice,

01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:13.120
although in your head?
- Yes.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.400
- So you're actually in
conversation with yourself?

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.233
- Yes.

01:30:16.233 --> 01:30:18.310
And hearing literally, I
mean, not quite literally,

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:21.633
I don't actually hear information,
but I'm hearing words,

01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.580
and so I discovered this about myself.

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:29.640
Other people, I think
may operate differently,

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.350
but I'm extremely verbal in how I think.

01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:33.900
That's how all my reasoning is done.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.530
It's with sentences and
[chuckles] construction

01:30:39.219 --> 01:30:41.160
of almost equations with words.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.320
- Complete sentences?

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.980
- Complete sentences
or complete-ish anyway,

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.780
mostly complete, and
when writing the book,

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:49.613
everything about the writing,

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:54.200
every sentence was always
played out in my mind,

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.900
listening for rhythm and timing,

01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:01.300
and I would obsess over
exact placement of words

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.910
to get the right rhythm of the
spoken sentence in my mind.

01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:06.400
- I don't mean to interrupt your flow,

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.010
but when you do that, and
having experienced this process

01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:12.350
a bit, although differently,

01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:15.230
do you experience any kind
of welling up of anxiety

01:31:15.230 --> 01:31:18.340
when you're hitting the friction points?

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:21.590
And if so, do you have tools or ways

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:24.100
that you quell that anxiety in real time?

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.010
'Cause what we're really
talking about here is your mind.

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:29.140
But what we're really
talking about is this process

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:32.940
of converting the activity of neurons,

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.290
into something physically
concrete in the world.

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:39.540
And these intermediate steps
are so mysterious to everybody.

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.077
We hear, "Just write the book",

01:31:41.077 --> 01:31:43.220
"Just do it", whatever that means.

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:44.520
In fact, statements like that to me

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.220
are kind of empty and meaningless,

01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:49.440
but when you hear your voice

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.640
and you're trying to find the correct word

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.720
and you keep hitting, it
doesn't sound quite right,

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.210
what is the experience in your body?

01:31:58.210 --> 01:32:03.120
- Yeah, when it's not right,
it's definitely evasive,

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.023
it doesn't feel good,

01:32:07.587 --> 01:32:10.487
but there's also a hope because
I know I can solve it too,

01:32:14.541 --> 01:32:16.640
and it's almost like you're almost there.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.260
There's a path that you know is there,

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:22.550
you don't quite see it, but it's there.

01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:24.323
And I keep that in mind,

01:32:26.985 --> 01:32:29.640
and so there's this
propulsive force forward

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.740
because I know that the solution is there.

01:32:32.764 --> 01:32:36.670
And that said, there were single words

01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:39.640
that I would spend days on,

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.420
because I was just not
happy until I got it right.

01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:45.420
And there were some things
that I never quite got perfect,

01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:47.130
and so I left out of the book entirely

01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:50.460
because it was so close,
but not quite there.

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.680
And I was like, no, I can't put that in.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.480
- Everything you just said
is entirely consistent

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.144
with my experience of you,

01:32:57.144 --> 01:32:58.280
[both laughing]

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.950
and the way you go about everything.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:03.010
I have to ask, are your kids writers?

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.280
Do they like books and words and poetry?

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.200
I know one of your children is going on

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.290
to a career in medicine and science.

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:10.123
- Yeah.

01:33:10.123 --> 01:33:11.730
They're each different which is amazing,

01:33:11.730 --> 01:33:14.450
yet they all, I think do
have some appreciation

01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:17.170
or a lot of appreciation for reading,

01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:19.050
but some are very musical.

01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:21.500
Two of the five are extremely musical,

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:25.193
very, very talented with
guitar and singing and vocal,

01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:28.930
impressions, it's just astonishing.

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:32.950
And some of them are great
with drawing and artistry

01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:35.700
and some are very physical and vigorous

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:39.380
and are never happy
except when leaping about.

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.460
And so, it's just amazing how
different they are, honestly.

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:46.090
But I think there is a shared
appreciation for language.

01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:49.950
- Do you think that one
can train their mind

01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:52.053
in using these practices?

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.233
I really like your description

01:33:54.233 --> 01:33:57.100
of the staying physically still

01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:00.660
and learning to grapple
with those challenges.

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:03.180
It's something that, especially
in laboratory science,

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.550
we aren't really trained to do.

01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:07.440
Like many professions
we're taught to come in

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.740
and just get into motion, and
I found that very relaxing

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:13.133
as someone who probably
has an underlying tic

01:34:13.133 --> 01:34:14.040
[Karl chuckles]
or something like that,

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.380
it felt great to be in motion.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.213
One of the hardest things

01:34:16.213 --> 01:34:18.930
about becoming a university
professor and running a lab,

01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:21.710
was that I no longer
working with my hands.

01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:26.670
And it felt like some big
important part of my life

01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:28.180
had been amputated.

01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.140
But what sorts of practices
do you incorporate there?

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:35.540
And do you think people can
learn to get better at focusing

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:39.727
through a dedicated practice
of the sort that you described?

01:34:42.835 --> 01:34:46.180
- I remember the rhythms of physical work

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.613
in the laboratory very well.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:54.250
My work these days as
the laboratory leader,

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:57.070
my job has returned mostly
to words now, again.

01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:59.453
And so it's kind of coming full circle.

01:35:03.313 --> 01:35:04.410
So it's a different mode.

01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:07.580
I think you just have to
embrace the different stages

01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.260
of life, come with the different modes,

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:11.860
but you can definitely train
yourself for each mode.

01:35:14.586 --> 01:35:15.723
I loved, as I mentioned,
the rhythm of sewing

01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:22.513
and suturing and surgery,

01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:28.020
and I worked really hard on
that and became good at it.

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:31.710
And now, I never do it, but
it's what's the next challenge.

01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:33.750
There's all the various
experimental techniques

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:35.223
the dissections of the brain,

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.240
I can't tell you how many
thousands of brain dissections

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.227
I've done in my life, and
now I don't do them at all.

01:35:41.227 --> 01:35:42.060
[Karl laughs]

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:42.893
- And then you developed a method

01:35:42.893 --> 01:35:44.141
so that we don't have to dissect brains.

01:35:44.141 --> 01:35:44.974
- That's right. [chuckles]
- As you mentioned there,

01:35:44.974 --> 01:35:46.840
maybe tell us for a moment about clarity,

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.650
and for people who will
probably never set foot

01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:53.870
into a laboratory, what an incredible,

01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:58.870
yet another incredible discovery
and development clarity is,

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:02.410
and why it helps us understand
how the brain is structured.

01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:03.243
- Yeah.

01:36:03.243 --> 01:36:06.460
So this is a different technology
also developed in my lab

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:10.040
here, and it's part of a broader approach

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.280
that we call hydrogel-tissue chemistry.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.320
And what this is, is it's building a gel,

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:20.270
like a clear jello-like substance
from within all the cells

01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:24.083
of a tissue or even an
animal, all at once.

01:36:25.192 --> 01:36:26.470
So you're effectively building a gel

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:28.870
inside all the cells at once.

01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:30.970
Now, that's an odd thing to do.

01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:31.803
Why do we do it?

01:36:31.803 --> 01:36:36.340
Well, we do it to transform the tissue

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.890
into a more tractable accessible object.

01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:43.210
And the reason that works
is having built this gel,

01:36:43.210 --> 01:36:47.170
this new infrastructure inside the tissue,

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:48.760
we can then use chemical tricks,

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.460
and we can link the
molecules we care about,

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:55.530
like proteins or RNAs
which are the things,

01:36:55.530 --> 01:36:58.000
as you know, right before
they become proteins,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000
we can link them, physically
anchor them to this gel,

01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:04.510
which is a scaffold basically,

01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:08.000
it's an interlocking network of polymers.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.680
We can link all these
interesting molecules in place,

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:13.940
lock them in where they were
initially in the tissue,

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:16.430
in the cell, in all the cells.

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.550
And then we can remove very vigorously,

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:21.880
everything we don't care about
that's blocking our light,

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.480
that's blocking our molecules,

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.570
coming in to exchange
information with the tissue.

01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:28.980
We can get rid of everything
else, like the lipids,

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.600
the fats, we can
effectively use detergents

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.710
to get them all out,
and then we can see in

01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:37.210
all the things that were
absorbing or scattering light

01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:38.850
are gone, you can have a brain

01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:40.810
that's completely transparent,

01:37:40.810 --> 01:37:42.970
and yet, all the interesting
molecules are still locked

01:37:42.970 --> 01:37:45.910
into place there, at the
cellular and sub cellular level.

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:47.650
And so this is hydrogel-tissue chemistry.

01:37:47.650 --> 01:37:50.760
The first form we described
was called clarity.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.480
We use that quite a bit still,

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.280
but there are many variants now,

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.950
that we and others have
developed on this basic concept

01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:59.040
of building this gel within the tissue

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.590
and anchoring molecules into place.

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:02.170
- Literally glass-clear brains.

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:05.360
I've done this, I've taken a
brain cleared with this method,

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.695
and looked at somebody through it,

01:38:06.695 --> 01:38:07.528
[Karl laughing]

01:38:07.528 --> 01:38:08.830
and although you don't want to
get it too close to your eye,

01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:11.020
you don't want to touch
it to your own eye,

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.470
and you can see direct
all the way through it.

01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:14.303
- [Karl] Yeah.

01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:19.750
- That's incredible for it
raises an important question,

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:21.570
which is again, about the human brain,

01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:24.850
and as somebody who essentially
started out in neuroanatomy

01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:26.400
and then got into other things,

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:32.290
I always am bothered by the
fact that we actually know

01:38:32.290 --> 01:38:35.800
very little about the
microstructure of the human brain,

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.177
compared to the brains of other organisms.

01:38:38.177 --> 01:38:39.010
- Yeah.

01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:41.430
- And in thinking about
understanding the circuitry

01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:44.900
and the piano, so to speak
and how to manipulate it

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.683
in order to relieve suffering,

01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:53.500
one wonders, are the structures
in these animal brains

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.687
and how they behave, and
active coping, passive coping,

01:38:57.687 --> 01:39:02.120
ADD, et cetera, those models,
how well they translate

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.950
to the human condition.

01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:06.630
Do you think it's fair to say
that there are entire regions

01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:09.480
of the human brain that
aren't just bigger,

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.550
but that exist only in
the brains of humans?

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:14.900
Especially given that we have this speech,

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:16.300
although I do wonder sometimes

01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.980
if animals report in to each other there.

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.820
Maybe they have little
psychiatric sessions

01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.340
with one another.

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:25.650
- You know, I'm always
careful to not assume

01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:27.030
we do things better.

01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:29.270
We certainly understand what we're doing

01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:31.030
better than we understand
what animals are doing,

01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:34.010
and they certainly do
things better than we do.

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.850
That said, we do have
amazing, wonderful brains

01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:39.470
and many structures that
are very highly developed

01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:42.350
in our brains that are
not nearly so developed

01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:45.490
in mice and fish for example.

01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:50.029
Now, that said, when I
look at the big picture,

01:39:50.029 --> 01:39:52.913
what is the mammalian brain really doing?

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.070
There are things that you
would never have thought

01:39:57.070 --> 01:40:01.933
we could study in animals and
laboratory mammals like mice,

01:40:03.958 --> 01:40:05.790
that it turns out you can, actually,

01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:07.600
and so I would never draw the line

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.130
and say, here's something
you can't study in mice,

01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:12.770
or here's something that
has no parallel in mice.

01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:13.910
I would be very careful

01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:16.877
before making any statement like that.

01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:19.090
And a good example of that
is we've been able to study

01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:20.940
just in the past year,
come to an understanding

01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:24.560
of dissociation, and we had a paper

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.690
that came out in late 2020,
both mouse and human work,

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:32.440
in which we got to the
sort of the circuit basis

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.140
for dissociation.

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:35.590
Now, what is dissociation?

01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:38.810
A lot of people might
not have experienced it,

01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:40.510
but it's actually very common.

01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:44.290
More than 70% of people
who've been through trauma

01:40:44.290 --> 01:40:45.850
experience dissociation,

01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:49.730
it shows up in borderline
personality, it shows up in PTSD.

01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:53.600
What it is, is a separation
of the sense of self,

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.110
from the body.

01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:57.370
So you can have someone who,
it's not as if you're numb,

01:40:57.370 --> 01:40:58.540
you're not anesthetized.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:02.020
You can still know that
something's happening to the body,

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:03.300
but you just don't care,

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.020
because you don't ascribe it to yourself,

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:08.140
which is very interesting, right?

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.110
How interesting is that?

01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:10.470
- The cells report narrative.

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:11.710
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:13.610
- In your book, you touch on this.

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:17.110
And I will say is the most precise,

01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:19.890
and meaningful and eloquent description

01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:21.780
of what might be consciousness,

01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:25.330
this narrative toward
the self or of the self,

01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:26.430
and where it might reside.

01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:28.683
So in dissociative conditions,

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.800
people are feeling as kind
of an absence of a merge

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.230
between mind and body.
- Right.

01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:35.063
- Is that one way to describe it?

01:41:35.063 --> 01:41:36.050
- That's right.
- And as I recall,

01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:39.350
this paper involved an
exploration of ketamine.

01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:40.400
- Ketamine was a big part of it.

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:41.233
Yeah, that's right.

01:41:41.233 --> 01:41:43.050
And so ketamine is
another one of those cases

01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:45.700
where people can experience dissociation.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:48.920
Ketamine or PCP, we call
these the dissociative drugs.

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.880
They cause it just like these
other psychiatric conditions

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.713
can cause it.

01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:59.370
But we were able to manifest this in mice,

01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:02.130
administering these
dissociative agents in mice.

01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:04.620
We could make them still
able to detect stimulus,

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.180
but not care that it was happening.

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.540
All the while we were recording

01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:12.780
the activity of individual
cells in the brain

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:14.716
to see what was going on,

01:42:14.716 --> 01:42:18.120
what was happening along
with this dissociation,

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.570
and then use optogenetics
to see that it mattered

01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:23.410
to actually provide
that pattern of activity

01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:26.620
and see, oh, that actually
causes the dissociation.

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.930
So we could do all that in mice,

01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:33.840
which who would've thought
that you could study something

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:34.700
like this in mice?

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:38.380
And we were able to go back
and forth with human work

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:41.970
because here in our Stanford
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center,

01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:45.330
there's a lot of what we
call Stereo EEG Recording.

01:42:45.330 --> 01:42:46.210
Patients who come in

01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:48.630
and in the course of normal clinical care,

01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:51.570
they have electrodes
recording in their brain

01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:53.440
to identify where the seizure is,

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.350
so they can be candidates
for removing a little patch

01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:58.730
of the brain that's causing the seizure.

01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:01.530
This has done for patients who
medications are not helping

01:43:01.530 --> 01:43:03.600
their seizure disorder.

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:08.200
And there was a patient who
had a dissociative state

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.107
before every seizure, so
this was a human being

01:43:10.107 --> 01:43:11.540
who was really dissociating,

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.670
who could tell us literally
as it was happening.

01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:17.000
And we could see this
pattern, the same pattern

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.430
that was happening in the
mice, in the same patch

01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:22.010
of the brain, we could see that happening

01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:23.960
in the human being at
exactly the right time,

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.350
in the same patch of the
brain that's homologous

01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:29.630
across these immense
evolutionary distances.

01:43:29.630 --> 01:43:32.010
And we knew that it mattered
to both the mouse and human

01:43:32.010 --> 01:43:34.796
because in the human we
could cause it to happen.

01:43:34.796 --> 01:43:36.546
- I just want to underscore the power

01:43:39.554 --> 01:43:42.000
of optogenetics and the ability

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.010
to not just remove a particular
experience or behavior

01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:48.950
by lesioning or destroying,
but then to go back

01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:52.750
and actually activate same
structure or group of structures

01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:54.140
and see the emergences.

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.650
So essentially, these days you hear a lot

01:43:56.650 --> 01:43:57.960
about gain of function research

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.590
in the context of viral manipulation,

01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:00.473
but gain of function is something

01:44:00.473 --> 01:44:01.990
that we do in the laboratory

01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:06.230
and you do in patients, to
both take away something

01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:09.160
and put it back, which
gives you causality.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:09.993
- That's right.

01:44:09.993 --> 01:44:11.132
Yeah, and exactly.

01:44:11.132 --> 01:44:14.210
And so with optogenetics,
we were able to provide

01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:18.150
in animals without being
on any ketamine or any drug

01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:19.660
and we could cause the dissociative state

01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:21.900
by playing in a precise
pattern of activity.

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.710
And who would have
thought you could do that?

01:44:23.710 --> 01:44:26.920
But that was a combined
mouse and human paper.

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.920
Likewise, we've been able
to play in visual sensations

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:37.200
into the brains of mice,
and by observing which cells

01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:40.700
in the visual part of
the brain, visual cortex,

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:44.610
are naturally responsive to
for example, vertical bars,

01:44:44.610 --> 01:44:47.710
instead of horizontal
bars in the visual world,

01:44:47.710 --> 01:44:50.030
we could see which cells
were normally reporting

01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:52.630
on vertical bars, and then
we could use optogenetics

01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:56.340
to come and play in activity
just to those cells.

01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.190
- So these animals are
not viewing anything?

01:44:58.190 --> 01:44:59.380
- Not viewing anything at all.

01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:02.530
And we could activate just
the vertical bar cells,

01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:04.160
and not only did the animal act

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.840
as if it was seeing a vertical bar,

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.810
behaviorally, it was trained
to do a particular thing

01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:09.730
if it saw a vertical bar, and it did that,

01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:12.690
just as if it was seeing
something visually.

01:45:12.690 --> 01:45:14.420
But everything in the brain
that we were recording

01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:18.610
to the internal representation
of this external world

01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:19.880
was naturalistic too.

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:23.160
It looked like the brain
was seeing something visual.

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.240
So that's gain of function too, you know,

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.200
playing in, providing a
complex sensation or percept

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.510
that wasn't there before.

01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:34.510
And we can do that across species.

01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:38.170
So, and of course mice are social,

01:45:38.170 --> 01:45:41.900
and they do amazing acts
of information processing

01:45:44.101 --> 01:45:46.800
and I try not to disparage
our cousins too much.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.640
- They certainly have helped
the field of neuroscience

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.080
and medicine I should mention,

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:51.890
and I know that people
have various sensitivities

01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:55.210
about animal research, but the
work that's been carried out

01:45:55.210 --> 01:45:59.897
in mice has been absolutely
vital and instructional

01:45:59.897 --> 01:46:02.802
for treatment of human disease.

01:46:02.802 --> 01:46:04.040
- That's right.

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:09.020
- Since we talked about
dissociation and dissociative states

01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:11.570
rather and ketamine,
I'd love your thoughts

01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:14.950
on psychedelic medicine.

01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:19.030
You know, I sort of half joke
having grown up in this area

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:21.250
in Northern California when it
was much more counter-culture

01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:24.620
than it is now, that many of the things

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.123
that we're hearing about now,

01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:30.550
at least from my read
of the history books,

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:31.710
happened before.

01:46:31.710 --> 01:46:33.610
There was a movement

01:46:33.610 --> 01:46:36.820
aimed at taking the very
same compounds essentially,

01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:37.910
putting them into patients

01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:41.130
or people who were obviously
using them recreationally,

01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:42.750
but putting them into patients,

01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:44.940
and seeing tremendous positive effects,

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:49.940
but also tremendous examples
of induced psychiatric illness.

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.470
In other words, many
people lost their minds

01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:54.770
as a consequence of
overuse of psychedelics.

01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:57.773
I'll probably lose a few people out there,

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.180
but I do want to talk
about, what is the state

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:04.340
of these compounds?

01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:06.450
And I realize it's a huge
category of compounds,

01:47:06.450 --> 01:47:09.840
but LSD and psilocybin, as I
understand trigger activation

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.410
of particular serotonin
receptor mechanisms,

01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:15.300
may or may not lead to
more widespread activation

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.350
of the brain that one
wouldn't see otherwise.

01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:19.670
But when you look at the clinical

01:47:19.670 --> 01:47:21.560
and experimental literature,

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.910
what is your sort of top contour sense

01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:26.170
of how effective these
tools are going to be

01:47:26.170 --> 01:47:27.720
for treating depression?

01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.370
And then if we have the time,
we could talk about trauma

01:47:30.370 --> 01:47:32.670
and MDMA and some of that work.

01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:36.280
- Well, you're right to
highlight both the opportunity

01:47:37.601 --> 01:47:39.840
and the parallel that is there.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.810
And of course we want to help patients

01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:45.310
and of course we want to explore anything

01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:47.390
that might be helpful,

01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:50.470
but we want to do it in
a safe and rigorous way.

01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:53.590
But I do think we should
explore these avenues.

01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:57.170
These are agents that alter reality

01:47:57.170 --> 01:48:00.436
and alter the experience
of reality I should say,

01:48:00.436 --> 01:48:02.523
in relatively precise ways.

01:48:02.523 --> 01:48:05.210
They do have problems,
they can be addictive,

01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:08.603
they can cause lasting
change that is not desirable,

01:48:09.948 --> 01:48:12.380
but we have to see these as opportunities.

01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:15.550
We have to first of all,
study in the laboratory,

01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:17.520
and I'm doing this here.

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.320
You know we have [chuckles] big...

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:23.050
We have safes with many
interesting psychedelics

01:48:23.050 --> 01:48:24.830
that are all very carefully regulated.

01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:27.290
We get inspections from the DEA and so on.

01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:28.512
- If anyone's hoping to find these labs,

01:48:28.512 --> 01:48:29.810
[Karl laughing]
they exist in outer space,

01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:34.280
so you need to be on board
one of the SpaceX missions

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.113
in order to access them.

01:48:35.113 --> 01:48:36.170
So don't try and come find them.

01:48:36.170 --> 01:48:37.720
- No, that's exactly true. Yes.

01:48:40.438 --> 01:48:42.330
And we're doing exactly this.

01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:43.840
We're saying this is an
incredible opportunity.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.628
If we could understand how

01:48:46.628 --> 01:48:49.130
the perception of reality is altered,

01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:52.080
we could be creating new
kinds of intervention

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.670
that don't have the risks

01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:59.670
and the problems of causing
lasting change or addiction.

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:05.250
Now, that said, even as
these medications exist now,

01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.260
as you know, there's
an impulse to use them

01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:12.760
in very small doses and to use
them as adjunctive treatments

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:15.160
for the therapy of various kinds.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.410
And I'm also supportive
of that if done carefully

01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:20.870
and rigorously, of course there's risk,

01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:23.930
but there's risk with many
other kinds of treatments.

01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:28.930
And I'm not sure that the
risks for these medications

01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:31.420
vastly outweigh the risks
that we normally tolerate

01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:32.860
in other branches of medicine.

01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:34.410
- Why would they work?

01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:39.410
I mean, let's say that
indeed their main effect

01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:44.760
is to create more connectivity,

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:48.270
at least in the moment
between brain areas.

01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:52.216
So the way I think about the two extremes

01:49:52.216 --> 01:49:53.870
of my experience anyways,

01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:57.360
a high degree of stress and
focus for whatever reason,

01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:59.820
is going to create
changes in my visual field

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:02.240
and changes in the way
that I perceive times,

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.940
so that I'm on a micro-sliced time,

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.770
I might be in a very contracted view

01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:07.350
of whatever my experience is,

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:11.620
whereas on the opposite
extreme in a dream or in sleep,

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.470
space and time are very fluid,

01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:15.210
and I'm essentially relaxed,

01:50:15.210 --> 01:50:17.020
although it might be a
very interesting dream,

01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:18.630
or it might not be.

01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:21.690
Psychedelics seemed to be a trajectory.

01:50:21.690 --> 01:50:25.390
I'm not too far off from the dream state

01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:29.920
where space and time are
essentially not as rigid.

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.270
And there is this element of synesthesia,

01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:34.660
blending of the senses, you know,

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:39.660
feeling colors and hearing
light and things of that sort.

01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.423
You hear these reports, anyway.

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.570
Why would having that
dream-like experience

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.620
somehow relieve depression, long-term?

01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:54.170
Do we have any idea why that might be?

01:50:54.170 --> 01:50:55.003
- Yeah.

01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:59.520
We have some ideas, and
no deep understanding.

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.130
One way I think about the psychedelics

01:51:02.130 --> 01:51:07.130
is they increase our willingness to...

01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:08.890
They increase the willingness of our brain

01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:13.380
to accept unlikely ways
of constructing the world,

01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:16.450
unlikely hypothesis, as it
were, as to what's going on.

01:51:16.450 --> 01:51:18.670
The brain, in particular
our cortex, I think,

01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:21.860
is a hypothesis generation
and testing machine.

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.870
It's coming up with
models about everything.

01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:26.920
It's got a lot of bits of data coming in,

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.450
and it's making models
and updating the models

01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:32.653
and changing them, theories,
hypothesis for what's going on.

01:51:33.570 --> 01:51:36.050
And some of those never
reach our conscious mind.

01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:38.370
And this is something I
talk about in "Projections"

01:51:38.370 --> 01:51:42.340
in the book quite a bit, is
many of these are filtered out

01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:45.323
before they get to our
conscious mind, and that's good.

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.460
Think how distracted we'd be

01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:50.190
if we were constantly
having to evaluate all these

01:51:50.190 --> 01:51:52.980
hypotheses about what
kinds of shapes or objects

01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:54.860
or processes were out there.

01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:56.480
And so a lot of this is handled

01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:59.070
before it gets to consciousness.

01:51:59.070 --> 01:52:00.800
What the psychedelics seem to do,

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.800
is they change the threshold
for us to become aware

01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:09.560
of these incomplete hypotheses
or wrong hypotheses,

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:14.180
or concepts that might be
noise but are just wrong,

01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:17.093
and so are never allowed to
get into our conscious mind.

01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:20.960
Now, that's pretty interesting,

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:23.300
and it goes wrong in
psychiatric disorders.

01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:26.430
I think in schizophrenia
there's some of the times

01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:29.430
the paranoid delusions that people have

01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:33.310
are examples of these poor models

01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:35.150
that escape into the conscious mind

01:52:35.150 --> 01:52:37.440
and become accepted as reality

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.540
and they never should've gotten out there.

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:43.210
Now, how could something
like this in the right way,

01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:45.410
help with something like depression?

01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:50.000
Patients with depression often are stuck.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
They can't look into the
future world of possibilities

01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:59.780
as effectively.

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:03.650
Everything seems hopeless.

01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:05.313
And what does that really mean?

01:53:05.313 --> 01:53:08.350
They discount the value
of their own action,

01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:10.810
they discount the value of the world

01:53:10.810 --> 01:53:13.350
at giving rise to a future that matters.

01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:15.510
Everything seems to run out like a river

01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:17.760
just running out into
a desert and drying up,

01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:22.440
and what these agents may do

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:25.510
that increase the flow through
circuitry, if you will,

01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:27.480
the percolation of
activity through circuitry

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.340
may end up doing for depression

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:32.906
is increasing the escape of some tendrils

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:37.906
of process of forward
progression through the world.

01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:41.690
That's a concept, that's
how I think about it.

01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.482
There are ways we can make that rigorous.

01:53:43.482 --> 01:53:47.120
We can indeed identify in
the brain by recording,

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.800
we can see cells that
represent steps along a path

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:54.200
and look into the future,

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.560
and we can rigorously define these cells

01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:59.310
and we can see if these are
altered on psychedelics.

01:53:59.310 --> 01:54:00.540
And so that's one of the reasons

01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:04.080
that we're working with these
agents in the laboratory

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.920
to say, all right, is
this really the case?

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:08.419
Are these opening up new paths

01:54:08.419 --> 01:54:11.963
or representations of
paths into the future?

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:17.460
- MDMA, ecstasy is a unique compound

01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:19.920
in that it leads to big increases

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:24.720
in brain levels of dopamine
and serotonin simultaneously.

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:26.770
And I realized that the neuromodulators

01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:29.380
like dopamine and serotonin
often work in concert,

01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.630
not alone, the way
they're commonly described

01:54:31.630 --> 01:54:35.490
in the more general popular discussions.

01:54:35.490 --> 01:54:38.920
However, it is a unique compound,

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.100
and it's different than
the serotonergic compounds,

01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:43.470
like LSD and psilocybin.

01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:47.350
And there are now data,

01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:49.780
still emerging that it might be,

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:54.080
and in some cases can be useful
for the treatment of trauma,

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.963
PTSD and similar things.

01:54:57.896 --> 01:54:59.202
Why would that work?

01:54:59.202 --> 01:55:03.330
And a larger question, perhaps
the more important question

01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:07.823
is, psychedelics, MDMA,
LSD, all those compounds,

01:55:07.823 --> 01:55:10.140
in my mind there are two components.

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:12.820
There's the experience you
have while you're on them,

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:15.253
and then there's the
effect they have after.

01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:18.920
People are generating
variations of these compounds

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.020
that are non-hallucinatory variations.

01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.700
But, how crucial do you think it is

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.990
to have, let's stay with MDMA,

01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:31.530
the experience of huge levels of dopamine,

01:55:31.530 --> 01:55:33.500
huge levels of serotonin,

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.810
atypical levels of dopamine
and serotonin released,

01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:38.030
having this highly abnormal experience

01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:39.670
in order to be normal again?

01:55:39.670 --> 01:55:40.890
- Yeah.

01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:43.102
I think the brain learns
from those experiences.

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:46.040
That's the way I see
it, and so for example,

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.013
people who have taken MDMA,

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:51.720
as you say, there will be the acute phase

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:54.320
of being on the drug

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.740
and experiencing this
extreme connectedness

01:55:57.740 --> 01:55:59.450
with other people for example,

01:55:59.450 --> 01:56:02.973
and then the drug wears off,

01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:06.160
but the brain learned
from that experience.

01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:09.250
And so what people will report is,

01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:12.680
yeah, I'm not in that state,
but I saw what was possible.

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:13.593
I saw it. Yeah.

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:17.520
There don't need to be barriers,

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.810
or at least not as many
barriers as I thought.

01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:21.500
I can connect with more people

01:56:22.929 --> 01:56:24.010
in a way that that is helpful.

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:27.860
And so I think it's the learning
that happens in that state,

01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:29.550
that actually matters.

01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:30.870
- And as you described that,

01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:32.550
that sounds a lot like what I understand

01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:35.310
to be the hallmark feature of
really good psychoanalysis,

01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:38.650
that the relationship between
patient and therapist,

01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:40.210
hopefully evolves to the point

01:56:40.210 --> 01:56:43.860
where these kinds of tests can be run

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:45.860
within the context of that relationship,

01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:48.210
and then exported to other relations.

01:56:48.210 --> 01:56:49.250
- Exactly right. Yeah.

01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:51.330
- And that probably, I'm assuming

01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:53.880
is still the goal of really
good psychiatry also.

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.190
- As a part of-

01:56:55.190 --> 01:56:56.730
- Intimacy, really.

01:56:56.730 --> 01:56:58.260
- It should be.

01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:01.700
When we have time, I think
all good psychiatrists

01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:05.650
try to achieve that level
of connection and learning,

01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:10.650
try to help patients create
a new model that is stable,

01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:16.190
that is learned, and that can
help instruct future behavior.

01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:19.640
- One of the things that I
took from reading your book,

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.170
in addition to learning so much science

01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:25.103
and the future of psychiatry
and brain science was,

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.560
amidst this very tragic cases and sadness,

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.240
and a lot of the weight that
that puts on the clinician,

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.240
on you also, that there's
a central cord of optimism,

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:45.890
that where we're headed
is not just possible

01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:48.400
but very likely, and better.

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.233
- Yeah.

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:52.840
- And, are you an optimist?

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.820
- [chuckles] I am.

01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:56.610
And by the way, this was a
really interesting experience

01:57:56.610 --> 01:58:00.870
in writing "Projections",
because I had a dual goal.

01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:02.770
I wanted it to be for everybody,

01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:07.770
literally everybody in the
world who wants to read it.

01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:09.930
And yet at the same time,

01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:14.930
I wanted to stay absolutely
rigorously close to the science,

01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:20.750
what was actually known, when
I was speaking about science.

01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:24.290
When I was speaking about
the neurobiology of the brain

01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:28.230
or psychiatry, I wanted to not have

01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:30.130
any of my scientific colleagues

01:58:30.130 --> 01:58:32.787
think, oh, he's going too
far, he's saying too much.

01:58:32.787 --> 01:58:34.960
And so I had these two goals

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:37.110
which I kept on my mind the entire time.

01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:39.720
And a lot of this trying to
find exactly the right word

01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.080
we talked about was, on this path

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:45.220
of staying excruciatingly
rigorous in the science

01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:48.510
and yet, letting people see the hope,

01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:50.773
where things were, have everybody see

01:58:50.773 --> 01:58:54.220
that we've come a long way,
we have a long way to go,

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:58.410
but the trajectory and
the path is beautiful.

01:58:58.410 --> 01:59:02.403
And so that was the goal, I think.

01:59:04.383 --> 01:59:07.103
Of course that sounds almost impossible

01:59:07.103 --> 01:59:10.650
[chuckles] to jointly
satisfy those two goals,

01:59:10.650 --> 01:59:12.950
but I kept that in my mind
the whole way through.

01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:14.550
And yes, I am optimistic

01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:16.560
and I hope that it came
through in the book

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.210
- It certainly did, and at
least from this colleague,

01:59:20.474 --> 01:59:22.720
you did achieve both.

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.510
And it's a wonderful, it's
a masterful book, really,

01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:28.380
and one that as a scientist

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.610
and somebody who is a
fellow brain explorer,

01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:36.500
hits all the marks of rigor
and is incredibly interesting

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.870
and there's a ton of storytelling.

01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:39.310
I don't want to give
away too much about it,

01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:41.710
but people should definitely
check out the book.

01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:44.240
Are you active on social media?

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.840
If people want to follow you

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.690
and connect with what you're
doing now and going forward?

01:59:48.690 --> 01:59:50.080
- Yeah. I have Twitter.

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:54.230
That's where I mainly do exchange,

01:59:54.230 --> 01:59:56.350
tell people about things
that are happening.

01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:58.260
- We'll provide a link to it,
but that's Karl Deisseroth,

01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.310
as I recall, with a K?

01:59:59.310 --> 02:00:00.143
- That's right.

02:00:00.143 --> 02:00:00.976
- Yeah.
- That's right.

02:00:00.976 --> 02:00:02.390
- And so you're on Twitter,

02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:06.623
and people will hear this,
definitely check out the book.

02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:09.100
There are other people in our community

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:13.240
that of course are going to be
reaching out on your behalf,

02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.920
but it's incredible that you juggle

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:17.833
this enormous number of things,

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:22.100
perhaps even more important however,

02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:24.850
is that it's all in service
to this larger thing

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:25.890
of relieving suffering.

02:00:25.890 --> 02:00:28.360
So thank you so much for your time today,

02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:30.090
for the book, and the
work that [chuckles] went

02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:31.744
into the book, I can't even imagine,

02:00:31.744 --> 02:00:32.577
[Karl laughs]
for the laboratory work

02:00:32.577 --> 02:00:34.500
and the development of
channelopsins, clarity,

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.770
and all the related technologies

02:00:35.770 --> 02:00:37.760
and for the clinical work you're doing

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:39.090
and for sharing with us.

02:00:39.090 --> 02:00:42.580
- Well, thank you for all
you're doing in reaching out.

02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:43.770
I'm very impressed by it.

02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:46.280
It's important and it's so valuable,

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:47.560
and thank you for taking the time

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:49.930
and for all your gracious
words about the book.

02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:51.400
Thank you.

02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:53.860
- I hope you enjoyed today's
discussion with Dr. Deisseroth

02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:55.100
as much as I did.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:56.437
