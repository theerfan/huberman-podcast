00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.290
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.307
for everyday life.

00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:09.190
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.350
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.000
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.940
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.280
Today's episode is about the biology,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.760
psychology and practices
of social bonding.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.740
From the day we are born
until the day we die,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.440
the quality of our social bonds

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.280
dictates much of our quality of life.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.490
It should therefore be no
surprise that our brain,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.170
and indeed much of our
entire nervous system

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.820
is wired for social bonds.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.400
Now social bonds occur
between infant and parent,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.558
there even particular wiring
diagrams within the brain

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:45.810
and spinal cord and body

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.666
that are oriented towards
the specific bonds

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.400
that occur between infant and mother,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.900
as well as infant and father.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.220
And we have specific brain
circuitries for friendship,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.830
specific brain circuitries
that are activated

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.610
in romantic relationships.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.285
And as it goes, specific brain circuitries

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:06.661
that are activated when we
break up with a romantic partner

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.430
or when they break up with us,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240
or when somebody passes away, moves away,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.580
or otherwise leaves our
lives in one form or another.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.770
Today, we are going to
talk about those brain

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.470
and nervous system circuitries,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.450
we're also going to talk
about the neurochemicals

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.300
and hormones that underlie their function.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.930
And we are going to touch
on a number of important

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.610
and actionable tools that you
can apply in everyday life.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.150
And because we are
headed into the holiday,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.880
the New Year and Christmas holiday,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.350
that you can deploy in
your various interactions

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.070
with family members and friends.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.070
And should you not be spending time

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.160
with family members and friends,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.940
today, we are also going to talk about

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.680
how to achieve social bonds

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.910
out of the context of family

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.340
and romantic partnership and friendship.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.150
So today's episode is going
to include a lot of science,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.850
a lot of actionable tools,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.790
and I'm confident that you will come away

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.140
from today's episode

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.640
with tremendous knowledge
about how you function.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.030
For instance, if you're an
introvert or an extrovert,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.863
why is that?

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:08.280
Turns out there may be a
neurochemical basis for that.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.360
Maybe you're somebody that
really enjoys social media,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.710
maybe you're somebody that doesn't.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.740
Today I'm going to talk about
a gene or a set of genes

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.132
that predicts whether or not
you will follow more people

00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:21.670
or seek out more online,
social interactions or fewer.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.760
Believe it or not, there's
biology around that now,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.770
and it's excellent peer reviewed work.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.000
We will also talk about
how bonds are broken,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.797
and why breakups can be so painful,

00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:32.540
not just romantic breakups,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.220
but breakups with
friendships and coworkers,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.100
and how to move through
those more seamlessly.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.660
So regardless of your age,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.870
and regardless of whether or not

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.530
you are in a romantic partnership

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.260
of one form or another, or not,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.330
I do believe this episode
will be useful to you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.420
as you explore the social bonds

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.860
that already exist in your life,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.190
and as you seek out new
and changing social bonds.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.760
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.180
that this podcast is separate

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.160
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.070
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.650
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.210
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.160
In keeping with that theme,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.710
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.430
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.390
Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.910
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.390
I've spent a lifetime
working on the biology

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.317
of the visual system,

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:21.700
and the visual system has
many important features

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.780
that allow us, for instance,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.620
to see things with crystal clarity,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.840
even if it's brightly lit or dimly lit,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.120
or there are changing
brightness in our environment.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.320
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.490
are designed with the biology
of the visual system in mind.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.530
So when you wear them,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.550
you don't have to take them
off and put them back on

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.610
like you would with other types

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.020
of sunglasses and eyeglasses,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.670
and you're always going to see
things with crystal clarity.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.330
In addition, they're very lightweight,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.720
so usually forget that
you're wearing them.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.130
I certainly forget when I'm wearing mine.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.960
I wear readers at night and when I drive,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.520
and I wear sunglasses
often throughout the day.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.500
The other thing that's really great

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.430
about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.090
is that you can wear them doing anything.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.680
You can wear them while
running, while cycling,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.120
if you get sweaty, they
won't fall off your face.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.700
But unlike a lot of other
performance eyeglasses out there,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.840
they have a terrific aesthetic

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.160
that you could also wear to
work, to school, out to dinner,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.630
they basically can be
worn anywhere, anytime.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.970
If you'd like to try Roka,
eyeglasses and sunglasses,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.650
you can go to Roka that's R-O-K-A.com

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.010
and enter the code Huberman

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.060
to save 20% off your first order.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.140
Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.610
and enter the code Huberman
at checkout to get 20% off.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.320
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.810
Athletic greens is an all-in-one

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.080
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.089
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012,

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:38.550
and I've taken it ever since.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.950
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.417
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.380
and the reason that I
still take Athletic Greens

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.610
once or twice a day,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.460
is because it covers all
of my vitamin mineral

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.710
probiotic foundational needs.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.030
There's now a wealth of
evidence pointing to the fact

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.800
that vitamins minerals and probiotics

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.930
support healthy gut microbiome,
healthy immune system,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.100
healthy nervous system,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.440
healthy endocrine system,
that's the hormone system.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.630
And with Athletic Greens,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.230
it really covers all those bases.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.630
In fact, when people ask me

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.400
what one supplement they should take,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.950
I recommend Athletic Greens.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.590
If you like to try Athletic Greens,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.190
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.880
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.570
They're giving five free travel packs,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.580
which make it very easy to
mix up the Athletic Greens

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.990
while on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.340
plus a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.260
There is now a lot of evidence

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.140
supporting that Vitamin D3

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.070
is great for our metabolism
endocrine system,

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.750
mood sleep, a huge number
of biological functions.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.100
And K2 has also been shown to be important

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.450
for cardiovascular health

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.260
and various aspects of blood lipids.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.960
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.350
you can claim a special offer,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.390
you'll get your Athletic Greens,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.320
five free travel packs of Athletic Greens,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.530
plus a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.220
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.580
Headspace is a meditation app

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.540
supported by 25 published studies

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.080
and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.080
I've been meditating for a very long time,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.800
more than three decades,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.620
but I confess I haven't
been a consistent meditator

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.950
until recently.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.900
I think many people will
have that experience,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.180
we've all heard about the terrific science

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.400
and benefits of a regular
meditation practice.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.050
Things like reduced
anxiety, improved sleep,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.280
sharper cognition, and focus.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.530
However, sticking to a meditation
practice can be tricky,

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.400
and many people start and then they stop.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.510
Or at least that's what happened to me

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.430
until a few years ago,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.190
when I started using the
Headspace app to do my meditation.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.050
Headspace has short meditations

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.030
of just a couple minutes long,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.700
longer meditations.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.329
Ideally for me, I like to
do a 20-minute meditation

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:38.900
at least three times a week,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.610
but sometimes because of my schedule

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.730
and other things going on,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.610
I only sneak in a five-minute meditation

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.350
once or twice a week.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.420
With Headspace, you have a huge number

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.360
of meditations to select from.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.700
So if you want to try Headspace,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.510
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.370
And if you do that,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.810
you'll get a completely
free one-month trial

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.020
with all of Headspace's meditation.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.660
That's the full library of meditations

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.880
that Headspace has to offer.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.609
That's the best deal offer
by Headspace right now.

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:05.133
So again, if you're interested,

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.560
go to headspace.com/special offer today.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.900
Let's talk about the
biology of social bonding.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.830
And I want to point out

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.880
that I used the word
bonding intentionally.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.270
It's a verb.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.652
And in biology, we want
to think about verbs

00:07:18.652 --> 00:07:22.320
because everything in
biology is a process,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.050
it's not an event.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.530
And when we think about things
in biology as a process,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.400
that means it's going
to have multiple steps.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.920
And today we are going
to explore the steps,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.430
start to finish of social bonding.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.740
Meaning how social bonds are established,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.020
how they are maintained,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.410
how they are broken and
how they are reestablished.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.900
Now an important feature
of biology generally,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.810
but in particular, as it
relates to social bonding,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.580
is that the neural circuits
meaning the brain areas

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.493
and neurons and the hormones,
things like oxytocin,

00:07:52.493 --> 00:07:54.390
which we'll talk about today,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.030
and the other chemicals
in the brain and body

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.280
that are responsible for the
process we call social bonding

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.070
are not unique to particular social bonds,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.410
they are generic.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.040
What I mean by that is that
the same brain circuits

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.301
that are responsible
for establishing a bond

00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:12.870
between parent and child

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.977
are actually repurposed
in romantic relationships.

00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:18.670
And this might not come as
a surprise to many of you,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.650
many of you are probably
familiar with this idea

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.920
of securely attached people
versus anxious attached people

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.690
versus avoidant attached people.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.440
We're going to touch on that a little bit,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.510
but all of that has roots
in whether or not children

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.150
and parents formed healthy social bonds,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.400
or whether or not they had
challenged social bonds.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.230
Now it's clear from the scientific

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.560
and psychological literature

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.870
that just because you might have had

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.140
a not so great or even terrible
social bond with a parent

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.280
or with some other caretaker
or loved one as a child,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.220
that doesn't fate you to have
poor social bonds as an adult,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.580
there's a lot of plasticity in the system,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.990
meaning it can change,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.520
it can rewire in response to experience.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.565
And as we will soon discover,

00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:05.317
there specific components

00:09:05.317 --> 00:09:08.330
within the neural circuits of your brain

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.360
that are responsible for social bonding

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.550
that allow you to place subjective labels

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.360
on why you are doing certain things

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.050
and to rewire the neural
circuits for social bonding.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.960
So we're going to touch
on all of that today.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.169
But the important feature
really to point out

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:24.768
is that we don't have
12 different circuits

00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:27.860
in the brain and body for
different types of social bonds,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.090
we have one,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.870
and there's some universal features

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.700
that underlie all forms of social bonds.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.320
So we're going to start by exploring

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.060
what those neural circuits are,

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.150
and then we're going to see how they plug

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.320
into different types of social bonds.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.670
And then we're going to explore

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.280
things like introversion, extroversion,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.590
where we're going to touch on a little bit

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.410
about things like trauma
bonds, healthy bonds,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.280
and various other aspects

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.630
of how humans can bond to one another.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.320
And as you'll soon discover,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.800
there is a unique chemical signature

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.250
of all bonding of all kinds.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.960
And you're going to learn how to modulate

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.490
that chemical signature.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.140
Before we talk about social bonding,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.220
I want to talk about it's mirror image,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.710
which is lack of social
bonding or social isolation.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.890
Now for better, for worse,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.700
there is a tremendous
literature on the biology

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.370
of social isolation,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.160
and all of the terrible things that happen

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.200
when animals or humans
are socially isolated

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.943
at particular phases of life.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.100
Now, for those of you that are introverts,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.120
you are not necessarily damaging yourself

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.120
by deciding to spend less
time with other people.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.230
Many people like time alone,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.120
I personally am an introvert,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.330
I get a thrill out of spending time

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.400
with one or two close friends,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.590
but I enjoy a lot of time by myself.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.640
I like to socialize,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.680
so I wouldn't call myself
an extreme introvert,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.910
but I know there's some
extreme introverts out there.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.730
But when we talk about social isolation,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.908
what we're referring to is when animals

00:10:52.908 --> 00:10:54.644
or humans are restricted

00:10:54.644 --> 00:10:57.010
from having the social contacts

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.210
that they would prefer to have.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.015
And to just briefly touch
on the major takeaways

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:03.234
from this literature,

00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:05.983
which spans back a hundred years or more,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.500
being socially isolated is stressful.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.510
And one of the hallmark
features of social isolation

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.100
is chronically elevated stress hormones,

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.080
like adrenaline also called epinephrin,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.710
like cortisol, a stress
hormone that at healthy levels

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.060
is good for combating inflammation,

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.010
helps us have energy early in the day,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.350
focused throughout the day.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.260
But if cortisol is elevated for too long,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.170
which is the consequence
of social isolation,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.900
the immune system suffers

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.040
and other chemicals start to be released

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.380
in the brain and body

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.810
that are designed to
motivate the organism,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.543
animal or human to seek out social bonds.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.600
An example of one such chemical

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.900
is a peptide called tachykinin.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.730
Tachykinin is present in
flies, in mice and in humans,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.500
and under conditions of social isolation,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.910
it's levels go up,

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.800
and because of the brain areas

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.440
that contain receptors for tachykinin,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.160
people start feeling very
aggressive and irritable

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.950
after social isolation.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.080
Now that should be a little
bit counterintuitive to you,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.850
you would think, oh,
you know, if you isolate

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.200
an animal or a human,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.860
and then you give them the opportunity

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.310
for social interaction, they
should behave very well,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.143
they should be thrilled,

00:12:18.143 --> 00:12:20.010
they're finally getting the nourishment,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.030
the social nourishment

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.830
that they've been lacking for so long.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.240
It turns out that's not the case.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.070
Chronic social isolation

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.670
changes the nature of the brain and body

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.790
such that it makes
social connection harder,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.030
and it makes the person who's
been isolated, irritable,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.600
even aggressive with other people.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.940
Now, I don't want to go too deeply

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.620
into the biology of social isolation,

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.970
because it doesn't actually
afford us that much insight

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.550
into what healthy social
bonding looks like.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.440
So today we're going to focus
more on the functional biology,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.270
a dual meaning of the word functional,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.960
as opposed to the pathology
of social isolation.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.100
However, I do want to point out

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.760
that social isolation
starts to deteriorate

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.460
certain aspects of brain
and body pretty quickly,

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.630
but how quickly depends again

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.010
on how introverted or
extroverted somebody is.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.040
So if you're somebody
who is socially isolated

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.873
for the holidays,

00:13:12.873 --> 00:13:14.830
or has been socially isolated
for a period of time,

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.156
and is craving social contact,
that is a healthy craving.

00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:20.390
And as we'll learn next,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.410
the healthy craving for social contact

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.160
has a very specific brain circuit,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
has a very specific
neurochemical signature

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.300
associated with it,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.790
and has some remarkable
features that you can leverage

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.000
in social contacts of all kinds.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.810
I think some of the more
important and exciting work

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.080
on social bonding comes from
the laboratory of Kay Tye.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.920
Kay is a professor at the Salk Institute

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.260
for Biological Studies,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.280
she's an investigator

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.270
with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.740
And in recent years,

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.860
I would say in about the
last five or six years,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.290
her laboratory has made
a fundamental discovery

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.750
as to why we seek out
and put so much effort

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.470
into social bonds.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.030
And the key discovery that she made

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.640
is that much like hunger,
much like temperature,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.010
much like thirst, we have brain circuits

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.910
that are devoted to what's
called a social homeostasis.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.360
Many of you have probably
heard about homeostasis before,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.971
homeostasis is the characteristic

00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:19.491
of various biological circuits

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:21.300
and even individual cells

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.510
to try and maintain a certain level.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.900
It's most easily thought of
in the context of hunger,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.850
if you don't eat for a while,

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.540
your drive to pursue
food and think about food

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.220
and make food and spend money on food,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.200
and indeed to enjoy food goes up.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.820
Whereas when you're well fed,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.770
you don't tend to seek out food

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.190
with as much vigor or as much intensity,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.930
you wouldn't invest as much
time, effort, money, et cetera.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.310
So homeostasis is the
aspect of cells, tissues,

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.020
and organisms to seek some sort of balance

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.280
to regulate themselves.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.300
In a crude way, you can
think about the thermostat

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.710
on your home as a homeostatic circuit.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.250
When the temperature goes up a little bit,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.690
it cools things down to
maintain a certain temperature.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.540
When the room gets cold,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.786
it hits a certain level
and a sensor detects that,

00:15:06.786 --> 00:15:08.870
it clicks on and then the heat goes on

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.920
to maintain a certain set temperature.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.930
So that's a simple way of
thinking about homeostasis.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.120
Every homeostatic circuit
has three components,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.280
or at least three,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.970
one is a detector, meaning the organism

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.390
or the thermostat on your wall

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.150
has to have some way of detecting

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.540
what's going on in the environment,

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.160
all right, in the context
of social bonding,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.837
whether or not you are
interacting with others

00:15:31.837 --> 00:15:33.900
and whether or not those
interactions are going well.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.230
So that has to be detected,
that's the first thing.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.770
Then there has to be a control center,

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.320
that's the second thing.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.960
And the control center is the
one that makes the adjustments

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.970
to, in the case of social bonding,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.370
to your behavior and to your psychology.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.240
So you'll soon learn that
there are ways in which

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.200
the more time that you spend alone,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.970
the more motivated you are to seek out

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:59.150
the pictures of faces, the
interactions with actual people,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.370
physical contact, and so forth.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.020
Now that might seem obvious to you,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.773
but thanks to the work
of Kay Tye and others,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.120
it's remarkable to learn

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.830
that there are specific brain centers

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.930
that are adjusting our
psychology and biology

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.600
so that we seek out
bonds more aggressively,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.340
or maybe we don't because
we are perfectly sated

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.043
or satiated with respect
to how much contact

00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:22.593
we've had with other people.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.860
Now, the third component
of this homeostatic circuit

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.193
is the effector.

00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:30.320
The effector is actually what drives

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.270
the behavioral response,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.311
it's what leads you to
pick up your social media

00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:35.480
and start scrolling,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.060
it's what leads you to text a friend,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.080
it's what leads you to
call a friend or make plans

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.680
and what leads you to follow
through on those plans.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.580
So again, those three
components are a detector,

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.550
a control center, and an effector.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.040
And as you'll soon learn,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.630
the neural circuit that
controls the social homeostasis

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.270
actually has a fourth component,

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.310
and that fourth component is one

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.550
that places subjective understanding

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.880
as to why you are doing
what you are doing,

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.880
and establishes your place in a hierarchy.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.310
Now, I know the word
hierarchy can be a little bit

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.560
of a barbed wire one
because people immediately

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.980
start thinking about boss and subordinate,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.650
or in couples, a leader and a follower.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.990
But when we talk about social hierarchies

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.810
in the context of human interactions,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.950
social hierarchies are very plastic,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.080
meaning in one setting, one
person can be the leader,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.460
in another setting, the other
person can be the leader.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.750
You probably have groups of
friends or family members

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.970
where you're constantly passing the baton

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.840
as to who's going to drive,
who's going to navigate,

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.450
who's going to pick the restaurant,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.200
who's going to clear the dishes

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.680
and who's going to do certain
activities and not others.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.920
So hierarchies are very dynamic.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.682
And as a consequence, social
has to be very plastic

00:17:50.682 --> 00:17:52.760
and very fluid so that you move

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.490
from one environment to the next,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.920
even with the same people,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.170
you have to be able to
make those adjustments.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.060
And in the case of the
social homeostasis circuit,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.060
those adjustments are made by
a particular brain structure,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.570
I've talked about on this podcast before,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.180
it's called the prefrontal cortex,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.020
it is the seat of our higher
consciousness, if you will.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.080
It's what allows us to play
subjective labels on things

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.850
so we are not strictly input
output, we're not robotic.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.450
Meaning if you go to dinner with a friend

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.060
and they are exceptional
at choosing restaurants,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.485
well, in the context of the
social homeostasis circuit,

00:18:24.485 --> 00:18:26.159
your prefrontal cortex would allow them

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:27.440
to pick the restaurant

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.050
because basically they
are dominant over you

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.690
in their capacity to
pick good restaurants,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.060
at least in this example.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.250
Whereas as you leave that restaurant

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.410
and perhaps you are navigating

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.870
to a where to get a drink after dinner,

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.600
or where to walk through the city,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.550
perhaps you have the
better sense of direction.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.100
And so then the social
bonding has to be maintained

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.420
as you switch the hierarchy, okay?

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.250
So that's the role of that fourth element,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.630
the prefrontal cortex.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.250
Now I just briefly want to
touch on some of the brain areas

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.810
that thanks to the work
of Kay Tye and others,

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.670
we now know underlie the
detection, control and response.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.650
Okay, I call them the detector,
control center and effector

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.430
because inside of that description,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.200
isn't just a bunch of
names of neural structures,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.580
there are also hints as
to what the underlying

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.940
neurochemicals are,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.480
and by understanding what
the neurochemicals are,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.770
you can start to think
about tools that you can use

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.547
to form social bonds and
maintain social bonds

00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:24.670
in better, healthier ways.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.810
So let's talk about the detector first.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.790
Now, keep in mind that
you have your senses,

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.320
you have your vision, you have
your hearing, you have touch,

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.400
you have smell, you have taste.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.820
Sensation as I've talked about many times

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.890
before in the podcast,
but I'll just remind you,

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.280
sensation is the conversion

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.660
of physical stimuli in the environment

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.510
into electrical and chemical signals

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.620
in your nervous system.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.750
The language of the nervous system

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.550
is electrical and chemical signals.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.424
So photons of light are
converted to electrical

00:19:50.424 --> 00:19:51.540
and chemical signals,

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.100
pressure on the skin or
light touch on the skin

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.160
is converted into electrical
and chemical signals

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.490
and so on and so forth.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.540
So all of that of course is
flowing into the nervous system,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.680
but the detector that
underlies social homeostasis

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.970
involves mainly two structures,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.410
one is called the ACC, the
anterior cingulate cortex,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.180
and the other is the BLA,
basal lateral amygdala.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.290
And when you hear the word amygdala,

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.940
you're probably thinking fear.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.460
But today, as you'll see,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.110
the amygdala actually has many different

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.970
sub compartments and components.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.650
And there's a reason why
the basal lateral amygdala,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.621
which is associated with certain aspects

00:20:24.621 --> 00:20:26.253
of aversive behaviors,

00:20:26.253 --> 00:20:28.044
meaning moving away from certain types

00:20:28.044 --> 00:20:29.900
of things or interactions,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.800
there's a reason why the
BLA is such an integral part

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.680
of the detector system,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.730
and that's because just as it's important

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.200
to form healthy social bonds,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.129
it's vitally important to try and avoid

00:20:40.129 --> 00:20:42.370
unhealthy social bonds.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.230
And so the basolateral
amygdala is mainly associated

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.844
with these aversive type responses

00:20:46.844 --> 00:20:49.623
of just moving away from certain things.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.260
The control center in the
social homeostasis circuit

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.920
involves a brain area called
the lateral hypothalamus

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.170
and the periventricular hypothalamus.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.500
The lateral hypothalamus

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.620
and the periventricular hypothalamus

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.610
contain neurons that are able
to access the hormone system

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.590
in order to influence the
release of things like oxytocin,

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.700
which is a hormone neuropeptide,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.030
it's got a part hormone,
part neurotransmitter,

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.890
it's kind of a hybrid,

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.430
we're going to talk a
lot about oxytocin today.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.640
So we've got the ACC and the BLA,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.120
these are their areas are mainly involved

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.870
in moving away from things,
although also toward them,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.703
that's the detector.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.220
Then we got the control center,

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.080
which is in the hypothalamus,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.290
and then there's a very
special and important area

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.780
associated with social bonding

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.450
that I want everyone to learn,

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.870
which is the dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN,

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.040
dorsal raphe nucleus.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.350
The dorsal raphe nucleus
is a small collection

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.870
of neurons in the midbrain,
so it's deep in the brain.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.930
And most of the time when
you hear about raphe,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.750
R-A-P-H-E, by the way, raphe nucleus,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.400
you're talking about serotonin.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.310
Serotonin is a neuromodulator
that is often associated

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.130
with feelings of satiety
after eating, warmth,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.853
basically satisfaction with
things that you already have.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.780
However, within this dorsal raphe nucleus,

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.730
there is a small subset of
neurons that release dopamine.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.150
Dopamine is a neuromodulator

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.240
most often associated with movement,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.020
craving, motivation and desire.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.380
And the neural circuits
that are rich with dopamine

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.080
are things like the substantia nigra,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.900
the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.160
the nucleus accumbens, et cetera.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.080
Those names don't have
to mean anything to you.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.840
However, this unique
population of dopamine neurons

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.950
in the raphe is truly unique

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.620
in that it's responsible for mediating

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.223
what I've been calling social homeostasis.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.830
It is the effector or the response

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.870
that mediate social homeostasis.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.950
Now I haven't told you exactly
what social homeostasis is.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.830
Social homeostasis, just like hunger,

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.460
is the process by which when
you lack social interaction,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.723
you start to crave it.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.470
What's very interesting about the fact

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.730
that there are dopamine
neurons in this raphe structure

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.113
that is the effector
for social homeostasis,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.580
what this means is that
when you are not interacting

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.700
with people at a frequency or intensity,

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.660
that is right for you,

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.060
dopamine is released into the brain.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.330
In most popular
conversations about dopamine,

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.060
and even in scientific circles,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.440
when you hear dopamine release,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.660
you think about reward or feeling good,

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.250
because indeed many behaviors

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.220
and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.480
That's one of the reasons they have

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.270
so much addictive potential.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.450
However, dopamine is not
associated with feeling good,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.580
it is actually the neurochemical

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.860
that's responsible for movement

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.000
toward things that feel good.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.890
So to zoom out and
conceptualize what we have here,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.460
we have a brain area that is a detector

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.380
that either will move us toward or away

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.893
from certain types of
experiences or sensations.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.520
We have a control center
that is going to release

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.750
certain hormones and neuropeptides
into our brain and blood,

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.440
depending on the sorts of interactions

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.240
that we happen to be having.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.530
And we have this response system,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.500
which is the dorsal raphe nucleus

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.970
that contains dopamine neurons.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.250
And when we are not
interacting with people

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.120
at the frequency or
intensity that we crave,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.550
dopamine is released,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.530
and that dopamine causes us to seek out

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.890
social interactions of particular kinds.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.520
So let's talk about what
social homeostasis is

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.780
and how it plays out.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.410
And again, let's use hunger as an example.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.890
So let's say you're a person who eats

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.180
every three or four hours regularly.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.950
So on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.910
you're just accustomed to eating
every three or four hours.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.680
If just suddenly I steal your meal

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.820
out of the fridge at work,
something I would not do,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.563
but just for sake of
mental experimentation,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.370
that would probably cause you to go

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.770
and seek out food
through some other route.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.710
You might buy food,

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.780
you probably be upset first,

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.510
but then you go buy
food or replace the food

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.343
that you were going to eat,

00:25:03.343 --> 00:25:04.360
you'd be hungry for that food.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.320
And indeed there are
hormonal type mechanisms

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.350
and other mechanisms that
when we eat regularly

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.080
and we predict that food is coming in,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.570
we actually start secreting insulin,

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.490
which is for mobilizing blood sugar,

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.310
there are hormones in the bloodstream

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.520
that make us hungry on a
regular clock-like schedule,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.230
and you would seek out more food.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.970
Similarly, if you're
somebody who is accustomed

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.890
to a lot of social interaction,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.560
and suddenly I take away
that social interaction,

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.086
you would feel kind of let down,

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:39.060
you would crave a replacement
social interaction.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.440
You might be upset that you
had a lunch date with a friend,

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.550
you're used to having lunch
with them every Wednesday,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.090
and they cancel and you
would crave the interaction.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.530
Okay, this is called a pro-social craving.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.570
And indeed, this is what you
see in animals and humans.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.781
If you, what's called
acutely isolate them,

00:25:55.781 --> 00:25:57.950
which is just a fancy scientific word

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.900
of saying deprive them
of social interactions

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.960
in a short-term basis,

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.300
they start engaging in
pro-social behaviors,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.440
they start texting other people,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.070
they start seeking out social interactions

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.903
of different kinds.

00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:11.510
And that makes perfect sense, right?

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.980
But thought of from the different side,

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.290
you could also imagine

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.420
how well, if you're getting
a social interaction

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.900
with somebody on a daily or weekly basis,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.780
and suddenly you remove that interaction,

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.493
well, then people might not care,

00:26:24.493 --> 00:26:25.460
they might just think,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.720
well, I'll get the interaction tomorrow

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.660
or the next day or the next day,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.900
because they're sated,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.030
much in the same way that the person

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.497
who eats very regularly might say,

00:26:31.497 --> 00:26:32.770
"Well, I ate four hours ago,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.320
and I'll eat eight hours
later, no big deal."

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.900
But that's not what happens.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.440
There's a prediction
that we are going to have

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.920
certain types of interactions,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.490
and when those interactions don't happen,

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.148
we replace that lack of
interaction with a drive

00:26:45.148 --> 00:26:48.660
and a motivation to seek
out social interaction.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.070
And that drive and
motivation is caused by,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.903
or I should say,

00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:56.560
is driven by dopamine release
from that dorsal raphe.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.130
And so the takeaway is that
when we lack social interaction

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.110
that we expect, we become pro-social.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.450
However, if we are
chronically socially isolated,

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.220
meaning we don't have interactions

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.910
with people for a long time,

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.540
we become actually more introverted.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.930
This is separate from all
of the tachykinin stuff

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.030
that I talked about earlier,

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.050
or falling into states of chronic stress,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.313
but it's well-established now
that in humans and in animals,

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.910
if you don't give them
enough social interaction,

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.100
they actually become antisocial.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.780
And so this is actually a little bit

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.890
like what one might see
with long-term fasting.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.850
Okay, I gave the example
of eating every four hours,

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.170
now let's give the parallel
example of somebody

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.190
who's been fasting perhaps
for two or three days,

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.950
if they are expecting to eat,

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.500
and then the meal doesn't arrive,

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.520
they are not necessarily
going to immediately

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.930
try and seek out food.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.210
And that's a little bit counterintuitive,

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.043
you would have thought,

00:27:52.043 --> 00:27:53.210
well, they haven't eaten
in a very long time,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.490
they're going to be very
motivated to seek out food,

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.000
but no, they are accustomed to fasting.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.980
Similarly, the social homeostasis circuit

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.490
works in a way such
that when we don't have

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.850
social interactions for a very long time,

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.760
we start to lose our craving
for social interactions.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.760
Let's look at the social
homeostasis circuit

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.450
through the lens of what's commonly

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.440
called introversion and extroversion.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.350
Now, typically when we
hear about introverts,

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.330
we think about the quiet
person at the party,

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.170
or the person that doesn't
want to go out at all.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.920
And we think about an
extrovert as somebody

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.580
who's really social, the
so-called social butterfly,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.310
who enjoys social
interactions, is really chatty,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.040
is kind of life of the party type person.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.970
That's the cliche or the kind
of pop psychology cliche,

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.950
but actually in the psychology literature,

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.853
that's not really the way it holds up.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.400
Many people who appear introverted
are actually extroverted.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.910
The quiet person at a party
could be an extrovert,

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.450
except that they just
don't talk very much.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.130
The characteristic of an extrovert

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.930
is somebody that gets energy

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.150
or feels good from social interactions,

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.420
they sort of get a lift,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.040
and we can predict that that lift occurs

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.080
because of some release of dopamine

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.170
within their brain and body.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.500
And indeed there's evidence for that,

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.540
neuroimaging study support that,

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.312
other forms of neuro-biological analysis

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:09.150
support that as well.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.960
We can also imagine that the person

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.550
who's talking a lot is somebody
who's very extroverted,

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.460
but oftentimes people who
talk a lot for their work

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.550
or they're somebody who's very social

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.120
when you interact with them,

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.640
that person gets back to their car

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.610
and is absolutely depleted and
exhausted by that interaction

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.440
or all sorts of social interactions.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.070
So we really can't predict
whether or not somebody

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.158
is an introvert or an extrovert

00:29:32.158 --> 00:29:34.080
simply based on their behavior,

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.150
it's really more of an
internal subjective label.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.580
However, if we look at
introversion and extroversion

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.920
through this lens of the
social homeostatic set point,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.750
and we think about
dopamine as this molecule

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.393
that drives motivation to
seek out social interactions,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.720
what we can reasonably assume

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.400
is that introverts are
people that when they engage

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.890
in certain forms of social interaction,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.970
either the amount of
dopamine that's released

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.665
is greater than it is an extrovert,

00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:07.147
that's right, I said greater
than it is at an extrovert,

00:30:07.147 --> 00:30:10.030
and so they actually feel quite motivated,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.950
but also satisfied by very brief,

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:17.290
or we could say sort of
sparse social interactions.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.550
They don't need a lot of social
engagement to feel sated.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.790
Again, the parallel
example would be hunger.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.050
This would be somebody who
doesn't need to eat much

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.940
in order to feel satisfied.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.990
Whereas the extrovert,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.198
we can reasonably assume
releases less dopamine

00:30:32.198 --> 00:30:35.120
in response to an individual
social interaction.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.330
And so they need much
more social interaction

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.460
in order to feel filled
up by that interaction.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.610
And indeed this is supported

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.850
by the neuro-biological imaging studies.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.280
So rather than thinking about
introverts and extroverts

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.823
as chatty versus quiet,

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.760
it's useful to think about
people, maybe yourself,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.870
maybe other people you know,

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.370
as how much social interaction they need

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.700
in order to bring this social
homeostasis into balance.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.050
Now there's the fourth component

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.460
of this social homeostasis
circuit that I mentioned before,

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.220
and that's the prefrontal cortex.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.270
The prefrontal cortex
is involved in thinking

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.660
and planning and action,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.610
and has extensive connections
with areas of the brain

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.300
like the hypothalamus,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.680
which is responsible for
a lot of motivated drives.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.470
It also has connections with the various

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.780
reward centers of the brain,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.530
and it can act as kind of an accelerator,

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.560
meaning it can encourage
more electrical activity

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.050
of other brain centers,

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.050
or as a break on those brain centers.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.930
A really good example,
it's kind of a trivial one

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.390
in the context of today's discussion,

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.960
but it's a concrete one so I'll use it,

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.363
it would be, I know many people
out there use cold showers

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.906
as a way to stimulate metabolism

00:31:39.906 --> 00:31:42.230
and build up resilience
and this sort of thing.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.140
If you get into a very cold shower

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.790
and you feel as if you want to get out,

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.493
but you force yourself to stay in,

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.590
you're forcing yourself to stay in

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.910
because your prefrontal cortex

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.700
is placing some subjective
label on that experience.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.700
Either you're doing it
for a certain benefit

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.660
or you've got a timer,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.500
and you're using the
timer as the regulator

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.730
of how long you're going to stay in,

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.550
basically your overriding reflexes.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.760
And that's the main function
of the prefrontal cortex.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.660
But as I mentioned earlier,

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.620
the prefrontal cortex components

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.230
that wire into the social
homeostasis circuit

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.170
are responsible for evaluating

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.430
where you are in a given hierarchy.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.915
And that affords you a ton of flexibility

00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:21.010
in terms of the types
of social interactions

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:21.950
that you can engage in,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.490
and whether or not you're
going to spend time

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.100
with certain people or not,

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.724
whether or not you're going
to engage and then disengage.

00:32:27.724 --> 00:32:28.930
What do I mean by this?

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.240
Well, let's say you're
an extroverted person,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.510
you're somebody that likes
a lot of social interaction

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.663
and you get a lot of
dopamine release on whole

00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:38.490
from a lot of social interactions.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.370
So maybe one interaction with
a teller at the supermarket,

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.260
isn't really going to
give you much dopamine,

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.710
but going to a party will
give you more dopamine,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.030
and so you seek out these
larger social interactions.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.920
However, you might go to a party

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.140
where somebody says something

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.670
or you see somebody there that
you'd much prefer not to see,

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.473
and therefore you decide to leave.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.430
The deciding to leave is regulated

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.600
by that prefrontal cortex component.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.380
So it's important to understand

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.340
that just because there's
a homeostatic circuit

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.010
that involves areas like the amygdala

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.250
and the hypothalamus and
these deep brain regions,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.733
like the dorsal raphe,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.633
as a human being,

00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:14.457
you have flexibility over
your social interactions

00:33:14.457 --> 00:33:17.600
and that flexibility arise
from those prefrontal circuits.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.160
So there's a ton of
subjective nature to it,

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.930
there's a lot of context to it.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.230
So while there are some predictable

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:25.620
elements of these circuits,

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.944
they are not simply what we
would call, plug and chug,

00:33:27.944 --> 00:33:29.420
you have flexibility,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.034
you are able to say, "You
know, I love parties,

00:33:31.034 --> 00:33:32.990
but I really don't want
to go to that party

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.250
because so-and-so is there."

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:38.120
Or, "I very much don't like
going across town in traffic,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.330
but I'm going to do it today

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.650
because a certain collection of people,

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.860
or perhaps a certain individual

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.420
will be at that particular party."

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.070
And so the prefrontal cortex again,

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.640
is what allows you that subjective ruling

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.890
or ruling over what would
otherwise just be reflexes.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.100
So now I'd like to drill
a little bit deeper

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.720
into this incredible neural structure

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.820
that is the dorsal raphe nucleus

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.180
and this small collection of neurons,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.020
the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.340
because while it's a small collection,

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.733
they are very powerful.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.220
Loneliness has been defined

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.220
by the great psychologist, John Cacioppo,

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.562
as the distress that
results from discrepancies

00:34:15.562 --> 00:34:18.620
between ideal and perceive
social relationships.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.453
Let me repeat that.

00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:21.910
Loneliness is not just being isolated,

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:24.760
loneliness, as he defines it,

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.028
is the distress that
results from discrepancies

00:34:27.028 --> 00:34:30.070
between ideal and perceive
social relationships.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.040
It's when we expect things to be one way,

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.600
and they're actually another way

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.020
and which way we expect them to be

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.080
and which way they turn out,
again, is highly subjective.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.940
What you expect from friendships,

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.460
and what other people
expect from friendships

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.830
could be entirely different,

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.270
but the circuit that
underlies friendship bonding

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.690
is exactly the same.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.040
And it is this dorsal raphe nucleus

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.770
and the dopamine neurons in that nucleus

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.130
that underlie the bond
that is social friendship

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.060
and all types of social bonds.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.380
There's a key finding in the literature,

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.330
the title of this paper is Dorsal Raphe

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.400
Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.473
of Social Isolation.

00:35:03.473 --> 00:35:05.700
This is a paper from Kat Tye's lab,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.260
the first author is Matthews,

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.570
Gillian Matthews to be specific.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.440
What they did is they were
able to selectively activate

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.570
the dopamine neurons in
the dorsal raphe nucleus.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:16.940
And when they did that,

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.410
they induced a loneliness-like state.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.880
Now, how did they know it
was a loneliness-like state?

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.540
They knew because it motivated

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.623
the seeking out of social connections.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.720
This is the kind of social hunger

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.610
that I was referring to before.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.570
Whereas when the dopamine
neurons of the dorsal raphe

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.780
are inhibited, meaning
their activity is quieted

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.890
that suppressed a loneliness state.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.970
So that's a little
counterintuitive, right?

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.267
It's a group of neurons
that when activated

00:35:45.267 --> 00:35:47.310
makes you feel lonely,

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:51.100
and when this brain area is not activated,

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.660
it suppresses loneliness.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.493
But if you think about it,

00:35:53.493 --> 00:35:56.220
that's exactly the kind of
circuit that you would want

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.780
in order to drive social behavior.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.690
When you're feeling lonely,

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.780
dopamine is released and
it causes you to go out

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.660
and seek social interactions.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.107
When this brain area has
enough social interactions,

00:36:08.107 --> 00:36:09.830
that's sort of a figure of speech,

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.000
brain areas don't have
enough social interactions,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.500
but when enough social
interactions have happened,

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.760
that the neurons in this brain areas

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.740
shut down their production of dopamine.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.130
Well, the loneliness state turns off.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.150
So what we think of as loneliness

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.297
as this big kind of dark cloud,

00:36:25.297 --> 00:36:29.270
or, you know, fog in our
psychological landscape,

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.480
boils down to a very small set of neurons,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.580
releasing a specific
neurochemical for motivation.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.400
And to me, this really changes the way

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.850
that we think about loneliness

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:40.800
and that we think about
social interactions.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.424
There's so much subjective
landscape to loneliness

00:36:43.424 --> 00:36:45.920
and to social interactions,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.880
but at the end of the day,

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.680
what it really is is that
we are all social animals

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.230
to some extent or another,

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.132
and we all crave social interactions

00:36:53.132 --> 00:36:54.900
to some extent or another,

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.762
although the extent will vary

00:36:56.762 --> 00:36:58.330
depending on where you are

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.860
in the introversion
extroversion continuum.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.580
And it is indeed a continuum.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.420
Now, the other aspect of the
study that was really important

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.060
gets back to that issue of
hierarchy and social rank.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.210
What they found is that depending

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:15.300
on where you see yourself
in the social rank,

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.280
the dopamine neurons in the raphe

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.587
will lead to one consequence or another,

00:37:19.587 --> 00:37:21.834
meaning moving toward social interactions

00:37:21.834 --> 00:37:24.170
or moving away from them.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.100
So the whole system is set up

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.563
so that you have a ton of flexibility

00:37:27.563 --> 00:37:29.890
and control over social interactions.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.510
So just a couple of key points
and actionable takeaways

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.060
based on the information
I've offered up until now,

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.593
if you think of yourself as an introvert,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.500
it's very likely that
you get a lot of dopamine

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.210
from a few or minimal social interactions.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:47.960
Whereas if you're an extrovert,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.020
contrary to what you might think,

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.820
social interactions are not going to flood

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.230
your system with dopamine,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:57.190
they actually are going to
lead to less dopamine release

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.820
than it would for an introvert,

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.020
and therefore you're going to need

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.070
a lot more social interactions

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.000
in order to feel filled
up by those interactions.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.530
Now I've been drawing a lot of parallels

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.870
between this social seeking

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.430
or avoiding social isolation and hunger,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.240
but is that really the case?

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.953
And could it be that they're
actually interactions

00:38:16.953 --> 00:38:18.780
between the different drives?

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.530
Meaning could social isolation

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.887
or the desire to seek
out social interactions

00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:27.300
actually relate to the
hunger system and vice versa?

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.610
And indeed the answer is yes.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.720
We don't have 50 different
homeostatic systems

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.720
and 50 different neurochemicals
to underlie our drive,

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.920
to eat our drive for
romantic interactions,

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.120
our drive for friendship interactions,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.130
we have essentially one, maybe two,

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.140
and they all funnel into
the same dopamine system.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.929
And there's a beautiful
paper that illustrates

00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:55.240
some of the crossover

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.560
between these different
homeostatic drives.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.140
The title of the paper
is Acute Social Isolation

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.810
Evokes Midbrain Craving
Responses Similar to Hunger.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.500
This from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.020
Massachusetts Institute of technology,

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.400
Dr. Kay Tye is also an
author on this paper,

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.010
the paper was published
in Nature Neuroscience.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.390
It's a really terrific paper.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.700
Just to briefly summarize what they did,

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.930
they took people that were categorized

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:23.160
as socially connected
healthy human adults.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.240
So these are people that are used

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.543
to pretty frequent social interactions,

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.400
and they socially isolated
them for about 10 hours.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.070
And they had no opportunity
to access social media,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.210
email, fiction reading even,

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.780
and certainly didn't have the opportunity

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.860
to interact with people face to face.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.317
So what this did is it
increased social craving,

00:39:44.317 --> 00:39:46.570
both subjectively the people said

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:48.630
that they were now craving
social interactions,

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.060
and then they did brain imaging

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.130
in response to images of people,

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.080
people interacting, food, flowers,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.110
other types of stimuli,

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.886
some of the stimuli or these images

00:39:57.886 --> 00:39:59.250
that we call them stimuli

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.380
but their images really, had
a lot of social engagement

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.730
going on in them, others did not,

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.470
some had a lot of faces
showing, others did not.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.180
And as you might suspect,

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.560
there was activation of
many of the brain areas

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.750
that we've talked about earlier,

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.720
dorsal raphe nucleus and other brain areas

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.440
associated with dopaminergic neurons.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.440
When the socially isolated
people viewed social cues,

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.310
people interacting, faces,

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.130
and so on and less so
for things like flowers,

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.578
however, they also had increased responses

00:40:30.578 --> 00:40:34.420
to images of food, which is interesting

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.870
and actually is consistent
with the literature

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.720
that when people are socially isolated,

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.190
they often will start eating more,

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.950
or they will change the nature
of the foods that they eat.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.340
Now we think of that as comfort foods

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.940
or soothing oneself through eating

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.930
rather than social interaction
as a kind of pathology,

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.870
but while it might not be healthy,

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.100
depending on the context and the person,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.480
it's really important to understand

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.680
that the reason that happens

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.810
is because we have a common circuit

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.910
and that the system meaning the person

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.900
is actually craving dopamine release.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.743
They don't consciously know this,

00:41:06.743 --> 00:41:08.780
this is all subconsciously carried out,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.460
but they're craving dopamine release.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.510
And if they can't get it
from social interactions,

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.540
as they normally would, they'll
start seeking it from food.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.940
Now they did an important
reverse experiment as well,

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.670
where they had subjects go
on 10 hours of food fasting.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.560
Now these were not people that
were familiar with fasting,

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.270
they weren't doing intermittent fasting,

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.840
they were eating more
typical meal schedules,

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.750
and so that created
increased hunger, et cetera,

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:37.100
but it also increased
their appetite if you will,

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.760
for social interactions.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.380
And so the important point here

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.380
is that there's a common biology,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.490
there's a common circuitry
that underlies homeostatic

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:49.080
craving of things that
maintain us as individuals

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.100
and as a species.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.840
And it really places social
interactions as right up there

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.530
in the list of things that
we could consider so vital

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.220
for our survival and for our health.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.730
Things like food, water,
social interactions

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:07.000
really sit within a top
tier amongst each other,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.210
and they use the same common circuitry,

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.150
dorsal raphe dopamine neurons,

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.430
in addition to other structures,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.840
in order to create this drive,

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.210
to seek out certain types of stimuli.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.970
Now, this is a very reductionist
view of social bonding,

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.400
I realized that,

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.100
but it's important to realize

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.590
that while we place all
the subjective context,

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.023
oh, I miss this person,

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:30.430
or I really would like
to avoid that person,

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.263
at the end of the day,

00:42:31.263 --> 00:42:33.534
it really all funnels into a system

00:42:33.534 --> 00:42:35.710
whereby a single neurochemical

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.610
is either being released and motivating us

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.931
to seek out more of a
particular type of interaction

00:42:40.931 --> 00:42:42.150
or is not released,

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.610
and therefore we are perfectly comfortable

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.690
staying exactly where we are.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.847
As I say this, some of
you are probably thinking,

00:42:47.847 --> 00:42:50.270
"Oh, that's probably what
happens when you fall in love."

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.720
And indeed that's the case.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.330
When people enter romantic relationships,

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.360
that to them are very satisfying,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.340
there's this period that, you know,

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.360
that the theory is that it lasts anywhere

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.190
from six days to six months,

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.890
although some people
report that this feeling

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.180
can last many, many years,

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:10.180
even decades of just feeling
completely filled up and sated

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.780
by the experience of
being with that person.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.930
So much so that cravings
for food are reduced,

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.560
cravings for sleep are reduced.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.780
Now there's all sorts of activities

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.180
and things that go along with
new romantic partnerships

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.730
that take up time, that might
get in the way of things

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.640
like sleep or things like food.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.860
But the point is that dopamine
is the final common pathway

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.740
by which we seek out things

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.886
and we end up feeling
as if we are satisfied

00:43:33.886 --> 00:43:36.540
by certain types of interactions.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.660
Now, similarly, if
you've ever been isolated

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.430
for a long period of time,

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.660
your focus might have shifted
to what you're going to eat,

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.770
what you're going to cook for dinner

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:46.550
in a much more heightened way,

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.890
the importance of those sensory stimuli

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.150
and those types of interactions,

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.860
and indeed the taste
of food itself expands.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.720
So normally when we are
in social relationships

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.150
that are ones that are familiar to us,

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.290
we have a balance of
these different drives.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.310
But when one particular drive takes over

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.860
and we are very focused on it,

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.510
because they all funnel
into the same circuitry,

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.480
there really isn't the seeking out

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.600
of certain types of behaviors

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.960
like food seeking when
we're newly in love.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.190
Now that doesn't mean that
food won't taste good to us

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.023
so that we don't seek it.

00:44:17.023 --> 00:44:18.790
And indeed, there are
experiments that have been done

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:20.320
where if people have just fallen in love,

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.010
the taste of a strawberry
can just be incredible.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.040
The other effect of
dopamine is that it changes

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.870
the way that we interpret sensory stimuli,

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.020
our detectors actually change

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.450
when we are in heightened states

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.390
of dopaminergic activity or drive.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.730
Basically what this means
is that things seem better

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.930
than they would when we have
less dopamine in our system.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:41.510
The point here is that
there's a lot of crossover,

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.500
there's a lot of meshing together

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.230
of different homeostatic drives

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.580
that they don't exist
in separate channels.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.440
And it's only under conditions

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.990
in which one particular homeostatic drive

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.850
is kind of being played
out to the extreme,

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.210
such as the example of falling in love,

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:59.920
that we tend to avoid or sort of overlook

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.330
the other homeostatic drives,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.070
and that's because simply
we're getting enough dopamine,

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.630
we don't need anymore.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.860
Up until now, I've been focused

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.334
on the organizational
logic of social bonding,

00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:10.900
which is really just nerd speak

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.540
for how is it that we
form bonds, avoid bonds?

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.690
Why do people seek out more or fewer bonds

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.280
than others, et cetera?

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.640
Now I'd like to shift gears a bit,

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.100
and focus on what are
some things that we can do

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.653
to encourage the formation
of healthy bonds?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.290
There's a beautiful
study that was published

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:32.450
in Cell Reports, Cell Press
Journal, excellent journal.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.175
The title of this paper
is Conscious Processing

00:45:34.175 --> 00:45:36.480
of Narrative Stimuli
Synchronizes Heart Rate

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.070
Between Individuals.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.770
I mentioned this on a previous podcast,

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.210
but I'd like to mention it again

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:42.380
and go into a little bit more depth

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.020
because it points to specific

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.270
actionable items that we can all use

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.880
in order to enhance the quality and depth

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.290
of social bonds of all kinds.

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.770
Now this study involved a very
simple type of experiment,

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.480
they had people listen to a story,

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.150
everybody in the study
listened to the same story,

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.930
but they listened to that
story at different times

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.850
and indeed in different locations.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.910
So different people, same story.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.870
And they measured things like heart rate,

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.640
they measured breathing, et cetera.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.820
Now, what was the
motivation for doing this?

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.010
Well, there's a long standing literature

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.240
showing that our physiology,

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.090
things like our heart rate, our breathing,

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.040
our skin conductance,

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.590
meaning the amount of sweating,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.860
can be synchronized between individuals,

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.910
and that synchronization can occur

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:28.980
according to a variety
of different things.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.540
There've been studies that
have people look at one another

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.570
and they look and actually
see that their pupil size

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.830
of their eyes starts to synchronize.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:38.980
People's breathing can synchronize,

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.530
people's body temperatures
can even start to synchronize,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.680
or at least shifts in body
temperature can synchronize.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.850
One person gets cooler, the
other person gets cooler.

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.570
A lot of this is subconscious,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.630
some of it can be
detected by conscious cues

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:51.700
like flushing of the skin,

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.760
or actually seeing
someone's pupils change.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.730
But actually the pupil reflex
is a really good example,

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.458
whereby except for rare cases

00:46:59.458 --> 00:47:01.610
and certain highly trained individuals,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.980
most people can't control
their pupil reflexes

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.340
in a very deliberate way,

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.950
it's truly a reflex,
it's an autonomic reflex.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.470
So there's a lot of literature showing

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.090
that within small groups or two people,

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.000
these physiological signals
can be synchronized.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.220
What this study found was
that when people listen

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.620
to the same story, but at different times,

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.800
their heart rates start to synchronize.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.400
This is incredible because
people are listening

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.050
to the story at different times,

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.840
but the gaps between their
heartbeats become very stereotype

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.700
and map almost precisely onto one another.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.753
That's incredible.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:37.880
Now we also know from
an extensive literature

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:42.320
that the quality and perceived
depth of a social bond

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.190
correlates very strongly

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.440
with how much physiological
synchronization

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.600
there is between individuals.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.530
In other words, when your
bodies feel the same,

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:57.640
you tend to feel more
bonded to somebody else.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.380
And so this whole thing is
a rather circular argument,

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.020
when you feel closer to somebody else,

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.090
your physiology synchronize,

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.190
and the reverse is true as well,

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.810
when your physiologies are synchronized,

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.830
you feel closer to other people.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.580
This is what I call
the concert phenomenon,

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.280
if you ever go to see your favorite band,

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.120
or you go to a concert
that you particularly love,

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.180
you often look over at somebody

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.070
and you'll see them
enjoying the same thing,

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.470
and they're often in a
similar state as you are,

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.860
maybe their sort of like
favorite song comes on,

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.000
and you actually feel
connected to that person.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.833
You feel like you're in...

00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:31.850
Obviously there's a shared experience,

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.560
but there's also a shared
physiological response

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.750
to that experience.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.090
And so this can happen and mass
with large groups of people,

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.520
or it can happen just
between two individuals.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.230
And as the study points out,

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.850
it can actually happen
between individuals,

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.980
without them actually
interacting with one another.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.670
When the story they are listening to

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.790
is the anchor or the
driver of their physiology.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.650
This really points to
the fact that the body

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:57.140
and the brain are reciprocally connected.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.140
Yes, indeed, what we think, what we hear,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.260
what we feel drives our physiology,

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.550
our heartbeat, our respiration, et cetera,

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.850
but our heartbeat and respiration also

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.290
are influencing our state of mind.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:10.123
And in this case,

00:49:10.123 --> 00:49:12.940
it's encouraging certain
types of social bonds

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.277
when our heart rates are synchronized.

00:49:15.277 --> 00:49:16.970
And you can leverage this,

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:17.990
how can you leverage this?

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:21.830
Well, let's take a upcoming
example of the holidays.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.330
There's a sort of a joke,

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:29.070
I think it was Ram Dass, sort
of Buddhist philosopher type

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.458
that said, "If you think
you're enlightened,

00:49:31.458 --> 00:49:32.980
go visit your parents."

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.440
And I think what he was referring to

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.350
is that some people, not all people,

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.360
have challenging relationships
with their parents.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.640
We're going to talk about
child-parent attachment

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.120
and interactions in a few minutes,

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.370
but you know, some people
have a wonderful relationship

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.860
to both their parents
and more power to them,

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.940
I think that's wonderful,
we should all be so lucky.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.289
Many people have challenged relationships

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:53.210
with their parents,

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.740
or they have a great
relationship with their parents,

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.550
but their parents know,

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.610
or they know how to drive that dart

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:03.080
right into that particular soft
piece of psychological flesh

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.100
by saying just the slightest thing,

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.670
or even by raising their
eyebrow or rolling their eyes

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.130
or the tone in which they do something.

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.450
This is also true between siblings.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:13.620
I think many of you can think of examples

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.573
where this is true.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.570
Many people when they
interact with others,

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:22.270
expect that the mere interaction
with the other person

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.750
is going to create the sense of bonding.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.100
And often that is the case,

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.600
for instance, if are involved
in intimate disclosure,

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.720
if people enjoy each
other's company so much

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.590
that just the mere sight of
somebody evokes great feelings

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.890
and it's mutual, that often can happen.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:41.740
But in many types of social interactions,

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.552
it's not the direct
interaction with that person

00:50:44.552 --> 00:50:46.610
that makes us feel close to them,

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.220
but rather it's shared experience.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.620
And shared experience
is shared physiology.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.710
That's the point I'm trying
to make by way of this study

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:58.030
about conscious processing
of narrative stimuli

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:00.410
synchronize this heart rate
of different individuals.

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:04.050
So for instance, if you
have a somewhat challenged

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:07.630
or somewhat, let's call
it a slight friction

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.580
in getting close with somebody,

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.520
or it can be a challenging interaction,

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.800
oftentimes, it's very
useful to focus outward

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.610
on some other common narrative, a movie,

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:20.670
oftentimes people will
watch a game together.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:22.500
Actually there's a lot of critique

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.750
that people or families will focus outward

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.500
too much on external events,

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.504
but these external events can
be observing the grandchild

00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:32.050
and how wonderful they are,

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:34.510
or observing the meal
and how wonderful it is.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.750
Or as we commonly see
in various traditions,

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.050
there's a story that's repeated each year,

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.450
certainly in the upcoming holidays,

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:42.860
there's Christmas stories,

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.210
there are themes and traditions,

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:46.760
and those themes and traditions

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.840
anchor a number of different
aspects of our psychology.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.760
They're really wonderful,

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.320
they thread through the ages really,

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.960
and allow us to link
our own experiences up

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.110
with previous generations and experiences.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.550
But in addition to that,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.390
they synchronize our physiologies.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.010
And so sometimes it can be useful

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:07.000
rather than expecting others
to shift our physiology

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.430
in the way that we wish,

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:11.670
or us shifting their physiologies
in the way that we wish,

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.730
and then expecting some
bond to mushroom out of that

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.760
in some beautiful way,

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.940
to focus on some external stimulus,

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.810
to focus on something
that will synchronize

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.110
the physiologies of both people,

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:26.480
that can act as a bridge in
order to establish social bonds.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.860
And this is not a hack or a workaround

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.750
for making terrible relationships good,

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.770
this is actually at the
seat of what we come away

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.440
from a social interaction with

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.240
as feeling "Wow, that was
a really wonderful time."

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.890
Often a really wonderful
time can be by virtue

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.480
of the specific things that were said,

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.500
or the specific things
that one engaged in,

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.470
but more often than not
the final common pathway,

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.350
we should say,

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:54.010
of great experiences was a
great physiological experience

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:57.050
and a shared physiological experience.

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:58.620
I have a short anecdote
that relates to this,

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.580
I have an older sibling
and she used to say

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.570
that when she was in college,

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:03.370
the best dates that she ever went on

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.650
were dates where she was asked to go out

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:06.760
and listen to music.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.080
She pointed out, however,

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.908
that oftentimes the guys
that would ask her out

00:53:09.908 --> 00:53:11.400
would take her to jazz clubs,

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.233
she always had the theory

00:53:12.233 --> 00:53:13.660
that they would ask her to jazz clubs

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.900
because at jazz clubs
typically you would sit down

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.121
and then she had to conclude
that they couldn't dance.

00:53:18.121 --> 00:53:19.460
My sister likes to dance.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.135
And so anytime someone
actually had the nerve

00:53:21.135 --> 00:53:22.270
to take her dancing,

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.780
those turned out to be particularly,

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.726
let's just say, satisfying
dates and relationships,

00:53:26.726 --> 00:53:27.915
at least they lasted longer,

00:53:27.915 --> 00:53:29.140
that's all I know about them,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.450
that's all I want to know about them,

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.100
she's my sister after all.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.900
But the theory behind
whoever was asking her out

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.310
on these dates was it was the right one,

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.310
which is that if you want
to bond with somebody,

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.850
you create a common physiological response

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.510
through a common and shared experience.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:46.960
And that is often a good entryway

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.080
into establishing whether or
not it's always a question,

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.340
whether or not there can be
common physiological experience

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.160
between two individuals.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.510
Up until now, we've been
talking about social bonding

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:58.100
through the lens of neurocircuits

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.980
that are already established.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.480
However, early in the episode,

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.103
I mentioned that these
very neural circuits

00:54:03.103 --> 00:54:05.140
that are responsible for social bonding

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.866
in adult forms of attachment,

00:54:06.866 --> 00:54:10.350
be it romantic or friendship or otherwise

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:13.290
are actually established
during development.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:14.360
One of the more important,

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:18.120
and I think exciting
areas of early attachment

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.480
as it relates to adult attachment,

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.630
comes to us from the work of Allan Schore.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:28.630
Alan shore, spelled
A-L-L-A-N, Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.760
is a psychoanalyst who
also has deep understanding

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.780
of neurobiology of attachment,

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.090
both in childhood and in adulthood.

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.653
And he's focused a lot on differences

00:54:40.653 --> 00:54:44.850
between right brain and left
brain forms of attachment.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:47.800
Now in an early episode of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.780
I touched into the fact that
most of what's discussed

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.500
in the general public in
sort of pop psychology

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.420
and even in some neurobiology courses

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.637
about right brain versus left brain,

00:54:58.637 --> 00:55:00.810
and one side of the brain
being more emotional,

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:04.340
and the other side being more
rational is completely wrong.

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.891
Okay, most of what I see out
there is actually backwards

00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:10.140
to the way things actually work.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.470
And while there is some,

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:13.930
what we call lateralization of function,

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.520
meaning certain brain functions
are handled by neurons

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.563
on one side of the brain or the other,

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:22.380
the idea that one side of
your brain is emotional,

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.260
and the other side of
your brain is rational

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.460
is just simply not true.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.670
However, the work of Allan Schore

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:31.410
points to some very
concrete neural circuits

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.730
that do have a lateralization bias,

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.820
meaning they are more right
brain than left brain,

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.930
or more left brain than right brain,

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.440
that underlies certain forms of attachment

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.130
between child and parents,

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.970
in particular child and mother,

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.680
and that these right
brain-isms, if you will,

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.380
and left brain-isms for attachment,

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.330
get played out again and again

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.510
in our forms of attachment as adults.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.820
So I'd like to talk about
that work briefly now,

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.270
because I think it
really points to a number

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.570
of important features of
how we establish bonds

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.570
and the different routes
to establishing bonds.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.330
So within the field of psychoanalysis,

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.340
there's been a longstanding
discussion, of course,

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.850
about the so-called
unconscious or subconscious,

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:16.760
the things that we are not aware of.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.280
And I think there's growing evidence

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.087
pointing to the fact that
at least one major component

00:56:21.087 --> 00:56:23.730
of the subconscious or the unconscious

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.920
is the so-called autonomic nervous system.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.330
The autonomic nervous system

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:28.950
is the portion of our nervous system

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.650
that controls our reflexive breathing,

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:32.990
our heart rate, our skin conductance,

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:35.700
meaning our sweating, pupil size,

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.070
it's the aspect of our nervous system

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.230
that makes us more alert or more calm.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.860
It's the so-called sympathetic,
meaning for alertness,

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.380
or parasympathetic branch of
the autonomic nervous system,

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.160
parasympathetic for
more calming responses.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.110
Now what Dr. Schore's work

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.970
and the work of others is now showing,

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:57.150
is that early infant-parent,

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:58.860
in particular infant-mother attachment

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.750
involves a coordination or synchronization

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.940
of these right brain circuits

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.600
and these left brain circuits,

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.470
as they relate, excuse me,

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:10.770
to the autonomic nervous system.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:11.830
How does this play out?

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.750
Well, it plays out where
early on as an infant,

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:16.650
when you're born, you're truly helpless,

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:17.760
you can't feed yourself,

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.940
you can't warm yourself,
you can't change yourself,

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.840
and you certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.453
to get the things that you need.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:27.550
All of those functions,

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:31.430
all of those needs rather are
met by your primary caretaker.

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:33.520
Typically that's the mother.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.270
Fathers of course play a role also,

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:38.060
but because of breastfeeding
or even bottle feeding,

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.340
typically mothers play
a more prominent role.

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.430
I realized there are exceptions,

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.830
but that's the general rule.

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.890
There are now brain imaging studies

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:49.030
examining the brains of infants

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:52.160
and the brains of mothers as they interact

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.940
and showing that the physical
contact between the two,

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.770
the breathing of the mother and child,

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:00.800
the heart rate of the mother and child,

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.010
and indeed the pupil size
of the mother and child

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.160
are actually actively getting coordinated.

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.570
In other words, the mother is regulating

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:10.260
the infant's autonomic
nervous system primarily,

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.820
and the infant is also regulating

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.580
the mother's autonomic nervous system,

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.230
a small coup from a baby or a cry,

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:17.660
which is a stress cry from a baby

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.690
will definitely regulate
the autonomic nervous system

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:20.930
of the mother.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:25.930
This whole right brain
system is directly tapped

00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:28.460
into the so-called oxytocin system,

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.470
and we'll talk more about
oxytocin in a moment.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.294
Oxytocin again, being this peptide hormone

00:58:32.294 --> 00:58:34.832
that is involved in
social bonds of all kinds,

00:58:34.832 --> 00:58:37.670
but that at least in early childhood

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:40.100
is very closely associated
with milk let down

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.580
and milk production.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.600
There's actually a lot of stimulation

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.060
of oxytocin release in the
mother by nursing itself,

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.562
so physical contact with the nipple,

00:58:49.562 --> 00:58:53.760
and by the contact of skin
between baby and mother

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.080
and their specificity there,

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.930
it's not just any baby that can evoke

00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:01.030
the most amount of oxytocin
release from the mother.

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:02.630
Now, however, there are examples

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.770
where just holding a child
will evoke oxytocin release

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:08.560
in the non-parent or somebody
other than the parent,

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.180
I think most people experience that.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.620
That's the new puppy
or new baby phenomenon

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.520
'cause indeed puppies can
invoke oxytocin release as well.

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.750
The point is not that
oxytocin is only released

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:21.186
in response to the primary relationship,

00:59:21.186 --> 00:59:23.440
or the mother and their child,

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.080
but rather that the amount of oxytocin

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.313
scales with how closely related one is

00:59:28.313 --> 00:59:31.290
to that particular child and vice versa.

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:33.190
So there's oxytocin release occurring

00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:35.090
in both the child and the mother.

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:38.660
So this right brain system is an emotional

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.460
but autonomic system,

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.420
it is below our conscious detection.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.113
Now, as we get older,

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.790
there's another system that
starts to come into play

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:53.760
in parent-child interactions,

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.300
and this also comes into play

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.020
in sibling interactions and so forth,

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.510
and that's the left brain system

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.250
as described by Allan Schore.

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:03.250
Now, again, this isn't about
emotion versus rationality,

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:04.620
this is about autonomic

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.740
versus more conscious forms of bonding.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.850
So on the left brain circuit side,

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.570
there is evidence for based
on neuroimaging studies,

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:15.090
but also animal studies
to support the idea

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.570
that on the left brain side of things,

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:21.050
there is a processing more of narratives

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:24.000
that are very concrete,
logical narratives, okay.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.420
And again, I have to zoom out

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.070
and just really tamped down the idea

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:29.976
that it's not that one side
of the brain is emotional

01:00:29.976 --> 01:00:31.529
and the other side is rational,

01:00:31.529 --> 01:00:34.520
but rather that these two things
are happening in parallel.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.880
And that there's a bit of a dominance

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.720
for the left brain circuitry

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.179
to be involved in the kinds of bonding

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:44.220
that are associated with
prediction and reward.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.190
So good example would be
reading to a child every night,

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.390
sitting there and reading,

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.140
you know, I can recall reading to my niece

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.600
and seeing her parents read to her.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.390
And she had no clue whatsoever
with what they were saying

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.017
because she, well, at least, I don't know,

01:00:58.017 --> 01:00:59.920
but she certainly couldn't speak,

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.710
but she liked looking at the pictures,

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:04.640
and it was a very predictable
sort of interaction.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.300
It was okay, out come the books,

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.950
it was usually here's the bath,

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:09.060
then there's the pajamas,

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.450
then there's the lights go down,

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:11.490
then out comes the book,

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.860
and then there's the interaction
between parent and child,

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.970
which of course usually also
involves physical contact.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:17.987
So it's not like the right brain system

01:01:17.987 --> 01:01:20.310
and the left brain system
are operating separately,

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.940
they're operating in parallel.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.040
But that sort of prediction and reward

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.550
kids like to be read to,

01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.000
is generally mediated by
this left brain system.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.140
And this carries on as children get older

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.073
and as parents take on and
evolve their parenting roles.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.980
It's very apparent that
healthy social bonding

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.970
between children and caretaker

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.677
relies on the fact that
both this right brain system

01:01:44.677 --> 01:01:46.870
and the left brain system are engaged,

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.970
that there's a synchronization
of autonomic function,

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:54.280
meaning a joining together
in actual somatic feeling,

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.440
and that there's a
synchronization of experience

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.300
that's more about some
outward or external stimulus,

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.490
like reading a book or
watching a show together

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:07.930
or enjoying some common
experience of a meal together.

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:09.260
And of course, as children get older,

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.088
they're able to access
more and more cognitively

01:02:11.088 --> 01:02:12.650
sophisticated things.

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:13.860
You can watch a movie with them

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.590
and they'll make predictions
about which characters

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.160
are going to show up for instance,

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.248
or you can take to a concert

01:02:19.248 --> 01:02:22.640
and they can appreciate the
concert or play in that concert,

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.417
and they appreciate that
they're being appreciated.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:26.110
Okay, so there are a million different,

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:27.930
there's infinite number of examples here,

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.800
but the idea is that there
are two parallel circuits

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.360
that are important for establishing bonds,

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.340
and that this is set up
very early on in childhood.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.480
And that it's neither emotional
nor rational, but both.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.230
Now both of these circuits
tap into the circuitry

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.480
that we talked about earlier,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.620
where dopamine is released
and molecules like serotonin,

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.140
which again is a neuromodulator

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:53.410
more associated with
feelings of warmth, comfort,

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.790
and satisfaction with our
immediate surroundings

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.030
and possessions rather
than seeking of things

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.250
and motivation and drive
to go look for things,

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.870
as is the case with dopamine.

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:04.460
So there's still interactions
with those systems,

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.330
but the work of Allan
Schore has stimulated

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:10.670
a lot of interest in what are the circuits

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:13.149
that underlie this autonomic bonding,

01:03:13.149 --> 01:03:17.630
this matching of heart rate and breathing,

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:19.410
and what are the neural circuits

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.778
that underlie this bonding
or this synchronization

01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:26.560
of experience on the
kind of left brain side.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.020
And the reason I find
this model so attractive

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.688
is that it's very clear that
healthy child-parent bonds

01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:36.150
are established, but
not by one or the other

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:39.130
of these right brainer left
brain systems, but by both.

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:42.060
And there isn't enough time
to go into it right now,

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.940
but some of you are probably
familiar with this idea

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.800
of anxious attached
versus avoidant attached

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.153
versus there's a kind
of dissociative attached

01:03:50.153 --> 01:03:55.100
model of infant parent
bonding, just briefly.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.310
What's becoming clear
from the neuro-biological

01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:58.530
imaging studies

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:03.200
is that as people start to
advance into adolescence

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.770
and adulthood and well
into their elderly years,

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.730
the same circuits that were active

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:11.440
and established in childhood

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.870
are repurposed for other
forms of attachment.

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.100
And that to have truly complete bonds

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.010
with other individuals,

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.590
but in particular with romantic partners,

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:24.080
it's important that there
be both synchronization

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.180
of physiology and
synchronization of these more,

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.250
I guess we could call them more rational

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.590
or predictive type circuits.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.040
So we can leverage this information,

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.920
we can start to think
about what sorts of bonds

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.910
to us feel very enriching
and very complete.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.190
We know that we can have,

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:44.050
for instance, an emotional
connection with somebody,

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.460
but we can also have a cognitive
connection with somebody.

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.670
I have many colleagues with
whom I have deep intellectual

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.800
connection and convergence with.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.040
I won't say that I have
deep emotional connection

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.210
with most of them, a few of them, yes,

01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.403
but most of them no.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.190
Others in my life, for instance,

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.850
I have a deep emotional connection to,

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.380
but not a lot of deep
cognitive connection to.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.710
A good example would be the connection

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.088
that I had with my bulldog,

01:05:11.088 --> 01:05:12.620
who unfortunately passed away.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.810
But Costello, we had a very close,

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:17.670
emotional connection, right?

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.540
It was based on touch, it
was based on our walks,

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.750
it was based on fun,
it was very autonomic.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.910
We rarely discussed if
ever what we were doing,

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.940
we had a felt relationship

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.040
as opposed to a cognitive relationship.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.760
And while I'm sort of
half kidding about that,

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.620
as an example, it's a really good example,

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.320
it was a very real bond.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.260
And in fact, just as a brief anecdote,

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.090
I can remember when Costello was a puppy

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:43.033
and I was entirely responsible
for his well-being,

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:45.800
like any parent of any infant,

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.490
I lost my appetite for those few weeks

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:49.810
when I was house training him

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:52.290
and I seem to lose all ability

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.100
to process any cognitive information.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.670
Now I was also sleep deprived,

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:58.892
but I was entirely focused
on the autonomic bond

01:05:58.892 --> 01:06:00.170
that we were forming.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.340
And now, thankfully,

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.810
that eventually was
established pretty quickly.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:06.125
Basically I went on to
just basically feed him,

01:06:06.125 --> 01:06:08.520
walk him and do everything for him,

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.790
and we had a wonderful relationship.

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:12.760
Now it's very clear that
what we're talking about here

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.223
is a form of empathy.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.270
Empathy is the ability to feel,

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:21.620
or at least think we
feel what others feel.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.180
Because again, as my colleague
and the great bioengineer

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.750
and psychiatrist at Stanford,
Karl Deisseroth has said,

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.563
and he was a guest on this podcast.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.480
We really don't know
how other people feel,

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.530
we just get the sense that
perhaps we are feeling

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.363
the same thing

01:06:36.363 --> 01:06:38.150
or we're feeling something
different and we infer,

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.250
or we project what they might be thinking.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.356
Empathy is this sense that we are sensing

01:06:44.356 --> 01:06:46.207
what other people are sensing, okay.

01:06:46.207 --> 01:06:48.100
And there's no real way to verify that

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.700
except if you're measuring physiologies,

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.660
you could get some insight into that.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:52.810
In the clinical psychology

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.970
and in the neuro-biological
literature now,

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:59.380
it's understood that there
is both emotional empathy,

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.450
like actually feeling
what somebody is feeling

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:04.740
and what is now called cognitive empathy.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.260
Cognitive empathy is this idea

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.950
that we both see and experience something

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:11.630
the same way at a mental level,

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.340
emotional empathy is this idea

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.087
that yes, I can feel what you feel

01:07:15.087 --> 01:07:19.830
at a visceral sematic or autonomic level.

01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:23.745
And it's absolutely clear
that strong social bonds

01:07:23.745 --> 01:07:26.720
between children and caretaker

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.540
involve both emotional empathy,

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.280
this autonomic function
and cognitive empathy,

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.410
that there's a mutual understanding

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:36.010
of how the other person feels

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.350
and how the other person thinks

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:39.880
in order to be able to make predictions

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.250
about what they're going to do.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.120
It's also very clear based
on the emerging literature,

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.770
that romantic relationships,

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.690
and to some extent, friendships,

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:50.120
although friendships have
been explored a bit less

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.240
in the literature,

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.130
that emotional empathy
and cognitive empathy

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.700
are both required in order to establish

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.920
what we call a trusting social bond.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.010
And there's some
beautiful experiments done

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:04.020
using neuroimaging of two
individuals playing a trust game,

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.790
essentially a game where
you're trying to predict

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:06.880
the other person's behavior,

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.090
whether or not they will
behave in a trustworthy way.

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.189
And these experiments
tend to use real money,

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:14.110
so there's actually something at stake,

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:15.790
and you can more or less predict

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:17.650
whether or not somebody feels

01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:19.240
a lot of trust for somebody else

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.450
and whether or not they believe

01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:23.040
they will act in a trustworthy manner

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.110
based on whether or not
they have high levels

01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:28.380
of both cognitive empathy
and emotional empathy.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.720
So for those of you that are seeking

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.030
to establish deeper bonds
or bonds of any kind,

01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:34.030
it's important that you think

01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:36.170
about synchronization of bodily states,

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.700
we talked about that earlier,

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.110
and synchronization of cognitive states.

01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:41.820
Now that doesn't mean you
have to agree on everything.

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.920
In fact, oftentimes
people who feel very close

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.730
to one another cognitively and emotionally

01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:48.980
argue about all sorts of things

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.250
and disagree about a lot of things.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:51.549
In fact, we probably know,

01:08:51.549 --> 01:08:54.100
I certainly know people and couples

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.120
that seem to bond through arguing,

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.080
which is an interesting
phenotype in itself.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.740
But the point isn't that
there'd be total convergence

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.390
of opinion or stance,

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:06.510
but rather that we understand
how the other feels

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.130
and we believe that they
understand how we feel,

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:11.420
that we understand how
the other person thinks

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:15.260
and that they think that we
understand how they think.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.580
So it's a reciprocal
loop between two people

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.570
that involves this cognition
and involves emotion,

01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:24.070
and it's grounded as Dr.
Schore has pointed out

01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:26.290
in our earliest forms of attachment.

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.850
And that makes perfect sense

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:29.510
because the same sorts of circuits

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:32.300
that are responsible
for social homeostasis,

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.890
the kind of right brain
and left brain circuits

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:37.260
that are responsible for
infant-mother attachment,

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.392
and then later for more intellectual

01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:41.230
or predictive type attachments

01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:43.390
between child and caregiver,

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.950
are the exact same circuits
that we superimpose

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.020
into all other types of relationships

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.840
throughout the rest of our life.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.240
And I should just mention
that for those of you

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.240
that might be thinking that you
had a less than satisfactory

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.670
infant-caretaker interaction
or form of attachment,

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:02.750
you are not alone.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.760
And in fact, much of the work
that Dr Schore focuses on

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.460
is about how those early circumstances

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.570
can be understood and rewired

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:13.150
toward the development of
healthy adult attachment.

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:15.050
And if you want to check out his work,

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:18.240
he's actually got a few
YouTube videos out there,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.390
again, it's Allan Schore,
spelled S-C-H-O-R-E,

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:23.390
I'd love to get him as
a guest on the podcast.

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.300
He also has a book it's called
"Right Brain Psychotherapy."

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.440
And it's an excellent book,

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.590
it's actually pretty accessible

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:29.730
even if you don't have a background

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:32.400
in biology or psychology,

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.290
I found it to be very interesting,

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:36.090
there are a lot of excellent references.

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:37.837
And again, if you're listening Dr. Schore

01:10:37.837 --> 01:10:38.950
or, you know, Allan Schore,

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:41.040
we'd love to get you on the podcast.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.820
One of the key themes to understand

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.630
about biological processes

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:47.003
is that they often work
on short timescales

01:10:47.003 --> 01:10:48.760
and longer timescales.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.450
And up until now, we've
mainly been talking

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:52.790
about the stuff that
happens on short timescales.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.700
So the kind of
synchronization of heart rate

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.810
or activation of a given set of neurons

01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:57.830
that dumps some dopamine

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.130
and causes us to seek out
more social interaction

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:02.820
or less for instance.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.780
But every biological circuit and function

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.800
needs to have longstanding
effects as well.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.970
And typically when you're thinking

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:12.410
about longstanding effects
in the brain and body,

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:14.370
you start looking towards
the hormone system.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.350
It's not always the case,

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:16.980
but more often than not

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.950
neuro-transmitters and
neuromodulators are pretty quick,

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:22.180
whereas hormones have
longer lasting effects.

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.827
In fact, a lot of hormones
can actually travel

01:11:23.827 --> 01:11:25.280
to the nucleus of a cell

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.100
and actually change which
genes are expressed.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:32.190
So if ever there was a hormone
or hormone-like molecule

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:35.970
that's associated with social
bonding, it's oxytocin,

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:39.200
and oxytocin has gotten a ton of interest

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.470
in the popular press.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.560
I don't know why that is,

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.580
but perhaps it's because of
all the incredible things

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.270
that oxytocin is associated with.

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:48.760
And it is indeed a lot of things.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.520
So for instance, oxytocin
is released in the brain

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.600
and binds to receptors in
different locations in the body,

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.230
and the moment you hear
different locations

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.970
in the body receptors, you should think,

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:01.710
well, it's going to have
lots of different effects.

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:02.870
And indeed it does.

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.840
Oxytocin is involved in orgasm,

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.530
it's involved in social recognition.

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.000
That's right, when you see people

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.940
that you consider your people,

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.410
your team, your group, your
friends, oxytocin is released.

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:19.700
Even if you don't come into
physical contact with them.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.220
Oxytocin is also associated
with pair bonding,

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.504
the feeling that they are your person,

01:12:24.504 --> 01:12:26.317
and that you are their person,

01:12:26.317 --> 01:12:28.630
is the common language people use.

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:31.490
It's also associated with honesty.

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:32.750
Believe it or not, there are experiments

01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:35.236
that show that if people receive oxytocin

01:12:35.236 --> 01:12:37.350
through an inhalation spray,

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.640
that they will be more honest

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.880
and forthcoming about certain things.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.359
And the oxytocin system and
variants in the oxytocin system

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.287
have also been associated with autism

01:12:46.287 --> 01:12:48.710
and various autism spectrum disorders.

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:50.420
So there's a huge range of behaviors

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.430
that's involved in
because you have receptors

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:54.770
for oxytocin in lots of
different brain structures

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.840
and areas of the body
that do different things.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.640
However, there's some very
consistent effects of oxytocin

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.030
that are worth just listing off,

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:04.060
and then I'm going to talk
about two separate pathways

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.772
by which oxytocin can
manifest its effects,

01:13:06.772 --> 01:13:09.430
and how you can actually regulate oxytocin

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:13.270
in ways that are interesting
and perhaps useful as well.

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:16.190
First of all, oxytocin
is involved in the milk,

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.430
let down reflex, lactation.

01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:19.460
This makes perfect sense,

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.760
there needs to be a cue by which

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.600
the suckling on the nipple of the infant

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.090
causes the release or let down of milk,

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:28.460
and milk let down and lactation

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.500
is controlled by
prolactin, another hormone,

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.913
but also oxytocin.

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.230
Oxytocin is also involved
in uterine contraction

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:38.350
during childbirth,

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.940
it's involved in cervical dilation

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.550
to allow the baby to pass
out of the birth canal.

01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:47.700
So it's involved in induction
of breastfeeding and of labor,

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.230
which is remarkable and
especially remarkable

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:52.620
given that in males or at
least in some male animals

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.780
and in some male humans,

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.880
and I do want to say some,
and I'll get back to this,

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.200
it can be involved in
the erection response,

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.120
it can be involved in the orgasm response

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.460
in both males and females.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.810
Although there there's a
very interesting difference.

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:06.540
There's a little bit of
controversy about this,

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.683
but it does appear that in females,

01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:15.169
sexual and orgasm cause
the release of oxytocin,

01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:17.630
whereas in males, sexual stimulation

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:19.377
does not cause the release of oxytocin,

01:14:19.377 --> 01:14:22.350
but rather a different
molecule vasopressin

01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:24.970
is triggered by sexual stimulation,

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:27.870
but orgasm does trigger the
release of oxytocin in males,

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:31.090
but with a delay of about 30 minutes.

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:34.170
Why that is in the specific
function of that is not clear,

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.480
but it does seem the oxytocin is involved

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.420
in the sexual response in
both males and females.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.510
The main types of interactions
that release oxytocin

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:45.280
at high levels are first of all,

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.642
that the interaction between individuals

01:14:47.642 --> 01:14:52.630
that see each other as very
closely associated, right?

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.327
So a infant and mother are
very closely associated

01:14:55.327 --> 01:14:57.550
whether or not it's an
adopted infant or not.

01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:59.050
Oftentimes they are in close contact,

01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:01.900
oftentimes they are from
the very body of the other.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.360
And so the amount or the
amplitude of oxytocin

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.000
released tends to scale

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.430
with how closely
associated individuals are

01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:11.560
just the sight of one's
baby or smell of one's baby

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:15.080
can evoke oxytocin release and
vice versa from the mother.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.380
Physical contact, even more
so in romantic partners.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.680
Physical contact,

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.010
even the sight of a picture of a partner

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:27.670
can evoke oxytocin release
and sexual desire also trust.

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:29.670
So there's this whole
collection of psychological

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:31.910
and physiological things that are packaged

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:34.130
into the oxytocin system.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:36.610
It's not just a one way system.

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.160
Now, a lot of people out there

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.350
have written to me asking
about inhaling oxytocin,

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:43.760
asking whether or not
that can actually increase

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.140
the depth or rate of pair bonding.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.410
And there does seem to be
some evidence for that.

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:51.270
Now, I think in most places,
oxytocin is prescription,

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.760
although it might be
over-the-counter and others,

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.550
I don't know, you have
to check where you are

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:56.930
as far as I know you can't just go out

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.850
and buy oxytocin nasal spray,

01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:59.830
although you may be able to,

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.910
forgive me, I'm naive to that point.

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:05.478
But it's interesting
to note that some drugs

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.690
that are being used in clinical trials

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:08.860
for things like trauma,

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.540
and are also used in
clinical therapeutic settings

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.580
for increasing bonding,
in particular MDMA,

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.893
also called ecstasy,

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.840
increase dopamine and
serotonin, we know this,

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.657
dopamine and serotonin have
a vast number of effects

01:16:22.657 --> 01:16:23.940
throughout the brain and body

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.280
that I've talked about some of them today

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.660
and another podcast.

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:31.070
But one of the lesser
appreciated effects of MDMA

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.240
is that it causes huge increases,

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.620
massive increases in
the amount of oxytocin

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.160
that's released into the brain and body.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.210
And MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
while still illegal,

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.120
as far as I know,

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.090
certainly in the United States,

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:45.830
but in most places throughout the world,

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:47.840
is being explored in clinical trials,

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.930
not just for trauma,

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:51.020
not just for depression, not
just for eating disorders,

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.410
but also for reestablishing

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:56.510
what seemed to be fractured
or challenged bonds

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.940
between romantic partners.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.130
And while most of the
attention has been focused

01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.831
on the dopaminergic and serotonergic

01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:05.570
aspects of the MDMA response,

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:08.090
it's clear to me, based on
my read of the literature,

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.950
that the enormously elevated oxytocin

01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:14.430
that occurs during the consumption of MDMA

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.460
is part of the reason why people

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:20.850
experience during the MDMA
session and post MDMA session,

01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:24.660
a much greater degree and depth of kinship

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.750
or feeling of connection with that person.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.420
And it's important to point out

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.780
that that feeling of connection
is of the autonomic type

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.080
that I was referring to
earlier, al Allan Schore's work.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.906
That it's not of the,
oh, we think about things

01:17:36.906 --> 01:17:38.260
the exact same way,

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.600
we agree on everything now,

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.310
it's more of that their
physiologies are synchronized.

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:47.210
So much so that even in
individuals within a couple

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:50.920
where one does a therapeutic
session and the other does not,

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.090
they still both feel quite
more bonded to the other.

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:56.610
Now, oftentimes in the
clinical therapeutic setting,

01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:59.390
both members of a couple
or romantic partnership,

01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:03.860
whatever form it may
take or consuming MDMA

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.679
and then thereby experiencing
elevated oxytocin

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:09.630
and this enhanced sense of bonding,

01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.450
and again, it's this autonomic bonding,

01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.700
but it's so powerful.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.880
Meaning the oxytocin
response is so powerful

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.870
that it doesn't even require
that both individuals

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:21.140
experienced this user
inflection and oxytocin,

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.297
and that's because one person's physiology

01:18:23.297 --> 01:18:24.940
is influencing the other,

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.410
and oxytocin is this
kind of bridging signal

01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:30.130
that occurs in both nervous systems,

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:31.810
synchronizes things like heartbeat,

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.843
obviously it's associated with touch.

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:35.500
And so if people are touching

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.160
or people are engaging
in the sorts of behaviors

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:37.993
that I mentioned earlier,

01:18:37.993 --> 01:18:40.740
that can increase oxytocin further,

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.310
that's going to further
increase the depth of the bond.

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:47.170
But the point here is that
there's actually a hormonal glue

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:50.130
between individuals,
okay, infant and mother,

01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:53.800
friends, teammates, romantic
partners, and so on.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.850
And that hormonal glue is oxytocin.

01:18:56.850 --> 01:19:00.610
Now people vary in the
extent to which they feel

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:04.380
or have the capacity to
feel bonded to anyone.

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:07.320
And it is now generally understood

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.410
that some of that variation

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:12.880
might depend on variations
in oxytocin receptors

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.040
or what are called gene
polymorphisms for oxytocin.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.530
Genes can have a number of
different sequences in them,

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:19.750
they're nucleotide sequences,

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.310
we won't go into genetics right now,

01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:23.810
As and Gs and Cs and Ts
in various combinations

01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:24.790
are what make up the genes.

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:27.540
Genes are transcribed into RNA,

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:32.540
RNA is translated into proteins
that affect cells, okay?

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:35.810
The oxytocin gene encodes for oxytocin

01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:38.700
and variants in that
gene change the amount

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.610
and function of oxytocin.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.820
There's a really interesting study

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.680
published just this last year
in a relatively new journal,

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.840
the journal has a kind of a
unusual name it's Heliyon,

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.400
I think it's Heliyon and not hellion,

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.690
but Heliyon, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N.

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:55.450
This is a Cell Press journal,

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:57.840
as far as I can tell,
it's a very solid journal,

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.490
certainly the Cell Press
label is very stringent.

01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:04.100
And this paper is entitled,

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.062
The Relation Between Oxytocin Receptor

01:20:06.062 --> 01:20:07.750
Gene Polymorphisms,

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:12.150
which just means changes in
genes or variations in genes,

01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:15.350
Adult Attachment and
Instagram Sociability,

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:16.690
and Exploratory Analysis.

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:18.040
This is a really wild study,

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.880
but I liked the study, It's very thorough.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.960
First author, last name,
Carollo, C-A-R-O-L-L-O.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.890
And what they found was that by analyzing

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.980
the genetics of different individuals

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:32.130
who are on social media,

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:36.850
and looking at how many people
those individuals follow

01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:39.740
and how many people follow them,

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.130
and what they come up with

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:44.120
is a so-called social desirability index,

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.850
they were able to correlate
in a very straightforward way

01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:51.580
that people that carry certain
variants in the oxytocin

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:56.290
and oxytocin receptor genes
actually seek out more online,

01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.900
social Instagram interactions.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:02.010
So some people I know, I
won't name their names,

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:05.700
only follow, you know, anywhere
from zero to six accounts,

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.790
other people follow thousands of accounts

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:11.800
and they take the ratio of how
many accounts people follow

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.740
versus how many followers they have,

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.280
arguably not a perfect measure,

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.440
but a nice one in the
sense that you can do this

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.270
in a completely unbiased way

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:21.650
with many, many thousands of subjects.

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.420
And then they were able
to get genomic analysis

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.840
from a number of these subjects.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.140
And it turns out that people who have,

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:33.080
let's say higher levels
of oxytocin function

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.060
or potential levels of oxytocin function,

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:41.030
actively seek out more social
interactions on social media.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.350
So this, I think represents
an important first

01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:46.430
in the area of how social media
and data from social media

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:49.090
are starting to merge with biological data

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.530
in terms of predicting how
avidly people will seek out

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:55.180
social interactions of an online type.

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.979
And nowadays, we hear
a lot about how online,

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:00.560
we are connected but we're not really...

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.810
What is it? We're communicating

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:02.720
but we're not connected

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.250
or the connections aren't real.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:06.090
I think we're going to
need to revisit that.

01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:08.010
While I'm certainly a believer in the idea

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.560
that face-to-face communication

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.410
and common interactions with people

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.130
standing in the same space

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.660
or playing sports together,
enjoying music together,

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:18.930
enjoying meals together
is vitally important,

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:21.040
there's an entire generation,

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.050
or several generations of people

01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:25.720
that are coming up who
much of their social

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.320
interaction has been online.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.580
And if you think about it,

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.020
all of the things that
we've spelled out earlier

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.600
about common mental narrative,

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.790
this left-brain system al Allan Schore,

01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:39.940
or autonomic bonding or
synchronization of heartbeats

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.270
according to common stories,

01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:44.500
all that is happening in
online social interactions.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.790
When a thousand of us

01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:48.400
look at the exact same Instagram post,

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.970
yes, we will have a thousand
independent responses to that,

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:54.940
but chances are many of us
have a similar or same response

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.880
based on the data that
we talked about earlier

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.380
in synchronization of heartbeats.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.370
And so we are socially
bonded with other people

01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:02.680
through social media,

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.530
and it's very apparent
that the oxytocin system

01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:07.660
is playing some role in that.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:10.155
And this, if we zoom
out makes perfect sense,

01:23:10.155 --> 01:23:15.155
because again, dopamine,
serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:18.670
none of these systems were placed in us

01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:23.100
or are organized within us in
order to encourage specific

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.870
and only specific types
of social interactions.

01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:28.060
The one that we can say
is absolutely critical

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.380
is the child-parent interaction, right?

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.150
Because children simply can't
take care of themselves,

01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:33.210
they need a caretaker.

01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:35.150
I should have said caretaker, not parent.

01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:38.570
But infants, if they're
not taken care of will die.

01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:41.210
But beyond that, we have evolved

01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:43.610
or come to realize many different types

01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:44.750
of social interactions,

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:47.814
and online interactions
nowadays are very, very common.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:49.270
I'm certainly involved in them,

01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:50.640
I'm guessing you're
involved in them as well,

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.710
we're involved in one
right now, for example.

01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:56.870
The oxytocin system is
absolutely threaded through

01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:59.490
and largely responsible for those types

01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:01.360
of social bonds as well.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.560
And incidentally, "Oxytocin" is the name

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.000
of the fifth song on Billie Eilish's

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.130
second album, "Happier Than Ever."

01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:09.210
So we've covered a lot about the biology

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.460
and indeed the neural
circuitry and neurochemistry

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.260
and neuroendocrinology of social bonding.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.760
I want to make sure that I
highlight the key features

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:21.180
that go into any and all
of your social bonds.

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:24.350
First of all, all social
bonds have the potential

01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:27.280
to include both what we
call emotional empathy

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.660
and cognitive empathy.

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.090
And so if you are
interested in establishing

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:34.030
and deepening social bonds of any kind,

01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:36.570
it's important that you put some effort

01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:39.410
towards this thing that
we call emotional empathy,

01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:42.870
which is really about
sharing autonomic experience.

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:44.010
Now, depending on the relationship

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:45.300
that will take on different contexts,

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.060
what's appropriate in one type of bond

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.350
is not going to be appropriate
in another type of bond.

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.780
Physical contact for instance,

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.709
is appropriate for certain types of bonds

01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:54.640
and not for others.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.610
Nonetheless, emotional empathy

01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:59.810
and the synchronization
of autonomic function,

01:24:59.810 --> 01:25:02.110
heart rate breathing, et cetera,

01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.860
can be best accomplished
by paying attention

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:07.480
to external events in
particular narrative story music

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.070
and perhaps sports or
other types of experience

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:12.810
as an external stimulus to drive synchrony

01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:15.230
of those internal states.

01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:19.000
The other aspect of forming
deep bonds is cognitive empathy.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.567
Again, cognitive empathy is
not about agreeing on things

01:25:22.567 --> 01:25:25.060
or viewing things the exact same way,

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.430
it's about really gaining understanding

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:30.140
of how somebody else
thinks about something,

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.830
really paying attention to that,

01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:35.220
and then paying attention
to how you think about

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:36.770
and feel about something.

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:38.330
So that's what cognitive empathy is.

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:40.507
So emotional and
cognitive empathy together

01:25:40.507 --> 01:25:45.100
are what make up these really
robust bonds of various kinds.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.050
Now we also talked about
introversion and extroversion,

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:51.140
and I'd like to try and dismantle
the common misperceptions

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.010
about introversion extroversion

01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:55.710
because when we look at the
neural circuitry, as you recall,

01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.550
introverts are not people

01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:59.740
that don't like social interaction,

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.400
it's just that they
feel filled up or sated

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.610
by less social interaction
than would be an extrovert.

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:10.220
And that's because at least
according to the social

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.700
homeostasis circuit model,

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.650
they actually get more dopamine

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:15.463
from less social interaction.

01:26:15.463 --> 01:26:17.410
Okay, it's like somebody who is sated

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.350
by less amount of food.

01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:21.680
Okay, it doesn't mean they
don't have the same appetite,

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.410
it just means that they
get more from less.

01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:28.800
Whereas extroverts get
less dopamine release

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.350
from an equivalent amount
of social interaction.

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.210
And of course these aren't
precise measurements,

01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:36.560
but on the whole extroverts
need more social interaction,

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.510
more frequent, more
long-lasting, et cetera,

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.560
in order to achieve
that dopamine threshold,

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.840
because again, dopamine is driving

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.460
that craving of social interaction.

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.550
And once it's met, then people don't feel

01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:51.230
like they have to seek
social interaction as much.

01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:53.700
So for those of you that feel
as if you're an introvert

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.130
or extrovert or that know
introverts and extroverts,

01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:59.740
it's not about how verbal people are,

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.400
it's not about how much they seek out

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.460
social interactions per se,

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.290
it's about how much social interaction

01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:08.160
is enough for the given person.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.250
Now, the whole reason for
providing this framework,

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:12.840
this biological circuitry, et cetera,

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.790
is not to simply put a reductionist view

01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:18.240
on things that you
already realized and knew,

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.250
but rather to give you
some leverage points

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:23.380
to understand how is it
that you form social bonds?

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.670
How is it that you might be challenged

01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:26.620
in forming certain types of social bonds?

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:28.540
And to think about entry points,

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:29.750
to both establishing

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:32.660
and reinforcing social
bonds of different kinds.

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:36.690
Hopefully it will also give
you insight into why breakups,

01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:38.850
whether it be between
friendships or romantic partners

01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:40.650
can be so painful.

01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:43.240
A breakup of any kind
involves both a breaking

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.360
of that emotional empathy
and that cognitive empathy.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.201
And indeed it has a neuro-biological

01:27:49.201 --> 01:27:51.180
and hormonal underpinning, right?

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.350
We go into some sense, a social isolation,

01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:56.810
even if we're surrounded
by other types of people,

01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:59.620
if one of our major sources of oxytocin

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:01.910
or one of our major sources of dopamine

01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:03.770
suddenly is not around,

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:06.770
that is incredibly devastating
to a nervous system.

01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:08.968
And to borrow from the great psychologist

01:28:08.968 --> 01:28:11.640
and neurobiologist Lisa Feldman Barrett,

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.250
who says, you know, we
are not just individuals,

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:17.131
we are nervous systems
influencing other nervous systems

01:28:17.131 --> 01:28:19.380
and their nervous systems
are influencing us.

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.440
I think that's the right
way to think about it.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.420
So it should come as no surprise

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.440
that breakups of various
kinds are very challenging

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.670
regardless of what underlied that breakup,

01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:30.730
whether or not somebody's moving

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:32.350
or an actual decision of one person

01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:35.350
to leave the relationship
or both, et cetera.

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:39.190
On the more positive
side, largely biological,

01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:43.330
but to some extent, psychological
view of social bonding

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:46.561
will also allow you to
orient in this vast landscape

01:28:46.561 --> 01:28:48.700
that we call social bonds.

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.170
To understand why it is
perhaps that you seek out

01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:52.520
so many online interactions.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.920
Maybe you have the oxytocin polymorphism

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.700
that causes you to want
more, follow more accounts,

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.240
or interact more with
people and comment more,

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.790
respond to comments, who knows?

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.640
I'm also hoping that it
will allow you to get a lens

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.760
into how you can
strengthen the social bonds

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.110
that you want to strengthen,

01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:12.760
and to establish new social bonds

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.650
that you want to establish.

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.830
None of this has meant to manipulate

01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:19.970
or leverage social bonds
that wouldn't otherwise form,

01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:22.240
to the contrary, it's about identifying

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.520
what are the specific routes

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.180
by which social bonds are created

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.810
and allowing you, I
hope, to work with people

01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:34.570
that you feel challenged in
forming social bonds with,

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.580
or maybe deciding to completely divorce

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.190
from those social bonds entirely

01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:39.370
because there's absolutely no hope

01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:41.960
of ever forming emotional
or cognitive empathy.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.250
I certainly acknowledge that
that could be the case too.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.570
So there's both a light
and a dark and a gray zone

01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:48.660
to this entire thing that
we call social bonding.

01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:52.560
What is not graded, but
is absolute, as they say,

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.940
is that social bonds are vitally important

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:56.360
to us as a species,

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.870
whether or not they are at a
distance over social media,

01:29:58.870 --> 01:30:00.390
whether or not they
are in close proximity,

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:02.510
actual physical contact.

01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:04.040
Today, what I've really
tried to illustrate

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.280
is that there are a common set
of biological, neurochemical

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.930
and hormonal underpinnings to
what we call social bonding.

01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:15.049
And so while it is complex
and it is subjective,

01:30:15.049 --> 01:30:16.710
it involves the hierarchies,

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:19.250
it involves our previous upbringing,

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:22.050
it involves our goals, et cetera,

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:24.300
it is not infinitely complex,

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.870
and in that sense, it is tractable.

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:29.182
Hopefully I've offered you some leavers

01:30:29.182 --> 01:30:31.470
or some entry points under
which you can both understand

01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:33.140
and move towards social bonds

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.750
that would be more satisfying
and more gratifying for you.

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:38.020
That's certainly one of the goals.

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.560
The other one is that hopefully
if you are a clinician

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.480
or simply the friend that people go to,

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.820
or the family member that people go to

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:45.090
when they are challenged

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:47.620
through various challenges
and social bonds,

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.880
that you can start to perhaps pass along

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.832
some of the information as a
way of people understanding

01:30:53.832 --> 01:30:56.480
what they're going through
as they are breaking up,

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.240
but also as they are falling in love,

01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.900
as they are forming attachments,

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:01.820
and as they are being
challenged with attachments.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:04.360
That's my hope, and especially as you head

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.690
into the holidays and end of year,

01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:09.910
but also as it continues into 2022,

01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:11.450
I would hope that you
would take this knowledge

01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:12.860
and apply it in any of the ways

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.860
that you feel are meaningful
and adaptive for you.

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:18.350

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:48.530
mentioned at the beginning of the podcast,

01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:51.120
that's perhaps the best way
to support this podcast.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.790
And we have a Patreon, it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:56.520
And there you can support the podcast

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.130
at any level that you like.

01:31:58.130 --> 01:32:00.060
We didn't talk about
supplements on today's episode

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:03.650
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
but on many episodes we do.

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:05.650
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:07.990
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:10.900
for things like enhancing the
depth and quality of sleep,

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.670
for things like focus,
immune system, et cetera.

01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:16.670
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:20.860
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:22.630
The reason we partnered with Thorne

01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:24.870
is because thorn has the
highest levels of stringency

01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:27.150
in terms of the quality of the ingredients

01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:28.870
that they include in their supplements

01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:30.540
and the precision of the amounts

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.060
of the supplements that they include.

01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.390
This is not true for a lot of other

01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:35.610
supplement brands out there.

01:32:35.610 --> 01:32:37.460
Thorne is partnered with the Mayo Clinic,

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:38.610
with all the major sports teams,

01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:41.230
so there's tremendous
confidence in their stringency.

01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:44.830
Again, if you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:46.330
you can see all the
supplements that I take,

01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:48.510
you can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:50.198
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site,

01:32:50.198 --> 01:32:51.450
through that portal,

01:32:51.450 --> 01:32:54.080
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.220
that Thorne makes.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.070
If you're not already
following the Huberman Lab

01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:59.670
on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

01:32:59.670 --> 01:33:02.570
on Instagram, I regularly
teach short snippets

01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:04.680
about neuroscience and
neuroscience-related tools,

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.320
some of that information overlaps

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.570
with what's covered on the
podcast, often it does not.

01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:11.100
So check us out at Huberman Lab

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.370
on Instagram and on Twitter.

01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:15.430
And last, but certainly not least,

01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:17.601
thank you for your interest in science.

01:33:17.601 --> 01:33:20.184
