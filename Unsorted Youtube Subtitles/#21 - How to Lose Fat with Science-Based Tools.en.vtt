00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.410
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.983
for everyday life.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.610
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.700
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.260
This podcast is separate from
my teaching and research roles

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.300
at Stanford.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.600
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.010
about science and science related tools

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.790
to the general public.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.060
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.270
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.155
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.870
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.530
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.230
to help you better understand your body

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.630
and help you reach your health goals.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.710
I've been getting my blood
work done for many years now,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.140
and that's where the simple reason

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.010
that only through quality blood work,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.350
and now through the advent of DNA test

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.170
can one really get a clear picture

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.120
of what's going on with their health.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.060
Things like metabolic
factors and hormones,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.910
all the various triglycerides.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.620
These are things that can only be measured

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.210
from a quality blood test.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550
And now with DNA tests,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.260
you can get an additional window

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.900
into your current health status

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.890
and the trajectory of your health.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.100
What's really wonderful
about InsideTracker

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.190
is that you don't just get numbers back

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.640
about the specific levels
of various hormones

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.920
and metabolic factors,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.590
you also get a lot of information about

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.707
what you could or should do in
order to adjust those numbers

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:28.540
to put you on the course to better health.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.631
So for instance, it will
give recommendations

00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.550
about particular foods to eat or avoid,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.348
particular exercise regimens

00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:37.020
that you might want to adopt

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.610
and the frequency of those regimens

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.624
in order to move those markers
in the correct direction.

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:45.540
InsideTracker has also added a new feature

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.910
that makes tracking your progress

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.280
and analyzing your data even easier.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.670
For those of you that use
a Garmin fitness tracker

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.190
such as the Garmin watch,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.270
that's now compatible with their platform.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.070
So you can couple your
data from your Garmin

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.630
with your blood and DNA for
even more personalization

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.980
and insights on your health.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.990
However, if you don't
have a Garmin device,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.750
there's still a lot that you
can get from InsideTracker

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.860
and their tests.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.480

and use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.780
Today's podcast is also brought to us

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.820
by ExpressVPN.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.170
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.730
that keeps your data secure and private.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.930
It does that by routing
your internet activity

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.820
through their servers and encrypting it,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.730
so that no one can see or sell your data.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.340
I'm familiar with the effects
of not securing my data

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.173
well enough.

00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:49.090
A few years back I had
my bank accounts hacked.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.150
I don't know exactly how it
happened, but it happened.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.470
And it was a terrible amount of work

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.444
to have that reversed and secured.

00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:59.640
The great thing about ExpressVPN
is I don't even notice

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.473
that it's running.

00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:01.330
I have it on my computer,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
I turn it on anytime I work at home

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.770
or when traveling or in
a cafe airport anywhere,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.010
and it runs in the background,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830
it doesn't change anything
about the interface

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.880
with my computer or the wifi.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.670
It just secures my data and
it secures any information

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.260
about what I happen to be
searching for, et cetera.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.340
I don't feel like I have
anything particular to hide

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.430
except my bank account passwords
and things of that sort.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.480
But with ExpressVPN, it basically
makes everything secure,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.629
you can't be tracked and no one can access

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.850
or steal your data, which is terrific.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.800
So again, I use it when I'm
traveling and when I'm at home.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.020
If you want to start protecting
your internet activity

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.698
using ExpressVPN, you can go
to www.expressvpn.com/huberman

00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:44.610
and you'll get an extra three months free

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.810
on a one-year package.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.810
That's www.expressvpn.com/huberman
to get three months free

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.310
on any of their one-year packages.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.730
Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.050
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.090
mineral, probiotic drink,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.250
that gives you a total foundation
of vitamins and minerals

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.110
and probiotics to support
your health and wellbeing.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.350
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.030
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.760
I started using Athletic Greens

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.720
and I still use Athletic
Greens once or twice a day

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.560
because it's the simplest
and most straightforward way

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.290
to get my basis of
important vitamins, minerals

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.280
and probiotic taken care off.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.310
All of those things combined
to support various aspects

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.750
of my health,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.050
such as brain health, such as gut health.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.490
For instance, there's a
tremendous amount of evidence now

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.810
showing that probiotics support gut health

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.690
and that the gut brain access
is important for things like

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.200
focus and cognition, as
well as for immune function

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.940
and various aspects of physical
health, like metabolism.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.180
The list sort of goes on and on.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.170
With Athletic Greens,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.200
it has all these vitamins and minerals

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.560
and various other things
that are good for me,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.470
and I actually really
liked the way it tastes.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.840
So the way I use it is once a day,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.760
sometimes twice a day,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.790
I'll mix it up with water,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.910
I add a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.910
I think it tastes great without
the lemon or lime juice.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.630
But when I add that, it's
truly delicious to me.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.440
And I'll drink that
first thing in the day,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.060
mid-morning sometimes instead

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.270
and sometimes again in
the later afternoon.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.430
I'm able to drink Athletic
Greens late in the day

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.650
and not have it keep me awake.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.360
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.260
you can go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.940
and if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.840
They'll give you five free travel packs,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.580
which make mixing up Athletic Greens

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.010
while you're on the road,
really simple and easy.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.770
And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3+K2.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.980
Vitamin D3, as many of you know,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.320
you can get from the sun,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.340
but many people even if
they're already getting

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.730
a lot of sun exposure,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.130
still have vitamin D3
levels that are too low.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.900
And vitamin D3 is very important

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.770
for a huge number of
cardiovascular, immune,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.180
metabolic and other aspects of health.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.410
So once again, if you go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.210
you'll get the five travel packs

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.740
and a year supply of vitamin D3+K2.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.620
Today is the third episode
in our series of episodes

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.090
about physical and
athletic skill performance

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.120
and skill learning in general.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.970
And today we're going to talk
about the science of tools

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.570
for fat loss.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.030
And fat loss is something

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.620
that interests a large number of people.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.500
Many people want to lose fat,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.290
many people are athletes
who need to lose fat.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.890
And in general, we know that
having body fat percentages

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.600
that are too high is unhealthy for us.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.540
And most people struggle to lose fat.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.610
Most people struggled to
lose weight generally,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.060
but most people especially
struggled to lose body fat

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.460
or what we call adipose tissue.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.870
Now, this is a huge topic on the internet.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.870
There's a lot of controversy.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.270
Today, we're going to
talk about some things

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.540
related to fat loss,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.790
and that are powerful for fat loss

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.203
that I'm guessing most of you
have never heard about before.

00:06:57.203 --> 00:06:58.880
You may have heard about a few of them,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.240
but I'm guessing you haven't
heard about all of them.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.015
This episode is going to be
rich with science-based tools

00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:07.780
that are gleaned from a variety of aspects

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.613
of the literature,

00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:10.780
including the use of cold,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.480
including brown fat,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.510
including something called beige fat.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.580
We're going to talk about
something called NEAT.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.770
We're going to talk about all
sorts of aspects of fat loss

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.440
that are governed by your nervous system.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.720
And this is I think an important gap

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.267
that's missing in the
discussion about fat loss.

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:29.990
You can hear a lot of
information out there

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.460
about the role of things like insulin

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.560
and various diets like ketogenic diets

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.420
or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.140
And there's some great stuff out there,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.145
and there's some really
terrible information out there,

00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:42.930
and there's a lot of controversy.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.930
We did a number of episodes talking

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.140
about the role of hormones on metabolism

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.620
and the role of food
on mood and wellbeing.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.310
So if you're interested in those topics,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.620
please check them out.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.290
I will touch a little
bit on hormones today.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.240
Things like insulin and
leptin, just a little bit.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.280
But today's episode is mainly
going to be focused on,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.790
how the nervous system, neurons,

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.060
and some of the cells
they collaborate with,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.290
like glioma and macrophages,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.120
how those encourage or can
encourage accelerated fat loss.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.640
Because it turns out they can.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.930
Remember your nervous system
which includes your brain

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.540
and your spinal cord
and all the connections

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.480
that they make with
the organs of the body,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.860
governs everything.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.830
It's the on switch and the
off switch for immune system.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.570
It's the on switch and the off switch.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.680
It turns out also for fat burning.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.870
And so the nervous system
and the role of the brain

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.360
and other neurons has
been vastly overlooked

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.860
in the discussion about losing fat.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.470
Now, I would be remiss

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.770
and I'd probably come under
a pretty considerable attack,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.110
if I didn't just acknowledge upfront

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.970
a core truth of metabolic science

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.160
and also of neuroscience, frankly,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.480
which is that calories
in versus calories out,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.780
meaning how many calories you ingest,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.730
versus how many calories you burn

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.600
is the fundamental and
most important formula

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.182
in this business of fat loss

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:11.941
and weight management in general.

00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:14.260
There's simply no way around the fact

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.470
that if you ingest far more
calories than you burn,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.890
you're likely to gain weight.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.400
And a good portion of that weight

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.120
is likely to be adipose tissue fat.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.650
It's also true that if
you ingest fewer calories

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.500
than you burn,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.460
that you will lose weight,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.770
and that a significant portion

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.690
of that will come from body fat.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.530
What portion?

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.070
Depends on a number of factors.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.210
But that simple formula is important.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.110
On a previous episode, I
mentioned the complications

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.150
with the statements of
a calorie is a calorie.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.040
And indeed there is
evidence from for instance

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.310
Robert Lustig, who's a
pediatric endocrinologist

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.680
at UC San Francisco has talked

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.060
about how highly processed
foods change the way

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.513
that we utilize food,

00:09:57.513 --> 00:10:02.130
and can lead to higher
incidences of obesity

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.200
and other metabolic syndromes
that go against the idea

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.150
that a calorie is a calorie and that's it.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.970
So a calorie is a calorie
as a unit of energy,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.850
and we need to accept and
acknowledge this calories in,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.200
meaning calories ingested
versus calories burned formula.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.880
But the calories burn portion
is strongly influenced

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.840
by a number of things that you can control

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.980
that can greatly accelerate

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.880
or increase the amount of adipose tissue

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.810
or the proportion of adipose tissue

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.860
that you burn in response
to exercise and food.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.193
So your hormones are important.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.360
Your thermogenic milieu,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.600
meaning how warm or how cold your body is?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.500
How cold you make it,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.333
how warm you make it?

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:51.210
But also your level of metabolism.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.200
Your levels of thyroid hormone

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.920
and something that's
hardly ever discussed,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.330
but is well supported by
the scientific literature,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.050
how much innervation?

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.230
Meaning how much connectivity there is,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.830
between your nervous system and fat.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.340
Today, we're going to talk about the fact

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.180
that your body fat of various kinds,

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.500
and there are several kinds of body fat

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.730
are actually innervated by neurons.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.530
Neurons connect to your body fat

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.730
and can change the probability

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.260
that that body fat will be burned or not.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.410
So your nervous system
is the master controller

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.840
of this process,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.230
and it plays a strong
role in the calories out,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.220
the calories burned component.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.840
So as usual, we're going to
discuss a little bit of science.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.070
I promise I won't go
too deep into lipolysis

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.429
and all sorts of things
related to fat oxidation.

00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:43.740
We're going to break down that process

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.730
into two important steps.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.410
And if you can understand
those two important steps

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.480
then the rest of the tools
will be very straightforward

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.520
to understand and manage.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.240
And I do believe that
today you will walk away

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.860
with many new tools that
you could incorporate

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.200
into any kind of fat loss regimen

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.560
that will greatly accelerate that process,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.473
because it's grounded in
quality peer-reviewed science.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.490
Throughout the episode,

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.980
I'm going to talk about
some behavioral tools.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.430
In fact, I'll mostly talk
about behavioral tools.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.500
I will also talk about
compound, supplements.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.440
Many of you are into supplements.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.220
Some of you aren't, and that's fine.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.210
For those of you that
are into supplements,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.360
an important issue in a
discussion about supplements

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.680
for fat loss or otherwise
is going to be the quality

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.460
of those supplements and the accuracy

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.340
about what's in those
supplement bottles and tablets,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.640
et cetera.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.620
I usually mention this at
the end of the podcast,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.900
but this podcast we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.380
Because Thorne we believe
has the highest levels

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.680
of stringency in terms of
the quality of the compounds

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.350
in their supplements and the
amounts of those compounds.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.070
If you want to see the supplements I take,

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.440
you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.180
You can see the supplements that I take,

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.090
that will also allow you to get 20% off

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.240
any of those supplements,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.300
or 20% off any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.620
Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.996
and all the major sports teams.

00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:13.080
So there's a very strong
basis for their stringency.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.260
Again, you don't need to use supplements.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.800
I'm certainly not encouraging
anyone to use supplements

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.220
if that's not your thing,

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.560
but if you're going to use supplements,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.970
make sure that your supplement source

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.170
is one a very high quality.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.900
With that said, I want to get started

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.870
and talk about the
various tools for fat loss

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.463
and how neuroscience,
neurons control fat loss.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.540
Before I do that,

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.270
I want to set the context correctly

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.660
and extract some of the key takeaways

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.340
from previous episodes,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.150
because if your foundation of health

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.800
and your foundation of hormones

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.520
and your foundation of
metabolism isn't right,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.830
it's going to be very hard to get the most

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.853
out of any kind of exercise
or fat loss protocol.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.640
In previous episodes, I
talked all about the science

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.310
and the details going
into particular protocols.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.600
We don't have time to do that now,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.270
and I want to get to the new material.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.010
However, there are a couple bins,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.120
a couple items that you should make sure

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.560
you're getting correctly.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.890
And if you're not perfect about
these, don't worry about it,

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.490
most people are not perfect about them,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.400
I'm certainly not perfect about them.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.790
But we should all be
striving to get quality

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.300
and sufficient sleep.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.240
I did four full episodes on sleep

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.980
and how to get better at sleeping

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.870
through things like light
exposure, temperature,

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.750
timing your sleep correctly
for your so-called chronotype,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.220
if you're a night owl or a morning person.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.160
That's the first four
or I think five episodes

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.790
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.900
Get your sleep right,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.700
get your light exposure right,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.490
avoid bright light in your eyes

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.490
at times you wanted to be asleep,

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.310
and get bright light in your eyes

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.970
at times you want to be awake.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.600
So get your sleep right.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.960
The other thing is essential fatty acids.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.700
I talked about this in
the food and mood episode,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.680
but I also talked about it
during the hormones episodes.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.160
We need fatty acids.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.950
They are vital to so many
aspects of our health.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.710
You don't have to get
them from supplements.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.610
You can, if you want to,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.410
but you need to get them from your food.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.660
They are essential.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.970
There's a reason there's an
E the essential part there.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.803
Of the fatty acids,

00:15:12.803 --> 00:15:14.500
there are multiple kinds,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.170
but for the antidepressant effects

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.260
where the levels of fatty acids
that will promote good mood

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.130
and also healthy metabolism

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.580
and we'll start to shift the
needle in the right direction

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.930
on bloodborne cardiovascular factors.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.310
The key thing is to get the levels of EPA

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.650
that you ingest above
1000 milligrams per day.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.970
So that doesn't mean just
taking a thousand milligrams

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.640
or more of say fish oil or krill oil

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.570
or whatever your preferred source is.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.190
It means getting above a
thousand milligrams of EPA

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.530
which may require that you
ingest more essential fatty acids

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.216
than just a thousand milligrams per day.

00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:55.700
That of course can be
done through food sources,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.040
things like fatty fish,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.480
or if you're not into eating fish,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.740
you've quality meats that
are grass raised can do that.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.280
There are other sources
of essential fatty acids,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.750
of course also from plant sources.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.060
So look, those up online.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.350
It's really easy to find.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.390
But the research and the literature shows

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.190
that you want to get above
a thousand milligrams

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.850
of EPA per day,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.390
because that's when you can
best support your metabolism

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.860
and position yourself for good fat loss.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.070
As well for people who
have cravings issues,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.440
they crave sweets all the time,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.020
I talked about this in
the gut-brain episode

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.300
and hormones and food.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.270
That you have neurons in
your gut that are craving,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.350
they're seeking essential fatty acids

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.400
and they're craving and seeking
amino acids from your food.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.200
Now, these are not supplements
that they crave per se,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.430
they're craving those things

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.130
because that's what your body
needs and your brain needs.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.330
But those same neurons
will respond to sugars.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.890
And so many people who are craving sugar

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.510
can satisfy that sugar
craving by giving the neurons

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.730
so to speak what they actually want,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.280
which are amino acids and
essential fatty acids.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.700
That includes EPA, but
also things like glutamine

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.740
and amino acid that can
really reduce sugar cravings

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.140
if you take a teaspoon of that,

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.310
or even a tablespoon of
that a few times a day.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.610
You have to ease into that a little bit,

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.760
because some people can get
a little bit of GI distress

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.160
from too much glutamine.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.500
But glutamine has also been
shown to improve symptoms

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.490
of leaky gut.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.330
It's a powerful amino acid.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.240
And yes, you can also get it from food.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.140
Things like cottage cheese are
high in glutamine, et cetera.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.880
And then finally you can't
really position yourself

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.560
to have a strong metabolism
if your iodine levels

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.393
aren't correct,

00:17:33.393 --> 00:17:35.410
and your thyroid levels aren't correct.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:36.790
You can overdo iodine.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.310
So you don't want to do that.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.920
A lot of table salt
has iodine added to it,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.720
but some people need to add iodine,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.670
by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera..

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.827
But one of the best ways to
support the thyroid system

00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:50.340
and metabolism in general,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.240
is to make sure you're
getting enough selenium.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.840
Sometimes called selenium each day.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.920
Simple way to do that is to ingest

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.730
the highest concentration of selenium food

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.630
that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts,

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.580
one or two or three of those per day.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.030
You'll have more than enough selenium

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.460
to meet the thyroid needs.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.940
You don't want your
selenium to be too high,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.960
you don't want a diet
too high in anything.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.610
So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.360
glutamine if you have
issues with leaky gut

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.050
or sugar cravings can really help.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.980
Get your gut microbiome, right?

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.160
I may have missed saying that,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.130
but get your gut microbiome right.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.520
That does not necessarily mean

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.530
you need to ingest probiotics.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.080
You can, if you want to,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.850
but you can also just
simply ingest a serving

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.850
or two of fermented foods per day,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.100
that can greatly assess.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.650
So things like sauerkraut, kimchi,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.550
every culture has a different source

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.450
or sources of fermented foods,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.430
those can really help the gut microbiome,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.590
and then make sure that
your thyroid hormone

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.870
is supported through the ingestion

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.000
of sufficient iodine not too much

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.420
and sufficient selenium, not too much.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.253
Okay?

00:18:55.253 --> 00:18:58.030
Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods,

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.080
iodine and selenium.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.650
That sets the basis for how things

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.400
like exercise, cold and
some of the compounds

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.830
and other things that we're
going to talk about today

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.580
that are I'm guessing going
to be truly new to many of you

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.040
that can really increase the
burn factor in the equation

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.010
of calories in versus calories burned.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.870
Okay?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.750
So on the one hand we have
this reality of calories in,

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.990
versus calories burned.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.070
However, I would also be
remiss if I didn't mention

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.530
an incredible study that
was done by my colleague,

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.650
Alia Crum at Stanford.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.120
She's a faculty member,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.770
professor in the psychology department.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.840
Looking at how belief affects,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.170
just thinking can impact
the effects of things

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.500
like exercise on weight loss.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.630
These are just incredible results.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.420
What they did was they took subjects

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.070
who were hotel service people
that would clean the hotels

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.390
and come in and change
the linens and so forth.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.260
Divide them into two groups.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.350
One group, they were told moving around

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.030
and doing your duties for your job,

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.310
meet the standards for US
guidelines for activity

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.840
and movement, et cetera.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.420
And a basic lecture about how movement

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.930
is good for you, et cetera.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.800
But mostly just that
their daily activities

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.620
met the standards for the US.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.910
The other group, however, was
given a bunch of information

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.647
about how movement and their daily routine

00:20:29.647 --> 00:20:32.670
was very good for cardiovascular health,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.900
it could be good for
weight loss, et cetera.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.530
And then they tracked these subjects

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.810
over a period of many weeks.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.320
The take home message from this study

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.060
was that simply being told
that movement is good for you

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.650
can lead to weight loss, et cetera.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.780
Led to significantly more body fat loss,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.290
waist-to-hip ratio
changes in the direction

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.800
that most people would want.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.630
But essentially a slimming
down, if you will.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.620
And all sorts of other positive effects

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.390
on things like cardiovascular health.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.350
Simply by the knowledge
that movement and exercise

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.800
can help various health markers.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.640
So this is remarkable and it speaks

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.117
to the power of the nervous system

00:21:13.117 --> 00:21:17.107
and the power of belief in
governing aspects of our body

00:21:17.107 --> 00:21:20.410
and our physiology that
one would otherwise think

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.210
we're outside our conscious control.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.630
Now, of course, any of you
that think scientifically

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.690
which I imagine if you watch this podcast

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.820
or listen to this podcast
is all of you by now

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.653
probably thinking,

00:21:32.653 --> 00:21:34.150
well, maybe they just moved around more,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.360
or maybe they stood up and sat down more,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.720
maybe they did something
else that was different.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.720
And indeed there's a strong possibility

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.680
that they did things differently
than the other group,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.680
but the mere knowledge that
exercise is good for you,

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.940
that movement is good for you,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.690
shifted their behavior
and their physiology

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.730
in the direction of enhanced weight loss,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.050
fat loss, et cetera.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.910
So how we think about a
given set of activities

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.810
affects how we perform those activities.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.250
And how we think about and
perform those activities

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.480
has a real effect on our physiology.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.960
So somewhere between
the hard and fast rule

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.400
that governs fat loss and weight loss,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.500
which is if you ingest more
calories than you burn,

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.040
you'll either maintain or gain weight.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.220
Typically, you'll gain weight,

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.700
although not always.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.957
If you ingest about as
many calories as you burn,

00:22:25.957 --> 00:22:29.160
you'll maintain weight, typically.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.210
And if you ingest fewer
calories than you burn,

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.270
typically you'll lose weight.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.680
That's the kind of rule of fat loss.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.010
And yet we also have these
belief effects which show,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.110
and this has been
replicated again and again,

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.110
that how we think about a process,

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.630
whether or not we think it's beneficial

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.960
can change our physiology in ways

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.070
that can be beneficial to us.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.920
Somewhere in between those two extremes

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.120
of hardcore metabolic science

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.003
and belief of why a bunch of protocols

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.970
that are grounded in quality
peer-reviewed science

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.760
and in physiology that you can leverage

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.570
to increase the rates of fat loss.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.920
And so that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.830
I love this topic and it's not

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.150
that I'm so obsessed with fat loss,

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.700
but rather the first the project
I ever worked on in science

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.160
was thermogenesis and fat loss.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.180
I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate,

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.980
and the guy I worked for
loved to explore new compounds

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.840
and how they impacted thermogenesis.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.723
And so we looked at how
things like MDMA/Ecstasy,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.180
how antipsychotics, antidepressants,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.730
various weight loss drugs
that were on the market.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.270
How those impacted body temperature

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.970
and fat loss and metabolism?

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.440
And we just had so much fun doing it.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.540
So if you detect a smile on my face,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.000
that's what that's about.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.170
And I also learned a lot,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.450
and I also came to really appreciate

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.430
that this tissue of our bodies,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.840
adipose tissue and fat,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.270
we think of as just this unfortunate thing

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.340
that's like we're told
it's a core energy source

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.227
if we ever entered a famine
and that's all true, et cetera.

00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:08.880
You come to realize that
the cells in our body,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.880
they are there as fuel for
the furnace of our body,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.901
which is our metabolism.

00:24:15.901 --> 00:24:17.850
And there's a third player.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.240
And that's where it
really gets interesting.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.790
That the nervous system,
neurons has the opportunity

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.800
to turn up the intensity of that furnace.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.062
It has the opportunity to
increase the amount of heat

00:24:29.062 --> 00:24:32.530
that we produce and therefore
the amount of energy

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.550
that we burn.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.600
And I was also really intrigued
by something which is that,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.450
growing up, I think we all know people

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.820
who can eat a tone and never
seem to gain any body fat.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.660
Or people who seem to eat very little

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.380
and seem to gain body fat very easily.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.367
And I was always intrigued by that.

00:24:47.367 --> 00:24:50.150
And it turns out there are a
number of different factors

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.520
that relate to that.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.460
But the nervous system is the one

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.320
that we can really control.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.910
Both through behaviors and what we eat,

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.290
but also in terms of this thing
that we call thermogenesis.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.420
There was one particular
story I want to relate to,

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.840
that does not suggest any protocol.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.470
In fact, I'm going to discourage you

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.143
from following this protocol.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.330
Please do not try the compound
that I'm about to describe.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.290
One of the favorite things
that we like to do in that lab

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.250
was to find rare compounds and test them.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.910
And at the time I was
reading about thermogenesis

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.320
and I learned about a compound

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.200
that was actually discovered
in the armory factories

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.910
of World War II.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.890
And it was discovered
because women in particular

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.080
who were working in these factories

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.940
would take a brush and
dip it in a compound

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.090
or a paint rather,

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.140
and they would then paint
the numbers with a stencil

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.830
onto things like bombs and
ammunition of various kinds.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.550
And they were losing weight like crazy.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.460
It turns out that occasionally
they'd lick the brush,

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.120
and then they would go back
just to get a sharper point

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.953
on the brush,

00:25:57.953 --> 00:26:01.260
and then they would paint
onto these various bullets

00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:03.490
and missiles and so forth.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.040
Bombs and so forth.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.340
And they started shedding
all their body fat.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.910
And many of them losed, excuse
me, lost a lot of weight,

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.570
a significant portion of their weight

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.430
without changing anything
else that they were doing,

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.780
what they were eating, et cetera.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.410
It turned out that that compound

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:21.210
is something called Dinitrophenol, DNP.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:26.210
And over the years Dinatrophenol,
DNP has gained popularity

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.070
in some niche cultures,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:33.190
mainly bodybuilders, athletes
even in the modeling industry.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.030
It is a absolutely terrible
compound for anyone to use,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.110
because it's highly fatal
if your body temperature

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.140
goes too high.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.500
Hyperthermia will kill you.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.210
And indeed many people have
died using Dinatrophenol

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.680
as a weight loss drug or attempting

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.410
to use it as a weight loss drug.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.840
But Dinitophenol really
illustrates a principle

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.540
which is that your
metabolism includes things

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.240
like thyroid hormone and
growth hormone, et cetera.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.290
But your body temperature

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.800
and the way you utilize energy

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.850
is controlled by your nervous system.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.550
And the way Dinatrophenol works
is by changing the neurons

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.420
and the way that the
neurons that connect to fat

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.190
change the way fat burns up.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.410
So we are not going to suggest,

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.940
I am not suggesting that
you use Dinatrophenol.

00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:29.580
However, there are other things

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.810
that you can do that can
change the relationship

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.080
between these neurons
and the fat of your body

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.607
in ways that can powerfully
accelerate fat loss.

00:27:40.607 --> 00:27:42.900
And I don't know why we don't
hear about these things more,

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.240
but probably because most of what you see

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.750
out there on the internet focuses

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.880
more on what you could eat and should eat

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.080
or shouldn't eat.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.440
It concentrates on exercise regimens

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.350
which we will also talk about.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.230
But the burn factor,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:01.530
your thermogenic
environment is one of the,

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.890
if not the most important factors

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.020
in this business of fat loss.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.450
And since I'm a neuroscientist

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.150
that's what we're going to talk about.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.270
So let's talk about fat utilization.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.060
Let's talk about how fat
is converted into energy

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.955
which is sometimes also
called fat burning.

00:28:18.955 --> 00:28:20.830
What I'd like you to know

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.320
is that this is a two-part process.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.153
Okay?

00:28:24.153 --> 00:28:27.250
In reality, there are
many biochemical steps.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.770
And if you log onto the internet,

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.710
or you open up a textbook
and you want to learn about

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.840
fat utilization,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.370
you're going to see a lot of chemistry.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.010
And I'm happy to go deep into
that chemistry if you like.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.270
But I think most of you
are probably interested

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.520
in what are the leverage points?

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.540
Where can you exert control
over this process in ways

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.380
that benefit you?

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.580
So I'm going to focus mainly on those.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.413
Okay?

00:28:51.413 --> 00:28:54.350
This is not to upset the aficionados

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.823
and I will put in some
nomenclature, but here we go.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.530
There's two parts to this process.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.680
One, is fat mobilization.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.420
And the second is fat
oxidation or utilization.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.253
Okay?

00:29:09.253 --> 00:29:12.640
So the first thing that
has to happen for body fat

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.410
to get burned up or used and reduced

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.000
is that it has to get mobilized.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.400
And that's a process called lipolysis,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.350
but I actually don't care if
you know the name lipolysis,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:29.350
you just have to move that
fat out of the position

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.370
that it's in.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.390
You have to get it out of the fat cells.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.223
All right?

00:29:33.223 --> 00:29:36.160
Fat cells can be visceral
around our visceral organs

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.930
or they can be subcutaneous
under our skin.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.180
Most people are thinking
about subcutaneous fat

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.950
when they think about fat.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.350
So here's the deal.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.870
And if you want more detail,

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.630
great, I'll touch on that in a bit.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.310
But basically stored fat has two parts

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.650
that are relevant here.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.280
It's got the fatty acid part,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.540
and that's the part
that your body can use.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.700
And that's attached to
something called glycerol

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.550
and they're linked by a backbone.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.490
So already, probably too much
chemistry for both of you.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.820
But what you want is you
want to break the backbone.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.727
So if you just can
remember to mobilize fat,

00:30:09.727 --> 00:30:11.230
you got to break the backbone

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.270
between glycerol and these fatty acids.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.103
Okay?

00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:16.322
That's accomplished by
an enzyme called lipase,

00:30:16.322 --> 00:30:17.960
but you can forget all that if you want.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.230
Remember, we're just
trying to mobilize fat.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.210
So the first step is to
get those fatty acids

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.210
moving around in the bloodstream

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.640
to get them out of those fat cells.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.640
And then they can travel
and be used for energy.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.980
And that second part,

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.740
remember first part is mobilization.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.770
The second part is oxidation.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.160
Is then those fatty acids,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.930
those are potential fuel.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.090
They're just potential fuel,

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.590
but you haven't burned the fat yet,

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.040
you've just moved it
out of your fat cells.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.820
They're going to go into cells
that can use them for energy.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.260
And once they are inside those cells,

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.230
they're still not burned up.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.550
You need to oxidize them.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.820
Think oxidation is the burnup part.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.160
They need to be moved
into the mitochondria

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.470
and then they can be converted
into ATP into energy.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.180
So just to really zoom
out again to make sure

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.020
I don't lose anybody.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.280
You got to mobilize the fat,

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.360
then you have to oxidize the fat.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.670
In other words, you have to mobilize it,

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.150
then you actually have to
convert it into energy.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.650
If you just mobilize it,

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.360
and you don't convert it into energy,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.590
you don't oxidize it,

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.020
it can be returned to body fat.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.530
And many of the things that
the nervous system can do,

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:32.400
is to increase the mobilization of fat,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.220
but also the oxidation of fat.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.053
Okay?

00:31:36.053 --> 00:31:39.070
So you have two opportunities
to burn more fat,

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.520
and both of those
opportunities are governed

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.000
by your nervous system.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.051
By neurons that literally
send little wires

00:31:46.051 --> 00:31:50.320
that we call axons into
fat and release chemicals

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.140
that provide a stimulus
for more of that fat

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.620
to be mobilized,

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.300
and then later for more of
that fat to be burned up.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.133
Okay?

00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:02.420
So we could go really deep on this,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.170
but I'm not going to go
much deeper than that,

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.400
because this isn't a biochemistry

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.690
of fatty acid metabolism lecture.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.500
This is about how to burn fat
using your nervous system.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.740
But remember, there's a mobilization step,

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.610
and then there's an oxidation step.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.410
I think anyone of you,

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.230
all of you should be
able to internalize that.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.720
Mobilize then oxidize.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.553
Okay?

00:32:22.553 --> 00:32:24.250
Mobilize then oxidize.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.140
So what are these neurons
that connect a fat doing?

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.080
What are they releasing exactly?

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.450
How do they actually
increase fat mobilization?

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.950
And how do they increase fat oxidation?

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.920
Burning of fat.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.050
Well, there are a couple
of things that they release

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.710
that encourage that process.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.480
And the main one that you need
to know about is epinephrine

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.130
or adrenaline.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.470
The conversion of these
fatty acids into ATP

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:53.820
in the mitochondria of cells
is favored by adrenaline.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.700
Okay?

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.340
And adrenaline is
released from two sources.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.450
Adrenaline is released
from the adrenal glands,

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.410
which set a top our
kidneys and our lower back.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.560
And it's also released

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.620
from the so-called
sympathetic nervous system.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.820
Although that name is a bit of a misnomer,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.940
because it has nothing
to do with sympathy,

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.360
has to do with stimulating alertness

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.793
and promoting action of the body.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.330
There's a big mistake in the literature

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.899
that is finally being
corrected among those who know.

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:29.410
The mistake in the literature
is that the adrenal glands

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.380
and the release of adrenaline
is what stimulates fat loss

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.360
and fat oxidation.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.950
In fact, it was thought for a long time

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.130
that adrenaline swimming
around in your body

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.440
of when you're fasted,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.510
because fasting can increase adrenaline

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.330
or when you're engaging
in intense exercise

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:50.260
or when you're stressed is
going to promote fat oxidation.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.103
That's actually not the case.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.400
The adrenaline that
stimulates fat oxidation,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.540
the burning of fat is coming from neurons

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.670
that actually connect to the fat,

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.820
not hormones like adrenaline
that are swimming around

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.653
in your system.

00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:08.430
It's a local process.

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:12.420
And this is very important
because it means that,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.410
what you do, the specific
patterns of movements

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.353
and the specific environment you create

00:34:19.353 --> 00:34:24.353
that can stimulate these
particular neurons to activate fat,

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.560
meaning to release fat,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.360
to mobilize it and then to burn it,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.210
is going to be a powerful
lever that you can use

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.190
in order to increase fat loss.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.330
So what have we said so far?

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.560
We've said that you've got to
mobilize and you got to burn fat

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.870
and that your nervous system
is in control of that process.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.773
It's not just about calorie deficit.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.050
Okay, so let's talk about how to activate

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.090
the nervous system in
ways that it promotes

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.160
more liberation, movement,
mobilization of fat

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.660
and more oxidation of fat.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.070
So one of the most powerful
ways to stimulate epinephrin

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.750
which is also called
adrenaline from these neurons

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.240
that connect to fat and
to thereby stimulate

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.980
more fat mobilization and
oxidation is through movement.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.650
But I'm not talking about exercise.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.500
The type of movement
that I'm referring to,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.840
is extremely subtle.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.850
And some of you may be familiar
with this type of movement,

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.900
but I'm guessing you're
probably not familiar

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.590
with what I'm about to tell you,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:31.590
which is that shiver or
shivering is a strong stimulus

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.660
for the release of adrenaline
epinephrin into fat

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.090
and the increase in fat
oxidation and mobilization.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.830
But shiver is not just induced by cold,

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.740
and there are other
subtle forms of movement

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.823
that can greatly increase
fat metabolism and fat loss.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.530
There was a group in England
during the 1960s and 70s

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:01.530
that discovered a pathway by
which subtle forms of movement

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.933
can greatly increase fat loss.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:09.230
This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.200
It's very famous in the
thermogenesis literature.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.660
And I learned about this early on,

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.300
when I was an undergraduate and I asked,

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.490
how did they come across this?

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.023
And here's how the story goes.

00:36:20.097 --> 00:36:24.690
They were aware that some people overeat

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.710
and yet don't put on weight.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.240
Other people overeat
even just a little bit

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.900
and they seem to accumulate
extra adipose tissue.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.950
Now, this is long before
all the discussions

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.627
about microbiome and
hormone factors, you know

00:36:37.627 --> 00:36:40.280
it was long before many
of the hormone factors

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.781
besides insulin had even been discovered.

00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:46.360
What they did was they
examined people who overate

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.710
and did not gain weight.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:52.613
And what they observed was
that those people engaged

00:36:52.613 --> 00:36:55.630
in lots of subtle movement
throughout the day.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.080
In other words, they were fidgeters.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.360
And that's what they call them.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.430
I'm not going to do the British
accent version of fidgeters.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.643
But Roth and Stock were British.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.590
What they found were people that overeat

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.260
but don't gain weight as a consequence.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.600
And in fact, many people who
had low levels of body fat

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.040
had a lot of resting tremor,

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.530
not of the Parkinsonian type,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.070
but they would bounce their
knee while they were sitting,

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.320
when they would talk,

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.730
they would engage in
very angular movements,

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.940
they were sort of electric.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.280
In fact, now in science,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.440
I was chuckling about
this as I was diving back

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.273
into this literature,

00:37:33.273 --> 00:37:35.420
because the other day I
heard a wonderful lecture

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.760
on a totally different topic
from a colleague of mine

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.160
and we all adore him.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.010
He's over in Europe

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.310
and he's this tremendously
successful scientist.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.550
So we like to poke fun at him.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.300
And every one of his movements
is incredibly electric

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.370
and staccato.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:51.110
And he's rail thin and
he eats like a horse.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.920
And so it fits very
well into the discovery

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.010
of Rothwell and Stock who discovered

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.300
that fidgeters people
that bounce their knee,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.760
people that have a head bob
while they're listening,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.040
people that nod a lot,

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.850
people that stand up and sit
down a lot throughout the day,

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.995
and people that pace
burn anywhere from 800

00:38:10.995 --> 00:38:15.995
to 2,500 calories more
than the control group

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.430
in the experiments that they looked at.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.130
And indeed, there's been a
modern look into all this,

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.930
and these numbers check out

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.490
that simply moving around a lot,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.840
even if those are subtle movements,

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.750
greatly increases the amount
of energy that you burn.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.910
And people who overeat,

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.510
the people who can have the
second or the third doughnut

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.700
or doughnuts at all and
don't seem to put on weight

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.150
to the same degree,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.240
they are people that move
around a lot even when seated.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.960
They're are people that
will often move their limbs

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.690
very quickly as well.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.320
There even have been studies
that have explored other things

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.594
that correlate with fidgeters.

00:38:53.594 --> 00:38:55.950
Fidgeters stand up very
quickly at the end of a lecture

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.900
or they start to gather
their things very quickly,

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.920
whereas non fidgeters don't.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.260
So dogs like my bulldog Costello,
definitely not a fidgeter.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.360
Every movement is incredibly
slow and deliberate.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.900
Sitting down as a process,

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.990
if you ask him to sit down
and sort of a slow motion.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.930
You ask him to get up

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.300
and he kind of looks at
you sighs and stands up.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.280
The fidgeter is the
opposite of that, right?

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.240
You say, how are you doing?

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.350
They go, great.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.080
So even sometimes their
speech will be accelerated

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.100
although not always.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.050
But staccato movements,
fidgeting, et cetera.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.563
And in 2015, and again in 2017,

00:39:29.563 --> 00:39:32.440
there've been studies
that have explored this,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.850
using some modern metabolic tracking

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.210
and indeed simply moving a lot,

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.400
being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.010
standing up and pacing several times

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.430
or many times throughout the day

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:49.850
led to considerable amounts
of fat loss and weight loss

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.860
when people were ingesting
the same amount of food,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.920
if they overate, they
were able to compensate

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.680
and burn off that food.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.350
And if they were trying to lose weight

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.700
and they incorporated
this fidgeting protocol

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.370
of deliberately trying to fidget more

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.050
and move around during the day,

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:08.530
pace, stand up more quickly,

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.680
sit down more often,

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.710
sit down and stand up more often rather.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.300
They found that they greatly
increased their weight loss

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.630
anywhere from 20 to 30% increases.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.060
And in some cases, you know,
there always those few people

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.520
who burned a lot more.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.230
It seems to work best in people

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.030
who are already slightly overweight.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.850
So for people that are overweight,

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.530
who are kind of averse to exercise,

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.490
fidgeting might actually
be a good entry point.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:38.080
And 800 to 2,500 calories
is a considerable amount

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.180
of calories when you
really think about it.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.410
Now, why am I telling you this?

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.360
Well, there's clearly a
tool to export from this,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.590
which is that you can increase
the amount of calories burned

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.630
without having to go on
additional long runs.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.590
I do hope that people
are exercising regularly

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.940
because it's so important
for other aspects of brain

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.120
and body health.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.730
But nonetheless, we are all time limited

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.960
and we are not all so
ready to embrace exercise.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.810
I have a family member
who has been slowly coaxed

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:09.700
into exercise,

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.240
but if I were to tell her, for instance,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.440
you need to fidget more,
she'd probably go for it.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.440
So this is a powerful way
to increase the calories

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.650
that are burned.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.380
Now, that's great.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.680
And you can think about the protocols.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.960
But I want to nest that protocol

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.920
in what I said before,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.450
which is that, fat is
controlled by these neurons

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.310
and the epinephrin they release.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.340
You might say, well, how could
these little micro movements

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.990
lead to so much caloric burn?

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.940
And that's where it
really gets interesting.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.410
Rothwell and Stock and
others that they worked with,

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.230
subsequently found that these
little fidgety movements,

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.080
the engagement of certain
aspects of our musculature

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.880
that are nothing like exercise.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.340
It's not these large coordinated
or rhythmic body movements,

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.470
but rather subtle little
bits of fidgety movement.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.530
And here I am doing a lot of
fidgety movement as an example,

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.250
tapping the pen, this kind of thing.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.345
I was probably that kid
in class most of the time.

00:42:09.345 --> 00:42:10.977
And I was like, I try not
to do it to irritate people,

00:42:10.977 --> 00:42:13.560
but I was definitely a knee bouncer.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.710
I'm not particularly lean or not.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.350
But I was definitely...

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.300
This is a common activity for me.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.880
People that do that sort of thing,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.320
it turns out that it's not
the kind of caloric burn

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.370
that we normally think of,

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.300
of like, oh, you'll
running, lifting weights,

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.610
swimming, yoga, et cetera.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:34.290
Those subtle movements
of our core musculature,

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.110
not just the core, but all our limbs

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.520
and our musculature,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.920
those low level movements,

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.750
they trigger epinephrin
release from these neurons,

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.770
and they stimulate the
mobilization of fat.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.960
And then that fat is
oxidized at higher rates.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.500
And I find this fascinating.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.870
I wish more people knew about it,

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.820
which is why I'm telling
you about it today.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.860
This has nothing to do with exercise

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.260
in the traditional form,

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.270
and yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.820
That's a considerable
amount of fat oxidized.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.850
If you are in a calorie maintenance mode

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.280
or if you're sub caloric,

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.070
that's going to add to it
still additional fat loss.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.280
The data on this are tremendous.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.460
I'll link to a few studies.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.960
If you're really interested in learning

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.530
about what's called neat.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:23.530
N-E-A-T which is non-exercise
activity thermogenesis.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.000
NEAT.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.490
So what's the protocol?

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:27.970
Fidget.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.100
If you're really interested
in burning calories

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.050
and you already exercise,

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:32.890
you want to burn more

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.380
or you don't have the
opportunity to exercise

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.620
or you're averse to exercise
for whatever reason,

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.150
fidgeting, movements, staccato movement,

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.800
standing up, walking around, pacing,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.540
all the sort of nervous activities

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.047
that were so critical of other people

00:43:47.047 --> 00:43:48.870
and sometimes in ourselves

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:52.170
are actually mobilizing and oxidizing

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.030
a lot of fat and a lot of energy.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.610
And while this probably won't compensate

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.180
for chronic overeating,

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.040
the caloric burn from
this is considerable,

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.360
and very likely can offset a meal

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.950
that had excessive calories

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.930
or a kind of steady
state of eating too much.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.300
And it also starts to open
up all sorts of thoughts

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.760
and discussion about when you travel,

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.200
you tend to eat foods
that are kind of outside

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.033
your normal ones.

00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:23.550
We tend to eat foods that
aren't so great for us,

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.320
we also tend to be a
little bit more sedentary

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.730
when we travel we're on
the plane, et cetera.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:31.180
But all of that aside,

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.810
just the use of something
like low-level movement.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.830
And it's almost like a tremor,

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.570
but also these select short,
small fidgety movements.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.950
I'm intentionally doing
a lot of these today.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.800
So you have examples that you can use

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.420
to select from if you like.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.630
These can have a major effect on fat loss

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.113
and it raises a second tool.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:57.700
If these low, meaning
these small movements

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.770
that we engage in trigger
epinephrin adrenaline release

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.593
from these neurons of the
sympathetic nervous system

00:45:02.593 --> 00:45:05.210
that innervate fat and increase

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.210
fat mobilization and oxidation.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:12.360
Now, it should make sense why shivering

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.210
is one of the strongest stimuli

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:19.930
that one can incorporate
to stimulate fat loss.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.080
Now, shivering is almost
always associated with cold.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.350
We think shivering, we think cold,

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.880
because when we get cold, we shiver.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.960
And there are two ways that
shivering can increase fat loss.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.210
And there are several ways
that you can use shivering,

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:35.750
you can leverage shivering

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.620
and you can leverage cold
to accelerate fat loss.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.760
But you have to do it correctly.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.260
And most of the people that are using cold

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.210
and frankly suggesting cold

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:49.460
as a means to increase metabolism fat loss

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.370
are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.320
In fact, the one I'm going
to recommend is 180 degrees

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.930
in the opposite direction
to the typical protocol

00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:58.763
that you'd hear about.

00:45:58.763 --> 00:46:00.740
So let's talk about how to use cold

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:05.330
and how to leverage shiver as
a particularly strong stimulus

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:09.390
to increase fat loss through
mobilization and oxidation

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.020
of these fatty acids.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.320
So in recent years there's
been a growing interest

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.520
in the use of cold for
various things like,

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.060
improving stress tolerance,

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.880
improving metabolism,
recovery from exercise.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.480
I've talked about a number of those things

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.880
and the uses of cold on this podcast.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.880
In fact, did an episode on
how to supercharge performance

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.630
through palmer cooling, cooling the palms

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.220
in specific ways or the
bottoms of the feet.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.880
And if you're interested in that,

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.580
and how to improve performance
in endurance and strength,

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.330
you can check out that episode.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.860
But most people out there
are using cold exposure

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.970
typically by taking cold showers

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.130
or by getting into cold
water of some other kind,

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.650
a lake or a river or a
cold bath or an ice bath.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:00.610
And they are doing that
probably with mixed goals,

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.120
meaning they both would like
to increase their metabolism

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.593
and burn fat, as well as
improve mental resilience.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.740
Since today, we're talking
about accelerating fat loss

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.160
through the use of science-based tools.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.930
I want to emphasize a study
that was published in nature

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.180
just a couple of years ago,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:24.180
showing exactly how cold
increases metabolism and fat loss.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:26.383
Okay?

00:47:26.383 --> 00:47:28.690
So we have several kinds of fat.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.580
Three kinds in fact.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.600
We have white fat, white adipose tissue,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.933
and we have brown fat
or brown adipose tissue.

00:47:38.071 --> 00:47:41.763
And there's a third kind
which is beige adipose tissue.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.020
White fat is the type
that we traditionally

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.670
think of as fat, subcutaneous fat.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.420
And it is not particularly
rich in mitochondria.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.890
It is there as an energy storage site

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:56.880
and we have to mobilize the fat out

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.760
as we talked about before
and burn it up elsewhere.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.140
Brown fat largely exists
between our shoulder blades

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.840
and on the back of our
neck, between the scapulae.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.480
And it's rich with mitochondria

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.920
which is why it's called brown fat.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.610
And brown fat has a
particular biochemical cascade

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.223
whereby it can take food energy,

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.300
it can take food, basically,

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.400
break it down and convert it
into energy within those cells.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.050
And there's some
additional steps involved,

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.860
but unlike fatty acids from white fat

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.190
which have to travel elsewhere

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.340
get broken down in mitochondria

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.373
and convert into ATP, et cetera.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:38.950
Used by the mitochondria rather.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.260
Brown fat is thermogenic.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.560
It can actually use energy directly.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.890
It skips a step, and I
don't want to get diverted

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.820
by going into all the biochemistry of it.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.210
Beige fat is sort of in between.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:55.970
It's white fat that could be brown fat,

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.230
because it has some mitochondria in it,

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:00.310
but not as many as brown fat.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.140
Now, cold exposure does several things.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.410
Making ourselves cold
can allow us to build up

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:11.230
mental resilience because
getting into cold of any kind,

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.010
doesn't matter if it's a cryochamber,

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.420
doesn't matter if it's a cold day

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.700
and you forgot your sweater or your parka.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.340
It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.190
or you're lying down in the snow.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:26.240
Cold causes the release of
adrenaline from your adrenals.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.950
And it causes the release of epinephrin

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.410
from these neurons that connect to fat.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:36.410
Now, the big effects of cold on metabolism

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.510
and fat burning are going
to be through two routes.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.240
One, is that if you
expose yourself to cold,

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:49.070
you have the opportunity to
trigger activation of brown fat

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.990
as well as to convert more
beige fat into true brown fat.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:57.660
So you essentially create a
stronger or a hotter furnace.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.210
That's the way to think about brown fat.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.150
It's like a furnace.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.850
And so with this principle

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:05.200
that we started with a calories
in versus calories burned.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.560
What you're doing is you're
increasing the amount

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.393
of burning,

00:50:08.393 --> 00:50:11.940
you're increasing the burn of energy

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.570
by increasing the intensity
of the heat inside you

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:16.403
so to speak.

00:50:16.403 --> 00:50:17.236
Okay?

00:50:17.236 --> 00:50:20.080
I'm talking here kind of metaphorically.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.910
Now, how can you do that?

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.370
Well, if you get into cold water

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.820
or an ice bath or a cold day,

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.723
and you try and remain
calm and resist shivering,

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.330
you actually short circuit

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.020
this mechanism for increasing
brown fat thermogenesis.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.080
The paper published in nature shows

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.320
that it is shivering itself

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:49.070
that causes the brown fat
to increase your burning,

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:51.050
your burn rate and your metabolism.

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.300
And it works like this,

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.300
when you get into cold and you shiver,

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.600
the shivering that low level
movement of the muscle,

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.580
those small movements triggers
the release of a molecule

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.080
called succinate.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.630
S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.880
And succinate acts on the brown fat

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.750
to increase brown fat thermogenesis
and fat burning overall.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.600
It actually increases body heat

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.810
through this brown fat
thermogenesis pathway.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:23.250
And it also over time can
increase the amount of brown fat

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:27.520
by converting beige fat
into true brown fat.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.530
Now, how much cold exposure and how often?

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.393
That's the key.

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:37.100
But before I give that
detail or set of details.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.840
Remember if you resist the shiver,

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.930
you are not going to get the
increased metabolic effect,

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:46.290
because you are not going to
get the succinate release.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:50.050
So if you want to get your body heat,

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.540
your thermogenic level to go up,

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.000
you need to shiver.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.360
So now we have the NEAT,

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.510
the non-exercise activity thermogenesis.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.900
So low levels of activity
as I described before,

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.750
which are done away from cold,

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.060
maybe do them in cold as well.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.640
As well as shiver in response to cold.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.310
And so the shiver itself is valuable

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:09.610
for triggering the release of succinate.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.180
In fact, succinate is being evolved now

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.599
by various drug manufacturers

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:15.760
as a potential treatment for obesity.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.500
Although it hasn't really hit the market

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.790
in its final form yet.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.483
Succinate is powerful for
its effects on brown fat.

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:26.460
So how many times a week do you need

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.690
to expose yourself to cold?

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.620
Will depend on how much
fat you're trying to lose,

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.940
and how much you're trying
to increase your metabolism.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:37.830
There are studies that describe
positive effects on fat loss

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.390
of exposing yourself to cold,

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.440
either through cold
shower or through ice bath

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.540
or other cold water.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.900
It doesn't have to
actually have ice in it,

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.960
provided it's cold enough
for anytime, anywhere,

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.190
excuse me, between one
and five times per week.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.430
But it turns out that
just one exposure per week

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:55.880
can be valuable.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.870
The question then is how long to get

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:00.570
into that cold environment?

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:04.080
And how cold should that environment be?

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.930
So first let's talk about how long

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:07.630
to get into that cold environment?

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.310
The answer here might be
a little bit different

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.330
than you might imagine.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:13.280
Most of you might think,

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.040
oh, well if one minute is
good, three minutes is better,

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.790
and if three minutes is better
than 10 minutes is best.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.020
But remember the goal is
to get the shiver induced

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.080
release of succinate,

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.283
so that succinate can
trigger the brown fat.

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.470
It turns out that if you
want to trigger the shiver,

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.470
what you want to do is
to get into the cold

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:41.140
and then get out of the cold
and typically not dry off,

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.680
and then get back into the
cold and out of the cold,

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.150
that will definitely
stimulate more shivering

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.410
than just getting into the cold itself.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:49.670
So what I'm not referring to,

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:51.940
is getting into the cold
environment like an ice bath

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:55.350
and waiting until you shiver
and staying there shivering.

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.183
Okay?

00:53:56.183 --> 00:53:57.630
You also don't want to get hypothermic.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.355
And I want to be clear.

00:53:59.355 --> 00:54:01.080
You want to get approval from your doctor

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.380
before you do any of this.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.060
When you get into cold water,

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.780
there are two factors that will dictate

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.220
whether or not you shiver.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.070
Probably three,

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:11.470
but let's just talk about the main two.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.640
One, is how cold it is.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.680
So how cold should it be?

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.610
And look, if you get into
water, that's very, very cold.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.060
It can actually shock your heart.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.480
It can actually give you a heart attack

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.150
if it's truly, truly ice cold,

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.790
and you're not adapted to that.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.930
So proceed with caution, please.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.113
I'm not a physician and I don't
want to see anyone get hurt.

00:54:31.841 --> 00:54:33.880
Just cold enough to be uncomfortable

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.690
is a good place to start.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.240
So for some of you that's
going to be 60 degrees,

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.240
for some of you that's
going to be 55 degrees,

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.160
for some of you it's going
to be high thirties, right?

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.780
Depends on how cold adapted you are,

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.350
and people vary in terms of how
well they tolerate the cold.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:51.150
So what you need to do
is find a temperature

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:54.130
that you can get into one to five,

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:55.730
probably one to three times a week.

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:58.200
If you really want this
to accelerate fat loss.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.440
And you want to get in until
you just start to shiver,

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.820
and then you want to
get out and not dry off,

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:07.260
wait anywhere from one to three minutes

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.070
and then get back into the cold.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.610
Now, you'll notice when
you get back into the cold,

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.570
it'll almost seem soothing,

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.700
it might actually not induce shiv...

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.490
It might take away the
shiver that you had.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:22.870
So here's a potential
kind of sets reps protocol

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:23.870
that you can play with.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:25.840
Find a temperature then
induce a shiver for you.

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.050
That's going to vary depending
on your cold tolerance

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.560
and how cold adapted you are.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.410
One to three,

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.040
maybe five times a week,

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.980
get in until you...

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.810
Or get under the shower or whatever it is,

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.000
until you start to shiver.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.970
Genuinely shiver.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.400
Then after about a minute or so, get out,

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.850
spend one to three minutes
out, but don't dry off,

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:48.640
get back in for anywhere
from one to three minutes,

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.490
but try and access the shiver point again.

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:53.900
And you might do three
repetitions of that.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.930
So it's three times in
and three times out total.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:57.790
Okay?

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:59.703
That's a great starting place.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:05.380
And what you don't want to
do is build up your tolerance

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.280
to cold so fast,

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.420
that pretty soon you're
able to resist the shiver,

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.790
because remember the shiver

00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:12.410
is the source of the succinate release

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.980
that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.290
So if you'd like to see
this protocol spelled out,

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.290
you can access it zero cost at a website

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:22.850
which is www.thecoldplunge.com.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.060
The Cold Plunge is a company
they make cold plunges,

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.710
and they were kind enough to gift one

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.720
to the Human Lab Podcast.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.750
But I want to emphasize that
these protocols are free of cost.

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:35.360
The folks at the Cold Plunge
are not just interested

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.430
in marketing their product,

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.790
but one of their main
interests is encouraging people

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.050
to engage in cold exposure
for particular end points

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:46.670
and goals like fat loss,
resilience, et cetera.

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:48.840
Resisting inflammation.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.590
But their main focus is
providing people protocols

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.350
and encouraging people to use
cold exposure of various kinds

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.560
not just through their products,

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.720
but through cold rivers
and jumps in the ocean

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.270
and things like cold showers,

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:04.630
whatever is most convenient

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.710
and accessible for various people.

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:09.170
And so we needed a place
where we could house

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.610
these protocols in a permanent way,

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.640
and not just for this episode.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.230
But so what they've agreed to do is,

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:16.500
to post the protocols there,

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.960
they should be very easy
to find on their website.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.760
This particular protocol we're referring

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.740
to as the fat loss optimization protocol

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.240
for lack of a better name.

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.330
And it's really grounded in how cold

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:32.400
it can be used to induce shiver.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.640
And again, it doesn't really matter

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.680
how you're accessing that cold,

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.380
provided you access to the shiver,

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.510
and you're moving from
the cold environment

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:41.510
to a slightly warmer environment.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:43.020
So getting out of the cold shower

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:45.460
or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera,

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.680
or out of the cold plunge,

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.920
and then back in.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.780
Because it turns out that the cooling

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.480
and rewarming process of the
body is where shiver kicks in.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.350
And so that's distinctly different

00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:58.900
than just trying to get into the cold

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.420
and stay in the cold
for as long as possible.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.320
And if you zoom out a little bit

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:06.190
and think about some examples in life,

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.130
you'll understand why
that must be the case.

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.780
For instance, people who do
a lot of cold water swims,

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.140
you have these polar bear clubs,

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.230
I think they call themselves.

00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.100
They do these cold water swims.

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.190
I would sometimes see these
people swimming back and forth

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.450
to Alcatraz and stuff like
that, which it seems risky.

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.850
and they tell me it's very stimulating

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:25.683
for the mind and body.

00:58:25.683 --> 00:58:26.516
Great.

00:58:26.516 --> 00:58:28.600
Sometimes those people are very lean,

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.340
oftentimes they're not,

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.120
and they're getting a
lot of cold exposure.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.440
And one of the things that happens is,

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.620
if you expose yourself
to cold over and over,

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:38.453
you adapt,

00:58:38.453 --> 00:58:39.430
you become cold adapted.

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:40.263
And when you do that,

00:58:40.263 --> 00:58:42.010
you no longer get the epinephrine,

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:44.300
the adrenaline release from the cold

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.840
and therefore you don't
get the succinate release

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.800
and the shivering and the
brown fat thermogenic effect

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.330
quite as intensely.

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:53.990
So if you want to use
cold for other reasons,

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.960
and certainly cold water swims can be fun.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.010
And there's, you know, long
as you can do them safely,

00:58:59.010 --> 00:58:59.843
they're great.

00:58:59.843 --> 00:59:00.950
I've gotten into cold water swimming

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:02.610
for some period of time.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:04.500
You can use cold for
resilience, et cetera.

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.730
But if you want to use
cold to increase fat loss,

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:11.540
then getting this shiver
process going the cooling

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.990
and rewarming which
accelerates the amount of,

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:15.600
or increases the amount of shiver.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.880
That's going to be the way to go.

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.960
One note about cold
and some of the factors

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.380
that it releases.

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.400
A few years back there
was a lot of excitement

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.360
about this hormone called
irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.650
which was associated with cold.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:31.130
And there was a lot of excitement

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:34.500
about its potential role
in increasing metabolism

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:37.340
so much so that people
were starting to explore

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.080
this as a potential fat loss drug.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.720
To my knowledge that went nowhere.

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.020
The science eventually
shifted over to succinate

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:49.050
as the main factor in
cold induced thermogenesis

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:50.730
through this brown fat pathway.

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:52.240
But if anyone out there is aware

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.000
of any positive effects of iricin

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.900
or of any signs of irisin
that I'm overlooking here,

00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.890
or that I'm speaking about
incorrectly, please let me know.

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:02.290
I'd be very curious to learn.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:06.870
Now, I want to just talk about
brown fat a little bit more,

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:09.194
and talk about a period in your life

01:00:09.194 --> 01:00:12.320
in which you were rich with brown fat,

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.910
you had a ton of brown fat,

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:16.340
and that's when you were a baby.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.243
Babies can't shiver.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.930
These neurons that release
epinephrin into fat

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.830
are not wired up and really aren't present

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:30.810
at sufficient levels or
in sufficient numbers

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.320
when you are a baby.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.140
And therefore you can't shiver as a baby,

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.310
and you can't warm yourself
up in cold environments

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:38.870
very well.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.313
To compensate for that,

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.180
mother nature installed in all of us

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.280
an excess of brown fat early in life

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.337
that exists again in the upper back,

01:00:49.337 --> 01:00:51.937
and the middle of the back
and the back of the neck.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.250
Over time if we don't expose
ourselves to cold environments

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.240
or do other things that make a shiver,

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.670
we lose a lot of that brown fat,

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:04.250
but what's interesting about brown fat

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.260
is that there's some evidence

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.080
that brown fat just like white fat

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.710
can both increase in size,

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.280
but that you can also add new cells.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.670
Now, there's a little bit controversial.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:17.950
People always say you can't
change the number of fat cells,

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:21.190
you can just shrink them
or increase their size.

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:24.660
Well, it turns out that
epinephrin released

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.420
from these little nerve
endings in brown fat

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.750
and succinate circulating in the body may

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.870
and I want to underscore
may have the effect

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:35.390
of increasing the amount
of brown fat cells

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:40.360
probably by converting these
beige fat cells into brown fat.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.290
So that allows us to become
much as we were early in life,

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.580
where we metabolized like crazy

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.660
and we'd heat ourselves
up without shivering.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.700
Some people have taken the
cold thing to the extreme,

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.690
putting ice packs on
the back of their neck

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.120
throughout the day.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.820
Did a episode all about
testosterone and estrogen,

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.150
and there's this, let's
just call it a very niche,

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.810
I have to imagine very,
very niche culture of people

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.610
who are wearing literally, I'm not joking.

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:10.870
They are these cool pack
ice pack underpants.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:12.760
They go by a name that I'm
not going to repeat on here,

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.170
but you can find them on Amazon.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.698
Those are people that are
using cold packs on the body

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:19.960
and on the groin to
try and increase things

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.143
like testosterone.

01:02:22.395 --> 01:02:24.890
But as well to try and
increase thermogenesis

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:27.430
and trying to increase their metabolism.

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.310
Just remember if you become cold adapted,

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:32.190
you're not going to get
the fat burning effects

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:33.330
to the same degree.

01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:36.130
So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.590
but you don't want to adapt.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:40.080
This is reminiscent of a rule

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.130
that you hear about in endurance exercise

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:44.040
and in strength exercise as well,

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.810
which is, that you want to use
the minimal effective stimulus

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:49.850
to promote growth or progress.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.950
So growth of a muscle or
improvements in endurance.

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.930
If you go 10% further
on a run or 10% faster,

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.510
you will likely see an
improvement in performance

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.520
provided your recovery the
next time you come back

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.610
and do that same round of exercise.

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.930
You'll be able to do more work

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:08.850
or complete the work
more easily, et cetera.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:09.733
You've adapted.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.410
If you do 20% more distance
or 20% more weight,

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:18.480
you won't necessarily see the same

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.300
commiserate level of gain or improvement.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.450
And so likewise with cold,

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:25.960
if you're quickly moving
from 30 seconds of exposure

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.320
to 10 minutes of exposure,

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.450
you're overlooking the opportunity
to get the most fat loss

01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:34.590
and increase in metabolism
by stepping it up

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:36.160
in smaller increments.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:36.993
Okay?

01:03:36.993 --> 01:03:39.380
And this also speaks to the rationale

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.050
for using cold exposure
to accelerate fat loss

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:43.170
for certain periods,

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.520
but then maybe not doing it year round.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.140
If fat loss is your goal,

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.540
maybe use it for two,
three months at a time

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.230
and then stop for two,
three months at a time,

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:52.840
because it is such a potent stimulus

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.440
provided you engage in the shiver.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.690
Next I'd like to move to exercise
and how particular timing

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:05.150
and types of exercise can
vastly improve fat loss.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.983
Before I do that,

01:04:05.983 --> 01:04:08.780
I just want to mention a
really important reference

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.270
for those of you that are
interested in learning more about

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:13.820
how neurons connect to fat?

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.310
This is certainly a paper
that you'd want to look at,

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:19.140
if you're interested in diving
deep into the literature

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.130
and reading all the various studies.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:22.330
It's a review.

01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:24.770
And the title of the review
is neural innervation

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.700
of white adipose tissue and
the control of lipolysis.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.830
That's neural innervation
of white adipose tissue

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.340
and the control of lipolysis.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.680
It was published in Frontiers
in Neuroendocrinology.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.300
You can find that free online.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.110
They have the full text available.

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:43.170
The first author is
Bartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.680
It's a great review.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.220
And I've talked about a number of things

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.770
that are mentioned in the review.

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.700
Follow the references in that review

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.560
and the reference trail as we say,

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.530
if you're interested
in learning more about

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:56.610
also how neurons control brown fat.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.470
And before I moved to exercise,

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:00.310
I also just want to highlight something

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.010
that comes up every few years

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:06.320
and has largely been considered myth now,

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.080
but that is actually more interesting

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.840
than most people might think,

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.610
which is this issue of spot reduction.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.370
You know, in the 80s and 90s,

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:17.930
there were a lot of commercials,

01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:19.483
late night infomercials,

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.660
where they would talk
about spot reduction.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.610
If you do sit ups, will
you lose abdominal fat?

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:27.223
If you do hip raises or glute raises,

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.600
will you lose gluten hip fat.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.380
And I think everybody
knows now believes that,

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.390
and understands that fat metabolism

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.880
is something that happens
systemically throughout the body.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.210
That some body fat is
quote unquote more stubborn

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.043
than others.

01:05:42.043 --> 01:05:44.660
Everyone varies in where
they tend to store fat

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.284
or lose fat last.

01:05:46.284 --> 01:05:48.460
Number of factors that influence that,

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.370
and in particular hormone receptors.

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:56.370
But now at least in the
scientific literature,

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.450
spot reduction and the possibility of real

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:04.200
true spot reduction reductions
in fat in a targeted way,

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.930
a body part or body area targeted way

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:11.760
is becoming more of a reality
and may be a reality soon,

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.760
because exercise that
triggers the activation

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.340
of these nerve fibers,

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.850
these neurons that innervate fat.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:25.240
In theory, if you can increase
the amount of epinephrin

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.830
released at those particular
fat pads as they're called,

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:30.410
they're actually called fat pads

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:32.350
in the scientific literature.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.810
In theory, you could increase mobilization

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.350
from those particular body fat sites.

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:40.183
Okay?

01:06:40.183 --> 01:06:44.260
So because the new view that
the modern understanding

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.980
is that it's not adrenaline
released systemically

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.870
kind of bathing all your fat tissue,

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.570
but rather its neurons
releasing adrenaline

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:55.063
epinephrin locally that in theory,

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:59.290
exercise that stimulates
the release of epinephrin

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:02.950
or exercise coupled
with things like shiver

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.750
or low grade shaking movement,

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:08.890
or the NEAT, the non-exercise
activity thermogenesis

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:14.200
could in theory lead to local enhancement

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.650
of mobilization of fat tissue.

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.030
So I think that spot reduction

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:21.240
actually will soon be
something that's possible

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.290
using the appropriate technology.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.860
What does this mean for you now?

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:28.900
What could you possibly do
with this information now?

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:33.240
Well, I think it speaks to the fact

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.980
that if one is going to engage in exercise

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.420
that doing exercises that involve

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:43.000
lots of different body parts and movements

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.250
is likely to encourage the maintenance

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.950
and or growth of these neurons

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:51.020
that innervate fat throughout the body.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.920
What this means is changing
up the pattern of exercise,

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.440
engaging in novel types of movements

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.070
may actually be one
way that one can access

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:02.010
these so-called stubborn body fat pads.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.440
Now, there's a little bit of speculation

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.970
in the statement that I'm making,

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:06.480
but if you think about it it makes sense.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.050
If you become very adapted
to a particular pattern

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:10.610
of exercise,

01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.700
whether or not you're subcaloric or not,

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.390
you're on maintenance calories are not,

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:18.600
you are oxidizing some fat always,

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.370
and you're utilizing the
neurons that innervate fat

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:23.300
in a regular way.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:27.600
And pretty soon this innervation
is going to shut off,

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.660
because there's no reason why
this neural innervation of fat

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.650
should continue to release epinephrin

01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:35.900
unless you give it a
strong stimulus like cold

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.810
or the fidgeting or in this case

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.240
to do novel forms of exercise.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.330
And there's some anecdotal evidence

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.040
and I don't even want to call it data,

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.670
but anecdotal evidence
that people who have,

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.200
quote on quote stubborn body fat,

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.810
if they start to adopt
new patterns of exercise,

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:56.130
they can start to access
those stubborn fat pads.

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:57.960
And again, fat pads is the correct way

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.810
to refer to these in the
scientific literature.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:04.260
So what we're focusing
on today is the fact

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:08.190
that fat indeed will be
mobilized and oxidized

01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:10.500
in response to a deficit in calories.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.697
But that the way that neurons
control those fat pads

01:09:13.697 --> 01:09:15.235
and those body fat stores,

01:09:15.235 --> 01:09:17.840
affords you a lot more control

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.560
than perhaps you ever previously thought.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.720
So let's talk about movement.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.410
And the more traditional
kinds of movement,

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.680
aka exercise has been
shown to lead to increases

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.900
in metabolism and fat
loss to greater degrees

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.300
depending on whether or not for,

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.060
instance you're fasted
when you do it or not,

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.730
whether or not you do your cardio first

01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:39.810
or your resistance training first.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:42.210
And this is again in the literature

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:43.940
for which there's a lot of controversy,

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:47.060
but in digging through
all the studies on this,

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.960
we're finally starting to
arrive at a consensus of,

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.690
when is best to do exercise?

01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:55.960
And what types of exercise to
do if your goal is fat loss?

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.500
The topic of exercise is a
kind of controversial one,

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.490
not as controversial as nutrition and diet

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:03.780
which we will talk about in a few minutes.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:06.880
But it's a particularly interesting one,

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.840
because different types
of exercising gauge

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.060
the musculature of the body
and the heart and the lungs

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.570
in different ways,

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:15.730
and can have vastly
different effects on things

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:18.290
like hormones and metabolism
depending on whether

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:19.890
or not it's of high intensity,

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:22.340
moderate intensity or low intensity.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.610
So rather than think about weight training

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:27.080
versus cardiovascular exercise,

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.910
I think the most simple way,

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:33.780
the most fluid way to have this
conversation about exercise

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.150
and fat loss is in terms of
three general types of training.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.190
Whether or not it's done
with weights or body weight

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.150
doesn't really matter.

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:45.060
And those are high
intensity interval training.

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.410
Something that's seems to have
gained a lot of popularity

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.310
in recent years.

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.860
So-called HITT, H-I-I-T.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.260
So high intensity interval training.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.040
Sprint interval training.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.050
So that's going to be very
high intensity or SIT,

01:10:57.050 --> 01:11:01.290
or moderate intensity
continuous training, M-I-C-T.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:05.830
So we've got HIIT, SIT and MICT, M-I-C-T.

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.500
And we can get a little bit
more precise if you'd like.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.260
I'm not somebody who measures
my VO2 max or anything

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:12.100
while I exercise.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.670
I generally know whether
or not I'm doing something

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.300
I could continue for a very long time,

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.920
or whether or not I'm doing something

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.610
that I realize is going
to be of short duration

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.443
high-intensity.

01:11:22.443 --> 01:11:27.443
But if you'd like to
map this to VO2 max SIT,

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.040
this sprint interval training was defined

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.440
as all out greater than 100% of VO2 max

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.000
bursts of activity that
lasts eight to 30 seconds

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.160
intersperse with less
intense recovery periods.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.540
So this would be sprinting downfield

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.230
for eight to 30 seconds,

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:46.500
then maybe walking back
for about a minute or two

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.270
and then sprinting again
and then continuing.

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.450
So that would be SIT.

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:53.310
HIIT, H-I-I-T is defined as submaximal,

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:57.060
so 80 to a hundred percent
of VO2 max bursts of activity

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.320
that lasts 60 to 240 seconds

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.880
intersperse with less
intense recovery periods.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.020
So on a standard 400 meter track,

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.170
just to give this a
little bit of a visual,

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.250
a four minute mile would be
fantastic for most people,

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.250
although people run faster
than that of course.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:15.350
So that's four 60 seconds laps,

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:17.520
but that's back to back to back.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.770
I think in my best shape or
maybe it was in my dreams,

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.040
I don't recall which I
was able to do 60 seconds

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:23.873
around the track,

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:25.260
but of course I couldn't
get that on the second

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.760
or third or fourth if I
did that was certainly

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.170
in the fantasy land and not reality.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:35.640
But 60 seconds would
be about one revolution

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.473
around the track,

01:12:36.473 --> 01:12:40.200
maybe 90 seconds, depending
on how fast a one is running.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.620
So 60 to 240 seconds.

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.660
MICT okay.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.550
This moderate intensity
continuous training

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:50.970
is steady state cardio
sometimes called Zone 2 cardio

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.630
these days on the internet,

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:55.640
which has performed continuously
for 20 to 60 minutes

01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.070
at moderate intensity
of 40 to 60% of VO2 max

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:05.070
or if you prefer heart rate
55 to 70% of max heart rate.

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:06.103
Okay?

01:13:06.103 --> 01:13:08.000
So we can think about high, medium

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.610
and low intensity exercise.

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:12.370
Although low intensity usually means

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:13.960
that you could carry on a conversation,

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.520
or maybe you have to gasp
every few steps or so,

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.960
while trying to talk and run.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.350
That's I think going to
be the most useful way

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:23.150
to have this conversation
that we're having now,

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:25.180
because there's so many
different forms of exercise

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.653
that people do and intensity is important.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.270
Let's ask the question
that I think many people

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:32.423
are wondering about,

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:34.990
which is, is it better?

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:38.500
Meaning do you burn more fat
if you do your exercise fasted?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.060
And fasted in this respect
could be that you wake up

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.893
in the morning,

01:13:42.893 --> 01:13:44.020
you've been fasting all night,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.040
you just hydrate and you exercise

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.740
or sometimes people will ingest caffeine,

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.760
there's controversy as to whether
or not that quote on quote

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.780
breaks the fast.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.630
It has to do with whether
or not your caffeine adapted

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.240
something for another episode.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.990
In any case that would be fasted.

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:00.990
So probably not having eaten anything

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:05.192
for anywhere from three to
24 hours or maybe even more.

01:14:05.192 --> 01:14:06.860
As you could also be
fasted in the afternoon.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.850
If you had lunch at noon and it's four

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:10.100
or five or 6:00 p.m.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.230
Is it, will you burn more fat

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:16.910
if you exercise without
an eating anything first,

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.980
without ingesting any calories first?

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.060
And people have tried to
really split hairs on this,

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.050
every which way people say,

01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:23.730
well, you can fat fast,

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:25.790
because fat and protein doesn't lead

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:30.790
to as great increases in
insulin as other things,

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.020
maybe you can have a few
almonds and then still train.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:38.020
And indeed insulin will
prevent fat oxidation.

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:39.690
I want to be really clear.

01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.280
The burning part of fat in the cell,

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.630
the movement of the fatty
acid and into mitochondria

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:49.130
and the conversion ATP,
insulin inhibits that process.

01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:52.500
However, it's been shown

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.380
that it least for short
periods of training,

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.050
it doesn't really seem to
matter whether or not you eat

01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.310
before training or you don't,

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:02.830
if your goal is fat oxidation.

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.610
Now, I want to put an asterix near that,

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.010
because there are some exceptions.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:09.707
But there were several studies done that,

01:15:09.707 --> 01:15:12.580
and the kind of the classic ones of these,

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.210
I'll read out to you.

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:18.240
What they basically did is they
gave people glucose, sugar,

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.930
to increase their blood
sugar before training or not.

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:25.920
And the kind of classic study
of this is Al Borg at all.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.080
So in 1976, so it goes way back,

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.420
which is that glucose reduces
fat burning and exercise.

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.700
And then some other studies
if you want to look these up,

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.160
they're very easy to find on PubMed.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.173
You put in Horowitz 1999,

01:15:38.775 --> 01:15:41.950
[indistinct] is another
one where they have people

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.630
drink milk with glucose in it.

01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:47.500
So sweet sugary milk
before exercise, et cetera.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.960
And you can find a number of examples

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.220
where eating before exercise
reduces the amount of fat

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.810
that's oxidized during the exercise.

01:15:56.810 --> 01:16:00.513
And you can also find a lot
of studies showing that,

01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:05.810
eating during exercise
or prior to exercise

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:08.520
will not reduce the amount
of fat that is oxidized.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.570
However, the types of exercise

01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:13.870
whether I was medium
intensity or high intensity

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:16.330
or low intensity is all over
the map for these studies.

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:19.710
So it's very hard to
target an ideal protocol.

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:22.560
And then if you look really
deep in the literature,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.540
you start to find meta analysis

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.720
where people have actually
aggregated all the findings

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.050
and some modern studies where it points

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:32.450
to some very specific
and useful protocols.

01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:35.240
And so here's the rule
that or the protocol

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.403
that I extracted from that literature.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.580
At a period of about 90 minutes

01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:44.363
of moderate intensity exercise,

01:16:44.363 --> 01:16:46.220
I want to be clear,

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:51.220
at about or after 90 minutes
of moderate intensity exercise.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.610
There's a switchover point

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:57.070
whereby if you ate before the exercise,

01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.700
you will reduce, excuse me,

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.700
you will burn far less fat
from the 90 minute point onward

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.820
than you would if you had
gone into the training fasted.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.250
So let me repeat that.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.730
If it's moderate intensity,

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:13.253
so-called zone two cardio type exercise,

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.720
at the 90 minute point,

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.370
if you happen to have
eaten before the exercise

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:23.160
within one to three hours
prior to the exercise,

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.500
then you reduce the amount
of fat that you will burn

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.040
from 90 minutes onward,

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.060
whereas if you had fasted
prior to the exercise,

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.260
you hadn't eaten anything
for three hours or more prior

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.093
to the exercise.

01:17:35.093 --> 01:17:38.440
At the 90 minute point,
90 minutes of exercise

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.690
you will start to burn
more fat than you would

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.100
had you eaten.

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:47.680
Now, 90 minutes of moderate
intensity exercises is a lot.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.740
So that's a pretty long run.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.840
Even if you're running
at a pretty slow pace

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.430
like a 10 or 12 minute mile,
that's a lot of running,

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:56.330
that's a lot of swimming.

01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:57.810
So that's a lot of walking,

01:17:57.810 --> 01:17:58.963
that's a lot of hiking.

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.070
However, there are people who
are going out hiking all day

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:03.750
or running all day or walking all day.

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:07.040
And if you want to burn
more fat per unit time,

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.400
you want to oxidize more fat
then you would do that fasted.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.750
Now, there are also studies
that pointed the fact

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.010
that you don't have to wait to 90 minutes

01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:21.250
in order to get this
enhanced fat burning effect.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:23.600
The studies I was able to find

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.060
and that looked to me like
quality peer-reviewed studies

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:30.650
with no company bias or no
product bias of any kind.

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:32.970
These are studies that were largely funded

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:37.970
by the federal government
in the university context

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.033
pointed the fact that if one
does high-intensity training,

01:18:43.584 --> 01:18:46.240
or even the very high
intensity forms of training

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.650
like sprints or squats or deadlifts

01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:51.370
or any kind of activity
that can't be maintained

01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:53.360
for more than these, you know, eight

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.290
or I would say up to 60 seconds.

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.840
So a set of lifting
weights repeated, repeated,

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.450
if that's done for
anywhere from 20 minutes,

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:03.820
so weight training or power lifting

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.070
or these kinds of things
or kettlebell swings

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:08.660
or up to 60 minutes,

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.660
we'll then the switchover point

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.280
in which you can burn more fat,

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.380
if you go into that fasted comes earlier.

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.890
And this makes sense
because there's nothing holy

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:21.580
about the 90 minute point
for a medium intensity

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.170
Zone 2 cardio.

01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:25.720
That 90 minute point is the point

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.720
in which the body shifts over
from mainly burning glycogen,

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.490
basically, sugar that comes
from muscles or the liver

01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:37.620
and realizes this is going on for a while,

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:41.967
I'm going to shift over
to a storage site fuel

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.490
that is in reserve like body fat.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:47.770
This is going to happen for a while,

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:49.610
so I'm going to start
tapping into body fat stores.

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:51.320
Now, fat doesn't have
a little brain there.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.540
It is innervated by neurons,
but it doesn't have thoughts.

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.130
And you don't actually control
this switch with your mind.

01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:58.480
This is something that
has to do with the milieu

01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.930
of various hormones.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:03.870
What has to happen is insulin
has to go down far enough.

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:05.740
So if you ate before the exercise,

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.330
you'd have an increase in insulin,

01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:08.350
if you ate carbohydrates

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:11.200
you'd have a bigger increase
in insulin, fat and proteins

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.510
indeed you'll have
lower amounts of insulin

01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:16.520
and fasting will give you
the lowest amount of insulin.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.810
Well, then that switch over
point is going to come earlier

01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:20.970
in the exercise.

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:23.590
And if you think about if
you were to do something

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:26.020
high intensity for 20, 30, 40 minutes,

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.610
so maybe lift weights and
then get into Zone 2 cardio.

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:31.800
If you are fasted, the literature says

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.030
that you're going to burn
more body fat per unit time

01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:40.370
than if you had eaten before
or during the exercise.

01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:41.203
So what does this mean?

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:43.450
This means if you want
to burn more body fat,

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:45.100
if it's in your protocols

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.823
and you have been approved
to do this safely,

01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:53.200
exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes,

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.280
the higher the intensity
obviously the shorter

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.550
that about is going to be,

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:58.660
and then move over into Zone 2 cardio.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.330
And if you do that fasted or
the medium intensity cardio

01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.163
I should say.

01:21:02.163 --> 01:21:04.470
And if you do that fasted,

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:07.370
then indeed you will burn a
higher percentage of body fat.

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:11.630
If you need to eat or you
like to eat before you train

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:14.270
that also can work.

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.980
And if you train very intensely,

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:20.060
you're likely to shift over
to the fat burning pattern

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:21.530
more quickly as well.

01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:23.380
So again, this isn't really an issue

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.650
of how long you exercise.

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.540
It's an issue of how
intensely you exercise

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:31.470
and therefore what fuel
source you're drawing from.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.150
So hopefully I've made that clear,

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:35.720
but basically you need to deplete glycogen

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.000
or through high intensity exercise

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.330
and then move to a steady state exercise

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:42.090
that will allow you to burn more fat.

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:45.450
Or you need to perform a medium intensity

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:47.990
or low intensity type exercise
for a long period of time

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:50.010
before you shift over to burning fat.

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:53.230
And indeed it seems that
going into all that fasted

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:56.653
will facilitate the burning
of more fat overall.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.860
But if you can't even get to the exercise,

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:02.850
if you're somebody who just
can't do the training at all,

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:05.965
you're unwilling to or
you're incapable of training,

01:22:05.965 --> 01:22:07.170
unless you eat something,

01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:09.270
then obviously eating
something makes the most sense.

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.700
And what you eat prior to exercise,

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:13.874
that's a whole other biz
that people argue about

01:22:13.874 --> 01:22:16.040
and fight about whether
or not you should go

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.080
into it with low carbohydrates
or higher carbs, all of that.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.340
But in general, the theme
there is very simple.

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.710
Which is that you want insulin
levels to be pretty low

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:26.380
if your goal is body fat reduction,

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.930
if you want to oxidize body fat.

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:29.260
So fasting in some cases,

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.570
fat fasting and other cases

01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:32.070
where you're just ingesting fats.

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:34.150
Fat and protein, in some
cases or for some people

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:35.750
it will be eating carbohydrates.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:39.140
I'm not here to dictate a
particular nutrition regimen.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.250
That's just how the hormone
balance of these things

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.230
and fat oxidation works.

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:44.860
Now, one thing that's very interesting

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.510
and cannot be overlooked is this issue

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:51.970
of how much energy you burn
during and after the activity.

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:53.970
And some of you probably
already know about this,

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:58.630
but the whole business of
calories in versus calories out,

01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:00.730
and people counting the number of calories

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:02.500
they burn during their aerobic session

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.810
or during their whatever session

01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:07.050
is only one half of the equation

01:23:07.050 --> 01:23:09.940
and it really eclipses
the more important issue,

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.110
which is how much of an
increase in metabolism

01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:18.570
does a given exercise
create after the exercise?

01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:20.030
And we could talk for hours about this,

01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:21.860
but the simple way to view this is that,

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:25.080
high intensity training,
anaerobic training

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:29.200
of weight training, sprints,
burpees, any kind of thing.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.410
I don't know these days I
hear that you're not supposed

01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:33.280
to do burpees that people
think burpees are dangerous.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.090
So I'm not suggesting any
particular movements here.

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:37.090
You have to decide what's right for you.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.380
I do burpees.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.180
I don't seem to be injured from them,

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.310
but I hear that they're
terrible for some people.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.760
So anyway, push-ups, sit-ups,

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.980
whatever it happens to be
that anaerobic exercise

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.630
that's of higher intensity or sprints

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:55.820
taps into glycogen stores
during the movement

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:58.900
and we'll burn more energy per unit time

01:23:58.900 --> 01:23:59.830
than moderate intensity.

01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.620
High intensity burns more
than modern intensity.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:02.770
That's straightforward.

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:06.840
What's interesting is that all the studies

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.270
that I was able to find on what happens

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:10.685
after that type of exercise showed

01:24:10.685 --> 01:24:12.990
that the percentage of fat that you burn

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:16.710
after high intensity
exercise is actually greater.

01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:18.360
In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.150
during the high intensity exercise.

01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:21.940
And then after the exercise,

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.130
the post exercise oxygen consumption

01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:27.240
as it sometimes called goes up.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.980
We know this after you train intensely

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.230
that post exercise oxygen
consumption goes up

01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:33.920
sometimes for up to 24 hours.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.620
And it is during that period of time

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.230
that you oxidize more fat not glycogen.

01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:42.930
Now, what's interesting is
that the reverse is also true,

01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:45.200
for people that do long bouts of low

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.930
or moderate intensity exercise.

01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:48.590
So typically this would
be things like running,

01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:49.710
swimming, biking, et cetera.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:52.050
So 60, 90 minutes, two hours

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:53.930
maybe even people that
are training for marathons

01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:55.130
or half marathons,

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:57.352
when they stop training,

01:24:57.352 --> 01:25:01.640
they burn more glycogen,
more carbohydrate,

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.450
even though they were burning
more body fat per unit time

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:07.130
during the low intensity exercise.

01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:08.500
So there's this kind of inversion.

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.980
High-intensity burns more
glycogen during the activity,

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.300
more body fat afterwards.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.250
Moderate to low intensity
burns more percentage-wise

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:20.210
more body fat is oxidized than glycogen

01:25:21.265 --> 01:25:24.830
during the actual exercise
afterward it's more glycogen.

01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:27.060
So I don't want this
to get too complicated.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:30.750
The point is you should
pick exercise that you like,

01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:32.560
that you're going to do regularly,

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.340
but it does seem that the
high intensity exercise

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.320
followed by moderate intensity exercise

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.930
is going to be optimal
for fat burning overall.

01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:45.430
Because when you look at the
percentage of body fat burned,

01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:47.610
and you look at the overall increase

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:49.470
in basal metabolic rate,

01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:51.630
moderate and high intensity training

01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:54.880
followed by low intensity training

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.580
or even just followed
by going back into life

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.690
is going to be the best way
to continue to burn body fat

01:26:00.690 --> 01:26:03.853
because of the ways that it
increases basal metabolic rate.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.730
This could be distilled
into a simple protocol

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.370
whereby three or four times a week

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:13.300
you do high intensity training
followed by either nothing

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.610
or followed by low intensity training

01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:19.500
especially if you're
able to do that fasted.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.740
And I should just mention
that none of this stuff

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740
about fasted is about performance.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.910
If you want to perform really well,

01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:27.834
this is for reasons of performance

01:26:27.834 --> 01:26:30.560
and you want to, you know, it's
for a sport or a competition,

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.200
it's not for body fat purposes.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.610
Well, then all of this kind of falls away

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.220
and is modified by what's
ideal to eat for performance.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.210
But what we're talking about today

01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:42.540
is how to optimize body fat loss.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:47.540
So train moderately to very high intensity

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.510
and then moderate to low intensity,

01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:53.880
or train moderate to high intensity,

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.160
and then go about life.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.030
And in fact, I have a friend
who uses this strategy.

01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:00.530
He likes the train intensely

01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:03.180
and not that often protocol
cause he's a very busy person.

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.340
So he'll train for 20
or 30 minutes intensely

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.330
with weights or just body
weight movement doing a lot,

01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:10.620
he does burpees and push-ups
and sit-ups and pull-ups

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:13.700
and just kind of moving and
kind of circuit type training.

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.170
But where he's breathing really hard,

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:16.310
the goal he always says is,

01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:18.830
I want to breathe hard
for 30 minutes every day.

01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:21.630
And then afterwards he
hydrates and drinks coffee

01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:22.680
and moves into his day.

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.440
And he's walking around and taking calls

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.880
and carrying around his children

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.850
and doing all these kinds of things

01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:27.683
that keep him really busy

01:27:27.683 --> 01:27:29.460
which is kind of like low intensity work.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.350
So I think you get the principle now.

01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:33.920
But you should all be asking yourselves

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.380
as scientists of yourselves.

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.940
Why would it be that
certain patterns of exercise

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.640
would lead to more or less fat loss?

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.010
I mean, it can't just be
about the energy burn.

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:45.550
We already established that.

01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:47.530
And again, it has to do with the neurons.

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:50.080
It has to do with how we
engage the nervous system.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.570
So while non-exercise activity
induced thermogenesis, NEAT,

01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:57.600
the fidgeting and cold
can induce thermogenesis

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.070
by engaging shiver tight
movement or low-level movements.

01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:04.490
Big movements that are
of very high intensity,

01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:06.010
meaning they require a lot of effort,

01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:09.820
deploy a lot of adrenaline
epinephrin from our neurons

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:12.980
and signal particular types

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:17.980
and amounts of fat
thermogenesis, fat oxidation,

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.500
whereas low level intensity exercise,

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.410
low or moderate intensity exercise,

01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:23.890
walking, running, biking

01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:25.160
where you can do that easily,

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.110
there's not very much adrenaline release.

01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:31.450
So adrenaline aka epinephrin

01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:33.660
is really the final common path

01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:35.920
by which movement of any kind,

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.410
whether or not it's low level shiver,

01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:40.720
whether or not it's lifting
a barbell sprinting up a hill

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.360
or doing a long bike ride.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.950
Adrenaline is the effector of fat loss.

01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:49.560
It's the trigger end, it's the effector.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.910
So now I want to turn our
attention to compounds

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:55.550
that increase epinephrin and adrenaline,

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:58.290
as well as compounds that work outside

01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:00.770
the adrenaline epinephrin pathway

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:03.120
to increase the rates of fat loss.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.210
I almost always save
compounds and supplements

01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:07.990
and things of that sort to the end,

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:10.840
because I do believe that
people should look first

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.270
towards behavioral tools and
an understanding of the science

01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:17.300
before they look toward a supplement

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:21.320
or a particular thing that
they can extract from diet.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.070
This is mainly to try
and shift people away

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:26.020
from the kind of magic
pill phenomenon or the idea

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.130
that there is a magic pill
because there really isn't.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:29.700
And frankly, there never will be.

01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.950
But there are some compounds

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:34.630
that can greatly increase fat
oxidation and mobilization.

01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:38.340
And understanding which
compounds increase oxidation

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.010
or mobilization can be very useful

01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:43.870
if your goal is to accelerate fat loss.

01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:46.370
There are things that people can ingest

01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:50.090
that will allow them to oxidize more fat.

01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:52.580
And that occurs mainly
by increasing the amount

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:55.160
of epinephrin that is
released from neurons

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.310
that innovate fat tissue.

01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:59.150
One of the more common ones is one

01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:01.823
that you may already be
using which is caffeine.

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:06.820
It's well-established that
caffeine can enhance performance,

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.280
if you're caffeine adapted.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.220
I talked about this in an earlier episode

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.170
so I want to make sure
I'm very clear about this.

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.430
If you are not used to drinking caffeine

01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:17.420
and you suddenly decide I'm going to drink

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.170
a big cup of coffee before training,

01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:24.250
you will vasoconstrict and
you will limit performance.

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:25.530
So that's performance.

01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:28.060
If you're caffeine adapted however,

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.950
there's this kind of
interesting phenomenon

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:31.670
where ingestion of caffeine

01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:34.700
serves more as a performance enhancer,

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.160
both by increasing alertness,

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.940
but also by way of dilating vasculature

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:41.340
of allowing more blood flow.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.720
Now, caffeine for burning
more fat for oxidizing

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.020
and mobilizing more fat
is an interesting one.

01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:54.590
It can be effective at
dosages up to 400 milligrams.

01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:56.950
You have to be careful if
you're caffeine sensitive.

01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:58.980
Some people have just the
littlest bit of caffeine

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:00.770
and their mind goes crazy,

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:02.000
and they're very uncomfortable.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.130
It can have cardiovascular
effects for some people

01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:05.300
or hypertension, et cetera.

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.070
So please check with your doctor.

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:12.070
But 400 milligrams is roughly
a cup and a half a coffee

01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:13.300
or two cups of coffee.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.530
Nowadays, there's a lot
more caffeine in coffee.

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:19.790
So if you go to a typical cafe

01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:22.670
and you were to get their medium-sized

01:31:22.670 --> 01:31:25.250
that would have close
to a gram of caffeine,

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:28.490
which is why, if you're a
regular caffeine consumer

01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:30.330
and you don't get that gram of caffeine

01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:32.350
in your coffee each day,
you will get a headache.

01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:35.250
It can cause constriction
and dilation of blood vessels

01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:37.050
in ways that's complicated,

01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:39.150
but you'll get a headache.

01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:42.620
Some people like the
way they feel drinking

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.690
100 to 200, 300 maybe 400
milligrams of caffeine

01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:46.523
before training.

01:31:46.523 --> 01:31:49.410
And indeed that will lead
to increase fat oxidation.

01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:52.280
It will do that because you
will release more epinephrin

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.510
and adrenaline.

01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:55.740
So let's just place this in the context

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.870
of what we said previously.

01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:59.520
Let's say you normally do Zone 2 cardio,

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.630
so you're going out for
a moderately intense run

01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:05.090
for 30 to 60 minutes or so.

01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:08.120
I think the current recommendation
guidelines in the States

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.610
are that people engage in 30 minutes

01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:15.850
of moderate intensity
exercise five days a week

01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:18.570
for that's 150 minutes.

01:32:18.570 --> 01:32:20.460
If their goal is to improve

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:23.393
or maintain health of the
cardiovascular system.

01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:27.950
80% of people in the United
States fail to do that,

01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:29.930
or anything close to it.

01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:32.760
We are way below threshold
for what the government

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.593
has recommended.

01:32:33.593 --> 01:32:35.060
In this case, the
government recommendations,

01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.250
I think are pretty good.

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.830
That's one could always
do better of course.

01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:41.500
But 80% of people aren't even doing that.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:44.082
However, just using the logic

01:32:44.082 --> 01:32:47.270
and the understanding of
how epinephrin adrenaline

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:49.520
is affecting this fat oxidation process.

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.990
If you were to go out for 15 minutes

01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:54.420
and you drank caffeine before you went,

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:58.890
yes, you'll probably oxidize
more fat per unit time.

01:32:58.890 --> 01:33:01.590
Can you compensate for the exercise

01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:04.040
you're not doing just
by drinking caffeine?

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.430
Well, probably if you were
just talking about fat loss,

01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:10.090
if that caffeine makes
you fidget a lot, right?

01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:13.250
The amount of calories that
you burn in a 30 minute run,

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.900
unless the run is very intense

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.940
and you're wearing a weight
vest and it's up a hill,

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.603
it's not that great, right?

01:33:18.603 --> 01:33:20.250
Then you probably get you in somewhere

01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:24.370
into the 400, 500 calories burned area.

01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:27.180
But I said earlier, and
there are a lot of data now

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.600
to support that fidgeting for a day

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.690
can burn anywhere from 800
to 2,500 calories a day.

01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:33.650
So you might say, well,
fidgeting is better than running,

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.720
ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.950
and the positive health effects

01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:39.700
of the cardiovascular system.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.390
So fidgeting alone can be great,

01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:45.600
but you need exercise for other reasons.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.243
Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat

01:33:47.243 --> 01:33:50.150
that you burn in any duration of exercise.

01:33:50.150 --> 01:33:52.460
And it can shift the percentage of fat

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.683
that you oxidize compared to glycogen.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:59.400
Unless you take that caffeine
and it ramps you up so much

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.630
that you're training
really, really intensely.

01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:02.810
The bottom line is,

01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:06.010
if you like caffeine and
you can use it safely,

01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:09.820
ingesting somewhere between
104 milligrams of caffeine

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.090
prior to exercise somewhere
between 30 to 40 minutes

01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:15.857
before exercise can be beneficial

01:34:15.857 --> 01:34:20.730
if we're talking about fat
oxidation burning more body fat.

01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:22.010
So that's caffeine.

01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:23.100
There are a number of other things

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.600
that have existed over the
years that are in this pathway,

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.600
things like ephedrine which
is now illegal in most states,

01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:32.370
I think maybe an all states

01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:35.330
because people were dropping
dead from taking ephedrine,

01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:37.410
because they were heating up too much.

01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:39.960
It's interesting it wasn't
direct effects on the heart

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.290
causing heart attack.

01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:45.950
It could trigger by way
of adrenergic receptors.

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:47.400
If you'd like to know,

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.570
increases in body temperature and heat.

01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:53.870
Now, those drugs turned
out to be dangerous,

01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:55.500
because people were overheating and dying.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.610
There was also the big Fen-Phen craze.

01:34:57.610 --> 01:35:01.260
That was a drug that was
released fenfluramine

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.890
which actually was quite effective

01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:05.640
as an anti obesity drug,

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.130
a treatment for obesity that
had to be outlawed as well.

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:13.660
It was FDA approval was removed

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:15.210
because again people were dying

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.040
because of cardiovascular effects.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.800
I don't know if people were
overheating on it as well.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.460
So what is the solution?

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.900
If caffeine is the kind of the
entry point for most people

01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:27.040
of using compounds to increase the rate

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.220
or percentage of fat loss in
exercise and even at rest,

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.410
what are some of the other
things that are useful

01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:34.243
and interesting?

01:35:34.243 --> 01:35:36.550
Well, in terms of tools
that are actionable

01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:38.940
and have reasonable safety margins,

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:43.570
I've talked before about
something called GLP-1.

01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:46.200
This is something that can be triggered

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.687
by the ingestion of yerba
mate, which is a tea,

01:35:48.687 --> 01:35:51.470
and I guess because I'm half Argentine,

01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:52.670
we grew up drinking mate.

01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:54.120
I think I was drinking mate from the time

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:56.010
I was about three or four years old.

01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:57.450
I don't suggest that for kids.

01:35:57.450 --> 01:36:00.570
I don't think kids should
be ingesting caffeine.

01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:04.830
But anyway I did it and
I still ingest mate.

01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:07.490
Mate increases GLP-1.

01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:10.710
GLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.

01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:13.080
So let's just quickly
return to our biochemistry.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:16.540
As you recall, fat is
mobilized from body fat stores

01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:18.900
and then it's burned up.

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.750
It's oxidized in cells.

01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:24.100
It actually needs to
be converted into ATP.

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.810
And those fatty acids are
essentially converted into ATP

01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:31.070
in the mitochondria of the cell.

01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:34.810
High insulin prevents that from happening

01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:38.423
and glucagon facilitates that process.

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.880
Glucagon facilitates that process

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.500
through increases in GLP-1.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:49.330
The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1

01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:52.630
and yes, increases the percentage
of fat that you will burn.

01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:54.400
It increases fat burning.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.860
And that is especially true,

01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.990
it turns out from the
scientific literature,

01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:02.060
if you ingest mate prior
to exercise of any kind.

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:06.050
So if you want to burn
more fat drinking mate

01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:08.230
before exercise is good.

01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:11.260
Drinking it at rest when
you're not exercising

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.570
will also help shift your metabolism

01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:18.100
toward enhanced burning of fat
by increasing fat oxidation.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.380
Now, there's a whole
category of pharmaceuticals

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.870
that's being developed right now

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.480
that are in late stage trials

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.860
or are in use for the
treatment of diabetes

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:32.090
which capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.

01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:33.960
They go by various names

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960
and there are people on the internet

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.320
who are selling these things.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.670
They are prescription drugs

01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:41.010
and I want to emphasize that
they are prescription drugs

01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:42.500
and you obviously wouldn't want to use

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.680
any of these without a
prescription and a requirement.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.140
It does seem that they are effective

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.940
for the treatment of
certain kinds of diabetes

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.990
and lead to fairly significant weight loss

01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:55.670
and reduction in appetite.

01:37:55.670 --> 01:37:59.630
So this is kind of the
modern version of GLP-1

01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:03.840
is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:07.300
are drugs such as somatical,

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.640
I can never pronounce this.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.120
I can't seem to pronounce
many things it seems.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.040
Semaglutide is the way
I would pronounce it.

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.823
S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.

01:38:20.096 --> 01:38:22.340
Semaglutide but that's not
the way you pronounce it.

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:25.110
But Semaglutide is the way
that it's been described

01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:26.590
on the internet.

01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:30.520
In any case, this
compound increases GLP-1.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.460
It's actually a GLP-1
analog in some cases,

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.360
and they go by various
types of trade names.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.350
So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.

01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:41.450
Most people, including myself,

01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:43.370
are not interested in
taking a prescription drug

01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:44.490
to increase GLP-1,

01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.460
I do it through the ingestion of mate.

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.320
I just get the mate leaves,
pour water over it and drink it.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.600
What's kind of interesting,

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.400
that's not often discussed

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.703
is that you can increase
the amount of GLP-1 by,

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.300
you can essentially reuse the tea.

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:03.590
The first time you drink it
it can be very, very intense.

01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:05.540
And in fact, some people find that mate

01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:08.010
almost tastes like burnt leaves.

01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:08.843
It's too intense.

01:39:08.843 --> 01:39:10.600
You don't want the water to be too hot.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.520
But I learned this trick from a friend.

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.690
You can reuse the leaves
over and over again,

01:39:14.690 --> 01:39:16.820
probably for about a
day before they go bad.

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:19.810
And in doing that, you start
to extract more and more

01:39:19.810 --> 01:39:23.010
of the compounds from the mate
leaf that increased GLP-1.

01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:23.843
So it's kind of cool.

01:39:23.843 --> 01:39:25.360
You can kind of get an increased effect.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.310
So what I'll typically do is
make a about 16 to 30 ounces

01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:30.350
and just sip it throughout the day,

01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:32.070
and I do like it before I train.

01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:33.620
Some people who don't like mate

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.350
might prefer something like guayusa,

01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:41.800
which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.600
G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa
which is from Ecuador,

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.670
despite the USA ending to it.

01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:49.503
It's from Ecuador.

01:39:49.503 --> 01:39:52.580
And it's a sweeter tasting tea.

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.410
It doesn't have any sweetener in it,

01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:57.180
but the leaf of the
guayusa plant is sweeter

01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.530
than the mate plant.

01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:00.060
I sometimes will mix the two

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.663
and then make the tea with that.

01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:05.340
There's no mate or guayusa
sponsor of the podcast.

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:09.700
These are just tools to increase
GLP-1 and fat oxidation.

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:14.640
And again, the Semaglutide
is the prescription version

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.890
of the that's kind of the heavy
artillery GLP-1 stimulant,

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:22.120
and again should be only
explored with a prescription.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.050
So those are the compounds

01:40:24.926 --> 01:40:28.420
that really increase
fat oxidation directly.

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:31.530
There are going to be a number
of things that impact insulin

01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:36.230
and glucagon that are
going to shift the body

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:37.570
toward more fat burning.

01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:40.150
We talked about a lot of
these during the episode

01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:41.460
on hormones.

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.293
We talked about it.

01:40:42.293 --> 01:40:44.490
We did a whole episode on
hormones and metabolism.

01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:46.720
And so for instance, berberine,

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.870
which comes from a plant
or metformin are compounds

01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:54.070
that are now in kind of growing use

01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.670
for reducing blood glucose.

01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:58.550
They are very potent at
reducing blood glucose,

01:40:58.550 --> 01:41:00.750
which will reduce insulin because the job

01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:04.390
of the hormone insulin is to
essentially manage glucose

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:05.570
in the bloodstream.

01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:08.560
So there are a huge gallery of compounds

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.200
that will reduce insulin

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.960
and thereby can increase fat oxidation.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.350
And that's because, as I mentioned before,

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:19.010
fat oxidation, this conversion
of fatty acids into ATP

01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:21.520
in the mitochondria is
inhibited by insulin.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.970
So if you keep insulin low,

01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:25.070
you're going to increase that process.

01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:27.310
Which brings us full circle back

01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:30.180
to the issue of diet and nutrition.

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:35.180
There is really solid
evidence from the Gardner Lab

01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:38.450
at Stanford and from
other labs showing that,

01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:40.310
when you look at different diets,

01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:41.990
you look at low fat diets,

01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:43.110
high fat diets,

01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:45.543
keto diets, intermittent fasting,

01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:49.340
provided people stick to
their particular diet,

01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:52.700
it doesn't really matter
which diet you follow.

01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.290
You can still get a caloric deficit

01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:55.523
and you get weight loss.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.750
Adherence however is always an issue.

01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:00.290
And so what I always say is,

01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:02.960
that you want to use the eating plan

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.670
that is obviously
beneficial to your health,

01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:08.070
but the one that allows you to adhere

01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:12.300
to whatever it is that the
particular nutrition protocol is,

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:13.133
right?

01:42:13.133 --> 01:42:14.290
If you can't stick with something,

01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:16.020
then it's not very worthwhile.

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.110
But from the purely scientific standpoint,

01:42:19.110 --> 01:42:22.940
there's also an advantage
to keeping insulin low.

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.090
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean

01:42:24.090 --> 01:42:25.700
you go to zero carbohydrate.

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.120
I've talked before about
my preferred way of eating

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.270
is to go lower or no
carbohydrates throughout the day

01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:33.440
for alertness to get that
adrenaline release and the focus

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.710
that goes with it, et cetera,

01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:36.590
and the ability to think and move

01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:38.450
and do all the things I
need to do during the day.

01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:39.900
And then I eat carbohydrates at night

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.760
'cause it facilitates
the transition to sleep.

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.820
That's what works for me.

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:46.730
But when insulin is low,

01:42:46.730 --> 01:42:51.730
you do place your system in a
position to oxidize more fat.

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.760
And so that's why I think a
lot of people do see benefit

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.940
from lower carbohydrate or
moderate carbohydrate diets,

01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:59.440
because when insulin is low,

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.300
you are in a position to oxidize more fat.

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.680
Both from exercise and at rest.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.440
And I should mention,
because I often mention

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.710
and it's appropriate to mention

01:43:08.710 --> 01:43:10.960
that if you're interested
in looking at the effects

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:14.700
of caffeine, of mate,
guayusa things of that sort,

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:17.010
GLP-1 you want to learn more about those.

01:43:17.010 --> 01:43:18.750
You can go to this wonderful website

01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:22.360
which is free www.examine.com.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.810
You can put in yerba mate,

01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:26.150
it will describe the three studies

01:43:26.150 --> 01:43:29.480
that show increased fat oxidation,

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.810
both during exercise and at rest,

01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:34.400
and as a consequence not
surprisingly and increase

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.798
in metabolic rate.

01:43:35.798 --> 01:43:38.960
One thing that's interesting about mate

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.840
is it causes a slight
decrease in heart rate

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.670
for reasons that still escape me.

01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:46.470
There's a single study showing

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:49.500
that heart rate is slightly reduced

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.070
which is kind of nice because if,

01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:52.310
when I drink too much caffeine

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:53.290
my heart rate goes up,

01:43:53.290 --> 01:43:55.730
maybe that would increase my
fidgeting and my fat burning,

01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.140
but I don't like the feeling
of having my basal heart rate

01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:59.310
being up too high.

01:43:59.310 --> 01:44:01.240
I like my heart rate
elevate during exercise,

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.730
but not when I'm just kind of resting

01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:04.430
or working and throughout the day.

01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:07.890
And for some reason
that I don't understand

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:11.840
there's an effect of mate
of increasing fat oxidation

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.560
but reducing heart rate just slightly.

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.590
So that's interesting.

01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:18.310
And it probably lends itself [indistinct]

01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:19.820
explains the subjective experience

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.730
that I've had of that mate
has kind of a little nice

01:44:21.730 --> 01:44:24.480
even mellow stimulant.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.480
It's not this really supercharged
stimulant like caffeine

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.200
from coffee or other sources.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.400
Although if you drink too much mate

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.023
it will also make you jittery.

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.630
And there's one more compound
that I think we should discuss

01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:38.590
in terms of increasing fat loss,

01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:41.750
and that's carnitine
or acetyl-L-carnitine,

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:43.233
they lie in the same pathway.

01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:48.730
We can return to our basic
knowledge now of fat mobilization

01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:49.753
and oxidation.

01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:54.280
After fat is mobilized
and makes it into cells

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:55.710
and needs to be oxidized.

01:44:55.710 --> 01:44:57.650
So the literally the burning of fat

01:44:57.650 --> 01:44:59.570
and conversion of it into energy

01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:04.600
that is accomplished and is facilitated

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:08.470
by the presence of
glucagon being elevated,

01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:13.470
GLP increases that process
and insulin being low.

01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:18.120
And we talked about some
ways to manage insulin

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.433
both in this episode
and in previous episode.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:24.900
L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:29.400
in particular facilitates fat oxidation.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.200
It helps convert fatty acids into ATP.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.930
And indeed supplementing
L-carnitine can increase fat loss.

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:37.973
That's been shown.

01:45:39.150 --> 01:45:40.550
At what dosages?

01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:43.681
Well, people ingest
anywhere from 500 milligrams

01:45:43.681 --> 01:45:47.950
to two grams per day in
divided doses typically.

01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:49.650
Some people who are really extreme

01:45:49.650 --> 01:45:52.670
are taking injectable L-carnitine,

01:45:52.670 --> 01:45:54.223
I've certainly not tried that.

01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:58.070
I confess I have used it in
pill form from time to time

01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:01.160
but in part, because of
the fat oxidation effects,

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:04.420
but also because of the other
effects that it tends to have.

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.730
So in exploring the effects
that acetyl-L-carnitine has,

01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:11.180
it has a huge variety of
effects on cellar metabolism.

01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.010
It can reduce ammonia in the blood

01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:16.010
that is actually a quite strong effect.

01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:18.090
It can reduce things
like C-reactive protein,

01:46:18.090 --> 01:46:21.310
which is you want to
C-reactive protein levels

01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:22.160
to be managed.

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.430
You do not want them too high.

01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:26.370
Can slightly reduce blood glucose.

01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:28.740
I can slightly increase HDLC,

01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:31.490
the good form of the blood lipid

01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:34.020
and slightly reduce overall cholesterol.

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:38.200
And as I mentioned, it can slightly modify

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.150
the pathway involving glucagon,

01:46:40.150 --> 01:46:41.890
such that you get a considerable effect,

01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:44.060
not a huge effect on fat oxidation,

01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:46.710
so it can improve pat oxidation rates.

01:46:46.710 --> 01:46:48.090
It has a number of other effects,

01:46:48.090 --> 01:46:51.650
some of which I talked
during the month on hormones

01:46:51.650 --> 01:46:53.750
and that sort of thing.

01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:57.120
It has strong effects
on rates of pregnancy

01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:58.190
and sperm quality.

01:46:58.190 --> 01:47:00.470
So clearly carnitine is doing
lots of different things

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:02.060
and lots of different cells.

01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.020
It's impacting sperm motility.

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:07.090
They're in a large number
of studies supporting that.

01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:09.560
Slight reductions in blood pressure

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:12.732
and has these interesting
effects on reducing fatigue

01:47:12.732 --> 01:47:14.100
during exercise,

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:17.040
reducing inflammatory
markers like interleukin 6.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.870
So it has a number of
effects that on the whole

01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:22.760
are quote unquote positive
or at least in the direction

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.200
of things that you may want.

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.530
And I should emphasize may.

01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:27.730
You certainly don't need
a acetyl-L-carnitine

01:47:27.730 --> 01:47:30.200
in order to lose fat,

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.300
but now that you understand
the cellular process

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:36.030
by which fat is mobilized and oxidized,

01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:37.840
it should make sense that if L-carnitine

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.710
is important for converting
fatty acids into energy,

01:47:42.710 --> 01:47:46.173
then supplementing L-carnitine make sense.

01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:50.550
Acetyl-L-carnitine is
the type of L-carnitine

01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:52.460
or the form of L-carnitine I should say,

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:56.437
that is transported and utilized
most easily by the body.

01:47:56.437 --> 01:47:58.260
And so that's why sometimes we distinguish

01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.210
between L-carnitine
and acetyl-L-carnitine.

01:48:01.210 --> 01:48:05.600
So once again, we've covered
an enormous amount of material.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.580
We've talked about the science of fat loss

01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:11.730
and in particular, we've
explored this topic

01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:14.480
from the perspective
of the nervous system.

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.560
How neurons and in particular
the release of things

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.560
like adrenaline, epinephrin
can facilitate fat mobilization

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.380
and oxidation.

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:27.090
We talked about NEAT, fidgeting,

01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:30.680
this non-exercise type movement

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.970
that can greatly increase caloric burn.

01:48:33.970 --> 01:48:35.650
And why that is.

01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:36.780
We talked about shiver,

01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:39.730
another form of non-exercise movement

01:48:39.730 --> 01:48:42.830
that can really increase
both caloric expenditure

01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:44.800
due to the shiver, due to the movement,

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.050
as well as increase thermogenesis
the heating up of the body

01:48:49.050 --> 01:48:50.440
through things like brown fat,

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.360
and even the conversion
of white fat to brown fat

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.903
which is a good thing if
you want to oxidize fat.

01:48:56.770 --> 01:48:59.212
We talked about cold as
a particular stimulus

01:48:59.212 --> 01:49:03.990
to induce shiver and
how to use getting into,

01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:07.170
an out of cold as a
way to stimulate shiver

01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:10.550
and avoid cold adaptation
so that you continue

01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:13.860
to oxidize and burn fat,
if that's your goal.

01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.570
If you want to check out
the protocols for that,

01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:19.110
there at www.thecoldplunge.com

01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:21.500
and in weeks to come
we're going to be adding

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.260
more protocols to that website

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:24.730
not just for fat loss,

01:49:24.730 --> 01:49:26.357
but for things like resilience,

01:49:26.357 --> 01:49:28.600
reducing inflammation, et cetera.

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.990
So be sure to check those out again,

01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:32.070
those are totally cost-free.

01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:33.900
Talked about exercise.

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.300
How rather than thinking
about cardiovascular

01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:38.130
or weight training exercise,

01:49:38.130 --> 01:49:40.750
that we should perhaps
look through the lens

01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:42.810
of this adrenaline system
and how it interacts

01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:46.210
with fat stores and
think about low, medium

01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:48.050
or high intensity exercise.

01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:50.010
Whether or not we show
up to that fasted or not.

01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:53.270
Turns out showing up to
that fasted can be useful,

01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:55.920
if you start with high intensity movements

01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.520
and then move into lower
intensity type exercise.

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.270
If you're going to go long duration,

01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:05.040
it probably doesn't matter
unless you're exercising longer

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.793
than 90 minutes, whether
or not you eat or not.

01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:12.010
We talked about caffeine as a stimulant

01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:16.350
and a stimulus for epinephrin
and adrenaline release

01:50:16.350 --> 01:50:20.000
as a way to access more fat metabolism.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.780
And we talked about compounds

01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:25.910
that come from things like
yerba mate and guayusa tea,

01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:30.880
this GLP-1 pathway that can
trigger increased fat oxidation

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.970
so much so that the
pharmaceutical companies

01:50:32.970 --> 01:50:34.930
are now developing compounds specifically

01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:39.370
to increase GLP-1 for treatment
of diabetes and obesity.

01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:41.850
But you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway

01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:43.680
through the ingestion of things like mate

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.060
or guayusa if that's of interest to you.

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:48.930
And then we talked about L-carnitine

01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:51.840
and how L-carnitine itself is critical

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.210
for the fat oxidation
within individual cells.

01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:56.880
The conversion of fatty acids to energy.

01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:00.340
And why having your insulin low

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:03.530
and things like L-carnitine
and glucagon levels

01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:07.697
high or sufficient at least can facilitate

01:51:07.697 --> 01:51:10.580
the burning of fat, fat oxidation.

01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:11.780
So we covered a lot of material.

01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:15.030
That's a lot of protocols
I realize that didn't...

01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:16.430
The little list I just gave right there

01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:19.130
didn't even begin to
get into all the details

01:51:19.130 --> 01:51:20.503
and corners that we discussed.

01:51:20.503 --> 01:51:23.810
I hope you found this
conversation interesting

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:26.210
both for sake of understanding fat loss

01:51:26.210 --> 01:51:29.140
and how to lose fat more
quickly and to lose more of it,

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:30.830
if that's your goal.

01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:33.250
As well as simply to
understand the biology

01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:35.250
of fat metabolism from
a different perspective,

01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:37.970
from the perspective
of the nervous system.

01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:39.430
If you're enjoying this podcast

01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:41.110
and you're benefiting from the information

01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:42.100
that you're learning,

01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:43.690
please subscribe on YouTube.

01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:45.300
That really helps us a lot.

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:47.850
There's also a notifications
button that you can hit

01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:51.370
that will notify you anytime
we release new content.

01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:53.330
We release new episodes every Monday,

01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:57.020
but sometimes we release
additional material in between.

01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.150
So please do subscribe on YouTube.

01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:02.660
As well if you could subscribe
on Apple and or Spotify

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.290
that's terrific and really helps us.

01:52:04.290 --> 01:52:08.150
And at Apple, you can give
us a five star review.

01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:09.900
If you think we deserve
a five-star review.

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.830
As well as you have the opportunity

01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:14.363
to give us feedback at Apple.

01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:17.350
The comment section on
YouTube is the place

01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:20.070
to give us feedback whether
or not you like an episode,

01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:21.540
whether or not you don't like an episode.

01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:24.080
Aspects that you particularly liked,

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.140
suggestions for future content.

01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:29.010
We do read, I do read
through all the comments.

01:52:29.010 --> 01:52:30.230
It takes me some time.

01:52:30.230 --> 01:52:31.460
I sometimes fall a little bit behind

01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:32.350
depending on other duties,

01:52:32.350 --> 01:52:33.860
but I read all the comments

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:35.640
and I do take them into account

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.020
when developing this material

01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.550
and the structure of the material.

01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:41.220
So please do provide feedback
in the comment section.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.810
We really appreciate it.

01:52:42.810 --> 01:52:44.600

01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:47.030

01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:48.760

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.600

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.010

01:53:00.168 --> 01:53:02.530
I've mentioned supplements
during the podcast.

01:53:02.530 --> 01:53:04.900
If you're interested
in taking supplements,

01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.750
you might want to check out Thorne.

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:08.670
T-H-O-R-N-E.

01:53:08.670 --> 01:53:09.890
We've partnered with Thorne

01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:12.390
because they have the
highest levels of stringency

01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:15.240
in terms of the quality of
the ingredients they use,

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.390
and the amounts of the
ingredients that they use.

01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:20.020
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:21.556
you can go to Thorne,

01:53:21.556 --> 01:53:26.556
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:29.420
And you can get 20% off
any of the supplements

01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.360
that are there,

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.780
as well as any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:36.843
That's thorne.com/u/huberman

01:53:40.050 --> 01:53:43.160
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.580
And last but not least,

01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:47.020
I want to thank you for your
time and attention today.

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.477
