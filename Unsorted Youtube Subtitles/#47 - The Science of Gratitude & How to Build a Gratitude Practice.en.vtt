00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.880
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.720
where we discuss science

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.494
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:09.270
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.720
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.500
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.600
Today, we are talking all
about the science of gratitude.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.450
In part, we're doing this

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.600
because of the upcoming
Thanksgiving holiday,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.750
which of course, is all about
giving thanks, gratitude,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.010
but also because there's
no a wealth of data

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.061
showing that having an
effective gratitude practice

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:32.880
can impact a huge number
of health variables;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.100
both mental health and physical
health in positive ways.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.530
Things like cardiovascular health,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.550
things like relationships,
things like mental health,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.760
things like physical and
cognitive performance.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.130
And these are not small effects.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.910
These are very large positive effects.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.750
However, in researching this episode,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060
I was completely surprised

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.730
as to what constitutes an
effective gratitude practice.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.800
I, I think like many of
you, would have thought

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.210
that an effective gratitude practice

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.440
simply involves writing down a few things

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.230
or many things that we're grateful for,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.720
or thinking about those.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.550
Or really making an effort to somaticize

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.900
or feel some of the elements of gratitude

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.730
while writing out that list
or thinking about that list.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.550
It turns out that an
effective gratitude practice

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.330
doesn't resemble that at all.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.670
The neuroimaging data,
the physiological data,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.520
looking at things like inflammatory
markers, other studies,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.020
purely looking at the
psychology and the long

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.960
and short-term effects of an
effective gratitude practice,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.400
point to a completely different
approach to using gratitude

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.870
to positively impact health metrics.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.830
Fortunately, these are things

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.710
that we can all do very easily.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.070
Some of them were actually fun.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.000
You can do them in a variety of contexts.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.680
So today we're going to
talk about the science

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.760
of effective gratitude practices,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.310
and we're going to describe what those are

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.720
and how you can incorporate
them into your life.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.320
Before we dive into today's topic,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.480
I just want to highlight

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.240
a particularly interesting set of findings

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.630
from the literature.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.990
This is a study that came out
in the journal Cell Report,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.810
Cell Press journal, excellent journal.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.970
It's very relevant to today's topic.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.760
In fact, we're going to spend
more time with this paper

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.720
a little bit later in the episode.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.636
The study involved having
subjects listen to a story.

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:14.810
The subjects are all
listening to the same story,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.870
but those subjects are not
listening to it together.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.260
They're not rounded up in
a circle or all in a room,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.190
they're in separate rooms

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.570
or entirely separate
locations on the planet,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.180
or they are actually
brought into the laboratory

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.173
on separate days.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.890
What this study found is
that different subjects

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.000
listening to the same story,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.683
undergo the same variation in heart rate.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.180
In other words, the gaps
between their heartbeats

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.020
start to resemble one another
in response to the same story.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.350
Now, this is very interesting.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.690
This is a coordination of
the physiology of the body

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.600
in response to a narrative,
a story in different people.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.040
And yet when they line up the heart rates

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.150
of these different people
who listen to the story

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.660
at completely different times,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.060
they find that those heart rates

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.630
map onto one another almost identically.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.314
It's really remarkable.

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:08.330
We're going to talk about what this means

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.180
in terms of coordination of
neural circuits in the brain

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.670
and neural circuits in the body,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.460
and the organs such as the heart,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.400
but also the lungs and
other organs of the body,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.090
and what this means for
changing one's overall state.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.170
A key theme that's going to
come up today again and again

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.880
is the distinction between traits,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.670
which are kind of pervasive
aspects of who we are

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.700
and how we tend to react

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.700
to different types of circumstances,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.810
and states, which are more transient.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.630
They tend to, you know, you
can invoke a state in somebody,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.100
a state of fear or a state of relaxation.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.620
But what this study
really starts to point to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.350
is that there are specific approaches

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.740
that any of us can take

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.690
in order to really rewire
our nervous system,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.530
such that we are calmer,
if we want to be calmer

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.930
in certain circumstances,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.610
that we are more responsive
in certain circumstances,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.670
if that's our goal.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.870
So we'll return to how one
would go about doing that.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.570
But I think these results
are just beautiful

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.350
in the sense that they really show

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.420
that our brain and our
body are highly coordinated

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.607
because people are listening to the story

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:10.360
and the heart rate is changing
in response to the story,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.270
but that there is what
we call a stereotypy;

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.600
sort of stereotyped
response to a given story.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.790
In my mind, there was no reason

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.610
why the results had to be this way.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.990
Two people listen to the same story,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.900
why should their heart
rates be almost identical

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.010
to the same story?

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.020
Very, very interesting and
points to the power of narrative

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.950
and story in coordinating our physiology.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.030
And this is something
powerful that we can leverage.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.380
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.970
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.940
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.610
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.420
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.390
And keeping with that theme,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.210
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.070
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.110
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.410
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.440
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.780
and I can tell you that the visual system

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.470
has a number of important features

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.580
that allow you to see
things with crystal clarity,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.460
no matter what environment you're in.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.160
So that means if you're in bright sunlight

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.520
or you go into shadows,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.320
you should be able to
see everything clearly.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.320
But many eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.880
actually short circuit that
feature of our visual system,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.900
and make it such that we
have to take off our glasses,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.130
or if our screen dims,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.120
we feel like we can't
see things quite right.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.980
ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.940
have completely solved that problem.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.410
In addition, they're very lightweight,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.480
so you don't even remember
that they're on your face.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.660
And if you get sweaty,
they don't slip off.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.380
They were actually designed
for cycling and running

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.520
and things of that sort, but
they have a terrific aesthetic.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.760
So I wear readers at
night or out to dinner,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.930
or when I'm driving, I
wear their sunglasses.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.210
And the aesthetics are really terrific,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.940
even though they're so-called
performance glasses.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.340
'Cause as many of you know,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.730
performance glasses often
make people look like cyborgs.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.180
These sunglasses and eyeglasses
have the kind of aesthetic

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.270
that you can wear them anywhere;

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.230
while cycling, running,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.570
but also doing anything
else you might be doing.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.490
If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.620
that's R-O-K-A.com and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.540
to save 20% off your first order.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.860
Again, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.140
and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.400
Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.920
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.380
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.900
to help you better meet your immediate

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.870
and long-term health goals.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.790
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.500
For the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.760
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.420
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.880
And now, with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.050
you can also get insights into your genes

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.650
and how those affect or
should affect your immediate

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.790
and long-term health choices.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.310
A big problem with a lot of blood tests

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.180
and DNA tests out there, however,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.550
is that you get the data back

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.360
and you don't know what
to do with the data.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.950
Inside Tracker has solve that problem

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.320
with a very easy to use dashboard,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.310
where you get your numbers
back from your blood tests

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.190
or your DNA tests,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.050
and then it points to
specific lifestyle factors,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.070
nutritional factors, and so forth,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.230
that can allow you to bring
the numbers into the ranges

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.447
that are optimal for you.

00:06:57.447 --> 00:07:00.250
And this is a huge advantage
over other blood tests

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.880
and DNA tests out there.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.710
Another feature that Inside Tracker has

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.740
is their InnerAge test.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.730
The InnerAge test shows you
what your biological age is,

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.370
and you can compare that
to your chronological age.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.620
And of course, your
biological age is equally,

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.930
if not more important than
your chronological age.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.220
So this is an important number

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.150
that you can get from Inside Tracker.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.690
If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.940
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.950
to get 25% off any of

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.550
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Magic Spoon.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.120
Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.890
keto-friendly cereal.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.880
Now, I'm not following a
ketogenic nutrition plan.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.220
What works best for me is to
fast until about 11:00 a.m.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.510
or noon most days, and then to
eat a low carbohydrate lunch,

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.090
a low carbohydrate snack in the afternoon,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.800
and in the evening is
when I eat my starches.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.640
That's what allows me to
be alert throughout the day

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.490
for work, for exercise and so forth,

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.190
and then to sleep really well at night.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.680
That's just what works for me.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.550
But it does require
that throughout the day,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.020
I am eating fewer carbohydrates
than I am at night.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.610
And oftentimes I want a snack,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.610
and the snack I want
is usually Magic Spoon.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.590
Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.200
13 to 14 grams of protein,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.460
and only four net grams of
carbohydrates in each serving.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.800
It's absolutely delicious.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.670
I particularly like the frosted flavor

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.700
'cause it tastes like donuts.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.670
And then I try not to eat donuts.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.970
No vendetta against donuts,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.510
but it's not really compatible
with my eating plan.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.270
They also have flavors like
cocoa, fruity, peanut butter.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.580
They're really delicious.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.820
Any ideas you have about
keto-friendly cereals

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.600
and foods not being delicious,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.730
you have to try Magic Spoon,
it'll change your mind.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.980
In fact I'm getting hungry just
thinking about it right now.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.190
If you want to try Magic Spoon,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.030

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.560
Let's talk about gratitude.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.040
And to begin, I'd like to
emphasize the various aspects

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.250
of mental and physical health

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.650
that have been shown to benefit

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.890
from a regular gratitude practice.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.810
There are studies showing

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.460
that performing a gratitude
practice twice or three times,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.560
or even just once a week,
can lead to a pervasive,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.814
a long lasting impact
on subjective wellbeing.

00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:35.910
People report feeling
happier, more meaning, joy,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.610
even awe for their life experience,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.470
simply in response to
adding a gratitude practice.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.760
The key thing is it has to be
the right gratitude practice.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.640
And we're going to talk about

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.522
what the right gratitude
practice looks like

00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:48.350
in just a little bit.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.675
But there are additional
benefits of a gratitude practice.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:56.200
There are studies showing that
a regular gratitude practice

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.750
can provide resilience
to trauma, in two ways;

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.720
it can provide a reframing

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.270
and resilience to prior
traumatic experiences.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.220
So buffering people

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.890
against the negative physiological effects

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.060
and psychological effects
of earlier trauma,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.010
but also inoculating them in many ways

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.020
to any traumas that might
arrive later in life.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.700
So that's a powerful thing.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.340
And today we will talk about

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.600
how that's actually accomplished.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.310
It's actually accomplished
by shifting the way

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.290
that the fear and defense networks

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.390
in the brain actually function.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.710
And we'll get right down
into the details of that.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.650
The other thing that a
gratitude practice does

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.379
is it's been shown to
benefit social relationships.

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:36.700
But not just for the relationship

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.480
in which you express gratitude, right?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.110
So on the face of it, you might think,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.610
okay, if I express gratitude
for somebody over and over,

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.880
over and over, over and over,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.560
then I'm going to feel
better about that person.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.410
And indeed, that is one effect
of a gratitude practice.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.680
That's called a pro-social

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.910
or interstitial social gratitude practice.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.840
But there are now several studies,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.410
recent studies in good
journals pointing to the fact

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.640
that a regular gratitude
practice can also enhance

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.200
one's social relationships
across the board;

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.820
in the workplace, at
school, at with family

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.090
and romantic relationships,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.930
and even one's relationship to themselves,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.430
which is really what
the subjective feelings

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.550
of wellbeing are.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.290
So it's clear to me that
ineffective gratitude practice

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.280
has an outsized effect
on many, many aspects

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.770
of mental and physical health.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.603
And for those of you

00:11:21.603 --> 00:11:23.820
that are coming to this
conversation thinking,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.720
gratitude practice, oh, that's
kind of wishy-washy or woo,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.780
it's going to involve putting
your hand on your heart

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.670
and feeling into all the amazing things

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.560
that you happen to have,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.950
even when things are really terrible,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.394
that's not where we're going at all.

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.930
And equally important is to understand

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.870
that the neurochemical,
the anti-inflammatory

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.870
and the neural circuit mechanisms
that gratitude can invoke

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.210
are equally on par with some
of the effects of pharmacology,

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.150
of things like high
intensity interval training

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.330
and exercise, and other
things that we think of

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.690
as kind of more potent
forms of self intervention.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.150
So if you are of the mindset
that a gratitude practice

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.810
is kind of weak sauce, buckle up,

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.710
because the data actually
points to the fact

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.200
that a gratitude practice
is a very, very potent way

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.720
in which you can steer your
mental and physical health

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.400
in positive directions,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.920
and that those effects
are very long lasting.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.020
Before we dive into the
tools and mechanisms

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.690
and scientific studies around gratitude,

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.540
I'd like to just set the
framework for the discussion.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.160
Gratitude is what we call
a pro-social behavior

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.640
or a pro-social mindset.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.840
Now, you can be grateful for something

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.920
without it involving anybody else.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.450
So the social part isn't
meant to convey anything

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.630
about interpersonal
relations, although it can.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.070
And today we're going to talk a lot about

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.750
how interpersonal relations
can be incorporated

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.640
into a gratitude practice
in really powerful ways.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.570
But pro-social behaviors
are basically any behavior

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.910
or mode of thinking that
allow us to be more effective

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.490
in interactions with other
people, including ourselves.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.380
Now pro-social is not
just a name that we give

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.800
these different tools and
practices and mindsets.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.130
They're actually neural
circuits in the brain

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.940
that are specifically wired

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.230
for pro-social thoughts and behaviors.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.800
And these are distinctly different

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.070
from the circuits in the brain

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.470
that are involved in defensive behaviors.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.070
So without getting into too much detail,

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.460
just yet, we will later,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.750
we have circuits in the brain

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.690
that are what we call appetitive.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.000
They are designed to
bring us closer to things

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.060
and to bring us into closer relation

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.060
to the details of that sensory experience.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.200
Now that could be a delicious
food that you're eating,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.840
it could be interacting with a loved one,

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.330
it could be interacting with a friend

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.980
or anyone that you happen to like,

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.980
it could even be in your
relation to yourself.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.550
These circuits that we're
calling pro-social circuits

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.610
light up in the brain in neuroimaging,

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.720
meaning the neurons are
firing more actively,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.425
more electrically robustly;

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:51.750
sort of like turning up the volume

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.700
on these neural circuits in the brain.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.400
And the neural circuits in the brain

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.430
that are associated with
aversive or defensive behaviors;

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.770
things like backing up things,

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.730
like covering up the
vital organs of the body,

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.760
things like a quaking of the voice,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.460
all of the things are associated
with defensive behaviors

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.760
are actually antagonized,
meaning they are reduced

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.820
when the pro-social
circuits are more active.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.730
So the framework here that I'd like to set

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.430
is that we have this kind of seesaw

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.950
of neural circuits in the brain.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.810
One set that are
pro-social and are designed

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.940
to bring us closer to
others, including ourselves,

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.460
closer to certain sensory
experiences, right?

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.180
Because a lot of pro-social behaviors

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.460
can also be geared towards
things like pets or food,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.110
or anything that we find
we want to be closer to

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.170
and want more of.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.870
Whereas the defensive circuits
involve areas of the brain,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.510
yes, such as areas that
are involved in fear,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.920
but also areas of the brain and body

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.890
that are literally
associated with freezing

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.200
or with backing up.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.910
So the way to think about gratitude

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.530
is that falls under this
category of pro-social behaviors,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.363
which are designed

00:14:53.363 --> 00:14:56.750
to bring us closer to
different types of things,

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.920
and to enhance the level of detail

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.340
that we extract from those experiences.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.750
Now, the existence of
these two neuro circuits

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.570
that I've placed on this sort
of a metaphorical seesaw,

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.403
if you will,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.570
runs counter to a lot of
the messaging or the ideas

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.210
that were put forth in the last century

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.980
about the psychology of
happiness and gratitude,

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.980
versus the psychology of
depression and struggle

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.468
and concern about the future.

00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:30.410
In fact, I'd like to read
a quote from the great,

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.400
and we really should call
him the great Sigmund Freud,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.850
because despite having certain traits

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.180
that people criticize him of,

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.070
Freud was indeed a genius

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.860
about many aspects of psychology.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.410
But I just want to read you
Freud's stance on happiness.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.110
And this invokes elements
of gratitude as well.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.023
And then you can gauge for yourself.

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:58.100
"Our possibilities of happiness
are already restricted

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.650
by our constitution."

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.350
So he's saying that we're basically wired

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.857
to not have happiness easily.

00:16:03.857 --> 00:16:06.390
"Unhappiness is much less
difficult to experience.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.930
We are threatened with
suffering from three directions;

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.480
one from our own body,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.797
which is doomed to decay and disillusion,

00:16:12.797 --> 00:16:15.250
and which cannot even do without pain

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.140
and anxiety as warning signals.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.980
Two, from the external world,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.080
which may rage against
us with overwhelming

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.080
and merciless forces of destruction.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.730
And three and finally, from
our relations with others,

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.930
the suffering of which
from this last source

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.340
is perhaps more painful
to us than any other."

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.630
That's Sigmund Freud.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.203
And not all of his writings
were pessimistic, if you will.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.018
What Freud is referring to there

00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:42.420
are those defensive circuits.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.960
And of course, he talks about
psychological defensives.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.120
And in full disclosure, I am a huge fan

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.577
of much of the psychological literature

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:55.160
and psychoanalysis of Sigmund
Freud and his descendants,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.380
like Young and others.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.670
I think there are strong
elements of truth there.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.640
But he gives you a sense
of the kind of mindset

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.444
of psychology early in the last century.

00:17:03.444 --> 00:17:05.230
And then of course, was the emergence

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.930
of the positive psychology movement,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.167
which was really about
invoking the understanding

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:14.350
and eventually the elucidation
of the neural circuits

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.440
for things like happiness
and awe and affiliation

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.070
and things that we are
calling pro-social circuits.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.240
So the field of psychology as
a dark and light, if you will,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.310
and the field of neuroscience
has a dark and light.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.350
We have these what we call
parallel pathways in the brain.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.270
And we have parallel pathways in the mind

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.340
that set us up for
feeling good about things

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.670
or for feeling less good about things.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.900
I think what's really salient
from the quote from Freud

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.610
is that what he's saying is our default

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.730
is to be concerned about the future,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.610
to be wrapped in our defenses,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.215
and to some extent that's true.

00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:50.710
And the reason we can say that's true

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.340
is because most of us
need a gratitude practice.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.840
We need to do certain things

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.550
in order to feel good and to feel happy.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.290
We actually have to put work into it.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.100
It is quite possible
that there's an asymmetry

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.740
in the way that these pro-social

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.120
versus defensive circuits are set up,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.710
such that because defensive circuits

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.220
are designed to keep us safe,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.870
psychologically and physically safe,

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.280
that they have more robustness,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.220
or they can actually drive
our behavior more easily.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.290
I'll give you an analogy in the system

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.340
that I'm most familiar
with as a neuroscientist,

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.740
which is the visual system.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.237
In the visual system, we
have parallel pathways.

00:18:27.237 --> 00:18:30.590
We have neurons in our eye that respond

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.710
when things in our
environment get brighter.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.360
Literally when the lights go up,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.390
these neurons start firing like crazy.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.770
And we have neurons in our eye

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.590
that respond when things get darker,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:43.178
when things start dimming
or go from white to black.

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:48.178
The circuits for detecting
darkening are much more robust

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.280
and much more numerous than are
the circuits for brightness.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.080
And that is probably related, probably,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.080
to the fact that dark objects
or experiencing looming,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.640
meaning incoming objects and
being able to perceive them

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.930
is something that's vital to our survival.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.860
Whereas being able to perceive
the brightening of things

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.200
might be important to
survival in certain contexts;

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.430
a car lights coming at you at night

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.660
or something of that sort,

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.810
but not as often in a
kind of a evolutionary

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.570
or ecological context as
the darkening of things.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.050
So, I think Freud's quote
and the field of psychology

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.140
now point to the fact that indeed we have

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.560
the capacity for happiness
and we have the capacity

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.510
for great worry and concern
and depression and unhappiness.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.960
And the neural circuit
literature also supports that.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.010
The key thing for today's discussion

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.970
is that gratitude turns out to be

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.820
one of the most potent wedges

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.290
by which we can insert our thinking,

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.500
and as you also see, the
physiology of our body,

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.020
between these two circuits,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.170
and give a little more
levity, if you will,

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.380
to the side of the seesaw

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.440
that's associated with
positive pro-social feelings.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.790
And if you keep imagining
this seesaw imagery,

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.310
what's really beautiful
about gratitude practices

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.070
is that if they're performed repeatedly,

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.670
and not even that often, but repeatedly,

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.860
then one can actually
shift their neural circuits

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.540
such that the seesaw that
I'm calling pro-social

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.250
versus defensive behaviors,
can actually start to tilt.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.720
And the little hinge, if you will,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.760
on the seesaw in the
middle can be adjusted

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.610
in a little tighter when
the side for gratitude

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.390
and for wellbeing and
for feelings of happiness

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.850
is a little bit higher.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.245
What this means is that,

00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:35.940
whether or not Freud was right or wrong,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.350
whether or not the neuroscientists

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.340
in one camp or another
were right or wrong,

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.710
we now know with certainty that
a regular gratitude practice

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.690
can shift the pro-social circuit

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.350
so that they dominate our
physiology and our mindset

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.470
in ways that can enhance
many, many aspects

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.890
of our physical and
mental health by default.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.370
So we don't always have to
constantly be in practice

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.950
trying to be happy.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.306
So the succinct way of saying all this is,

00:21:01.306 --> 00:21:03.490
yes, indeed, we might be wired

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.300
or in such that we have
a greater propensity

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.290
for unhappiness than happiness.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.970
But gratitude practices provided
they are the effective ones

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.360
and they're performed regularly,
can shift those circuits,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.800
such that we are happier on average,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.280
even when we are not
performing those practices.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.587
Now I'd like to talk about
some of the neurochemistry

00:21:24.587 --> 00:21:27.620
and neural circuits
associated with gratitude

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.710
and pro-social behaviors.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.130
Numerous times on this podcast,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.570
I've talked about
so-called neuromodulators.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.280
For those of you that might've forgotten

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.500
or have never heard of
neuromodulators before,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.810
neuromodulators are chemicals

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.900
that are released in the brain and body

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.680
that change the activity
of other neural circuits.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.870
They make certain brain areas
more likely to be active

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.600
and other brain areas
less likely to be active.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.020
These neuromodulators have
names like dopamine, serotonin,

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.963
acetylcholine, epinephrin, and so on.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.010
The main neuromodulators
associated with gratitude

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.490
and pro-social behaviors
tends to be serotonin.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.890
Serotonin is released

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.850
from a very small collection
of neurons in the brainstem

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.700
called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E,
the raphe nucleus,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.250
and a few other places in the brain.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.760
And the raphe neuron
send these little wires

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.080
that we call axons out to
numerous places in the brain.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.190
And they tend to increase the activity

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.910
of particular neurocircuits
that lend themselves

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.880
to more approach to particular
types of experiences.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.200
That makes total sense
if you think about it.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.080
Have a chemical that under
certain circumstances

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.520
is released in the brain,

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.600
that triggers the activity
of neural circuits,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.940
that makes the organism, you,

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.460
more likely to stay in an
interaction with something,

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.780
or even lean in and seek a
more detailed interaction

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.430
with that person, place or thing.

00:22:52.311 --> 00:22:57.090
Beautiful work from a
cognitive neuropsychologist.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.140
His name is Antonio Demasio.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.440
He's a world-class neuroscientists.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.240
Has been in the game a very long time.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.460
Has explored the so-called
neural correlates of gratitude.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.090
And two main brain areas are activated

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.450
by these serotonergic systems.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.990
And when people experience something

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.490
that makes them feel gratitude,

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.890
even if it's shallow gratitude or deep,

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.990
and if it's all the way to deep gratitude,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.620
they see activation of these
particular brain circuits

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.550
I'll mention in a moment.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.760
And the amount of activation scales

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.630
with how intensely the person experience

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.540
the feeling of gratitude.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.500
And those two areas have particular names.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.570
You don't need to know the names,

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.870
but for those of you that want to know,

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.960
they are the anterior cingulate cortex

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.910
and the medial prefrontal cortex.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.380
And of course, these
brain areas are connected

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.470
to a number of other
networks in the brain.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.590
In fact, that's how they get you or others

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.635
to lean into certain experiences.

00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:53.440
Because when these areas are active,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.080
certain thought processes get invoked.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.020
Those thought processes probably
resemble something like,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.060
hmm, I'd like to experience more of this,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.520
or hmm, this feels really good.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.620
And then they literally
feed onto your muscles

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.900
via the neurons, making you
happy to stay stationary,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.350
if you're experiencing something you like,

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.140
or to move closer to something

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.730
that you find attractive to you literally.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.620
So these are powerful circuits.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.950
Of these two brain areas,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.760
the one I'd like to focus on the most

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.536
is the medial prefrontal cortex.

00:24:25.536 --> 00:24:26.840
Many of you have probably heard

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.570
of the medial prefrontal cortex,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.429
because this is the area of the brain

00:24:30.429 --> 00:24:35.180
that is involved in planning
and in deep thinking

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.790
and evaluation of different
types of experiences,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.523
past, present, or future.

00:24:39.523 --> 00:24:42.440
It seems actually that
pretty much every study

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.400
of human anything seems to involve

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.700
the medial prefrontal cortex,

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.780
or at least one could get that impression

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.470
just by looking at scientific abstracts

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.188
and papers these days.

00:24:51.188 --> 00:24:53.930
So I think it's worth us
taking a step back and asking,

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.260
what is the medial prefrontal
cortex really do, right?

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.610
How could this one piece
of neural real estate

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.760
that we all have right
behind our forehead,

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.110
how could that be involved
in so many different things?

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.590
And the reason it can be involved

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.620
in so many different things,

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.260
and the reason it's especially
important for gratitude

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.650
is that medial prefrontal
cortex sets context, okay?

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.970
It sets context and it literally defines

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.340
the meaning of your experience.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.690
Now this is not at all
an abstract phenomenon.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.442
I'm going to give a very
physiological example of this,

00:25:25.442 --> 00:25:27.840
and then we're going to
translate to gratitude.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.890
But I really want everyone to understand,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.210
how is it that medial prefrontal cortex

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.790
sets the context of
everything in your life?

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.510
Well, it does it the following way.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.460
You have a number of
circuits deeper in your brain

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.160
that simply create some
sensations or they allow you,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.610
I should say, to perceive
certain sensations.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.180
Let's use the example of cold exposure,

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.180
something that we'd sometimes
talk about in this podcast,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.542
for other reasons.

00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:56.333
If you were to deliberately
place yourself into an ice bath,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.680
it would be uncomfortable,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.023
even if you're adapted
to cold and so forth.

00:26:02.474 --> 00:26:05.780
The discomfort is non-negotiable.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.030
However, if you are doing
it because you want to,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.640
or because you have knowledge

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.743
that there are particular health benefits,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.330
the medial prefrontal cortex

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.980
can then control areas
of your deeper brain,

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.180
like the hypothalamus,
to positively impact

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.480
the neurochemicals that are
released into your system.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.170
You'll still get a lot of adrenaline

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.840
by getting into the ice bath.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.930
But the fact that you are
doing this deliberately,

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.420
and your knowledge that
you are making the choice,

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.430
that it's you that's
deciding to put yourself

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.510
through this discomfort,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.890
has been shown to create a very different

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.290
and positive effect on
things like dopamine,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.230
on things like anti-inflammatory markers,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.780
in your immune system, et cetera,

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.700
compared to if someone
pushes you into an ice bath,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.430
or if you are doing it
because someone insists

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.820
that you do it and you
really, really don't want to.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.830
So there's a very subtle distinction here.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.970
It's just the distinction
of motivation and desire,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.720
or lack of motivation and
being forced into something.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.383
And there are a number
of other effects of this

00:27:09.383 --> 00:27:10.850
that have been described.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.240
In the episode with Robert Sapolsky

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.290
that I did earlier this last year,

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.270
he talked about a study in animals,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.640
which has also been shown in humans.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.400
If you take a mouse for instance,

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.030
and it runs on a running wheel,

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.830
which mice really like to do,

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.450
there are many positive effects
on reducing blood pressure,

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.530
improvements in neurochemistry,
et cetera, in that mouse.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.910
However, if there's a mouse
in the cage right next to it

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.240
that's trapped in the running wheel

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.300
and it has to run every
time the other mouse runs

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.680
'cause the wheels are linked,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.360
well, then the second
mouse that's forced to do

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.520
the exact same running
experiences negative shifts

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.710
in their overall health metrics.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.340
Blood pressure goes up, stress
hormones go up, et cetera,

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.540
because it's not actually
making the choice.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.700
Medial prefrontal cortex is the knob,

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.750
or the switch rather, that
can take one experience

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.120
and allow us to frame it

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.020
such that it creates
positive health effects.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.870
And the exact same experience

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.170
framed as something we don't want to do,

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.580
or that we are forced to do

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.660
can create negative health effects.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.510
Now how exactly the neurons
and medial prefrontal cortex

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.400
do that is rather complicated,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.620
and frankly not completely understood.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.680
But it's somehow able to adjust

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.210
the activity of other neural circuits

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.430
that are purely reflexive.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.770
As we say, neuroscience, like
really dumb neural circuits,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.440
they're just like switches,
and place a context onto it.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.220
So, gratitude is a mindset

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.810
that activates prefrontal cortex,

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.440
and in doing so sets the
context of your experience

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.640
such that you can derive
tremendous health benefits.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.210
Which leads us to the question;

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.810
what kind of gratitude practice

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.690
is going to accomplish this, right?

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.130
Because it is not simply the
case that I could take a knife,

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.420
don't please, don't do this experiment,

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.740
and cut my hand and say, oh, you
know, I'm going to enjoy this.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.820
I'm doing this 'cause this is
good for me and it won't hurt.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.653
Of course it'll hurt,

00:29:02.653 --> 00:29:05.141
just like the ice bath
is cold, no matter what.

00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:08.560
But I can't lie to myself, right?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.950
If I have some knowledge that
cutting myself is bad for me,

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.800
that's very hard to override.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.280
And so, the medial prefrontal cortex

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.968
has a tremendous capacity to set context.

00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:23.290
And it does that beautifully
with respect to gratitude.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.320
But you can't simply lie to yourself.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.070
You can't simply say, oh,
well, every experience

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.470
is a learning experience,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:33.420
or a terrible thing happens, oh, good,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.860
I'm just going to say good,

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.590
and that your body will react
as if it's good for you.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.570
That's a myth.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.360
And frankly, it's a myth
that's fairly pervasive

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.010
in the self-help and
self-actualization literature.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.780
We have the opportunity
to reframe and set context

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.030
on our experiences.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.890
But that requires a very
specific set of practices.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.210
We can't simply lie to
ourselves or quote unquote,

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.810
fake it until we make it.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.470
Neural circuitry is very
powerful and very plastic.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.670
It can be modified and it's
very context-dependent,

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.830
but it's not stupid.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.360
And when you lie to yourself about whether

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.613
or not an experience is
actually good for you or not,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.380
your brain knows.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.020
So what does an effective
gratitude practice look like?

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.710
Well, let's examine what an ineffective,

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.430
what a poor gratitude practice looks like.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.120
Because therein lies some
really important information,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.690
including the fact that I,

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.959
and I think millions of
other people out there

00:30:28.959 --> 00:30:30.303
are doing it wrong.

00:30:31.428 --> 00:30:34.300
Most gratitude practices
that you see online

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.070
and that people talk about
in various talks and so forth

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.420
involves something like
writing down or reciting,

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.483
or thinking about five or
10 or three or 20 things

00:30:46.483 --> 00:30:48.960
that you're especially grateful for.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.140
And then really trying to
feel into some of those,

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:56.140
really try and think
deeply about the emotions,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.320
the sensations, the
perceptions that are associated

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.650
with those particular people,

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.363
places and things on your list.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.530
Most studies actually
point to the fact that

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.850
that style of gratitude practice

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.700
is not particularly effective in shifting

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.300
your neural circuitry,
your neural chemistry,

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.510
or your somatic circuitry,
the circuits in your body,

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.450
'cause you literally have
organs and neural circuits

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.580
that are connected,

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.350
the circuits of your brain and body

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.340
toward enhanced activation
of prefrontal cortex,

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.460
enhanced activation of these
pro-social neural networks

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.460
that we were talking about earlier.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.760
Now that may come as a
surprise to many of you,

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.253
and certainly came as a surprise to me.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.420
There is some evidence
that if there's a shift

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.710
in so-called autonomic arousal

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.980
during these gratitude practices,

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.140
these ones that I'm calling ineffective,

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.680
that they can be made
slightly more effective.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.280
So what do I mean by a
shift in autonomic arousal?

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.060
Well, very briefly we have a
aspect to our nervous system,

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.410
both within our brain and body

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.860
that we call the autonomic nervous system.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.693
It's a little bit of a misnomer

00:32:02.693 --> 00:32:04.690
because autonomic means automatic.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.880
And in fact, we can take control

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.360
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.880
It has one branch, meaning
one set of connections

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.610
and circuits that are associated
with making us more alert,

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.683
the so-called sympathetic nervous system,

00:32:17.683 --> 00:32:19.520
or I should say sympathetic arm

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.630
of the autonomic nervous system,

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.850
but that's really a mouthful.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.310
It's really associated with
enhanced alertness of any kind

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.930
for excitement or fear,

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.520
and it has nothing to do with sympathy.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.090
It's just about enhanced alertness.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.970
And then the other arm of
the autonomic nervous system

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.454
is the so-called parasympathetic arm

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.287
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:32:37.287 --> 00:32:38.280
But that's also a mouthful.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.390
So let's just say it's the calming aspect

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.810
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.170
So it's associated with
decreased heart rate,

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.840
decreased breathing rate, et cetera.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.950
So we have these two aspects,
our autonomic nervous system,

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.800
and it has been shown
that if people are brought

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.390
into a state of heightened
sympathetic tone,

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.550
meaning more alertness,

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.930
then the intensity of the
emotions that they experience

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.430
in their gratitude practice is enhanced,

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.830
and the effectiveness of
that gratitude practice

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.640
can be enhanced.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.050
This is seen nowadays somewhat
commonly as having people,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.640
for instance, cyclic
hyperventilated breathing,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.640
as we call it in my laboratory.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.093
Breathing that's very intense so that,

00:33:22.093 --> 00:33:24.530
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale very deeply

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.880
for 25 or 30 breaths.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.760
Then people will sit
in a meditative stance,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.410
or they'll focus on
their notepad and paper.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.760
And they'll write out the things
that they're grateful for.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.980
And then they'll really try
and feel into those things,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.460
or they'll think about those things.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.870
And it makes perfect sense

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.136
as to why enhancing autonomic arousal

00:33:41.136 --> 00:33:46.130
toward more alertness would
create more robust feelings

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.860
or more robust impact of
the gratitude practices,

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.850
because in that state, you are more alert

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.070
and therefore you are
able to bring more detail,

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.890
more richness to the perception
and the understanding

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.930
of what those things on
your list happened to be.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.550
And I should say

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.300
that there are numerous
other approaches to this.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.730
Sort of self-help type stuff

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.540
and self actualization seminars.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.610
People will do things like cold baths,

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:11.900
or they'll do chanting,

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.510
or they'll have any number
of different experiences

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.710
all of which are mainly geared

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.240
towards increased autonomic arousal.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.470
There even practices out there

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:22.290
using pharmacology to create
increased autonomic arousal

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.036
and then drop into gratitude.

00:34:24.036 --> 00:34:29.010
Across the board, those
increase the potency

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.770
of the gratitude practice of
listing things out on paper

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.500
or in one's mind or saying them out loud.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.980
But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.940
that form of just expressing
thanks, expressing gratitude

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.900
is not the most effective way

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.170
to shift these pro-social circuits

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.140
in positive ways for one's physiology

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.453
and anatomy and psychology.

00:34:53.327 --> 00:34:57.310
It turns out that the most
potent form of gratitude practice

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.160
is not a gratitude practice
where you give gratitude

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.490
or express gratitude,

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.430
but rather where you receive gratitude,

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.070
where you receive thanks.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.320
And this to me was very surprising.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.540
There are a number of
studies about this now.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.000
One in particular that I
think is interesting is called

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.790
Prefrontal activation while listening

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.610
to a letter of gratitude read aloud

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.583
by a coworker face-to-face: A NIRS study.

00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:21.416
N-I-R-S.

00:35:21.416 --> 00:35:22.600
I'll explain what all this means.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.290
You now know what the
prefrontal activation part is.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.540
This is activation in
the prefrontal cortex.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.740
The NIRS, N-I-R-S study,
that's just a technical term.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.460
It's a form of imaging brain activity.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.530
It's noninvasive.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.690
So it's kind of a skullcap.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.140
It looks like a hoodie

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.200
with a bunch of wires
coming out of it basically,

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.750
that can measure neural activity

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.100
without having to remove
any parts of the skull

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.510
or put a person into one of
these two black fMRI machines,

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.790
which is very invasive.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.440
It's also a wonderful tool
because it allows human subjects

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.830
in the laboratory to move around

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.420
and to engage with one another.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.250
So in this particular
experiment, what they did

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.530
is they had co-workers
write a letter of gratitude,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.640
of thanks to another coworker,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.110
unbeknownst to the other coworker.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.070
And then they sat down together

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.570
and then they imaged brain activity

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.010
as this letter was being read

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.370
and as the letter was
being heard, received.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.700
And it showed very robust effects

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.720
on these prefrontal networks;

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.680
that pointed to the fact
that receiving gratitude

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.530
is actually much more potent,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.710
in terms of the positive
shifts that that can create

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.490
than giving gratitude.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.240
So this raises a couple
of important points.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.530
First of all, if you are
somebody who is prone

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.950
to write letters of gratitude,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.660
ideally I think it's requisite

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.500
that these be genuine
letters of gratitude,

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.500
or saying things that are
genuine expressions of gratitude.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.080
This could be by text or
in-person or by phone.

00:36:52.203 --> 00:36:54.990
You have within you a very potent form

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.340
of shifting somebody else's neurology.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.940
Now, that's wonderful,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.700
and I think there are many
people like that out there.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.970
But for many people who want to experience

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.653
the positive effects of gratitude,

00:37:06.653 --> 00:37:11.040
it's probably not the
most advantageous approach

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.070
to just sit around waiting,

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.700
hoping that someone's going to deliver

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.150
all these letters or words of gratitude.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.810
How is it that you can create

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.280
that sense of receiving
gratitude for yourself

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.170
and thereby derive the
effects of gratitude

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.970
as outlined in this particular study?

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.210
And there we go back to the important work

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.410
of the great Antonio Damasio

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.060
who explored these neural
correlates of gratitude,

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.590
to define the areas of the brain

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.410
that are associated with
pro-social behaviors

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.075
like the prefrontal cortex.

00:37:37.075 --> 00:37:40.320
And what's really
interesting about the work

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.890
that Demasio and colleagues
did is first of all,

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.530
they used functional
magnetic resonance imaging.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.610
So this is a very high resolution approach

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.410
to exploring what areas
of the brain are active.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.820
And has very high, what we
call temporal resolution,

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.280
meaning you can see things
in time at very fine scales.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.090
So a lot of mechanistic detail,

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.060
it can emerge from these sorts of studies.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.617
What they did was interesting.

00:38:03.617 --> 00:38:07.670
Rather than have people express gratitude,

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.700
they had the subjects go into the scanner,

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.220
so their brains are being imaged,

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.220
and they watched narratives,
stories about other people

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.050
experiencing positive
things in their life.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.650
And in this case, these
were powerful stories.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.260
These were stories about
survivors of genocide.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.560
So that's what they're watching.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.830
The subjects were subjects

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.200
that were not survivors of genocide.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.260
So they were watching these videotapes

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.930
of people that had genocide,

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.920
and had people help them along the way

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.230
as part of their story of survival,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.740
either psychological and/or...

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.140
Obviously they survive long
enough to make the video.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.170
So, or physical survival.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.890
So within these stories,

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:54.660
there was a conveyance
of a lot of struggle.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.700
These people talked about
the horrible situations

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.700
they were in, but also
small, but highly significant

00:39:01.729 --> 00:39:04.100
features of their history that had led

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.330
to their own feelings of gratitude.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:09.410
So for instance, it says a woman at the...

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.050
This is literally from
the scientific paper.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.080
Somebody had been sick for weeks.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.950
So the woman's describing how
she'd been sick for weeks.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.430
And then another prisoner who was a doctor

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.490
finds a particular medicine somehow,

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.580
it doesn't describe how, and
literally saves her life.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.600
Or an ally who was also
in a stricken circumstance

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.500
gave this person a pair of glasses

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.900
when their eyesight started to falter.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.120
So these sorts of stories.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.170
Now just hearing this in the context

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.230
of nothing but a scientific
paper and discussion,

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.370
these probably aren't that impactful.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.280
What's really important about this study

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.330
and is really important
for all of us to know

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:52.040
is that these stories of
other people receiving things

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.440
that were powerful for them
in their life trajectory

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.670
is embedded in story.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:01.670
And the human brain especially
is so oriented towards story.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.040
We have neural circuits
that like to link together

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.870
past, present future,
have different characters,

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.720
protagonists and antagonists.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.850
From the time we're very young

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.870
until the time we're very old,

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.240
story is one of the major ways

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.030
that we organize information in the brain.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.660
There does seem to be storytelling

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.360
and story listening circuits in the brain.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.162
So what's important is not simply

00:40:24.162 --> 00:40:26.530
that these people survived genocide.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.190
That's obviously important and wonderful.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.840
But it's not just that they
were helped along the way,

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.740
it's that the description of their help

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.830
is embedded in a larger story.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.740
So the human subject in
this scientific study

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.210
is watching these powerful stories.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.780
And the neural circuits associated
with pro-social behaviors

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.360
and with gratitude become robustly active

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.474
when they start to feel some affiliation

00:40:51.474 --> 00:40:53.160
with the person telling the story.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.720
They start to feel some resonance.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.690
We might call that empathy,

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.870
but it doesn't necessarily
have to be empathy.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.940
Empathy is a somewhat
complicated thing to define

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.890
because it involves
literally a setting aside

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.560
of one's own emotions and
really focusing almost entirely,

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.500
or experiencing almost entirely
the emotions of another.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.780
It could be sympathy, it could be empathy.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.040
What we do know is that
the stories themselves

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.670
were able to shift the
physiology of the subjects

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.900
in this study and activate these,

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.980
what we're calling gratitude circuitry

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.970
that involves the prefrontal cortex.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.020
So if you think about the earlier study

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.490
that receiving gratitude
is the most powerful way

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.033
to activate these circuits for gratitude,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.870
the subjects in this study in many ways

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.763
are receiving a sense of gratitude,

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.360
but through the narrative of
one of these other subjects.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.850
Which I find fascinating.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.535
I would have thought a
great gratitude practice

00:41:47.535 --> 00:41:49.105
is when you sit down and list out

00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:49.938
all the things you're grateful for.

00:41:49.938 --> 00:41:51.220
That just seems so logical to me.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.100
But it turns out

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.650
that these neurocircuits
don't work that way.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.510
That to really activate
these circuits for gratitude

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.020
in the serotonin and that probably

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.092
the oxytocin system as well,
and its prefrontal networks,

00:42:01.092 --> 00:42:04.690
one has to powerfully
associate with the idea

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.130
of receiving help, okay?

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.650
The subjects are associating

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:12.780
or experiencing empathy or sympathy

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.830
for somebody else who received help.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.210
In the other study we
described a few minutes ago,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.260
the person hearing the letter
was receiving gratitude,

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.070
and that would amplify the
activity of these circuits.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:26.480
And that takes us to a larger theme of,

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.480
what are these pro-social circuits?

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.410
And an important concept
to emerge from this

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.770
is one that's most often associated

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:35.910
with the autism literature, frankly,

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.240
which is this idea of theory of mind.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.320
So just very briefly, theory of mind

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.590
is the ability to attribute or
to understand the experience

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.610
of another without actually experiencing

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.030
the thing that they're experiencing.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.760
Again, it kind of sounds like empathy,

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.760
but this was actually a term
that's now been demonstrated

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.560
in the psychology and neuroscience,

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.040
that's been linked to
some very robust findings

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.170
associated with brain areas and so forth,

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:07.750
that was looking at autistic
kids and non-autistic kids.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.690
The person largely responsible
for developing theory of mind

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.610
is Simon Baron-Cohen.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.850
I believe he's either the
brother or the cousin.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.080
I can't remember recall which,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.290
to the comedian Sasha Baron-Cohen.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.140
Simon Baron-Cohen is a
professor at Oxford University,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.160
or at least he was the
last time I checked.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.540
And the theory of mind
test can be done on adults

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.920
or on children.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.830
And we can sort of do
that experiment right now,

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.910
if you like, and you can think
about how you would behave

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.480
if you were a subject in
a theory of mind test.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.610
Theory of mind test
involves you or a child

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:39.520
or some other adults,

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.200
sitting down and watching a video

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.080
of a child going into a room
or a person going into a room,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.470
opening up a desk or a
dresser, a drawer for instance,

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.900
or a desk drawer and
placing something in it,

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.720
like a pen or a toy, and then leaving.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.800
And then another person
walking into the room

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.500
and clearly looking for
something in the room,

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.310
and one presumes it's the toy or the pen,

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.208
depending on the context.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.690
People who have strong theory of mind

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:11.450
make the obvious conclusion
that the person looking around

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:16.450
for the pen or the toy is
confused, or they're perplexed.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.200
They don't know where the toy is,

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.480
they're looking for the toy.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.090
Someone who is fairly far
to one side of the autism

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:28.240
or Asperger's spectrum will simply focus

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.810
on the location of the object,

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.720
on the location of the pen or the toy.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.300
And this is especially true in children.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.090
They will say, well, it's
in the second drawer,

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:36.923
it's in the second drawer.

00:44:36.923 --> 00:44:38.750
And they'll say, well, how does the person

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.710
who comes into the room feel?

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.260
And they'll say, well, it's in the drawer.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.340
So they tend to focus on the
specific factual elements

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.350
of the scenario rather
than place their mind

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.510
into the mind of the other person.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.970
So-called theory of mind.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:54.280
Now that doesn't mean
that people with autism

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.230
and Asperger's don't have empathy.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.760
In some cases they can.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.760
It sort of depends on where
they are in the spectrum

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.650
and so forth.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.590
But theory of mind has very strong basis

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.900
in these prefrontal cortex neural circuits

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:07.820
that we were talking about.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.750
Because, as you now know,

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.580
the prefrontal cortex sets context

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.100
on what we see and experience.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.560
And the theory of mind task

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:20.560
that I just described very
briefly is a pure example

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.200
of context setting, right?

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.730
It's not about just the factual elements

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:29.160
about the location of the
objects, it's about the context.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.460
Someone is looking for something

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.010
that someone else put someplace

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:35.120
that makes it such that
that object is hidden.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.240
So basically theory of
mind is your ability

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.087
to put yourself into
the mindset of another.

00:45:39.087 --> 00:45:44.087
And in order to get activation
of these gratitude circuits,

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.820
one needs to put themselves
into the mindset of another

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.120
or to directly receive gratitude.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.620
So let's just take a moment
and start to think about

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.050
how we are going to build out

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.940
the ultimate gratitude practice;

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.080
meaning the most effective
gratitude practice

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.070
for us to do because of all
the many positive effects

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.720
that an effective gratitude
practice can have,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.113
if it's the proper one.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.390
It's very clear that receiving
gratitude is powerful,

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.550
but it's also very clear
that waiting around

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.390
to receive that gratitude
is an impractical approach.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.540
Now, there are methods
that have been developed

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.830
by my colleague at Stanford,
Kelly McGonigal and others

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.320
that actually have developed
things for the workplace,

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.410
for school, for coworkers and students

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:32.530
to write out particular
worksheets related to

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.397
what they're thankful for
from others and exchange them.

00:46:34.397 --> 00:46:36.230
And so those are very useful practices.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.560
I don't want to take anything
away from the important work

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.560
that Kelly and others have done.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.990
But in the absence of having other people

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.557
to do these practices with,

00:46:44.557 --> 00:46:46.560
what we know for sure

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.620
is that there has to be a real experience

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.200
of somebody else's experience.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.490
And that the best way to do that is story.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.870
So, in thinking about how to build out

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.020
an effective gratitude practice,

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.660
it's very worthwhile, I believe,

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:07.660
to find someone's narrative
that's powerful for you.

00:47:08.067 --> 00:47:09.858
And many ways to think about this is,

00:47:09.858 --> 00:47:13.790
it's got to be a story that inspires you

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.810
because of the, for
lack of a better phrase,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.680
the beauty of the human spirit,

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.900
or the ability of humans
to help other humans.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.470
And I find this remarkable
because what this really means

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.120
is that the circuits for gratitude

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.370
are such that we can exchange gratitude.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.310
We can actually observe
someone else getting help,

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.800
someone else giving help.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.780
And that observation

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.841
of our species doing that for one another,

00:47:41.841 --> 00:47:46.841
allows us to experience the
feeling of a genuine chemical

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.570
and neural circuit
activation lift, if you will.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.470
Very, very different
than simply writing out

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.710
the things that you're
thankful for, right?

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.850
And so, how would you do this?

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:01.050
Well, people digest story in
a number of different ways.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.910
People watch movies,
people listen to podcasts,

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.020
people read books.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.903
There are a tremendous
number of stories out there.

00:48:07.903 --> 00:48:10.860
It's clear that an
effective gratitude practice

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.300
has to be repeated from time to time.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.650
So what I would not suggest
is that we build a protocol

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.420
in which you're constantly foraging

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.180
for inspirational stories
over and over again.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.874
Social media and the internet
are replete with those.

00:48:23.874 --> 00:48:27.240
That's not going to be a
very potent protocol or tool,

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.860
because the most potent
protocol or tool for gratitude

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.055
is going to be one that you
repeat over and over again.

00:48:33.055 --> 00:48:36.350
Rather, the most
effective protocol or tool

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.840
is going to be either to think into,

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.410
and you could write this out if you like,

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.400
but think into when somebody was thankful

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.090
for something that you did,

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.620
and really start to
think about how you felt

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.423
in receiving that gratitude,

00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:57.513
and/or I should say, imagining
or thinking about deeply

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.563
the emotional experience of
somebody else receiving help.

00:49:02.563 --> 00:49:05.220
Now, what narrative you select

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.980
is going to be very dependent
on you and your taste.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.890
It's going to be very dependent
on what resonates with you.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:14.210
But again, I want to
emphasize that the story

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:17.110
that you select does not
have to have any semblance

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:18.740
to your own life experience,

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.020
is just about what happens to move you.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.960
And so, the way that one could do this,

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.230
and actually I've started
this practice for myself

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.380
on the basis of the learnings
I've had in the last few weeks

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.320
around preparing for this episode,

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.080
is to find a story that's
particularly meaningful for you.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.690
And then to just take some short notes,

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.580
bullet point notes about
maybe list out for instance,

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.640
on just a small sheet of
paper or in your phone,

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.360
if that's your preference,
just list out for instance,

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.793
you know, what the struggle was,

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.750
what the help was,

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:56.070
and something about how that
impacts you emotionally, okay?

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.140
This is something just for you.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.410
You don't have to share it with anybody.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:02.980
That kind of shorthand
list of bullet point notes

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:06.200
serves as your shorthand
for getting into this mode

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.350
that we're calling gratitude.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:10.630
And actually closely mimics
a lot of what was done

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:11.800
in these various studies.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.790
Because even though the studies

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.440
I've talked about up until now,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:18.000
were really focused on what
we call acute imaging studies,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.340
where someone watched a
story or received gratitude

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.890
while the experiment was done,

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.192
and then that's it one and done.

00:50:24.192 --> 00:50:27.770
There are other studies looking
at gratitude in this context

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.500
over many weeks, up to six weeks.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.440
And what one observes

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.580
is that there's so-called
neuroplasticity of these circuits.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.820
Neuroplasticity is the brain
and nervous system's ability

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.590
to change in response to experience.

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.570
And that these neural
circuits start developing

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.550
a familiarity with the narrative.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:44.740
So that, for instance,

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.360
let's say you sit down the
first time you've found a story

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.140
that you find particularly compelling.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.180
You've written down a few notes

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.699
about what that story
is just to remind you.

00:50:53.699 --> 00:50:55.230
And then you read those out

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.110
and you think into the
richness of that experience,

00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.420
that receiving of gratitude,

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.380
or if you prefer you're doing the protocol

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.150
where you're thinking about
when someone was deeply grateful

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.963
or was genuinely grateful to you,

00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:07.490
that you're thinking about that.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:10.060
The neural circuits become
activated more easily

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.440
with each subsequent
repeat of the practice.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.410
Now this can be done
literally for one minute

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.700
or two minutes or three minutes.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.110
This is not an extensively long practice.

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.730
And that's another beauty
of gratitude practices,

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:25.540
is that they have these
out-sized positive effects

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.600
on so many aspects of our physiology,

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.500
but these are very short practices.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.620
They're the kind of thing that you can do

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.840
walking to your car.

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.350
The kind of thing you can
just sit down for a minute

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.300
and set a timer and do,

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.133
because they are really

00:51:36.133 --> 00:51:38.490
about changing your
state of mind and body.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:41.510
And if you have an experience
of receiving gratitude

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.538
or a story that's very potent for you,

00:51:43.538 --> 00:51:47.310
it becomes a sort of shortcut
into the gratitude network,

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.010
these pro-social networks.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.570
Meaning the activation of these circuits

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:52.280
becomes almost instantaneous.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.280
And that's very different

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.450
than a lot of other practices out there.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:57.920
I'm not aware of any meditation
practices for instance,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.051
that you can do only a few times,

00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:03.690
and then within a week or so,

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:04.950
you just have to do them for one minute.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.710
You immediately drop into
the kind of optimal state

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.160
that that meditation practice
is designed to create.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.840
There are some shorter
meditation practices

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.060
that are very potent and
very effective like that.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.750
But gratitude and the
circuits associated with it

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.650
appear to be especially plastic;

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:23.250
meaning, especially prone to
being able to be triggered,

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.900
in the good sense of the word triggered,

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.810
just by simply reminding yourself

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.410
of this particular narrative.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.800
Now there's another very
clear and positive effect

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.870
of using this narrative
or story-based approach

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.530
to a gratitude practice.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:39.263
And that's what story
does for our physiology.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.500
Now, earlier in the episode,

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.870
I mentioned this really incredible study

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:48.870
in which listening to a story
coordinated the heart rates

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.430
of different individuals,

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:55.020
and literally changed the way
that their heart was beating.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.620
The title of the study
is conscious processing

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.640
of narrative stimulate synchronizes

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.010
heart rate between individuals.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:06.030
The first author is Perez,
again, published in Cell Reports,

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:08.130
Cell Press journal, excellent journal.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:09.810
And it's a really elegant study.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.370
They looked at instantaneous heart rate.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.050
They use electrocardiogram to do that,

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.450
which is simply a way
to look at heart beats

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.560
with very fine precision.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.700
They also looked at the
breathing of subjects

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.740
as they listened to the stories.

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.510
Some of you may know that
breathing and heart rate

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.830
are actually linked to one another

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.340
in a really interesting way.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.060
The simple way to put it
is that when you inhale,

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.100
your heart rate speeds up a little bit,

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.850
and when you exhale, your
heart rate slows down.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:38.270
And this is because of the
movement of the diaphragm

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:40.610
in your thoracic cavity.

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.100
And the physicians and medical types

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.364
call this respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

00:53:45.364 --> 00:53:47.330
There's a mechanism
there we could get into,

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.670
but I don't want to distract
us from the main theme here.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:52.180
So just remember when you inhale,
your heart rate speeds up,

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.530
and when you exhale, your
heart rate slows down.

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.480
They looked at breathing,
they looked at heart rates

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.930
in different individuals.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:01.550
And listening to a story

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:06.550
produced very consistent
gaps between the heart rates

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.180
of the people who are listening,

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.500
different individuals in the study

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.260
who were not located in the same place

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.130
when they listened to the story,

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:17.250
listening to the story on different times,

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:22.140
different days entirely had
very similar heartbeat patterns

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.910
listening to the story.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.860
What this means for
your gratitude practice

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.760
is that having a story
that you can return to

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.530
over and over again, even if
it's not the entire story,

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.870
you're just using the
shorthand bullet point

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:38.830
version of your story,
will create a perceptible

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:43.350
and real shift in your
heartbeat and in your breathing.

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.120
And actually that's been
demonstrated over and over now

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.550
that an effective
gratitude practice is one

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:49.850
that can rapidly shift,

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:52.760
not just the activation of
these circuits in your brain

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.360
for pro-social behaviors,

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:59.360
but also activation of
particular circuits in your heart

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.810
and in your lungs and the
other organs of your body,

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:06.360
such that you can get
into a reproducible state

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.660
of gratitude each time.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:11.260
So an important component here is that,

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.240
there be some element of story,

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.150
again, you don't have to listen to or read

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.320
or think about the entire
story, start to finish

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.950
in order to extract these benefits,

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:22.550
and that it be the same
story over and over.

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:25.330
And as a consequence, that's
going to shift your physiology

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.850
into presumably a more relaxed state,

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:28.980
because typically that's the one

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.970
that's associated with gratitude.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:34.010
Although activation of
these gratitude circuits

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:38.390
has also been shown to create
sense of awe or sense of joy.

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.890
There are few studies looking at

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:41.580
and kind of parsing the difference

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.490
between gratitude and joy.

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.060
I was able to find a
few studies about that.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.640
But in general, the neural
circuits that are activated

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.095
tend to overlap quite a lot with those

00:55:52.095 --> 00:55:54.350
that create a sense of gratitude.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.750
So we don't want to split
hairs on necessarily there.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.890
The key thing is that you
want to use the same story,

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.230
even if it's your own
experience or somebody else's,

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.310
and keep coming back to
it over and over again.

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:05.980
That makes it a very potent tool

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.940
that you can get a tremendous
amount of benefit from

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.660
with even as short as
60 seconds of practice.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.210
Earlier, I talked about how
you can't lie to yourself

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:19.090
and say, you know, I'm so
grateful for this thing

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:20.640
that I actually hate.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.110
And in a moment, I'm going to tell you

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.290
about some scientific data that proves

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:28.210
the statement I made is true,

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.850
and that you can't just lie to yourself

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.970
and derive the benefits
of a gratitude practice.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.360
The data are also going
to point to the fact that,

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.640
if you are giving gratitude,
not just receiving it,

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.040
but giving gratitude, that
too has to be genuine.

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.850
There's a really interesting studies

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:46.490
published in scientific reports,

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.670
which is a nature research journal.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.810
The title of it is Neural
Responses to Intention

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:53.870
and Benefit Appraisal are Critical

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:55.910
in Distinguishing Gratitude and Joy.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:57.840
It's a somewhat complicated study,

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.540
so I'm just going to hit
on some of the high points.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.780
But basically what they did

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.150
is they use functional
magnetic resonance imaging.

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:06.560
So they could look at
brain circuitry activation

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.460
with very high precision.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:11.570
And they had people receiving money

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:15.320
in the context of this experiment.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.490
And they had some knowledge
as to whether or not

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:20.030
the money that they were receiving

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:23.400
was given to them
wholeheartedly or reluctantly.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.410
And there were a number of
different variables in the study,

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:26.960
including how much money was given.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.310
So in some cases it was very little,

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:29.520
in other cases, it was modest,

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.760
in other cases, it was a lot more.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.690
And they also varied the extent

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:37.260
to which the giver of the
money, called the benefactor,

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.690
was doing it wholeheartedly

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:41.100
or seem to be doing it
somewhat reluctantly.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.300
And they looked at whether
or not the sense of gratitude

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.310
scaled with the amount of money received

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:53.170
and/or the intention of the benefactor.

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.690
Whether or not the person giving the money

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:57.090
was doing it wholeheartedly
or reluctantly.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.400
And what's remarkable

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.780
is that while the amount of money given

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:06.528
was a strong component in
whether or not somebody felt

00:58:06.528 --> 00:58:10.210
that they had received
gratitude, which makes sense,

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:13.480
you know, the amount
of money is some metric

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.203
of whether or not somebody feels thanked.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.520
The stronger variable, the
bigger impact came from

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.900
whether or not the person giving the money

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.100
was giving it with a
wholehearted intention

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.330
and not a reluctant intention.

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:30.080
And of course, there was an interaction

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.880
where the best circumstance of course,

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.060
is where the person
received a lot of money

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.550
from somebody who wholeheartedly

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:36.880
wanted to give them a lot of money.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.410
And they did every derivation of this.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.140
But this is of important.

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.270
This tells us many things

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:44.850
that extend way beyond
gratitude practices,

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:49.610
which is that, genuine
thanks are what count.

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:50.443
Okay?

00:58:50.443 --> 00:58:52.270
We could probably presume that.

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:56.830
But receiving genuine thanks
is also a strong variable

00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:01.010
in determining whether or not
we experience real gratitude,

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.010
or whether or not it's empty,

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.150
regardless of the size of a gift.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:08.490
So this constrains our
gratitude practices somewhat,

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:11.089
but I think in an interesting
and important way,

00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:13.470
you can't make this stuff up.

00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:15.790
You can't tell yourself
that an experience was great

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:20.600
or that I got a lot of money
and therefore it justified it,

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.130
even though I think that they
give it to me reluctantly,

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.830
or my boss hates me, but
they gave me a raise.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.500
That stuff stings for
all the right reasons,

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.270
because there are circuits
in our brain and body

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:34.570
that are oriented towards
these pro-social interactions.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:37.280
And in some sense, what we
are looking for as a species,

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.630
what these circuits want, if you will,

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:42.020
is to receive things from people

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.860
that are giving them wholeheartedly.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.930
And that tells us that
if we are the giver,

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:49.000
that we better be giving wholeheartedly,

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.680
or we are undermining
the sense of gratitude

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.810
that someone is going to receive from us.

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:55.600
So we are gradually building up

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.050
the ultimate gratitude practice

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:01.030
based on the variety of
scientific literature

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.380
that's out there.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.990
And I know that many people
are probably interested

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:08.120
in developing a gratitude
practice that has long lasting,

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.840
maybe even permanent positive effects

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.380
on their neural circuitry.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.770
So with that in mind, I
want to turn our attention

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:16.722
to a really interesting study.

01:00:16.722 --> 01:00:19.569
It's entitled effects
of gratitude meditation

01:00:19.569 --> 01:00:22.100
on neural network functional connectivity

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.140
and brain heart coupling.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.320
And to make a long story
short and a lot simpler

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.970
than that title,

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.780
repeated gratitude practice

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.680
changes the way that
your brain circuits work.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.710
And it also changes the
way in which your heart

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.980
and your brain interact.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.424
You're familiar with the fact

01:00:41.424 --> 01:00:42.257
that your brain controls your heart

01:00:42.257 --> 01:00:43.270
because you could be
stressed about something

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.630
that's perceived with your brain,

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.560
and then your heart rate will speed up.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.980
You're probably also
familiar with the fact

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.390
that if your heart rate speeds up

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:50.860
for some reason or no reason,

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.693
you're probably thinking,

01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:52.687
well, what's making my
heart rate speed up?

01:00:52.687 --> 01:00:54.830
And that's because the brain and the heart

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.020
are reciprocally innervated, as we say.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.960
They're talking to one
another in both directions.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.806
It's a two way highway.

01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:03.800
This study looked at changes

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.430
in so-called functional
connectivity within the brain

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.630
and between the brain and the heart,

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:12.310
in response to gratitude practices.

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:13.980
And as a control they used,

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.930
what I think is very interesting,
a resentment intervention.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.910
I think resentment is an apt control

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:23.120
and quite different than gratitude.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.770
To make a long story
short, what they found

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:27.030
is that a repeated gratitude practice

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:30.910
could change the resting
state functional connectivity

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:34.360
in emotion and
motivation-related brain regions.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.470
If I haven't mentioned a
strong enough incentive

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.630
for doing a regular
gratitude practice until now,

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:42.640
this is definitely the
one to pay attention to.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.270
Because what they found was
a regular gratitude practice

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:50.070
could shift the functional
conductivity of emotion pathways

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:53.370
in ways that made
anxiety and fear circuits

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:54.910
less likely to be active,

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.650
and circuits for feelings of wellbeing,

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.460
but also motivation to
be much more active.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.180
I find that remarkable and important

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.100
because a number of people struggle

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.300
with issues of motivation.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.530
A lot of people who are highly motivated

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.750
also have issues with anxiety and fear.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:13.370
And so this study really
points to the fact

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.370
that it's a twofer.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.070
If you have a good gratitude practice

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.940
and you repeat it regularly,

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.810
you reduce the fear, anxiety circuits,

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:25.810
you increase the efficacy
of the positive emotion,

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.980
feel good circuits,

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.840
and the circuits associated
with motivation and pursuit

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.570
are actually enhanced as well.

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:35.627
So that's very strong incentive
to have a gratitude practice

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:36.970
and one that you use regularly.

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:39.370
We'll talk about how
regularly in just a moment.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.401
I don't want to go into too
many details of the study,

01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:44.480
although we will put a
reference to it if you like.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.010
It includes a lot of fMRI data,

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:48.520
imaging data of different brain areas,

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.770
many, many tables and examples of matrices

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:54.860
of before and after gratitude,
after resentment, et cetera,

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.210
you do indeed have circuits
in your brain for resentment,

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:00.140
whether you like it or not, we all do.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.310
And some people,

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.540
just those circuits are
more robust than others.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.730
But the remarkable thing is
one can shift these circuits

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.440
in the direction that I
think most people would like;

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.630
which is more sense of
wellbeing and motivation

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:14.840
and less resentment and fear literally.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.230
And what's really cool
about this study also

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:21.820
is that the interventions
are only five minutes long.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.460
It's incredible, five minutes long.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.800
And so, as we start to build out

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.320
our ideal gratitude practice,

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.250
we know that it has to
have certain features.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:34.280
First of all, it has to
be grounded in a story,

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.730
probably a story that you've heard

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:37.450
in its entirety at least once.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.930
But then you can have a shorthand version,

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:42.030
the so-called bullet points
that I talked about before

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.790
that allow you to drop into that story

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.930
or the emotional
associations with that story.

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.520
So you don't have to listen
to the whole story each time.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.353
And that story should be one

01:03:50.353 --> 01:03:53.430
in which you are genuinely
being thanked for something

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.780
and it made you feel good,

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.400
or it could be a story about

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.650
someone else genuinely
expressing thanks, okay?

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:03.300
Based on the description
of the gratitude practices

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.750
that we talked about earlier.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.350
Your gratitude practice can be very brief.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:11.350
I mean, it be as brief as
one minute, 60 seconds,

01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:13.890
or five minutes, which still
seems very brief to me.

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:15.120
Although in these studies,

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.340
they were getting these
really major effects

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.420
just from five minutes
of gratitude practice.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:25.420
Some of these papers involve
people doing some focusing

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.320
on their breathing and calming themselves

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.010
as they go into the gratitude practice,

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:32.060
but that's within the five minute block.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.830
So if you decide that you're going to do

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:37.800
a gratitude practice
that involves first doing

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800
some calming breathing,

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.710
exhale emphasized breathing, for instance,

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.840
or physiological size, things
I've talked about before

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.520
on this podcast that can help calm me down

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.551
'cause they have a lot of
exhales, which you now know,

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.121
slows your heart rate down,

01:04:49.121 --> 01:04:50.850
and then doing your gratitude
practice, that's fine.

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:52.300
It's actually not necessary,

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.850
but a lot of these studies used that.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:57.730
I think once a narrative has been set,

01:04:57.730 --> 01:04:59.790
you've heard the story and
it has meaning for you,

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.740
or you have a recollection of a story

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.260
where you are genuinely thanked,

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:07.970
then I think just 60
seconds or maybe 120 seconds

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.190
should be sufficient.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.023
Then the question becomes,

01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:12.203
how often to repeat
this gratitude practice.

01:05:13.153 --> 01:05:17.290
That's not exactly clear
from the existing literature.

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:19.810
I can't point to any one study
that says five times a week

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.643
or four times a week.

01:05:20.643 --> 01:05:22.143
So I'm going to throw out a number

01:05:22.143 --> 01:05:26.260
which is three times a week,
and then people will ask,

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.470
well, when should I do
that gratitude practice?

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.640
And I'll tell you what I tell everybody

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.000
about almost every practice
with a few exceptions,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.930
which is the best time of
day to do this practice

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.007
is when you first wake up in the morning,

01:05:39.007 --> 01:05:42.940
or before you go to sleep at
night, or any time of day.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.460
So we've talked about some
of the neurocircuitry changes

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.370
associated with a regular
gratitude practice.

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:49.300
And I should mention

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.786
that there's an additional
neurocircuitry shift that occurs.

01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:55.090
It relates to a structure that I mentioned

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:56.060
just briefly earlier,

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:59.540
which is the so-called ACC
or anterior cingulate cortex.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.050
This is an area of the brain
that has several functions,

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.010
but more and more data
are pointing to the fact

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:07.570
that the ACC is actually
involved in empathy

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:10.730
and is involved in understanding
the emotional states

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:11.780
of others in general,

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.940
even if it doesn't evoke
a sense of empathy.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.040
And there are several studies
that point to the fact

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.800
that in humans who have a
regular gratitude practice,

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.930
the ACC becomes more robustly engaged,

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.440
even with these very
brief gratitude practices.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.809
We actually have a project in our lab.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:30.350
This is actually done in animal models,

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.430
where animals observe other animals

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:37.250
experiencing certain emotional states.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.560
And one of the brain areas
that we've identified

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.380
as important for this;

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.630
it's kind of a primordial form of empathy

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:46.500
'cause we really don't know
what these mice are thinking.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.210
We work on humans, in the
case where we work on humans,

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:51.050
of course we ask them and they tell us

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.652
what they think they're thinking.

01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:54.290
With the mice, we ask them,

01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:56.050
but they don't tell us much
of anything interesting.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:58.650
Instead we measure a number
of physiological signals.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:01.160
But the important point is that the ACC,

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.700
the anterior cingulate cortex
seems to be an important hub

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:09.150
for the generation and
execution of empathy

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.790
as it relates to feelings
and empathic behaviors;

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:14.450
altruistic behaviors of
animals helping animals

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:16.420
and humans helping other humans.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.980
We see this in the animal
models, we see this in humans.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.860
So, if you want to be
a more empathic person,

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.830
a gratitude practice

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:26.650
is also going to be very
effective for that, it appears,

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:29.060
especially using this
narrative type approach

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.350
where you are using
someone else's narrative

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.270
of receiving gratitude

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:36.340
as a way to tap into your
own sense of gratitude.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.950
Thus far, we've mainly talked
about the effects of gratitude

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:40.517
on neural circuit activation,

01:07:40.517 --> 01:07:43.350
and changes a little bit
about some of the changes

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:44.820
that are happening in terms of the body,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.450
heart rate and breathing and so forth.

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:50.070
But we haven't talked a
lot yet about the changes

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:53.330
in health metrics, in
things like inflammation

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.530
or reductions in inflammation and immunity

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:57.890
and things of that sort.

01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:00.170
So with that in mind, I'd
like to describe the results

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:02.590
of a really interesting recent
study that was published

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:04.750
in the journal Brain
Behavior and Immunity.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.050
This was published 2021.

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.090
The title of the study is,

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:10.470
Exploring Neural Mechanisms
of the Health Benefits

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:13.200
of Gratitude in Women: A
Randomized Control Trial.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.380
The first author is Hazlitt.

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.984
And basically, what this paper showed

01:08:17.984 --> 01:08:22.984
was that women who had a
regular gratitude practice

01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:26.320
of the sort that we've been
talking about up until now,

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.883
showed reductions in amygdala activity;

01:08:29.883 --> 01:08:32.330
a brain area associated
with threat detection,

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.790
a intimate part of the
fear network in the brain.

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:38.200
So reductions in amygdala activation,

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.810
and large reductions in the production

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:46.150
of something called TNF-alpha,
tumor necrosis factor alpha,

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:48.500
and IL-6, interleukin six.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.430
Now, if you happen to have
listened to the episode

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:52.995
that I did on activating
your immune system

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:57.530
and immune function, you heard
about TNF-alpha and IL-6.

01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:01.150
TNF-alpha and IL six are
inflammatory cytokines.

01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:03.870
These are chemicals
that exist in your body,

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:08.820
and that are released from
cells when there is damage

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:13.170
or kind of a systemic stress;
when your system is in duress.

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:15.190
And in the short-term,
they can be beneficial.

01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:16.977
They can call in signals for wound healing

01:09:16.977 --> 01:09:19.180
and repair of cells, et cetera,

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:22.950
but you don't want TNF-alpha
and IL-6 levels to be too high,

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:26.260
and you don't want those
levels to be up for too long.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.120
And so, this study is really nice

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.020
because they showed significant effects

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.870
in reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:36.240
in response to a gratitude practice.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.620
And because they also observed reductions

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.809
in amygdala activation,

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:43.796
this area associated with
threat detection and fear,

01:09:43.796 --> 01:09:47.300
it's likely, and I
should emphasize likely,

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.420
'cause I don't know,

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.810
that the direction of the effect

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.290
is that there are neural circuit changes,

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:54.150
which in turn shift the degree

01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:55.890
to which these inflammatory cytokines

01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:56.760
are released in the body.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.660
Although for all I know, it
could be the other way too.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.070
It could be that having
a gratitude practice

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:03.920
shifts something about
heart rate and breathing,

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.817
which in turn lowers the
amount of TNF-alpha and IL-6,

01:10:07.817 --> 01:10:10.530
and that in turn reduces
activation of the amygdala.

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:13.480
We don't really know the direction
of the effect, excuse me,

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.430
but if I had to speculate,
I would speculate

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:17.360
that it was a shift in neural circuitry

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.010
that led to a change in
the circuits of the body.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:23.040
And another interesting
aspect of this study

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.970
is that the reductions
in amygdala activation

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:29.800
and the reductions in TNF-alpha
and IL-6 were very rapid.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.980
They occurred almost immediately

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.030
after the gratitude
practice was completed.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.670
And even though that study was performed

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:38.674
exclusively on female subjects,

01:10:38.674 --> 01:10:41.960
based on the biology and
circuitry of the amygdala

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.330
and the biology of TNF-alpha and IL-6

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:49.420
performing this inflammatory
role in both men and women,

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:50.290
I don't see any reason

01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:52.450
why the results of that
study wouldn't pertain

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.240
to both men and women.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.060
So what about the chemistry
associated with gratitude?

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.470
Are there certain chemicals in our brain

01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:00.610
or that we could enhance in our brain

01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:03.053
that would enhance our gratitude practice?

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:04.930
Indeed, there are.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:07.170
And earlier I mentioned the chemical,

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:11.010
the neuromodulator serotonin
as having a powerful influence

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:12.540
on the activation of neural circuits

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.520
associated pro-social
behaviors and gratitude,

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.244
and other sort of feel good behaviors.

01:11:18.244 --> 01:11:20.120
To make a long story short,

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.840
neuromodulators like
dopamine and epinephrine

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.860
and norepinephrine tend
to place us into a state

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.960
of external perception,

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.410
meaning a state of observing
things and focusing on things

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.200
outside the immediate reach of our body

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.260
and confines of our skin.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.230
They tend to put us in pursuit,

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.770
or in thinking about
things out in the future

01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:42.183
or out away from our physical body.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.330
Whereas the neuromodulators serotonin

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:48.550
and some of the associated
pathways like oxytocin

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:52.010
and other neurochemicals
tend to, I want to emphasize,

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:56.330
tend to be associated with
states that are about contentment

01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:58.890
with what we have within
the confines of our body

01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:00.490
and our immediate experience.

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:02.100
So they're not so much about pursuit,

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.760
but about gratitude and about appreciation

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.391
for what we already have.

01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:11.130
I'd be remiss if I didn't
therefore point out

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:14.540
that if one were to shift their chemistry

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.130
toward having higher levels of serotonin,

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:19.990
you would, by all logic,

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:22.290
experience heightened levels of gratitude.

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:23.610
And indeed some people do this.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.860
They will take compounds
that increase serotonin.

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.040
There are a number of compounds
out there, as you know.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.910
I'm certainly not
suggesting people do that.

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:32.300
A couple of the supplement based legal,

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.229
over-the-counter approaches to this

01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:39.229
are things like 5-HTP, which
is a precursor to serotonin.

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:41.150
Some people will take 5-HTP

01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:42.550
to try and enhance their sleep.

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:45.137
I'm not a fan of doing that, personally.

01:12:45.137 --> 01:12:47.270
I've talked about this
in the sleep episodes.

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:52.270
But the state that we call
sleep has a very complex

01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:55.700
and important architecture as
it relates to neurochemicals.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.220
And by taking serotonin by supplement

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.540
or by stimulating serotonin
release by supplement

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.600
with 5-HTP or with tryptophan,

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.970
which is an amino acid
precursor to serotonin,

01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:07.400
one can run into the problem

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.360
of disrupting the normal
architecture of sleep cycles

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.193
throughout the night.

01:13:11.193 --> 01:13:14.180
I experienced that as, if I've
taken 5-HTP or tryptophan,

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.370
I fall asleep very deeply,

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:16.980
but then I wake up three hours later

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.560
and I can't fall asleep at all.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.540
And actually it sometimes
even messes up my sleep

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.830
the subsequent night.

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:24.530
Some people are not so
sensitive to 5-HTP in tryptophan

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:25.590
and they actually really like it.

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.610
So again, you have to talk to your doctor,

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:28.630
decide what's right for you.

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:30.420
You're responsible for
your health, not me.

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.970
And you have to determine
what works for you.

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.530
Everyone's slightly individual.

01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:38.530
But one could imagine enhancing
their amount of serotonin

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.710
in their brain and body by
taking 5-HTP or tryptophan

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.020
before a gratitude practice,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.350
that seems a little bit extreme

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:47.440
given that the gratitude
practice is only about a minute

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.220
to five minutes long on a regular basis,

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.770
but there may be instances

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:53.420
in which you're really trying
to amplify the circuitry

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.000
in the brain and body that
are associated with gratitude,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.390
and therefore that might be something

01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:59.010
that you want to explore.

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:01.210
There's a new compound that's out there.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:04.060
A legal over-the-counter compound.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.230
At least it's legal in the United States,

01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.510
I don't know about overseas.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:12.510
And that's a compound
called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.240
It's an interesting compound.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.460
It goes by another name as well, which is,

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.250
and I'm going to mispronounce
this and I apologize,

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:22.160
this is Sceletium tortuosum.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.680
Please see our timestamps

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.345
if you want to see the spelling of that.

01:14:25.345 --> 01:14:29.360
But I'll just call it Kanna,
by its other name for short.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.550
It's an herb that is traditionally chewed

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:35.360
prior to stressing endeavors,

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.330
is how it's described on an examine.com.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:38.910
But I looked at some
of the studies on this.

01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:39.743
It's kind of interesting.

01:14:39.743 --> 01:14:43.260
It very likely increases the
amount of serotonin in the body

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.641
and pretty potently.

01:14:44.641 --> 01:14:48.070
It is generally taken in dosages

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.084
of anywhere from 25 to 50 milligrams.

01:14:50.084 --> 01:14:55.084
And it creates a kind of a
pro-social gratitude enhancing,

01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:58.870
or I should say gratitude circuitry

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:03.130
pro-social neurocircuitry enhancing effect

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.220
because of the ways that it interacts

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.380
with the certain urgent
pathways of the brain.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.280
So it also has another name,

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.900
it's sometimes called
Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.570
Again, I'm not suggesting
that people run out

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:16.490
and take this stuff.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:19.294
But there is an emerging practice

01:15:19.294 --> 01:15:23.420
of people using Zembrine,
Sceletium tortuosum,

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:26.383
also called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A,

01:15:26.383 --> 01:15:31.230
in order to enhance the
states that are about comfort

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:33.590
and pleasure with what one has

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:36.080
in their immediate sphere of experience.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.722
And so one could imagine

01:15:37.722 --> 01:15:39.680
if it's safe for you and right for you

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.320
and legal where you live
in enhancing serotonin

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.459
by taking Kanna and then
doing your gratitude practice.

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:49.230
What's the logic behind that?

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:52.840
Well, oftentimes we hear about

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.530
supplements and pharmacology
for "increasing plasticity"

01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:57.860
or "opening plasticity."

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.910
You know, if I had a dollar
for every time someone said,

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.840
I hear that such and
such opens plasticity.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.590
Well, indeed there are molecules

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:07.230
associated with the thing
that we call neuroplasticity.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:10.860
But neuroplasticity is not
an event, it's a process;

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.450
meaning it has many, many steps.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:13.740
It occurs during wakefulness,

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.588
it's consolidated during
sleep and so forth.

01:16:16.588 --> 01:16:19.130
Taking a substance that increases

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:22.720
a neurochemical in your brain will likely,

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.360
provided it's the right substance

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.560
and it's the right practice,

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:30.200
will likely enhance the
amplitude or the intensity

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.300
of that practice and make
it a more potent form

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.570
of inducing neuroplasticity.

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:37.500
Meaning it will create longer lasting

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500
or more robust brain changes

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:43.470
than if one hadn't increased
their chemistry in this way,

01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:45.590
this way of taking something.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:46.840
But that doesn't necessarily mean

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.990
that you couldn't get to the
very same place without it,

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:52.080
by simply doing a slightly
longer attitude practice

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.750
or putting a little bit
more mental effort into it.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:59.000
That said, I think the
future of neuroplasticity

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.580
really resides in not just one approach,

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.320
not just neurochemistry
and taking substances

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.800
to increase neuroplasticity,

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.500
not just behavioral practices

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.086
to try and increase neuro-plasticity,

01:17:09.086 --> 01:17:11.278
not just brain machine interfaces

01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:14.530
or devices to increase neuro-plasticity,

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:17.310
but rather the convergence
of multiple tools.

01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:20.790
So you could imagine enhancing
serotonergic transmission,

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:21.910
as we say in the brain

01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:23.010
using something like Kanna,

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:25.300
combined with a gratitude practice.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.600
In the not-too-distant future,

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.960
this will probably also be combined

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.410
with some sort of noninvasive device

01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:33.010
to stimulate the prefrontal
cortex at the same time.

01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:34.350
Please don't do that recreationally.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.685
Those devices are for
clinical use only currently.

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:39.610
But I think you start to get the idea.

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:41.940
So for those of you that are
a little bit more exploratory

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.140
and you want to go in and
do some reading on this,

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.170
I thought you might
find Kanna interesting.

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:47.110
I certainly did.

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:49.140
There are a number of studies
that will pop up on PubMed.

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:52.784
I recommend using examine.com
as your jumping off point.

01:17:52.784 --> 01:17:54.700
There are some decent studies

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.140
that they described in their
so-called human effect matrix.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.770
So those are studies done on humans.

01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.160
And the main effects
that have been documented

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.950
in the scientific literature are minor,

01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:07.210
but significant increases in
cognition, executive function.

01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:08.390
Executive function is something

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.550
that's also associated
with prefrontal cortex,

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:12.100
and reductions in anxiety.

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.670
And that seems to be a common theme

01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:15.390
that we're seeing again and again.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:16.814
You saw this in the study,

01:18:16.814 --> 01:18:20.150
the trial where we saw
reductions in TNF-alpha

01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:22.900
and reductions amygdala activation.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.970
Which would ostensibly lead
to reductions in anxiety.

01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.820
You're seeing increases in
activity in brain networks

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.500
that are associated with
feelings of wellbeing.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.900
So again, back to that kind of push-pull

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:37.230
of defensive anxiety and
fear-like circuitry in the brain

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:39.880
being antagonistic, as we say,

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.000
to the circuits that are
associated with pro-social,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.530
feeling good, receiving good feelings,

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:47.090
type circuitry and events in life.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:49.380
So as you now know,
there is a lot of science

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.010
about how gratitude can positively impact

01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:53.376
neural circuits in the brain.

01:18:53.376 --> 01:18:56.110
Anti-inflammatory markers in the body,

01:18:56.110 --> 01:19:00.305
brain-heart breathing
coordination, and on and on and on.

01:19:00.305 --> 01:19:03.260
I'd like to just
highlight the key elements

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.100
of the most effective,
at least to my knowledge,

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.570
gratitude practice.

01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:09.160
And when I say the most effective,

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.900
what I'm doing is I'm gleaning
from the scientific studies

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.230
I was able to find and
combining the various findings

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:18.730
of those studies into what
I think is a very practical,

01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:21.440
and what should certainly
be a very effective

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.500
gratitude practice

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.180
for all the positive
effects that we described.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.650
First of all, that gratitude practice

01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:31.360
has to be grounded in a
narrative, meaning a story.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.890
You don't have to recite
or hear that story

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:37.030
every single time you do
the gratitude practice,

01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:39.240
but you have to know what that story was

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.970
and what the gratitude
practice references back to.

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:45.830
Second of all, that story can be one

01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:50.090
of you receiving genuine thanks.

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:51.410
And the key elements there

01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:53.550
are that you are the one
receiving the thanks,

01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:54.570
the gratitude,

01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:59.523
and that it's being given to
you genuinely, wholeheartedly.

01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:05.480
Or it can be a story of
you observing someone else

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.870
receiving thanks or expressing thanks.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:11.750
And that has to be a
genuine interaction as well,

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:14.833
both between the giver and the receiver.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.420
So, those are the first three elements.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.640
What I recommend would be
after you've established

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.960
the story that you want to use
for your gratitude practice,

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.150
that you write down three
or four simple bullet points

01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:31.820
that can serve as salient
reminders of that story for you,

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.250
it will serve as kind
of a cue for that story

01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:39.240
without having to listen to,
or talk out the entire story.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.470
I would recommend writing down something

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:44.760
about the state that you
or the other person were in

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.060
before they received the gratitude,

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.110
the state that you were in
or that the person was in

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.030
after they received the gratitude,

01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:54.010
and any other elements

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:56.130
that lend some sort of emotional weight

01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:57.420
or tone to the story.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.890
This could be three pages
of text, if you like,

01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:02.320
or it could just be a
couple of bullet points.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.390
I don't think it really matters.

01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:05.490
The important thing is that
it's embedded in your memory

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:06.620
and that it's really associated

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.375
with this genuine exchange of thanks,

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:10.940
and the receival of things.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.680
I think those are the key elements.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.640
And then it's very simple:

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:17.560
The entire practice involves
reading off these bullet points

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:22.560
as a cue to your nervous system
of the sense of gratitude.

01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:25.310
And then for about one minute,

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:26.850
which is a trivial amount of time

01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:29.610
if you really think about
it, or maybe two minutes,

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:31.690
or if you're really
ambitious up to five minutes

01:21:31.690 --> 01:21:35.420
of just really feeling into
that genuine experience

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.810
of having received gratitude

01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:40.990
or observed someone else
receiving gratitude.

01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:44.860
And then in terms of frequency,
I think a good rule of thumb

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.360
would be to do that
about three times a week.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.810
And the time of day doesn't really matter.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:51.360
I can't see why there would be

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.190
any so-called circadian effects of this.

01:21:53.190 --> 01:21:55.050
I know some people like
to do a gratitude practice

01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:56.760
before they go to sleep at night.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.530
I don't see any problem with doing this

01:21:58.530 --> 01:21:59.530
before you go to sleep at night.

01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:01.370
I also don't see any
problem with you doing this

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.390
on your lunch break or mid-morning

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:04.450
or first thing in the morning.

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:08.450
I can't see any logic for
placing it at any one time of day

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:09.690
and not another.

01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:10.720
So I think the most important thing

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.450
is that you do it at
least three times a week.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.780
And as mentioned before,
it's very, very brief.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:19.380
So there are very few barriers
to entry for doing this.

01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:21.970
So if we just take a step
back from this protocol

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.180
and compare it to what's
typically out there

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.178
in the literature, which is,

01:22:26.178 --> 01:22:28.430
make a list of all the
things you're thankful for,

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:31.040
recite in your mind all the
things you're thankful for,

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.873
count your blessings.

01:22:31.873 --> 01:22:33.610
So I think everybody should
be counting their blessings

01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:34.443
all the time.

01:22:34.443 --> 01:22:35.920
There's always something
to be thankful for.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.370
But in terms of a scientifically
grounded gratitude practice

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:43.090
that has also scientifically demonstrated

01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:47.030
to shift your physiology at
the level of your immune system

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.540
and your look neurocircuitry,

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.080
reducing anxiety, increasing motivation,

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.927
all these wonderful
things that so many of us

01:22:52.927 --> 01:22:55.890
are chasing all the time as goals,

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:58.420
I think a gratitude
practice reveals itself

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.020
to be an immensely powerful tool

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.800
for any and all of us to use.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.530
And that should come as no surprise

01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:06.994
because these pro-social
circuits for gratitude

01:23:06.994 --> 01:23:09.780
are not a recent phenomenon.

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.510
Discussions about gratitude
date back hundreds,

01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:14.090
if not thousands of years.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:16.200
What we've done today is
to take the modern science

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.550
right up until 2021,

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:21.460
and to really distill from
that the neuroimaging data,

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.820
the neurochemistry, the various aspects

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:26.600
of brain-body connectivity,
look at the protocols,

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.980
take various subject groups.

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:28.920
Some were done in women,

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.740
some were done between two individuals,

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.820
some were done with brain imaging,

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:36.562
all the various changes on a theme

01:23:36.562 --> 01:23:39.730
that allow us to point to a simple,

01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:42.960
but very effective protocol
that certainly we could all use

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.100
around Thanksgiving.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.470
But Thanksgiving is just, but one day

01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:49.440
throughout the entire year, of course.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.890
I personally have been
using a gratitude protocol

01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:53.780
for the last several years.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:57.270
But that protocol was based
on my ignorance, really,

01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:58.817
about the scientific literature,

01:23:58.817 --> 01:24:00.750
and was mainly based

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:03.010
on what I'd heard out
there in the internet,

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:06.030
which is that I should
list out or think about,

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:09.700
or verbally recite the
things that I'm grateful for.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.730
The sort of protocol
that we arrived at today

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:14.500
based on the scientific literature

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.470
is distinctly different from that.

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:19.200
And as a consequence,
I've started to script out

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.730
a protocol identical to
the one I just described,

01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:24.790
and I intend to use that going forward.

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:27.310

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.900
During today's episode, and
in many previous episodes,

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.090
I mentioned supplements.

01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:59.330
Supplements aren't for everybody.

01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:00.940
But if you are going to use supplements,

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.420
it's imperative that the supplements

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.960
be of the very highest quality.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.950
For that reason we've
partnered with Thorne,

01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:07.440
that's T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.820
because Thorne supplements

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.750
have the highest levels of stringency,

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.470
in terms of the quality of
the ingredients they include

01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:15.650
and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients

01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:17.630
they include in their products.

01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:19.450
They've partnered with
every major sports team,

01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:20.540
as well as the Mayo Clinic,

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.690
so we're delighted to be
partnered with them as well.

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.330
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:29.030

any of the other supplements

01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:44.200
that Thorne makes.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.990
Thank you for your time
and attention today,

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:48.180
learning about the science of gratitude.

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.120
And last, but certainly not least,

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.171
thank you for your interest in science.
