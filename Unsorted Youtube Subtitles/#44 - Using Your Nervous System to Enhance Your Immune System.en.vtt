00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.417
where we discuss science

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:05.953
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.050
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.310
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.270
Today, we are discussing
the immune system,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.640
and we are also discussing
the nervous system,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.170
which is the brain, spinal cord,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.010
and the connections of
the brain and spinal cord

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.763
with all the organs of the body.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.620
We are also going to discuss
how the nervous system can be

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.720
used to activate and
control the immune system.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.960
Now, about 10, 20 years ago,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.760
if somebody said that
the mind could control

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.300
the immune system, they'd
probably get laughed out

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.960
of most academic conferences.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.570
And certainly the work
wouldn't be published

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.060
in quality journals, but
nowadays there are dozens,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.550
if not hundreds of quality
peer-reviewed studies

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.700
on how the mind and how the nervous system

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.230
can control activation
of the immune system.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.860
This is a wonderful
growing body of research.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.510
And just to give you a hint of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.790
where we are headed with
this, just this last week,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.950
there was a paper published in "Nature"

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.070
which is the apex journal
for scientific publishing,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.763
premiere journal, extremely stringent,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.200
a paper published in "Nature"

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.240
from Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.700
explored how acupuncture can reduce

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.620
inflammation in the body.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.110
And I will describe this study
in a bit more detail later,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.700
but what they discovered was
that by stimulating the body

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.480
in particular ways at
particular sites on the body,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.040
they were able to liberate
certain cells and molecules

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.960
that enhance the function
of the immune system,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.760
and potentially can be used to combat

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.580
different types of infection.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.650
And just to give you another little hint,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.310
they found that a particular
type of organ tissue

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.620
called fascia, some of you
may have heard of fascia,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.980
fascia surrounds our muscles.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.813
Just to look at it,

00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:00.380
you might think it's a
kind of useless tissue,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.130
it's sort of like a dense bag

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.030
in which the muscles are contained.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.140
Well, it turns out that those dense bags

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.450
are much smarter than we thought.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.620
They don't have a mind of their own,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.890
but by stimulating the fascia

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.300
in a particular location on the body,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.540
there's a pathway leading
out of that fascia

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.430
directly to an organ
called the adrenal medulla,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.630
I'll explain what all this means,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.330
that could liberate particular chemicals

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.980
that had a potent
anti-inflammatory effect.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.430
So what we're basically saying

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.850
is that the nervous system
acts as a set of highways

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.830
between the different
tissues of your body,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.410
calling into action the immune system,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.170
liberating particular molecules
that can reduce inflammation

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.410
and lead to faster healing.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.430
And I will explain how all of that works

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.700
as well as some other
non-acupuncture methods

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.170
for activating and enhancing the function

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.060
of the immune system.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.990
So, today, we're going
to be talking all about

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.110
healing with the mind in
a completely non-mystical,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.080
non-abstract sense.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.040
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.930
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.200
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.260
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.580
about science and science-related tools

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.080
to the general public.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.270
In keeping with that theme,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.290
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.630
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.980
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.910
that are absolute suburb quality.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.290
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.720
and I can tell you that
one of the major issues

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.840
our visual system has to contend with

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.020
is how to see things clearly
in bright environments

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.490
or dimmer environments, et cetera.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.150
ROKA clearly understands the
science of the visual system,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.410
because one thing that's
wonderful about their sunglasses

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.080
is that you can be in a
very bright environment

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.250
and then walk into a shadowed environment

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.900
and you don't even notice the transition.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.663
Everything is still seen
with crystal clarity.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.020
Their eyeglasses as well
allow you to see things

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.780
regardless of how bright or
dim internal lighting is.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.470
I wear readers at night, I
wear sunglasses during the day,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.340
and ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses are particularly nice

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.610
because they're very lightweight,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.520
so I often forget that
they're even on my face.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.840
They also don't slip
off if you get sweaty.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.630
They were actually designed to be used

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.250
while running or cycling.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.950
And so I can use them while exercising.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.130
They also have a great aesthetic.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.260
So you can go from exercising,
to dinner or to work,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.220
without having to change

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.580
from one set of glasses to the next.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.790
If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.740
that's R-O-K-A.com and

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.840
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.130
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.100
mineral probiotic drink.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.607
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012.

00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:45.700
And so, I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.320
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.350
once or twice per day is
because it allows me to cover

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.490
all of my basic nutritional bases.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.850
It's got the vitamins and
minerals that make sure

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.100
that no matter what I'm eating,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.450
I'm covering all of my
micronutrient bases.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.080
And it has the probiotics,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.360
and probiotics we now know are essential

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.020
for a healthy gut microbiome.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.850
And a healthy gut microbiome
we know is essential

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.390
for many important biological functions

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.080
related to human health,
like metabolic needs,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.830
endocrine function, immune
function, and so on.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.070
With Athletic Greens, I
can mix that up with water.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.200
I usually add some lemon or lime juice.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.150
It tastes delicious.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.830
I like it very much and I'll
drink it once early in the day,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.083
and once again later in the afternoon.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.440
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.967
you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:35.650
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.310
They'll give you five free travel packs,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.420
which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.330
whether you're in the car, or
on a plane, or on the move,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.150
and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.270
There is now a lot of data
showing that vitamin D3

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.590
is important for many biological functions

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.890
that impact our immediate
and long-term health.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.290
And most people do not
get enough vitamin D3,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.080
even if they're getting a lot of sunshine.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.010
And K2 is also important or
has been shown to be important

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.470
for heart health and for blood
lipid function, et cetera.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.480
So, again, if you'd like
to try Athletic Greens,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.570
you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.990
to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.880
and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.241
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:06:19.241 --> 00:06:21.730
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.560
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.140
to help you better meet your immediate

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.090
and long-term health goals.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.010
I've long been a fan of
getting regular blood work done

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.610
for the simple reason
that many of the things

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.940
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.540
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.970
There's just simply no
other body surface marker

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.877
that you can look at
somebody or yourself and say,

00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:47.270
"Ah, I know that my blood lipids
or my cholesterol are good,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.570
or that my hormone levels are X, Y, or Z."

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.280
We really need numbers on those things

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.280
to know where they sit.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.220
The problem with a lot
of blood tests, however,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.730
is you get all those numbers back,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.620
you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.370
InsideTracker has solved that problem,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.490
and they have a very easy to use dashboard

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.950
where when you get your numbers back,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.490
it can tell you for instance,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.270
where your numbers are
high or low or on target.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.420
And they can suggest very
specific dietary intervention,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.290
supplemental interventions,
and behavioral interventions

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.050
that can allow you to bring those numbers

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.410
to where you would like them to be.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.010
So they've simplified the whole process.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.540
And in terms of getting the blood tests,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.610
you can go to a local center
to get the blood drawn,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.270
or they can even send
somebody to your house.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.010
So, they've made the whole
thing very, very easy

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.490
from start to finish.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.350
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.450
you can visit InsideTracker.com/Huberman

to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.670
You just use the code
"Huberman" at checkout.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.430
Okay, let's talk about the immune system,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.310
and the nervous system,
and how the two interact,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.760
and how you can control your immune system

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.730
to serve you better.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.539
We are going to talk a lot
of mechanistic science,

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.110
a little bit of detail,
you'll learn some new language

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.540
around the immune system;

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.340
names of the different
cell types and so forth,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.210
but I promised to make it all very clear,

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.940
regardless of your background.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.450
We are also going to
discuss a lot of tools.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.810
And I think many of you are
probably here because you want

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.530
to know what you can do in order to boost

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.610
or enhance the function
of your immune system.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.633
That's a very reasonable question to ask.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.560
I want to begin by just
acknowledging that if one were

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.670
to put that question into the internet,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.230
you would get back a lot of answers.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.660
And there is now a sort of
generic form of that answer

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.500
that deserves our respect,

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.383
but is not going to be the
topic of conversation today.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.640
I just want to tip my hat to it, however,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.840
and list off a few of
the things that we know

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.970
set us up to be healthier than we would be

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:45.950
if we didn't do these things.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.460
So the first of course is
the foundation of all mental

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.250
and physical health, which
is to get adequate sleep.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.350
Meaning enough sleep,
whatever it is for you

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.630
that you require,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.370
to get deep sleep, so it's
got to be of high quality,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.650
and to time that sleep correctly.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.320
Meaning you can't sleep
during the day one day,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.270
and at night the next day,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.930
and expect your system to function well.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.930
I've talked a lot about
that before on this podcast.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.660
You need a relatively
consistent sleep schedule

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.520
most of the time, about 80% of the time,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.410
or even better would be 90% of the time.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.030
But the realities of life
make it that we can't always

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.070
go to bed at the same time

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.610
and wake up at the exact same time.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.580
Okay, so we need sleep.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.720
We do need sunshine.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.760
Why do we need sunshine?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.850
Because it sets our rhythm
into a regular state

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.560
where the genes in all of our cells

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.300
can be expressed at the correct times.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.360
We're sort of a factory
of cells, if you will,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.240
and that factory can only
run properly if it knows

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.020
when certain things should be active

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.310
and when certain cells
should not be active.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.880
And the best way to coordinate
all of those activities

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.730
of all the cells is to
get sunshine in your eyes

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.980
in the morning and again in the evening,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.200
and not to get too much
bright light in your eyes

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.560
in the middle of the night.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.900
That's just foundational.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.910
And then any lists that you'll find

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.187
on any number of websites
on the internet would say,

00:09:58.187 --> 00:10:03.080
"Okay, get good sleep,
get sun, get exercise."

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.190
How much exercise?

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.710
We should all be getting
150 to 180 minutes

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.480
of zone two cardio.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.270
That's cardiovascular
exercise where we can

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.520
just barely hold a conversation
or maybe not, per week.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.700
We should be eating well.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.270
We're always told we have
to get good nutrition.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.690
What good nutrition means to
you is going to be different

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.980
than what it means to somebody else.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.490
But we acknowledge that food intake

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.010
and quality of food in particular,
avoiding processed foods,

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.300
that's going to be important.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.710
Social connection is important.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.970
Hydration is important.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.720
You're starting to get the picture.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.890
We can take all that,
acknowledge it as useful

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.690
and foundational for
mental and physical health.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.140
But of course there are many
people who still struggle

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.020
with getting ill too often,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.540
or with not being able to heal

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.700
from physical injuries and wounds,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.940
or from various bacterial
and viral infections

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.210
quickly enough or deal
with chronic disease.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.390
And so, today's really about how you can

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.060
take all of that information,
acknowledge it, and follow it.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.520
But in addition to that,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.520
there are things that
you can do to leverage

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.530
your nervous system in order
to enhance the function

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.800
of your immune system in very robust ways.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.420
So that's where I'd like to
shift the conversation to.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.200
The first topic we have to
attack is the question of

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.800
what is the immune system
and how does it work?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.800
I think many of you have heard
of antibodies or killer cells

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.160
or the various organs of
the body that are involved

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.993
in the immune system,

00:11:31.993 --> 00:11:34.110
like the bone marrow,
the spleen, the thymus,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.253
and the lymph nodes.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.640
I'd like to just take a
moment and do a sort of

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.950
brief immune system 101; really simple,

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.810
cover the basic elements
of the immune system

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.160
so that everyone
listening or watching this

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.700
can get a clear sense of how
the immune system functions

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.200
and what its basic parts are.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.380
For some of you, this might be too basic.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.970
It might be a little bit of background

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.000
that you already know.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.450
I think for most of you,
this information will be new.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.380
And I promise you, you
don't need a biology

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.300
or medicine background in
order to understand this.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.590
It's actually really simple

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.580
because it is truly elegant in design.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.580
You have three main layers
of defense for your health.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.610
These are the three things
that are constantly at work

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.610
to protect you from invasion
and illness from bacteria,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.290
from viruses, and from parasites.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.180
And the first of those
three is a physical barrier

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.120
that we call your skin.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.500
And that might seem kind of obvious,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.340
but everything about you is
contained in this compartment

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.350
that is boundaried by your skin.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.130
And your skin is a very important aspect

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.840
of your immune system.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.130
If you've ever had a cut,

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.930
you essentially have a
breach of the boundary

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.870
that is your immune system,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.000
and you would notice a number
of things would happen.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.280
You might get some
swelling around that cut.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.570
You might get a scab, likely
you would get a scab over time.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.900
If it got dirty, there were
some bacteria that got in there,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.130
you might see some accumulation
of white blood cells,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:10.963
what's called puss.

00:13:10.963 --> 00:13:13.260
I know it's kind of gross,
but that's what that is.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.090
It might take on a yellow tint
because of the accumulation

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.100
of some dead cells there.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.760
But basically your skin
is the primary barrier

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.170
through which you keep
things from the outside

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.940
that could harm you from
getting to the inside.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.640
Now, still in category one,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.810
your body and your external surface,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.330
you have openings to that surface, right?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.990
You're not just a round or a body shaped

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.760
completely covered up with skin.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.330
You have openings, what
are those openings?

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.170
Well, let's start at the
top and work our way down.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.140
A primary site of potential
infection are your eyes.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.010
You have your ears,
you have your nostrils,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.980
you have your mouth.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.230
Okay, those are going
to be the primary sites

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.930
by which things can get into your system.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.300
And you need to put
things into your system;

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.320
you need to drink and eat,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.880
and you need to get
light into your system.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.660
That's why you have those openings,

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.820
but bad things, meaning
things that can harm you,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.160
can get into those systems.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.573
And then of course, along
the back of your throat,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.210
all the way down to your stomach
and your digestive system,

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.300
and through your intestines
and out your rectum,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.450
you have a tube, that you are
basically a series of tubes.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.820
I've said that before on this podcast,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.510
and this is one such tube by
which you extract nutrients

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.170
from the outside environment.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.500
But all along that tube,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.180
including your nose and your
mouth, it's lined with mucus.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.350
And while mucus might seem
kind of gross to some of you,

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.430
the more you learn about mucus,

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.450
the more you realize that
mucus is really, really cool

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.190
because mucus essentially
acts as a filter,

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.460
as a trap for bacteria and viruses.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.290
And it has certain ways of scrubbing

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.193
or killing those bacteria and viruses.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.900
Now, the mucus is constantly
being turned over,

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.120
as we'll talk about later,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.160
the chemistry of that
mucus is really important

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.090
in order to make sure that certain things

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.240
don't make it into your system,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.440
and other things are allowed
to move through your system

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.580
and you can extract nutrients from them.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.720
So the reason I'm talking
about this first category

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.480
of barrier for immune
system in such detail

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.180
is I'd like you to envision
yourself as a human, of course,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.550
but as a human that is a clear
entity from everything else.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.960
And you have to bring in the right things

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.893
and you have to keep out the
wrong things or kill them.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.530
Now, inevitably, bacteria, viruses,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.250
and parasitic infections
are going to make their way

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.590
into our body, but whether
or not they are killed off

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.570
or whether or not they
take over and cause us harm

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.100
is going to be determined
by layers two and three.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.270
So, layers two and three are the so-called

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.660
innate immune system and
the adaptive immune system.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.180
So the innate immune
system is what I would call

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.370
the second layer of defense.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.510
It's very fast.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.910
So whether or not it's
bacteria, virus, or parasite,

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.910
what happens when you have
something enter your body,

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.420
maybe you swallowed it, maybe
got in through your eyes,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.710
maybe you shook somebody's
hand who is carrying

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.230
a particular kind of illness,
and then you wiped your eyes.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.860
And I've talked about
on this podcast before,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.890
very soon after we meet another person,

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.230
usually within 30 seconds,
believe it or not,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.710
most people wipe that person's chemicals

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.030
somewhere on their face or
on their body's surface.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.790
This has been demonstrated
over and over again.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.840
If you want to learn more about that,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.820
we did an episode all
about chemical signaling,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.680
where you can learn about it.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.240
I know it sounds weird and you
might say, "I don't do that,"

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.240
but indeed you do, most of
the time most everybody does.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.240
Okay, so, this innate immune
system is this rapid response

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.630
when something enters our system

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.960
and our body doesn't recognize it.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.900
It's not food, it's not clean air,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.190
it's something that's either
a bacteria, virus or parasite.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.020
And the innate immune
system involves the release

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.020
of particular cells that
are waiting dormant,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.680
ready to attack whatever this invader is.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.520
And some of these cell types
you've heard of before.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.780
The most typical one are the
so-called white blood cells.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.890
So, the white blood cells
will actively go to the site

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.750
of invasion and will start to encapsulate

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.040
or try and surround that given invader.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.750
The other names of these
different cell types

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.160
are things like neutrophils, macrophages,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.600
natural killer cells are just a few

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.610
of the many types of immune cells.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.020
So there's kind of like
an ambulance system,

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.210
but rather than go and
try and heal something

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.450
like a paramedic would,
they go there and they try

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.473
and surround and kill
whatever this invader is.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.750
They work in concert with
two other assistants,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.210
and those assistants are
called the compliment proteins.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.240
Compliment proteins exist in the blood,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.830
and what they do is they travel to sites

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.870
where there's an invasion
and they mark certain things

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.210
for being engulfed and eaten.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.163
So they sort of put an "eat me" tag on it.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.260
They basically put a
chemical tag onto invaders

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.390
that then allows those white
blood cells, neutrophils,

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.907
macrophages, natural killer cells to say,

00:18:15.907 --> 00:18:19.610
"Ah, I need to basically kill this thing,

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.530
and then wrap it in a
body bag and send it off.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.550
Kill that thing, wrap in a
body bag and send it off."

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.510
And I'm using the analogy of the body bag,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.420
but in the sense it's the right one rather

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.820
because these cells that
come in and kill things,

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.390
the way they do that is actually to engulf

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.760
the invading bacteria, virus or parasite.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.090
So they actually surround it.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.930
And when you see puss or you see infection

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.450
in maybe a cut on the skin
or something like that,

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.760
or even in an ingrown hair
that gets some bacteria in it,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.040
that puss and the white part,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.270
I know it's kind of gross to talk about,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.083
but those are the white blood cells,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.400
oftentimes it's dead cells,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.450
and that's the dead invader sitting there.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.720
So it's trying to create
an isolated compartment

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.590
'cause it wants to keep it
in that part of the body.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.010
Okay, so you've got the
innate immune system,

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.170
the compliment comes
through blood and helps it

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.890
by tagging certain things
with an "eat me" signal.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.760
And then there are the cells
that are either damaged

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.140
from the injury or from the parasite,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.840
or are suffering because of the bacteria

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.160
or the virus itself, and
the cells of your body

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.910
will also release an alarm signal,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.750
which is not an "eat me"
signal, but a "help me" signal.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.890
And those "help me"
signals come in the form

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.810
of what we call cytokines.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.480
And the cytokines are
things like interleukin-1,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.650
interleukin-6, tumor
necrosis factor alpha.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.310
You may have heard of these
things if you are at all curious

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.500
about or have been learning
about the health space,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.590
online health space, especially
in the last few years,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.980
inflammation is all the buzz word now.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.060
Everyone's talking about inflammation,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.330
inflammation, inflammation.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.410
What do we mean when we say inflammation?

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.830
Well, inflammation is a physical response,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.100
but it's also a chemical response.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.610
And many times the markers of
inflammation that are measured

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.090
in people or in animal models
where this research is done,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.120
are things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.750
tumor necrosis factor alpha.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.390
So when those go up in the blood,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.530
it's a sign that somewhere there's a cell

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.870
that's saying "help me, help me."

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.550
And is secreting these
things which calls in

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.990
those neutrophils, macrophages,
natural killer cells,

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.870
and white blood cells, okay?

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.023
And it might help to remember all this,

00:20:30.023 --> 00:20:34.240
by just telling people
that what interleukin means

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.570
is to communicate, right?

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.560
So the interleukin is
shouting out "help me,"

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.497
the compliment proteins
are coming in and saying,

00:20:40.497 --> 00:20:44.330
"eat this" and tagging the
invader with an "eat me" signal.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.870
And then the killer cells
and the white blood cells

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.350
are doing the job of trying
to kill off that thing.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.180
That's the innate immune system.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.100
So, your skin and your mucus lining

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.970
plus your innate immune system
are a beautiful two-layered

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.560
set of defenses against various kinds

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.590
of invaders and infections.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.120
And then there's the third type,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.060
which is the adaptive immune system.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.350
And you'll notice that
leading up until now,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.090
I haven't said the word antibody at all,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.040
and that's because it is
the job not of the skin

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.280
or the mucus or the microbiome
or the innate immune system

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.880
to produce antibodies that can
recognize specific invaders,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.200
but rather it is the job of
the adaptive immune system

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.770
to create antibodies
against bacteria, viruses,

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.550
and even parasites and
even physical intruders

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.910
to your system.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.360
So, the adaptive immune system
has this incredible ability

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.000
to show up at the site of invasion

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.560
or infection or inflammation.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.450
It's called there by various cues,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.410
including the cytokines that
we talked about earlier.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.410
And what it does is it
actually attaches to

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.720
and creates a sort of
an imprint of the shape

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.440
of whatever invader happens to be there.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.620
So if that particular
invading bacteria or virus

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.750
has a contour that's kind
of rippled or kind of spiky

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.160
or whatever shape it happens to have,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.390
it creates an imprint of that.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.820
And then, using that imprint in concert

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.450
with some other cells, creates
antibodies that are specific

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.260
to recognize that invader should the body

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.210
ever have that invader inside of it again.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.810
Now, that's why it's called
the adaptive immune system.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.810
And in many ways it creates
a memory of a prior infection

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.590
so that these antibodies
can be made anytime

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.683
that same invader comes
back again, all right?

00:22:44.683 --> 00:22:47.900
And so, this is the basis
of what we call immunity.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.610
This is the basis of what
we call an enhanced ability

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.100
to combat certain types of infections.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.680
And it's really a wonderful, and I mean,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.840
I can't even state how
incredible this really is,

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.690
that all of our bodies
have this capacity, right?

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.173
We have something called leukocytes.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.770
These are essentially white blood cells.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.640
We have red blood cells
and white blood cells,

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.370
and they both are derived from
the same type of origin cell.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.560
It's a stem cell.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.820
When you hear stem cell,
a stem cell just means

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.330
a cell that can become many
different types of other cells.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.860
We sometimes hear about stem
cells in terms of people

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.870
that are getting injections of stem cells

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.930
or the potential therapeutic effects

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.970
or potential of stem cells.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.250
But we all harbor certain
stem cells within us as well,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.040
that can become lots of
different cell types.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.130
And there's one particular
type of stem cell,

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.090
which is the hematopoietic stem cell,

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.990
which can give rise to red blood cells

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.420
and white blood cells.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.000
And in general, these
reside in the marrow,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.210
at least in adults.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.400
So, in our bone marrow,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.210
we have this ability to make certain cells

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.440
that can go out when they
are called out chemically,

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.070
they get called out to sites of infection

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.750
and create antibodies,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.700
and then maintain those
antibodies in our system,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.980
or have a memory of that
particular infection

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.090
so that if the infection comes back again,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.660
we can kill it off immediately.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.720
And it doesn't have to pass
through these multiple stages

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.130
of first, the innate response,

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.630
then the adaptive
response, taking some time.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.770
Now, there are a lot more details

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.410
to the adaptive immune system,

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.640
but I just want to emphasize a few points

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.430
that might be relevant.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.700
First of all, the name of the antibodies

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.100
that are created
sometimes come in the form

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.820
of IgM and IgG, things of that sort.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.560
This isn't a full deep
dive immunology class,

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.470
but Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay?

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.330
So the immunoglobulins are a part of

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.773
the adaptive immune response
in creating antibodies.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.610
If you hear IgM, the IgM is the first

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.270
of the adaptive immune responses,

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.790
and it tends to come on earlier.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.050
So if somebody is immunopositive for IgM

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.420
for a particular type of
viral or bacterial invader,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.083
that means that it was a
fairly recent infection.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.200
Later, one creates...

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.100
The adaptive immune system,
I should say, creates an IgG,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.020
which is the more stable
form of the specific antibody

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.870
that's going to recognize a given invader.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.930
So IgG tends to come
up a little bit later.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.140
So, just to recap,

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.900
something gets into your
system through your eyes,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.773
through some hole in your skin,
a cut, through your mouth,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.670
sexually transmitted
diseases come in through

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.210
the mucus membranes that
are on the genitalia

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.563
or in the genitalia,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.790
sexually transmitted
disease, airborne disease,

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.930
gets into the mucus, somehow
gets into the bloodstream.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.350
Then there's the innate response,

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.010
which is a more general
response of trying to contain

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.260
and combat the infection or invader.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.040
And then the adaptive response is the one

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.280
that generates the antibodies.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.550
First, the IgM response, the
immunoglobulin-M response,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.060
and then the immunoglobulin-G
response, IgG response.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.670
So, how do we keep these three barriers

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.950
or these three defense
systems to infection tuned up?

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.670
Well, leaving aside the list of things

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.670
that I mentioned before that generally

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.790
enhances their function,

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.910
things like sleep and
sunlight and good nutrition,

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.600
et cetera, the sort of generic
things for good health,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.140
one of the key ways we
can do that is to keep

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.070
that mucus lining in really good shape.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.903
And what does that mean?

00:26:32.903 --> 00:26:36.410
Well, the mucus lining needs
to turn over quite often

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.970
and it needs to be the
correct chemistry to be a trap

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.810
for the bad stuff and
for it to be permeable

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.270
to the good stuff, to the
nutrients that we need.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.580
And it is now very clear from hundreds,

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.020
if not thousands of studies
that the best way to do that

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.380
is to maintain a healthy
so-called microbiome.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.740
The microbiome being these
little bacterial organisms

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.640
that are good for us that live
all along our mucus pathways

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.060
and even in our eyes.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.460
Now, just to be really clear,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.600
it's not just about the gut microbiome;

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.930
we actually have a microbiome in our eyes,

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.560
we have one that's specific to our mouth,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.360
we have a nasal specific microbiome,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.010
there's one all along the gut
and the species of microbiota

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.270
that live all along the digestive tract

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.500
differ from the mouth, to
the throat, to the stomach,

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.180
intestines, into the rectum.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.760
It's well-established that
there are healthy microbiota

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.280
that live all along that length,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.780
and that they differ along that length.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.800
There's also a urethral microbiota,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.500
and there's a vaginal
microbiota that promotes health

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.210
of that environment as well.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.570
So how is it that one can
maintain the healthy microbiota

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.980
and not favor growth of harmful bacteria,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.870
or allow that mucus lining
to become too permeable

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.780
to the bad stuff that can
come in from the environment?

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.000
Well, as far as we know,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.700
there are three main ways to do that.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.943
The first two are purely
structural and mechanical.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.880
It's very clear now from work,

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.250
some of which was done at
Stanford, but elsewhere as well,

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.710
that the nasal microbiome
is particularly good

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.870
at scrubbing bacteria,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.210
at preventing certain types of infections.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.960
So, this is a reminder
that whenever possible,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.730
unless eating or speaking, you
want to be nasal breathing,

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.160
not breathing through your mouth.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.500
Your nose is a much
better filter for viruses

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.520
and bacteria than is your mouth.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.980
The mouth contains certain
structural features,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.210
even organs and cell
types that can protect

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.860
against incoming infection,

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.770
but you don't want to be a mouth breather

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.100
for a variety of reasons.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.407
And there's a terrific book called

00:28:49.407 --> 00:28:51.620
"Jaws: A Hidden Epidemic,"

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.780
which was written by my colleagues,

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.970
Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford,

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.530
and Stanford Medicine with a foreword

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.760
by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.480
So it's really a lot of
heavy hitters on that book

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.090
that talks about the increase in infection

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.620
that one gets when
breathing through the mouth,

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.690
as opposed to the nose.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.510
Now, of course, during hard exercise,

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.570
one breathes through the mouth,

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.290
that's not necessarily bad.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.690
When one is eating or speaking,

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.440
that's not necessarily bad at all.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.000
I guess it depends on what you're saying.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.900
That was a joke.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.250
But in general, when possible you want

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.690
to be breathing through your nose.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.700
Many people have trouble
breathing through their nose

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.500
because of so-called deviated septums

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.830
or chronically collapsed sinuses.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.230
The best way to dilate
those sinuses is actually

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.240
to breathe through your nose.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.480
So it can take a little bit of time,

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.860
but there is some
plasticity to the sinuses.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.640
And so, be a nose breather,
not a mouth breather,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.590
you will combat more of the infections

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.140
that you are constantly confronted with.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.280
I should mention that
we are always bombarded

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.080
with different types of bacteria, viruses,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.590
and parasites in our environment.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.220
And the goal of course,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.410
is to reinforce your immune system,

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.503
so you can keep these things
at bay and not get sick.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.580
There's actually a
paper that was published

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.100
in Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal,"

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.230
excellent journal that showed
that the nasal microbiome,

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:08.070
it has particular species of microbiota

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.403
that are good at fighting off infection.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.430
There has not been a direct
link between particular patterns

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.230
of nasal breathing and
the nasal microbiome yet,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.130
but oxygenation of that environment

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.520
by breathing through your nose,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.020
turns out to be quite important overall

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.950
for enhancing it as a filter.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.940
So don't just think of
your nose as something

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.820
to smell foods and to bring in air.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.730
It's also an active filter for
things that could invade you.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.920
The other way to try
and keep out bad things

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.470
and to avoid getting sick is
the advice that your mother,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.280
and certainly my mother gave me,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.280
which is to not touch your eyes
after touching other people

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.470
or touching other surfaces.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.530
And as I mentioned earlier,

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.760
we tend to do this subconsciously.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.170
But the reason to avoid
doing that is the eyes

00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:00.380
are a primary entry point for
a lot of bacteria and viruses.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.440
You're constantly lubricating
the surface of your eyes

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.020
with the so-called lacrimal glands,

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.720
and tears and things of that sort.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.260
If you've ever noticed when
you wake up in the morning,

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.197
you have some sleep in your eyes,

00:31:10.197 --> 00:31:11.280
you know the kind of crusty stuff

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.470
in the corners of your
eyes or on your eyelashes,

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:19.170
that sleep, that crust
are actually dead bacteria

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.740
that you've successfully
battled during the night.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.573
Okay, that's what that is.

00:31:23.573 --> 00:31:26.660
It's not the accumulation
of some healthy tissue.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.120
It's the accumulation of that
your healthy mucus membranes

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.390
and tears and other things
that are specifically

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.400
combating those bacteria.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.090
So, I know that sounds a little bit gross,

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.950
but that's what that is.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.350
So you're wiping away the
casualties of a battle

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.080
that you fought at night.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.860
So during the daytime, you
don't want to introduce viruses

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.130
and things to your eyes
as much as possible.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.700
It is a primary site of entry.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.920
This is why people wear
goggles in surgical units

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.470
and things of that sort,

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.870
to try and avoid getting
things into their eyes.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.050
Very, very important.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:03.750
And then the third way to
keep a healthy line of defense

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:08.750
for your entire mucus tract is to enhance

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.200
the proliferation of good gut microbiota.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.040
The best way to enhance the
quality of your gut microbiome

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.050
and the mucus lining that
serves as this protective layer

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:24.560
all along your body is to ingest
two to four servings a day

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.210
of fermented foods, low
sugar fermented foods.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.880
I've talked about this
before a bunch of times

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.180
on the podcast, but these
are data from my colleague,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.640
Justin Sonnenburg's lab at Stanford Med.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.160
And there, I just wiped my eyes.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.093
Yep, you got me.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.520
But a paper published
in the journal "Cell,"

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.820
which is a absolutely spectacular journal,

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.870
really points to the fact that when

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.210
people eat fermented foods,
two to four servings per day,

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.540
it helps reduce the activity
of certain cytokines.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.940
Now, you know what those are, right?

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.610
Cells make cytokines to call
out, "help me, help me."

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:01.190
To reduce the amount of cytokines,

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.450
the so-called inflammatom.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.490
Now that doesn't render
those cells more vulnerable.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.190
The reason they saw a
reduction in IL-6 and IL-1,

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.430
and some of these other cytokines

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.370
is because when people have
a healthy gut microbiome,

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.110
there are fewer cells in
the body being infected

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.090
from outside infections and
therefore less of a reason

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.490
for cells to be crying out, "help,"

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.630
because they are thriving, not suffering.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:26.280
So, don't wipe your eyes,
keep your hands clean,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.240
everyone tells you that, right?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.160
But keep your hands clean,
don't wipe your eyes,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.260
be a nasal breather, not a mouth breather,

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.900
unless you're speaking,
exercising or eating,

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.250
and keep a healthy gut microbiome

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.190
by eating two to four servings
a day of quality, low sugar,

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.000
fermented foods, things like sauerkraut,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.930
things like natto if you can access that.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.960
I've tried it before, it's interesting.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.620
It's sort of an acquired
taste, kimchi, pickles,

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.360
again, low sugar sources
are going to be the sources

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.910
that are going to be
most effective for this.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.570
So now you're armed with three
ways to enhance the function

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.280
of your immune system and
combat infection that is,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.050
I like to think separate from the typical

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.610
type of information that you
get such as get good sleep,

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.560
good nutrition, good social
connection, et cetera.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.860
All of that stuff still holds true,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.360
but these three other points
I think can really make

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.920
a substantial difference
in terms of bolstering

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.750
the immune system, your immune system.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.010
I do want to mention,
because these names are going

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.790
to come up several times
during this episode,

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:30.366
that while interleukins like IL-6 and IL-1

00:34:30.366 --> 00:34:33.460
encourage inflammation, they
are these "help me" signals

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.860
that call in cells to gobble up invaders.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.480
There are some interleukins
that are anti-inflammatory.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.550
And the one that I'd like
to highlight in particular,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.570
because it will come up
again in a little bit

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:45.250
is interleukin-10.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.970
So not all of the IL, insert number,

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.500
not all of the interleukins
are inflammatory,

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.900
some are anti-inflammatory.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.330
So that's an important
point to keep in mind

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.430
as we go forward.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:57.720
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.750
what's called sickness behavior.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.620
And indeed there is a category of behavior

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.860
that we call sickness behavior
that is very informative

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.950
as to the things that we can
do to avoid getting sick.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.650
Now, this notion of sickness behavior

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.010
goes back several decades or more.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.300
And it's a very interesting way of looking

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.520
at the function of the immune system,

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.430
because what it does is it
bridges us from this thing

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.200
that we're calling the immune
system where it's T-cells,

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.280
and B-cells, and cytokines and leukocytes,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.760
and it starts taking us into the realm

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.593
of the nervous system,

00:35:32.593 --> 00:35:35.670
because of course the nervous
system controls behavior.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:40.080
So sickness behavior
is a suite of responses

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.220
that we tend to all undergo
when we are feeling sick.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.690
So this is going to vary
from person to person,

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.410
but there's some general
categories of things

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.220
that we all do and that
happen to all of us

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.210
after we are wounded or sick

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.050
or dealing with an infection of any kind.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.540
And by examining sickness
behavior in some detail,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.470
it can be really informative as to routes

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:04.030
that we can take to health.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.010
So the main thing about sickness behavior

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.570
is that it tends to involve a slowing

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.580
of our usual levels of activity.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.640
People start to feel lethargic,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.680
or they feel like the
activities that previously

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.610
they could do with relative ease

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.450
are very difficult for them
or somewhat overwhelming.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.160
The other thing you start to
see is that people and animals,

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.400
by the way, stop grooming,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.930
they stop taking care of themselves.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.340
Not necessarily stopped showering,

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.680
although oftentimes that's the case,

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.310
but they will stop doing their hair,

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.923
they'll stop putting on makeup,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.930
depending on whether or
not they did that before,

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:39.763
they might stop.

00:36:39.763 --> 00:36:43.100
Animals will stop licking
and grooming themselves.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.800
People will stop taking care
of their cosmetic appearance.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.340
Now it's not just because they don't care

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.460
how they look when they're sick,

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.320
it's because there's
this overall suppression

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.930
of certain kinds of
activities and an enhancement

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.070
of other kinds of activities.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.270
And this is really important.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.010
Sickness behavior is
actually a motivated state.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.760
It's a state that's designed
to accomplish certain things.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.610
One of the other features
of sickness behavior

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.160
in addition to being
lethargic, loss of grooming,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.830
will be a loss of appetite, right?

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.360
Oftentimes people who have
a great appetite normally

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.260
just won't feel hungry at all.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.620
And there are several theories
as to why this would be.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.330
One prominent idea in
the literature is that

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.960
it's to discourage vomiting and diarrhea,

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.350
which of course can be
infectious to other people.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.120
So, that's a theory.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.540
I don't know that that's
ever been tested directly,

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.240
but that's one idea.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.410
The other idea is that it's
simply to harbor more resources

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:44.810
for sake of repair.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:48.780
And I want to talk about
that because we are all told

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.490
to get extra sleep when we
aren't feeling well or to rest.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.720
But just like any good
two or three-year-old

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.300
constantly asks, "why, why?"

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:02.430
Good scientists, good
people who are interested

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.260
in health information
should always be asking why.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.270
Why should I get more sleep?

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.420
What happens in sleep that I should

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.550
get more sleep when I'm sick?

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.180
Why shouldn't I just push through this?

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.330
And there are a couple of reasons for this

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.180
that have been established
in the literature.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.550
The first is that there does
seem to be something useful

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.870
about slowing circulation when we are ill.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.380
One idea that has some data to support it

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.590
is that when we slow our
circulation, our blood circulation,

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.950
so not running around so
much or running it all,

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:35.230
but rather lying down, getting
extra rest, maybe sleeping,

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.280
maybe even just remaining still,

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.430
is that the lymphatic system,

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.600
which carries a lot of the
immune-related cells and fluids,

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.580
is able to ramp up its levels of activity.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.890
So, this is interesting, right?

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.270
So reducing circulation of the blood,

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.870
but increasing circulation
of the lymphatic system.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.960
You've all probably been familiar
with the lymphatic system

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.670
when you're combating an infection,

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.370
your lymph nodes can get sore.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.770
You've got lymph nodes behind your ears,

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.950
in your groin, your
armpits, around your throat,

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.590
around near your thyroid,
in your throat, et cetera.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.940
So, that's the other reason.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.893
Now, some people, when they get sick,

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.850
psychologically go into
a very vulnerable state

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.220
where they really, really want people,

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.900
other people to take care of them.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.880
You've probably witnessed this,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.330
or you feel this way yourself.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.690
About 50% of people have that response.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.410
They really want to be taken care of.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.020
Now, when you think about it
from an adaptive perspective,

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.530
this makes sense, right?

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.530
A member of our species is
ill and they more or less

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.860
will cry out for help
in one form or another

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.240
to the other members of their
species to take care of them.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.360
And of course this will be
especially apparent in cases

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.160
where people are young enough
or incapacitated enough

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.770
that they can't actually
get resources on their own.

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.750
If you've ever been really sick,

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.540
just getting up and going to
the fridge or to the restroom

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.960
can feel like a monumental task.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.960
So about 50% of people report
or describe seeking of help

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.700
and support when they are sick.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.130
But you could also
imagine how this would be

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.850
a very non-adaptive response

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.170
because it increases the
opportunity to spread infection

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:16.410
to the caretaker.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.243
So that's an interesting consideration.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.770
Another 50% of people seem
to have the opposite response

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:25.603
when they're sick.

00:40:25.603 --> 00:40:28.170
So, somehow, regardless of how they were

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.840
prior to getting ill,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.220
the sickness behavior that's engaged

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.080
by these neural circuits in the brain,

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.800
they are indeed neural
circuits in the brain,

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.680
create a stay away from me.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.700
I don't want to be bothered.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.700
I want to be left alone.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.280
I don't want to be taken care of, right?

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.823
It's not stubbornness.

00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:45.970
It's literally a lack of interest

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.680
or a disinterest in social
connection when one is sick.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.200
And you see this in animals too,

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.960
some animals will seek out
other members of their species.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.730
Others, like my unfortunately now

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.580
passed away bulldog, Costello.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.220
When he was sick I always knew
because he would go around

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.740
the back of the house and
he would just hide there.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.640
He would just take himself
away from everybody else.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.677
He did not want to be taken care of.

00:41:05.677 --> 00:41:07.530
And it was just a natural response to him.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.880
I don't think he was trying to prevent me

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.190
from getting whatever it was that he had.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.440
So if ever somebody doesn't
want to be taken care of,

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.690
or if they do want to be taken care of,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.350
realize that people tend to fall into

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.430
these two bins naturally,

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.930
and animals tend to fall into these bins.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.940
Regardless of what species
they are, it's about 50/50.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.510
And again, this sickness
behavior is a motivated state.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.610
It's designed to slow
circulation of the blood,

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.560
increase circulation of the lymph,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.360
and the other killer cells in the body,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.130
reduce the probability of
infecting others by reducing,

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.060
its thought, diarrhea and vomit,

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.260
but also breathing on others,
interacting with others.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.350
And in some cases it will activate this,

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.080
I don't want to call it a regressed state,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.685
but many people feel somewhat more...

00:41:52.685 --> 00:41:55.700
If they are adults,
they feel more childlike

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.950
when they are ill and they want

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.390
to be taken care of very badly.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.330
Some of it might be learned.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.560
Some of it might be innate.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.080
We don't know, but the sickness
behavior is very interesting

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.130
for a couple of reasons.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.170
First of all, it mimics another state

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.800
that has been described in
the neuroscience literature,

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.593
which is major depression.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.810
And in both sick individuals,

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.200
sick from bacterial or viral infection,

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.770
and in people with major depression,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.800
it's been shown that
there are robust increases

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.760
in the levels of interleukin-6

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.840
and tumor necrosis factor alpha.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.530
So there is an idea now circulating
that depression involves

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.630
these inflammatory
cytokines being very active.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.830
And we know that illness involves

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.230
inflammatory cytokines being very active.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.063
So if you think about it,

00:42:43.063 --> 00:42:45.970
the similarity between major
depression and being sick

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.990
ought to be able to point us
in a direction of interventions

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.710
that could help us either prevent illness

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.140
or move through illness more quickly.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.200
But as we head in that direction,

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.060
because indeed that's the case,

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.770
I just want to emphasize
that sickness behavior

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.250
is what provides this bridge
between the immune system

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.770
and the nervous system.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.440
And what we'll soon see also
is that healthy behavior,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.700
behavior that allows
us to avoid infection,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.620
also points to a clear bridge between

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.840
the nervous system and the immune system.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.630
That it isn't just that we have a brain

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.070
and body and our organs, and
then we have an immune system.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.960
That's true, but they're
interacting all the time.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.000
And this is going to lead us to a place

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.870
where it's going to be very
clear and not at all surprising

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:34.820
how certain patterns of
thinking and certain behaviors

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.870
that we can elect to take can help enhance

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.720
our immune system function and vice versa.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.210
There are two other features
of sickness behavior

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.250
definitely worth pointing out.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.710
One is a theory, which is
that the reduced appetite,

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.350
in particular appetite for
protein rich foods when sick,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:58.180
is thought to be an attempt,
a subconscious attempt,

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.610
of the organism to
reduce the amount of iron

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:02.900
that it's taking in.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.510
Now, typically the amount of iron intake

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.480
that's recommended or
more or less is for men,

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.790
it's about eight milligrams per day.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.780
For women, it's anywhere from
18 to 27 milligrams per day,

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.260
depending on whether or
not they're pregnant,

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:20.133
lactating or menstruating, et
cetera, the ranges can vary.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.300
But, and indeed, it's
true that if iron levels

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.930
in the blood go too high, like
over 45 milligrams per day

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.950
can be very toxic to the system.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:34.760
But the theory that's prominent
in the biology literature

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.070
and in the health literature
is that the reduction

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:38.570
in appetite is actually an attempt

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:42.550
to reduce iron intake specifically

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.560
because many bacteria and
other forms of infection

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.567
seem to thrive when levels of
iron in the blood are high.

00:44:49.567 --> 00:44:51.890
And I don't want to see
anyone take this too extreme

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.740
and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.990
in order to get well.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.200
But it's an interesting
theory that I'd be remiss

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.560
if I didn't mention,
because it makes good sense.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.830
Iron is actually attached to hemoglobin

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.790
and red blood cells in the bloodstream.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.260
Normally that can help us quite a lot.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.160
It's also in muscle,
I should mention that.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.380
Iron can be a sequestered into muscle,

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.130
and iron serves a lot of
important health promoting roles,

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:24.130
but by reducing appetite and
thereby reducing iron intake,

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.170
it does reduce the
capacity of certain things,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.420
including infections to
travel in certain compartments

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.610
within the body.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:33.360
So, again, that's just theory,

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.630
but I think many of you
are probably familiar

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:38.533
with not having an
appetite when you're sick.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.570
The other thing that's
very typical of people

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.210
with major depression is loss of appetite,

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.870
not always but often loss of appetite.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.760
So, here again, we have loss of appetite

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.590
in sickness behavior, loss of
appetite and major depression,

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.780
and perhaps not surprisingly
one of the major symptoms

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.110
of sickness behavior and major depression

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.920
that map more or less onto one another

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.310
is loss of libido or interest,

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:05.750
not just in social interactions,

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.340
but in sex and reproduction.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.820
And so, again, if you think
about sickness behavior

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.950
and depression, they
are very, very similar.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.780
Okay, so sickness behavior
and major depression

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.343
have certain core features in common.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:24.800
We need to therefore ask
ourselves why and how does

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.510
being sick influence the way
that we think and perceive

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:32.570
our environment and impact our appetite,

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.450
whether or not we want
to be cared for more

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:35.450
or cared for less?

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:39.070
Again, people tend to diverge
into two different bins there,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.380
and believe it or not,

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.800
the pathway for this has been identified.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.330
When we have an infection
someplace in our body,

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:48.890
and it could be up in our head,

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.940
it could be a sinus infection,
it could be an ear infection,

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.770
or I should also mention
many of these same mechanisms

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:57.820
can also be the consequence of a wound

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.453
or an injury to the body.

00:47:01.167 --> 00:47:02.700
A back injury or a slipped disc

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.740
or I guess it's called a herniated disc

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.740
is the way that you hear it described.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.120
When we have that, we
can be kind of irritable,

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.810
we don't want to do certain things

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.940
and we just want to be left alone.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.810
Things are harder.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.190
How? Why?

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.960
Well, there's a known pathway,

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.870
which is the so-called vagus nerve

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.390
that connects the body and the brain,

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:29.390
signals to particular brain
sites to engage this category

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:32.563
of motivational state that
we call sickness behavior.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.820
Many of you have probably
heard of the vagus,

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.440
V-A-G-U-S, vagus.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.850
The vagus nerve is a very
extensive nerve pathway,

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.940
as the 10th cranial nerve
comes out of the back

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.040
of the brainstem, heads into the body,

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.560
and branches out extensively to innervate

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.210
or connect to many of our organs,

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.440
including our lungs, our
heart, our gut, et cetera.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.390
And all of those organs are
able also to send neural signals

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:00.513
back up to the brain.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:04.070
We sometimes hear of
the vagus as the route

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.630
to calming ourselves down.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:08.960
Unfortunately, that's more or less a myth

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.000
that I don't know how it got propagated.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.100
You have lots of different
pathways in the vagus

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:16.540
Usually vagal stimulation
actually creates more arousal

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.210
and alertness, although it
does have multiple pathways,

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.550
but there have now been
many studies of the vagus

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:25.940
in various contexts, including
in sickness behavior.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.940
And it's very clear that the
vagus nerve is the fast pathway

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.890
by which an infection in the
body is signaled to the brain,

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.240
to a particular location in the brain

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.430
called the hypothalamus,

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.220
which harbors a lot of
different types of neurons.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.310
Neurons, for instance,
in the preoptic area

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:45.290
that increase body
temperature and fever, right?

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:46.600
That's one of the most important things

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.130
is to increase body temperature,

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:52.930
it's the body's attempt
to kill off this invader

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:57.040
because many viruses and many bacteria

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.240
don't survive well at elevated heat.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.560
That's the function of a fever.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.190
A fever actually has a functional role.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:05.010
So, in biology, we like complicated words,

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.820
so we call anything that
increases body temperature

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.060
or creates a fever, a pyrogen.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.130
Many years ago, in my undergraduate years,

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.340
I was working on pyrogens,

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.220
injecting something
called lipopolysaccharide

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.910
into the belly, which
then gives you a fever.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.390
The way it does that is LPS causes

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:28.040
an inflammation response in the gut.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.650
The gut doesn't know what is happening.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:31.560
The stomach cells don't
know what's happening.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.900
So they just start secreting
the IL-6, the IL-1,

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.760
all those cytokines, the killer
cells migrate into the gut.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.320
That's why you sometimes
get a stomach ache

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.960
when you don't feel well, you have a flu,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.023
or something like it.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:46.330
A neural signal, electrical
signals get sent up

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:47.400
to the hypothalamus.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.470
The hypothalamus says, oh,
I don't know what's going on

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.560
out there, but there's a
signal something's going on.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.170
Let's just heat up the body.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.040
Let's just start cooking
whatever it is out there.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.840
And of course you don't
want fever to go too high

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.560
because you can kill brain cells.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.560
But within a particular range
the fever is a functional

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.810
and adaptive response, okay?

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:09.750
So if you're taking drugs
to try and lower the fever

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.180
that might make you feel more comfortable,

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.610
but actually that's limiting
the response that your body

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.920
is creating in order to try
and kill off that invader.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.960
And again, you don't want
fever to go too high.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.480
This is going to vary depending on age.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.060
You can look up online what the tolerable

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.260
ranges are for fever.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.820
But when you're trying
to lower body temperature

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.400
when you have a fever,

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.850
unless you're heading into
dangerous levels of heating up,

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:36.920
that's actually the wrong
way to take your system

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.220
if you do indeed want to
kill off that invader.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.330
Okay, so the vagus nerve
is the quick response.

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:46.730
It also sends input to areas of the brain

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.240
that change your perception
of the outside world.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.900
One of the most obvious of these,

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:56.090
obvious once I tell it to
you, is photophobia, right?

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:57.490
I love bright sunshine.

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.140
I love bright lights
when I want to be alert.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.980
We all have different
levels of light sensitivity,

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.810
but most people when they are sick,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.450
when there's an inflammation
response in the body,

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.670
they feel like bright
lights are kind of aversive.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:14.100
They get a well-described
kind of classical photophobia,

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.840
and that's mediated by a
pathway that goes from your eye

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.910
to an area of your thalamus,

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:24.080
called the anterior
nucleus of the thalamus.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.030
This is work that was
done by Clifford Saper

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.920
at Harvard Medical School.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.020
It's really beautiful work.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.620
And then from there up to the
outer lining of the brain,

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.720
which is the meninges just sort of

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.890
on the outside of the brain
where the brain starts

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.420
to interface with some of
the other connective tissues.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.080
We'll talk more about these later.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.580
It can actually create a
photophobia and a headache

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.530
when one is ill.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.729
So, here's the pathway:

00:51:49.729 --> 00:51:51.950
Some invader gets into your system

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.970
'cause you wiped your eyes or
it got in through your mouth.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.190
You didn't listen to your mother

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.150
and got in through your eyes.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:58.233
You're feeling sick.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.020
Something's going on there.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.420
You have a stomach ache because of all

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.230
the inflammation there,

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:05.580
the signal goes up from your vagus nerve.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.350
You're heating up with a fever.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.880
You've got photophobia
because you've activated

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.280
this pathway by which what would
normally be tolerable light

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.140
is triggering this thalamic
nucleus, the anterior thalamus,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.840
that's projecting up to the meninges.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.170
You got a headache in
response to looking at light.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.360
It's basically triggering
an overall pathway

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.440
to get you to go into a
quiet, dark place and rest.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.450
And the last element I'd like
to talk about is the rest.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.230
There's something that gets
triggered from the body

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:35.980
to the brain, to the hypothalamus,

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.510
and we think we know which
hypothalamic area it is.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.780
It's the supraoptic nucleus, we think.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.300
Supraoptic 'cause it's right above

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.020
your so-called optic chiasm,

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.140
If you want to look up where that is,

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.750
it's right above the roof of your mouth.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:51.750
And there are nuclei there that
promote the desire to sleep

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:55.070
even during the daytime,
what would normally be

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.840
the active phase of your circadian cycle.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.100
Now, that is really interesting

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.750
because what's happening
here is you've got multiple

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:05.713
pathways that are saying avoid light,

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.810
reduce your amount of behavior, heat up,

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.250
all the things that are making you sick.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:14.670
This is sickness behavior,
and it's going from your body

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:18.090
to your mind to make
you do the right thing.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:20.600
Now there's also a slow pathway

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.120
that's purely mediated by the blood,

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.730
so-called humoral factors.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:25.700
Not 'cause they're funny,

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.760
but humoral factors are
factors of the blood.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:33.760
As you have an infection
for many hours or days,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.315
the amount of IL-6 and IL-1

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:41.820
and tumor necrosis factor and
other inflammatory cytokines

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.310
is starting to increase
such that the total amount

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.420
in your circulation gets high enough

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.790
and is communicated to the brain.

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:52.740
And it tends to enter the brain through

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.250
a particular type of tissue
that's really interesting

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:58.950
called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.700
Choroid is really interesting.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.150
It's kind of this fluffy tissue

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.300
that sits in your ventricles.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.200
The ventricles are the
spaces in your brain,

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.140
and the spaces in your
brain have what's called

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.020
cerebral spinal fluid in them.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.150
The cerebral spinal fluid contains

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:12.430
a number of important things,

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:16.130
but the choroid starts
releasing and responding

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:19.690
to these cytokines, the
inflammatory cytokines,

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:23.360
and then the brain actually
starts to experience

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.380
all sorts of changes in terms
of inflammation to neurons,

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.090
your memory tends to get poor,

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.340
your cognition tends to get poor.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.030
These are transient things most often.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:35.600
Eventually these things will pass,

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.020
but this is deep into sickness

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.390
when you're really feeling lousy.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:39.920
You can't read, you can't watch a movie,

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.753
you can't do anything.

00:54:40.753 --> 00:54:42.980
So if you ever get sick and you just can't

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.660
be bothered by anything,

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.420
it's probably because you've
had that fast response

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.360
from the body and you've
also had the slower response

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.940
where you literally have a
set of tissues in your brain

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.300
that are sending out these
inflammatory signals.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.920
And now your whole brain
is starting to cope,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.920
or is trying to cope with this infection.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.320
So you've got a slow
pathway and a fast pathway.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.530
That all sounds really terrible.

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:10.070
So, now, I'd like to talk
about what you can do to reduce

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.550
the probability of getting sick.

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:16.630
And there are actually
things that one can do

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.160
as you start to get sick
and once you're sick,

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.350
to accelerate the healing
process by flipping the equation.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:26.240
Up until now we've been
talking about how the body

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.610
activates certain areas
in the brain to create

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.960
sickness behavior that's
very much like depression.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.630
You're probably all familiar
with this from anytime

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.790
you've had a cold or a flu
or something really lousy

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.930
or an injury.

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:40.530
Now, let's flip the equation
and ask what can we do

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:43.040
with our nervous system
in order to enhance

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.940
the function of our immune
system in order to be able

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.590
to heal and recover from
illness and injury more quickly.

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.650
So let's say you are in that
unfortunate circumstance

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:57.040
of waking up one day or coming home,

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.990
and you've got that tickle in your throat,

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.520
or when you breathe,

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.800
your nasal passages
don't feel the same way.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.860
You've got a little bit of a headache.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.210
You're feeling kind of off.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.360
We all know what we should do.

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.090
We should all hydrate, drink
some water and go to sleep.

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.380
Right, that's we are all told,

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:18.210
but there are actually things
that you can actively do

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:22.700
in order to get your immune
system to deploy a more robust

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:27.700
response at that early phase
of potential infection.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.793
Let's focus first on the rest component.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.990
Yes, of course we are all
told that we should take

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:36.790
a hot shower and go to sleep,

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:38.720
and get nine or 10 hours of sleep.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.320
But there's an interesting
way of looking at sleep,

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.130
specifically for its role in
enhancing the immune system.

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:49.790
And there's a wonderful review,

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:54.250
I'll put the review in the
captions that looked specifically

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:59.250
at the literature surrounding
sleep that is different

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:02.750
because it occurs in support
of the immune system.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.180
So normally when we go to sleep,

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.660
we have slow-wave sleep predominantly

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.960
in the early phase of the night,

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.190
and then over time as we
sleep longer and longer,

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:11.360
we get more so-called REM,
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.250
I talked all about this
on the episodes on sleep.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.250
Of course you have slow-wave
sleep and REM sleep

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.490
throughout the night always,

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.010
but it's the fraction of slow-wave sleep

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:20.620
to REM sleep that shifts,

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.923
and they have different
functions, et cetera.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.090
There is some evidence
that the sleep associated

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:31.710
with an infection, in particular,
early stage of infection,

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:36.280
is associated with elevated
levels of serotonin in the brain

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.170
that either through an adaptive mechanism

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:41.570
or for whatever reason,
the neurons in the brain

00:57:42.544 --> 00:57:44.260
of the so-called raphe nucleus start

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.423
releasing more serotonin.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.320
And that serotonin and
its related pathways

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.870
can help enhance some of
the immune system function

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.190
that could combat the infection.

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:59.590
There is starting to be some data,

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:01.620
and I emphasize starting because it's not

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.520
a very robust literature yet,

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.560
looking at whether or not
supplementing precursors

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.340
to serotonin like 5-HTP,

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.520
which can be taken in a supplement form

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:17.520
or consuming foods that
increase serotonin naturally.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.740
So these would be any foods that contain

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:20.830
high levels of tryptophan.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.000
You can look up what those are.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.200
So, white meat turkey, for instance,

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.530
certain complex carbohydrates can often

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:30.490
be rich with tryptophan.

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.080
That consuming those foods can enhance

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.947
the amount of serotonin
that's available in the brain

00:58:34.947 --> 00:58:37.970
and blood and thereby
lead to the particular

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:41.470
quality of sleep that
allows for more deep healing

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.280
or for when I say deep healing,

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.210
I mean for a more robust immune response.

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.920
Now, again, those are still emerging data.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.070
What is very clear, however,

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.560
is that during sleep and in particular,

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.940
during sleep that's associated
with the early stage

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.660
of any kind of viral
or bacterial infection,

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.720
the so-called glymphatic
system is much more active

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.060
than it would be normally.

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.450
What's the glymphatic system?

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:07.830
The glymphatic system is actually

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:10.540
a relatively recent discovery.

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:14.050
I mentioned lymph and the
lymphatic system earlier,

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:18.550
the glymphatic system with a
G, is a system in the brain

00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:22.270
by which debris that
accumulates throughout the day,

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.730
but in particular, debris that
accumulates under conditions

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:29.860
of neuroinflammation and
inflammation of the body,

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:33.130
is cleared out or is
washed out of the brain.

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.290
And the activity of this glymphatic system

00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:39.390
is extremely important for the recovery

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:41.810
from infection of any kind.

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:45.280
And it's now becoming clear,
is important for recovery

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.860
from traumatic head injury,

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.913
and maybe even from psychological trauma.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.720
So, the glymphatic system can
be thought of more or less

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.200
as a plumbing system that
runs through the ventricles,

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.060
but also mainly through
the lining that sits

00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.710
between the brain and the skull

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:03.050
and some of the other tissues
and things of that sort.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:05.200
The choroid is involved as well.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.250
Brain imaging reveals
the glymphatic system

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.690
is very active during deep sleep.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.440
And there's this kind of wash
out of the glymphatic system.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.490
And I am aware of some
studies that are ongoing now

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:18.260
where augmenting the serotonin
system through either

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.700
supplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.630
or even serotonin itself,
these are laboratory studies,

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:27.210
is being looked at for
its capacity to increase

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.020
the amount of circulation
in the glymphatic system.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.900
And the idea is that it might,
and I want to underscore might,

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.690
potentially lead to more
rapid recovery from injury

01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:40.080
and illness and potentially
ramp up, if you will,

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.870
the activity of the immune system.

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.260
So, it essentially is a
ramping up of the activity

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.350
of the immune system.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.690
Now, regardless of whether
or not you decide to,

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.100
for instance, supplement with
5-HTP before sleep or not,

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.310
I'll talk about what that
might look like in a moment,

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.480
there is a way that you
can increase the activity

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.200
of your glymphatic system
under normal circumstances.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.700
Because of the mechanics
of the glymphatic system,

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:06.740
it turns out that if
you elevate your heels

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.050
by about 12 degrees, it
doesn't have to be exactly 12,

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:12.040
as you sleep by putting
maybe a rolled pillow

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.840
or two pillows underneath your feet,

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.500
by having the head below your legs.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.130
It seems that there's
more glymphatic washout

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:22.000
or clearance during sleep.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.630
And this is without taking any compound

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:25.190
to adjust the serotonin system.

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.470
So I would say if you're not feeling well,

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:28.660
yes, take the hot shower.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.670
Yes, get into bed and go to sleep,

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:32.630
but elevate your feet to try and increase

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.693
the activity of the glymphatic system.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:41.140
Some might even consider
that if you have to be awake,

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.470
that you might want to be awake

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.040
with your feet elevated above your head.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.010
Now that might not be
practical for the workplace,

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:50.940
but it might be practical for
a short nap during the day

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:51.820
or something of that sort.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.310
The glymphatic system is not
just active during sleep.

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.460
It's also active during
certain phases of waking,

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:00.020
in particular when we are in
a deep state of relaxation.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.240
So as many of you probably
know I'm a big proponent

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.020
of self-hypnosis because of the quality

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.300
scientific literature on this.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.880
If you're interested in self-hypnosis,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.000
you can go to Reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.020
Reverie is a cost-free
app for Apple and Android

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.140
that was developed by my
colleague, David Spiegel,

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.410
and others at the Stanford
University School of Medicine,

01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:23.290
based on quality studies
and peer reviewed data,

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:26.830
showing that deep states
of relaxation can be used

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.990
to improve pain management,

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.507
improve transition time to sleep,

01:02:30.507 --> 01:02:32.450
and a number of other things.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:35.900
You can select the
various sort of outcomes

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.130
that you're seeking using Reverie.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.130
It's a great thing especially for people

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.360
that are challenged with
meditation could use,

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.590
because you just listened to the script.

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:45.120
It involves deep relaxation.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.870
I would suggest using that
script, or the script for sleep,

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.840
but with feet elevated
to increase activity

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.070
of the glymphatic system.

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:56.060
Now, if you do decide
that you want to test out

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.210
this serotonin hypothesis on your own,

01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.570
obviously check with a doctor.

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:00.960
I'm not a doctor, I'm a professor.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.770
So, I'm professing things,
not suggesting things,

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:06.650
but 5-HTP is a supplement
that I've talked about before

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.390
on this podcast that I
actually do not recommend

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.420
for most people for sake of sleep,

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.970
because it can disrupt the
normal architecture of sleep

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.580
and create a deep sleep
early in the night,

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.650
and then a spontaneous
waking with some trouble

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:21.810
to get back to sleep.

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.880
And that's because of the
way that the serotonin system

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.950
and the melatonin system interact.

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.920
However, under conditions
where one is feeling

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.240
like they might have an infection

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.580
or an early stage of illness,

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.820
in that case, 5-HTP might
be a useful supplement

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.250
in order to access these states of sleep

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:39.750
that are not typical.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.860
They're not the typical deep
sleep that you would achieve

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.920
when you're feeling healthy.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.180
These are states of sleep
that are specifically there

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.460
in order to try and repair
some of the immune system

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.610
related inflammation that's occurring.

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:55.750
If you'd like to explore
the 5-HTP approach

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.830
and you feel it's right and safe for you,

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.580
and you've talked to your doctor,

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.460
it's 300 to 500 milligrams
taken about 30 to 60 minutes

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.400
before going to sleep for the night.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.620
That's the typical protocol.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:13.620
Not incidentally,
increasing serotonin is also

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.130
one typical approach for the
treatment of major depression.

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:19.950
This is the basis for things like SSRIs,

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.880
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.470
like Prozac and Zoloft, and so forth.

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:29.910
The 5-HTP approach is
a much milder approach

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:32.550
than prescription drug, of course,

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:35.050
but will allow more serotonin

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.430
to be synthesized and/or released.

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:40.520
Now, for those of you that are
interested in learning more

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.170
about the glymphatic system,
it's a fascinating system,

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.870
and you might want to do a deep dive there

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:46.410
in terms of the behavioral protocols,

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:47.243
and what's known about it,

01:04:47.243 --> 01:04:49.947
there's a wonderful article called

01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:52.610
"The Glymphatic System:
A Beginner's Guide."

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.040
This is a scientific article.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.550
The first author is Jessen is
the last name, J-E-S-S-E-N.

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:02.010
If you put in "Jessen,
The Glymphatic System:

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.990
A Beginner's Guide," you
can access the full length

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:05.340
manuscript easily online.

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:08.290
It'll show up immediately in your search.

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:11.170
And in a really interesting way,

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:14.520
the glymphatic system
has now also been tied

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.250
to the iron deposition system.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.220
Earlier we were talking
about iron and how,

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.720
of course, getting enough
dietary iron is important,

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.980
but if levels of iron are too high

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.170
it isn't good for a number of reasons.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.960
There's a very interesting article

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.647
that just came out last year called

01:05:30.647 --> 01:05:34.610
"Dysfunction of the glymphatic
system might be related

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:38.020
to iron deposition in
the normal aging brain."

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.960
So, we're starting to see these links

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.670
between iron levels being too high,

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:47.670
the glymphatic system not being
active enough and so forth,

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.570
leading to sickness
behavior, inflammation,

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:54.120
and maybe even damage to
neurons associated with aging.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.060
We can flip that on its
head and say that increasing

01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.950
the activity of the glymphatic system,

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:01.480
feet elevated during deep sleep,

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:06.183
maybe even feet elevated
above the head while awake,

01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:09.430
during a nap or doing a Reverie script

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:11.430
once a day or something of that sort,

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.790
could increase the activity
of the glymphatic system,

01:06:13.790 --> 01:06:18.790
lowering iron to a point
that's probably below

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.760
the typical intake during
periods of infection,

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.880
perhaps, I should say,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.520
can enhance the glymphatic
system and vice versa.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.510
And then you've got this specialized sleep

01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:32.750
that's related to sickness behavior

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:35.520
that seems to have heightened
levels of serotonin

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.867
that might be augmented
by ingesting 5-HTP.

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.940
Again, not on a regular basis.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.100
I don't suggest that people take compounds

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.040
that increase serotonin
unless it's prescribed

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.577
to you for depression or something,

01:06:50.577 --> 01:06:55.230
but not doing by supplement
with tryptophan or 5-HTP

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.310
on a regular basis, but
only under conditions

01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:00.120
where as I mentioned, you
might be starting to feel sick

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.190
or you're coming down with something,

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:03.550
or you're combating
some sort of infection.

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.720
So if we consider the
advice that we typically get

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.610
when we're not feeling
well of take a hot shower,

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.410
get into bed and go to sleep,

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:14.470
and we've now touched on
ways to potentially increase

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:16.490
the efficacy of the sleep part through

01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:18.520
the glymphatic and the serotonin system.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.140
What about the take a hot shower part?

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:20.973
Is that good advice?

01:07:20.973 --> 01:07:21.830
Well, it turns out it is,

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:24.080
and there's actually a
way to do even better.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.810
There's a study, a very interesting study,

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.680
the title reveals where
I'm going with this,

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.550
it's "Effect of a single
Finnish sauna session

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.300
on white blood cell profile
and cortisol levels."

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.480
In this case, it was done in
athletes and non-athletes,

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.380
which is kind of nice.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:44.270
This involves taking
athletes and non-athletes

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:46.050
and exposing them to sauna.

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:47.770
It wasn't particularly hot.

01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:49.940
It was 96 degrees, which isn't cool,

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.990
but it's not really hot.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.900
Nowadays you hear about people
doing very, very hot sauna.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.530
The humidity of the sauna,
if you want to know,

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.870
is 15 plus or minus 3%.

01:07:56.870 --> 01:08:00.640
But basically what they found
was that just one 15 minutes

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.130
sauna session could really increase

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:05.570
white blood cell profiles and
could adjust cortisol levels

01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:08.780
in ways that were beneficial
for combating infection.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.110
And now there are many
other studies like this.

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:13.340
Now, this should immediately
make sense based on

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.590
what we said before about fever;

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:17.810
heating up can actually
help combat infection.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:18.960
But for those of you that have listened

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.563
to the episodes on temperature,

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.950
what you probably know is
that when you get into a sauna

01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:24.350
or any kind of hot environment,

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.240
your body is also going to be actively

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.210
pushing to cool itself off.

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:30.750
So, there's probably an increase in heat,

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.010
there is an increase in heating,

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:34.360
but then afterwards
your body will cool off,

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.460
maybe even with a dip below baseline.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.560
I do want to provide a cautionary note

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.920
that if you are already running a fever,

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.290
getting into a sauna could
take your body temperature

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.770
into dangerously high levels,

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.500
dangerously meaning you can kill neurons.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.990
And once you kill neurons,
they do not come back.

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:50.740
So, please don't kill your neurons.

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.930
I don't recommend getting into a sauna

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.220
if you're already running a fever.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.900
So this would be something
to do at the initial stage

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.380
of an infection or if you're
feeling a little bit off.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.070
So this is kind of a ramping
up or a super protocol

01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:06.390
of the typical advice of take
a hot shower and get into bed.

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:07.223
That is good advice.

01:09:07.223 --> 01:09:09.920
Now we're talking about a hot sauna,

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.440
probably showering off
and then getting into bed,

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.370
maybe augmenting serotonin.

01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.570
I know many people don't
have access to sauna.

01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:19.640
So, in that case, a
very hot bath or shower,

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.140
don't scald yourself, of course,

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.640
but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.230
or right at that edge
of what you can tolerate

01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:27.400
would be a good idea.

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.300
Some people I've heard are creating saunas

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.360
in their bathrooms by running hot water

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.470
and creating a ton of steam.

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:35.550
Anything that really heats you up,

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:36.900
but not to dangerously high levels

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.200
is going to be beneficial.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.283
If you have access to a sauna, terrific.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.873
This again was only 15 minutes.

01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:47.830
They'd had a cool off session.

01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:50.210
Would you get more of an increase?

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.620
People always want to know
if you did it twice as much,

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.420
would you get twice an increase?

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.810
Those data don't really exist yet.

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:57.130
However, if you are
interested in maximizing

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:58.640
the effects of sauna,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.580
it is clear that a cool
off period is important.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:04.350
So it's not that a 15
minute sauna is good,

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:05.910
and a 30 minute sauna is better.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.120
If you are going to take
that route of exploring more,

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.420
it does seem that doing a
15 minute heating period

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.650
followed by a five to 10
minute cooling period,

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:18.500
and then getting back into
the heat can be beneficial.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.620
And this is interesting.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.620
It gets to the mechanisms by
which the hypothalamus areas,

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:26.020
the areas of the hypothalamus, that is,

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.250
that generate increases in body heat,

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:32.600
the activation of those
neurons occurs as you heat up

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.550
and then were you to just stay
in that heated environment,

01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:37.620
they would actually shut
off and some other neurons

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.680
would be handling the job so to speak.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.230
But by getting in and out
of the heated environment,

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.460
you actually force that
system to send repeated pulses

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:49.890
of these cortisol lowering
and white cell stimulating

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:51.360
signals to the body.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.977
Some of you have probably
heard the phrase,

01:10:52.977 --> 01:10:55.327
"feed a fever, starve a cold."

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.960
I don't know who first said that.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.410
I couldn't find the
citation, but we hear this.

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:05.397
And we can speculate that
the reason that phrase,

01:11:05.397 --> 01:11:08.170
"feed a fever, starve a cold" came to be

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.800
is because of the adaptive
function of fever,

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.360
that increases in body
temperature make it challenging

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.160
for intruding viruses
and bacteria to survive.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.100
Even though, of course, highly
elevated body temperatures

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.633
pose a danger to the
host organism, to you.

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.030
Feeding, eating does cause an
increase in body temperature

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.480
through the so-called
thermogenic effect of food.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.720
So I can understand the
logic of feed a fever.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.700
It would mean that when you have a fever,

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.300
it's your body's natural
attempt to heat up

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.150
and kill some invading thing.

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:46.180
And by eating, you would further increase

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.930
your body temperature.

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:51.223
Why you would want to starve
a cold, I don't know, however.

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:55.290
Maybe it's because when your
nasal passages are congested,

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:58.070
it's uncomfortable to eat
or something of that sort.

01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:00.220
So the feet of fever
part makes sense to me,

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.900
the starve a cold part is
still mysterious to me.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:06.870
I couldn't find any logical
reason why that would be good.

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:09.830
There are communities out
there that believe that fasting

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:14.763
is a viable way to combat
certain types of infection.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.380
Fasting, in particular, prolonged fasts,

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.540
do increase the amount of adrenaline,

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.310
also called epinephrin,
in the brain and body.

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:27.930
And as we'll next explain, epinephrin,

01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:31.500
adrenaline does have a powerful effect on

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.250
the various inflammatory cytokines

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.370
and on the immune system in general.

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:38.190
So, let's talk about a behavioral protocol

01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:40.700
that anyone can use; it
doesn't involve any equipment,

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.700
you don't need a sauna, you
don't need anything at all,

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.900
that has been demonstrated
in excellent peer reviewed

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.970
research to enhance the
function of the immune system

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:52.920
and actually allow people
to combat infection

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.780
in very dramatic ways.

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.900
Next, I'd like to do an
in-depth analysis of a study

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.760
that has achieved some
prominence out there,

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.100
not just in the scientific
literature, but on the internet,

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:09.510
because it relates to how
particular types of breathing

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.630
can impact the immune system

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:14.650
and the ability to combat infection.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.277
The title of this paper is

01:13:16.277 --> 01:13:19.620
"Voluntary activation of the
sympathetic nervous system

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.020
and attenuation of the innate
immune response in humans."

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.170
This is a paper that
was published in PNAS,

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.010
which is the Proceedings
of the National Academy

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.130
of Sciences, USA.

01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:32.223
It's a very prestigious journal.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.780
For those of you that know PNAS,

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.610
you know that there are certain
papers published in PNAS,

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:39.410
or there used to be that
were not peer reviewed.

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:41.340
In recent years, I think
all of them have moved

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.320
to peer reviewed papers.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.360
So this is a peer reviewed,
very high quality study.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.170
And I just want to describe
the basic contour of the study.

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:52.690
I'll explain the findings,
and then I want to go in-depth

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:55.810
and explain the mechanistic
basis for these findings

01:13:55.810 --> 01:14:00.090
and the protocol that we can
all export from these findings.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:01.853
So, here we go.

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.170
First of all, a couple of
terms so that everybody

01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:06.373
is on the same page.

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.580
The sympathetic nervous
system is one division

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.500
of our nervous system.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.720
It's a set of neurons down
the middle of our spinal cord

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.530
and in our brain that generally
lead to a heightened state

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.030
of arousal and alertness.

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:23.550
It's associated with
epinephrin release in the brain

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:25.680
and adrenaline release in the body.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.860
It's the so-called fight or flight system

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.440
when it's really active,

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.273
but it's the system that's
active when we are wide awake.

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:37.850
And we already talked about
the innate immune system.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:40.950
That's that first line of
defense after the skin barrier,

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:44.670
of course, whereby some
infection comes into the body

01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:48.690
and there's this rapid response
of increasing inflammation.

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:52.070
And that's also about the time
that you first feel lousy.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.903
So when you start to feel like,

01:14:52.903 --> 01:14:54.170
"ugh, I think I've got something.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:55.670
I don't feel right, a headache.

01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:57.010
I feel nauseous.

01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:57.870
I'm heating up.

01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:58.710
I don't feel good."

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:02.083
That's the innate immune
system kicking in.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.270
So what they did in this study,

01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:07.740
and by the way, I should say they,

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:10.880
this first author is Kox, K-O-X,

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.570
last author, last name
Pickkers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S.

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:20.200
What they did was they
exposed human subjects

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.553
to an endotoxin.

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:25.790
In other words, they
injected people with E. coli,

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:29.430
which is a bacteria which makes people,

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:30.950
all people feel terrible.

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:34.700
Makes you nauseous,
fever, vomiting, diarrhea,

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.610
it's very unpleasant, okay?

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:39.110
These people voluntarily
signed up for this study.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.680
However, some of the
subjects in this study

01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:48.630
performed a behavioral protocol
that can best be described

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.730
as cyclic hyperventilation.

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:53.210
My lab works on these types
of breathing protocols.

01:15:53.210 --> 01:15:54.670
This is not work that my lab did,

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:57.840
but basically subjects hyperventilate,

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.140
followed by breath
retention, by breath holds,

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.220
and I'll explain exactly what they did.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.610
They also looked at other
forms of behavioral protocols,

01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:07.010
but let's focus on that one.

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:10.820
So, they're comparing
controls that do just sort

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:13.060
of a basic meditation
versus people that do

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.833
this intense breathing
followed by some breath holds.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:19.447
I'm just paraphrasing here,
in the intervention group,

01:16:19.447 --> 01:16:20.510
the breathing group,

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:24.580
plasma levels of
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.750
so this is a cytokine that
is lowers inflammation,

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:32.143
increased after endotoxin administration.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.840
And that was triggered by an increase

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.090
in epinephrin and adrenaline.

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:37.950
So, in other words,

01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:39.900
doing a particular pattern
of breathing allowed

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.370
an anti-inflammatory
cytokine to be turned on,

01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:45.440
whereas that was not
the case in the subjects

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.890
that did not do this
particular breathing protocol.

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:51.420
And they discovered that levels

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.420
of proinflammatory TNF-alpha,
tumor necrosis factor alpha,

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:59.470
IL-6, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8,

01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:01.290
which you should all be familiar with now,

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:04.340
as proinflammatory cytokines were lower

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.640
in the intervention group.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.800
Whereas these IL-10 levels

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.550
that are anti-inflammatory went up.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.200
Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.530
in the intervention group.

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.770
So this is an amazing finding, right?

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:18.033
These are human subjects.

01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:21.330
One group of subjects is
doing this breathing protocol.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:24.420
The other group of subjects
is just meditating.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:28.560
Both sets of subjects have
been injected with E. coli.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.550
So, you know everyone's
getting the same amount

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.510
placed into their system.

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:35.760
This is very, very interesting.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.990
And it leads to the question
that every good scientist,

01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:41.310
two year old or health
information seeker asks,

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:42.990
which is why?

01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.823
How?

01:17:43.823 --> 01:17:44.810
How in the world does this work?

01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:45.970
Why does this work?

01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:49.760
Well to make a long story shortish,

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.030
because I am going to go into depth here,

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:54.860
the reason it works is
because the sympathetic

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:59.380
nervous system, the so-called stress part

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.517
of our nervous system, it's
not really called that,

01:18:01.517 --> 01:18:04.170
but the part of our nervous
system that triggers stress

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:07.473
from mild stress, to severe
stress, even to panic,

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.370
causes the release of
adrenaline and epinephrin

01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:13.060
in the brain and body.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.300
And under normal circumstances,

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.530
when we have some sort
of invading infection,

01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:20.980
our body is able to push back on that,

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:23.950
to resist it by engaging
the stress response.

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:27.980
So what's happening here is
there's a behavioral protocol

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.180
involving the nervous
system, 'cause all behaviors

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.420
are generated from the
nervous system of course.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:36.220
A behavioral protocol that
people are deliberately employing

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.830
that allows them to activate
the sympathetic nervous system,

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:43.610
which in turn allows them to
activate the normal pathways

01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:47.510
by which immune system
function is enhanced.

01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.370
Okay?

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:51.300
Now, the reason I'm
underscoring this is that

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:54.570
the common interpretation of
this study is that somehow

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:57.900
it blocks the normal immune response,

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.780
but that's not really
what's happening here.

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.540
Yes, there's a reduction
in inflammatory cytokines

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.410
and there's an increase in
anti-inflammatory cytokines,

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:08.340
but that's not really the same thing

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.600
as blocking the immune response.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.330
This could just as easily
be viewed as enhancing

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:16.290
the immune response and
combating the intruder,

01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:18.120
in this case, E. coli.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.960
So, let's parse this study
a little bit more closely.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.910
First of all, what is this
magical pattern of breathing?

01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.340
Some of you may recognize this

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.200
as so-called Wim Hof breathing.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.830
Wim, of course the Dutchman.

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:31.470
I think his occupation online used to be

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:34.090
listed as daredevil, believe
it or not, on Wikipedia.

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:36.743
That's a pretty cool occupation.

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:42.590
Wim is best known for his
activities with cold exposure,

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.000
he holds multiple world records for that,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.510
swimming under icebergs
and other incredible feats,

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:51.070
that you definitely
don't want to try unless

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:52.760
you're extremely skilled and really know

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.750
what you're doing, as he does,

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.977
but also for the use of breath work.

01:19:56.977 --> 01:20:00.430
The breathing that is
so-called Wim Hof breathing

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:02.370
is very similar, not exactly the same,

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:05.410
but very similar to Tummo breathing,

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:07.420
as it's been described historically.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:09.740
In the science and physiology community

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:12.550
and in my laboratory, 'cause
I run a university laboratory,

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:14.670
we refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation,

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:17.950
which just means repeated
deep breaths in and out.

01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:19.350
And then there are these retentions.

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:23.130
So, because I'm here
in the hot seat anyway,

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:24.910
I might as well demonstrate it for you

01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:26.160
so you know what this looks like.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.360
There are variations on
this, so with respect to Wim,

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.120
with respect to Tummo practitioners,

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.150
with respect to the cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere,

01:20:34.150 --> 01:20:36.020
this is one general theme of it.

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:40.420
It involves 20 to 30 deep inhales

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.860
and then exhales through the mouth,

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:46.570
followed by a exhale of all one's air

01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:49.820
and a breath hold, that's the retention.

01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:53.330
And then at some point,
15 to 60 seconds later,

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:55.490
repeating the 25 or 30 breaths.

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:59.050
And then again, a breath
hold with lungs empty.

01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:00.490
There are variations on this,

01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:04.490
but in our laboratory and
in this particular study,

01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:05.760
it looks something like this.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.420
Okay, I'm not going to do
the whole thing right now,

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.156
but it goes something like this.

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:12.656
[Andrew deeply breathing]

01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:20.970
Okay, so let's assume I
did that for 30 breaths.

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:23.850
I can already feel myself
perspiring a little bit.

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:26.270
You're heating up, that's
the release of adrenaline.

01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:27.590
It's caused by that breathing pattern,

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:29.010
and then exhaling all of one's air,

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:30.945
no speaking in between like I'm doing.

01:21:30.945 --> 01:21:34.362
[Andrew deeply exhaling]

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:39.420
And then sitting lungs empty
until one feels the impulse

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.150
to breathe and then
repeating for several rounds,

01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:43.770
two or three or even four rounds.

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:46.790
Now some people will also
introduce a big inhale

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:48.490
and breath hold at the end

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:51.280
and find that indeed they can
hold their breath much longer

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.030
than they normally would be able to.

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:56.630
Because the trigger to
breathe is normally activated

01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:59.700
by increases in carbon
dioxide in our blood.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.580
We have neurons in our brain stem

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.270
and in our various regions
of our brain, actually,

01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:07.230
that respond to when
carbon dioxide is too high

01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:08.740
and trigger the reflex to breathe.

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.980
But when we exhale deeply,

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.860
we blow off a lot of carbon dioxide

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.860
so we don't feel that impulse
to breathe come quite as soon.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:21.060
Basically this study
looked at people doing

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:24.440
these cyclic hyperventilation
with retention,

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.740
25 or 30 breaths, then the retention,

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.390
25 or 30 breaths, then retention,

01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:30.210
25 or 30 breaths, then the retention.

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:33.480
So, three rounds of 25 to 30
breaths followed by exhale,

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.210
hold in between of various duration.

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:40.960
But in general, 15 to
60 seconds is typical.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.440
What happened physiologically?

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.300
This is one of the
reasons I like this study.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.810
What happened physiologically?

01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:49.520
Well, a couple of things.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.770
Of course, blood oxygenation drops.

01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:55.410
You would expect that
based on hyperventilation

01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:56.870
and especially based on the exhale

01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:58.140
of so much carbon dioxide.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.240
We could explain why that is,

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.570
but blood levels of oxygen drop.

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:08.570
The pH, the alkalinity
of the body goes way up.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.120
This is very interesting.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.430
If you look up this paper,

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:14.730
you can look at Figure One,
Panel C, the pH goes way up.

01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:15.840
People become alkaline.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.270
You've heard before of alkaline water.

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:19.103
I hate to say this,

01:23:19.103 --> 01:23:20.610
I'll probably lose some friends for this,

01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:24.140
but yeah, don't waste your money
on drinking alkaline water.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:27.430
You can't really shift the
alkalinity of your body.

01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:30.340
There are cases where some
compartment in your body

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.950
needs to be more alkaline than the rest.

01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:34.530
Your gut is a different
alkalinity than other areas

01:23:34.530 --> 01:23:38.310
of your body, et cetera, but
ingesting high alkaline water

01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.410
isn't going to shift
your overall alkalinity.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.150
If someone can send me a quality reference

01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:45.400
that shows different than I'm happy

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.450
to revise that statement.

01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.760
But in any case, doing
that pattern of breathing

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.540
that I just described
greatly increases the pH.

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.490
Greatly, I should say,
it doesn't send it off

01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:55.360
into dangerous levels.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.440
It takes it from 7.4 to 7.6,

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.260
which is a significant
increase in alkalinity.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.630
So, as pH levels, for those
you remember high school

01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:08.750
or college chemistry, as the
numbers on the pH go down,

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:10.180
you're becoming more acidic,

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.680
as they go up, you're
becoming more alkaline,

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.110
okay or more basic.

01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:17.870
So, these subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6

01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:18.920
during the breathing,

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.700
and then afterwards it returned to normal.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.260
But that shift in alkalinity is thought

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.950
to be important here.

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:25.900
So, what's going on here?

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:30.900
How is the breathing
leading to the shifts in...

01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:35.070
Or I should say reduction
in inflammatory cytokines

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:38.760
and an increase in the liberation

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.240
of these anti-inflammatory cytokines.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.450
Well, the authors make some good arguments

01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:47.780
as to why it's not the shift in pH per se,

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:52.030
or the shift in carbon
dioxide levels in the blood,

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:54.750
but rather it's the release of epinephrin.

01:24:55.858 --> 01:24:57.740
And there's some good reason
to believe why that's the case.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.180
It's beyond the scope of this discussion,

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.290
but that it's actually
the release of epinephrin,

01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:05.930
AKA adrenaline, that's
causing this reduction

01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:07.170
in inflammation.

01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:11.660
And that's actually supported by something

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.390
that you've probably experienced before,

01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:15.190
which is if you've ever
worked, worked, worked, worked,

01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:17.490
worked really hard, or
you've been a caretaker

01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:20.120
for somebody else or studying for exams,

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.560
and people around you are getting sick

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.690
and you're just powering through it

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.670
and you're not getting sick,

01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:27.320
but then you stop, you
turn in your final exam,

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.910
you stopped taking care of somebody else,

01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:32.350
or you finally stop and
rest or you go on vacation,

01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:34.070
and then you get sick.

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:38.870
Well, you've just experienced
the effect that adrenaline,

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:42.040
epinephrin can have in
activating your immune system

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.040
by way of the nervous system,

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.710
in order to keep fighting
and combating infection.

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:49.470
And that brings us to a larger theme,

01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:52.980
which is that stress and
combating infection or a wound

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:56.490
is not one unique system.

01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:58.210
It's the same stress system that you use

01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:00.110
to combat psychological stress.

01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:01.830
So when you're very, very stressed,

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.670
at least in the short term,

01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:06.670
because you release so much
adrenaline and epinephrin,

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:09.340
you're actually better
able to combat infections

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.517
and you reduce inflammation

01:26:10.517 --> 01:26:12.620
and the whole feeling
lousy response, right?

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.810
Remember reduced flu-like symptoms here.

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:18.110
So this pattern of breathing
is actually a very useful tool.

01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:20.970
And I confess, I use this
pattern of breathing anytime

01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:23.790
I am at the initial stages
of getting some sort of bug.

01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:26.440
If I feel like I've been
running myself ragged,

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.470
or if I somehow, for whatever reason,

01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:29.750
have a tickle in my throat,

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:31.930
or I have that kind of
sensation in my nose,

01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:35.330
like I might've caught a bug of some sort,

01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:37.780
I will do this pattern of breathing.

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.330
I've been doing it consistently,

01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:41.713
gosh, for the last four years or more.

01:26:42.722 --> 01:26:45.190
Now this is just anecdotal reports,

01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:49.240
but I find that it allows
me indeed to either

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.750
have those early symptoms disappear,

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:54.560
or it allows me to just
kind of push through

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.800
and harder, longer.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.310
I don't suggest people
continue to push through

01:26:59.310 --> 01:27:00.610
exposure to infections.

01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:03.120
Obviously you don't want
to infect other people,

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.700
nor do you want to crash and
suddenly get a massive illness

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.130
of some sort because you
stopped doing this breathing.

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:10.850
But I do think it's a useful tool.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:14.730
It's a purely behavioral
intervention that has been shown

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:17.830
here and now there are
additional studies on the way,

01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:21.310
to enhance the function
of your immune system

01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:22.740
and to reduce inflammation.

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.100
And this is to me, one of
the most concrete examples

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:31.100
of a zero cost tool that
bridges the activation

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.880
of the nervous system through breathing

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.200
with the immune system by
way of releasing adrenaline

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.710
and thereby reducing the terrible effects

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:46.090
or feelings of lousiness
from, in this case,

01:27:46.090 --> 01:27:48.050
an E. coli infection.

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:52.270
Now, I'd like to focus on a
couple of important points

01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:55.820
that I haven't heard
discussed broadly elsewhere,

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.670
which is that the hyperventilation

01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:01.680
and the breath retention
are both important.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.680
So you can't simply
hyperventilate to get this effect

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.230
at the level of epinephrin release

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.880
and reduction in inflammatory cytokines.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.260
It's been shown before that
the hyperventilation phase

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.940
and the hypoxia, which is
a low oxygen saturation

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.030
due to the breath retention,

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:26.120
they both combine to increase
epinephrin adrenaline levels.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.040
So, you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths,

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.210
and then the retention.

01:28:31.210 --> 01:28:33.080
25 or 30 breaths then the retention,

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.790
meaning that the exhale
with the breath hold,

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:36.750
in order to get the full effect.

01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:39.820
I'd also want to provide a
critical cautionary note.

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:43.730
Don't do this anywhere near
water or while driving a car.

01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:45.610
These things might seem kind of obvious,

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:49.730
but obviously in the off
chance that you black out

01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.300
or something like that,
it could be disastrous.

01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:52.980
So, please be careful.

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:56.600
And again, don't try and
push the breath hold.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.960
The moment you feel the impulse
to breathe, just breathe.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.420
And it did seem that the three
rounds of 25 to 30 breaths

01:29:04.592 --> 01:29:06.630
with breath hold retentions in between

01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.550
was the ideal protocol.

01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:11.630
There's one last very
interesting feature of this study

01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:12.970
that I want to emphasize.

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:16.010
And that was that they
actually measured the so-called

01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:18.040
catecholamine concentrations.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.720
Catecholamines are things like dopamine,

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.000
epinephrin, norepinephrine.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.830
These are chemicals in your
nervous system and body

01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:29.380
that promote states of
alertness, dopamine, of course,

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.760
part of the reward and
motivation pathways.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.150
They explored the levels of
these molecules in blood,

01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:41.150
in plasma during and after
this breathing protocol.

01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:43.220
And it was interesting,
as I mentioned before,

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:45.540
epinephrin showed robust
increases compared

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.550
to the control group,

01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:49.642
norepinephrine, significant
increases occurred

01:29:49.642 --> 01:29:51.103
in the breathing group,

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:55.180
in the cyclic hyperventilation
retention breathing group,

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:57.930
of course, but less so.

01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:01.630
And dopamine levels
actually dropped somewhat.

01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:04.910
But this is very interesting
because there's a new

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:09.480
and emerging literature largely from Asya,

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:13.430
A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab in Israel.

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:18.430
What her laboratory has shown
is that motivational state

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:23.710
and mindset has a powerful
impact on various aspects

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:26.010
of the immune system
that were thought to be

01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:29.430
independent of the brain
and mind and thinking.

01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:32.890
So this brings us back to
something that we discussed

01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:34.270
at the very beginning of this episode,

01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:37.190
which is that 20, 30 years ago,

01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:39.460
the idea that you could
heal the body with the mind

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.820
was considered kind of quackery.

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:45.350
I think that there was an
intervening period up until now

01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:48.120
where people might've said,
"sure, if you're stressed out,

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.220
it's going to make things worse."

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.950
I mean, I think everyone
agrees that stress

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:54.300
makes every thing worse at some level,

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.640
outcomes to neurodegeneration,

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.530
performance in a physical
endeavors and mental endeavors.

01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:04.380
If stress is too high for too long

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:07.480
people experience different challenges

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.930
and essentially every
major psychiatric disorder,

01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:11.870
everything suffers, but in the short term,

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:14.290
stress can actually be
beneficial in the ways

01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:15.220
that we just described.

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:18.260
And stress, if we break it down

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.900
is really a neurochemical state, right?

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.310
It's the release of these catacholamines.

01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:26.760
And what Asya Rolls' laboratory has shown

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.920
is that when the so-called dopamine system

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:30.870
and at several episodes,

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:32.760
I described there are
multiple dopamine systems,

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:35.280
but the so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.830
involving areas like the
nucleus accumbens, et cetera.

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:43.630
When the reward system that's
associated with dopamine

01:31:43.630 --> 01:31:46.033
and norepinephrine is activated,

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:50.923
you see incredible effects,
including for instance,

01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:55.970
highly significant reduction
in tumor size in cancers.

01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:57.570
Now, why would that be?

01:31:57.570 --> 01:32:01.850
How is it that mindset,
dopamine and tumors,

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.650
and tumor growth are somehow linked?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.890
We now know how this
occurs largely through

01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:09.230
the incredible work of
Asya Rolls and others.

01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:13.170
So, now I'd like to turn our
focus to how it is specifically

01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:17.310
that certain mindsets
impact the immune system

01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:19.000
in ways that we can
actually point to specific

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.280
biological pathways and
also specific protocols

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.760
related to mindset.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.660
I guess a simple way to frame
all this would be to say

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.180
that most of us are
aware that yes, indeed,

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.380
you can worry yourself sick.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.170
We've been told that, you're
going to worry yourself sick.

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:37.870
And actually there was a
paper published in "Science,"

01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:39.950
again, one of the top
three journals out there,

01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:43.150
the top three really being
"Nature," "Science," and "Cell."

01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:45.570
And then other of course,
excellent journals exist,

01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:49.480
but this was a paper that came
out in "Science" last year.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.740
First author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A,

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:58.530
describing psychogenic stress and fever.

01:32:58.530 --> 01:33:01.400
So this was looking or
asking the question,

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:05.110
are there areas of the
brain that actually underlie

01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:08.050
this notion that we can
worry ourselves sick?

01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:10.780
And they discovered a new
pathway and they were able to

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:14.500
both activate this pathway
independent of worry and stress

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.280
and see illness occur,

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.210
and they were able to
inhibit this pathway,

01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:20.270
block activity in this neural pathway

01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:24.930
and prevent psychogenic
fever and the worrying

01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:26.160
of oneself sick.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.800
So, they were able to do this
in a very controlled way.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.920
I'll just mention the pathway in case

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.313
you want to look it up in more detail.

01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:37.560
This is a corticolimbic pathway.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.310
So, just to orient us,
the cortex is more or less

01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:42.760
the outer shell of the brain.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.390
It's involved in thinking
and sensation and perceptions

01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.530
and learning and maintenance
of a lot of memories

01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:49.363
are stored there.

01:33:49.363 --> 01:33:52.790
We all hear that you learn and
remember in the hippocampus,

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:55.090
that's the initial site
of learning and memory,

01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:56.660
but then that information,
believe it or not,

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:58.500
is passed off to the
cortex where it's stored

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.890
in kind of a long-term
hard drive type storage.

01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:05.600
So the corticolimbic
pathway is one in which

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.240
your thoughts, your prior
experiences can literally

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.760
in a structure way, feed down
onto the areas of the brain

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.820
that control very basal processes,

01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.120
including temperature regulation.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.340
So this is a corticolimbic
hypothalamic pathway.

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.720
We talked earlier about the hypothalamus

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.560
as controlling temperature
and a lot of sickness

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.190
related behavior, right?

01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:26.860
Remember vagus up to the hypothalamus

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.770
and all the sleep more,
less appetite, fever.

01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:31.450
Okay, that's all in the hypothalamus.

01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:36.450
This is a top-down corticolimbic
hypothalamic pathway,

01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:38.080
and it has a fancy name.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.900
It's the dorsal peduncular
cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:44.980
The short of that is the DP/DTT.

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.960
Let's just call it the DP/DTT,

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.180
to the dorsomedial hypothalamus.

01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.200
A lot of D's.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.550
It shouldn't mean anything.

01:34:53.439 --> 01:34:55.200
It doesn't really matter what we call it.

01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.200
But what's important is
conceptually it's a pathway

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:02.440
that originates insights to the brain

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.830
that are associated with thinking,

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.470
with emotion and with prior history,

01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:09.420
and feeds directly into
an area of the brain

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.500
that's involved in basic physiological

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.660
subconsciously controlled processes.

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:15.340
So, that's incredible, right?

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.040
And it points to a physical
pathway by which the way

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.940
we think about something
changes something core

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.770
about our physiology.

01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.710
Now, in some ways that
shouldn't be surprising, right?

01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:27.390
If you think about
something that excites you,

01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:28.850
your heart rate can increase.

01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:30.120
You think about something
that terrifies you,

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.100
your heart rate can increase.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.610
So the idea that thinking
controls our physiology

01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:38.460
is not a new concept at all,
but somehow human beings,

01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:43.010
we have been challenged with
the idea that we could actually

01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:44.680
think ourselves into being sick.

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:49.680
But this paper from Kataoka
shows that if you expose

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.323
somebody to a psychological stress,

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.470
you can actually activate this
pathway and create a fever.

01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:57.303
And how do they do that?

01:35:57.303 --> 01:35:59.770
Well, you can do this by exposing subjects

01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:02.960
to a very stressful real event,

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:05.080
and you cue it through
our associative learning.

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.970
So, maybe, like my PILOT
V5s, which I love so much,

01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:10.300
we could traumatize me to the PILOT V5

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.930
if I had some horrible
experience happen to me

01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:14.510
while I'm looking at and
concentrating on the PILOT V5.

01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:16.030
Then you take away the
horrible experience,

01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:17.007
you give me the PILOT V5,

01:36:17.007 --> 01:36:19.910
and I start to experience
a lot of the symptoms

01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:22.400
associated with that terrible event.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.920
They were able to do this
using sickness inducing stimuli

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.753
and so forth.

01:36:26.753 --> 01:36:29.320
They did all the various derivations

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.130
and identified this pathway
that when activated,

01:36:33.130 --> 01:36:35.210
even in the absence of
some horrible event,

01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:39.830
could create fever and
illness-like behavior and so forth.

01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:42.580
And if they blocked certain stations

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:44.590
along this neural pathway,
they could block that effect.

01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:48.360
So this is really concrete
evidence, proof, if you will,

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.320
that there are dedicated
pathways in the mammalian brain,

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.800
your brain and mine,

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.653
that allow us to turn
thoughts into illness.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.280
That's kind of a depressing idea.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.550
What about the inverse?

01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:02.290
What about turning thoughts into health?

01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:04.593
Well, that's the work of Asya Rolls.

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:10.660
They explored the well-established
psychological phenomenon

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:15.640
that when cancer patients
or very ill people

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:18.735
or people who are suffering
from very debilitating injuries,

01:37:18.735 --> 01:37:23.735
when people had a
reported a sense of hope,

01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:26.680
their rates of recovery
were much higher, right?

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.690
Sounds very subjective.

01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:32.090
But what is a sense of hope?

01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:34.890
A sense of hope is a sense of the future.

01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:37.010
A sense of the future
is tightly associated

01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:38.670
with the dopamine system.

01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:40.970
Dopamine, again, being
this molecule of reward

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:42.930
and motivation and movement,

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:47.930
but movement and motivation are
about things that are beyond

01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:51.440
the confines of our skin
and are about the future.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.160
And so what they've discovered
and through other studies

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.400
from other groups have
discovered is that stimulation

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.610
of the dopamine pathway,

01:37:58.610 --> 01:38:02.133
either simply by thinking about a future,

01:38:03.130 --> 01:38:04.430
ideally a positive future,

01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:07.110
but thinking about a positive
future leads to activation

01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:09.600
of the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.740
and could reduce the size of tumors,

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.590
could accelerate wound healing,

01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:18.380
could greatly accelerate the
passage from a state of illness

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:21.240
to a state of health and wellbeing.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.060
So there are many, many
studies now starting

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:27.280
to wick out related to this.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:30.730
There's also the idea that
augmenting the dopamine system

01:38:30.730 --> 01:38:33.240
can increase the rate of healing.

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.740
And so, there are individuals
out there who opt,

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.860
for instance, to take things
that increase dopamine.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.260
Now, obviously drugs of abuse
would not be a good idea

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.280
in this context, even though
they increase dopamine,

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.330
they lead to big crashes,

01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:48.030
they have addictive properties, et cetera.

01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:50.050
I've talked before on
this podcast about things

01:38:50.050 --> 01:38:55.050
like L-tyrosine, taking anywhere
from 500 to 750 milligrams

01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:58.290
can increase dopamine because tyrosine

01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.140
is a dopamine precursor, of course.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.100
Things like Mucuna
pruriens, which are L-dopa,

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.230
the immediate precursor to dopamine.

01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:06.530
Some of these will lead
to somewhat of a crash

01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:08.460
in certain individuals.

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:10.610
Other people tolerate
them a little bit better.

01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:11.860
Again, you have to talk to your doctor,

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.160
you have to figure out
what's right for you.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.250
If you have bipolar or
mania or schizophrenia,

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:19.300
these things, I would not
recommend them at all.

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:20.390
I'm not recommending them at all,

01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:22.640
I'm just mentioning them
for potential exploration

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.230
if it's safe and right for you.

01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:26.200
But the point is this:

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:30.170
the dopamine system, when
activated can accelerate healing,

01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:34.180
it can accelerate the recovery
from injury of all kinds.

01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:37.470
And that shouldn't come as a mystery

01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:39.490
or surprise result to us.

01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:42.760
It's because this reward
pathway and the fact

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.220
that it's related to a sense of the future

01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:48.430
seems to liberate entire
systems within the body

01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:52.780
that make inflammatory cytokines go down,

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:55.610
and anti-inflammatory cytokines go up.

01:39:55.610 --> 01:40:00.330
Exactly as was demonstrated
in the beautiful PNAS study

01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:04.030
where breathing, cyclic hyperventilation,

01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:07.630
was used to increase epinephrin,
increase norepinephrine,

01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:10.800
and to augment the catecholamine system.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.610
So, I think that the bridges
between these studies

01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:15.443
are really relevant.

01:40:15.443 --> 01:40:17.180
In one case, I'm talking about potentially

01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:20.360
taking an over-the-counter
compound to increase dopamine

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.290
to accelerate healing.

01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:24.380
In another case, we're
talking about using breathing.

01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:27.660
There's also the use
of cold water exposure

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:28.570
to increase dopamine.

01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:30.300
I talked about this several episodes ago,

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:33.640
but it's been shown that
immersing oneself in cold water

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.010
up to the neck or so.

01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:35.843
How cold?

01:40:35.843 --> 01:40:37.030
Well, it depends on what you can tolerate,

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:38.310
but uncomfortably cold,

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:40.210
but not so cold that
you become hypothermic,

01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:42.870
but where it's challenging to get in,

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:46.280
but you can stay there for
three to 10 minutes or so,

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.120
has been shown to lead
to very significant,

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.820
up to doubling or more of
baseline dopamine levels

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:56.890
and epinephrin levels that
go on for several hours.

01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:01.230
This may be the basis for why
people will do cold showers

01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:03.110
or ice baths and then get into a sauna.

01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:06.890
So, what's called
cold-heat contrast therapy,

01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:09.330
as a way to augment
these neurotransmitters.

01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:11.210
Today, we've been talking about
how these neurotransmitters

01:41:11.210 --> 01:41:14.950
can be used to enhance the
function of the immune system.

01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:17.870
And so just keep in mind that
anytime you're talking about

01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:19.330
increasing neurotransmitter levels,

01:41:19.330 --> 01:41:22.190
that can be done pharmacologically
through supplementation,

01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:24.560
or the can be done
behaviorally through exposure

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.350
to cold water, for instance,

01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:29.210
or it can be done even
just simply by breathing

01:41:29.210 --> 01:41:30.100
in a particular way,

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.893
cyclic hyperventilation
followed by retention.

01:41:33.930 --> 01:41:36.420
The catacholamines,
noradrenaline, dopamine,

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:39.780
and norepinephrine are
the bridge of activation

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.380
for the immune system
and the nervous system.

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.490
They are the way that the
nervous system calls out

01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:48.040
to the immune system,
"Aha, we have a problem.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.290
We need to counter this."

01:41:49.290 --> 01:41:53.050
So you can think of them,
them meaning dopamine,

01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:54.880
epinephrine, and norepinephrine,

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:59.880
as being able to deploy larger
amounts of immune cells,

01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:02.100
all the types of immune
cells that we talked about

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.120
at the beginning of the episode.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.080
Okay, so thus far, we've been
discussing how one can prevent

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:12.720
getting sick or when
one starts to feel ill,

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.710
how one might be able
to shorten the course

01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:17.420
of that infection by
ramping up the activity

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.980
of the immune system.

01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:22.440
But what about when you're
already experiencing symptoms?

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.830
The runny nose, stuffed
up nose, congestion,

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:27.860
headache, et cetera.

01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:30.410
Well, there are many ways to address that

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:31.590
at the symptom level.

01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:33.070
You're probably aware of all

01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:35.050
the over the counter medications,

01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:39.130
many of which focus on
the epinephrin system.

01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:43.160
Things that are of the
Sudafed variety prevent

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.060
or reduce congestion because of the way

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.540
that they cause release of epinephrin,

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:52.190
and some of the effects on
dilating the bronchioles

01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:54.543
and dilating the nasal
passages and so forth.

01:42:56.050 --> 01:42:57.480
I'm not going to speak to whether or not

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.240
those are good or bad choices.

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:02.160
They do have a couple of
effects that are not so great

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.660
for the course of treating
the underlying cause,

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:09.150
which are first of all
they can cause dehydration.

01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:10.900
So you have to make sure
that you're hydrating well,

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:13.580
both fluids and electrolytes,

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:16.840
and they also can interfere with sleep

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:20.350
because as I've talked about
in the episodes on sleep,

01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:22.710
one of the hallmarks of
deep sleep and in particular

01:43:22.710 --> 01:43:27.310
REM sleep is that epinephrin,
adrenaline levels are low.

01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:29.840
This is what allows you to have intense,

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.770
often very emotionally-laden
dreams during REM sleep

01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:36.370
and not act those out.

01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:40.140
And low adrenaline,
epinephrin during REM sleep

01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:42.230
is basically a signature,

01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:44.330
a neurochemical signature
of the REM sleep state,

01:43:44.330 --> 01:43:47.560
which is so vital for
emotional and physical repair

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.393
and so forth.

01:43:48.393 --> 01:43:50.490
So, the fact that they can inhibit sleep,

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.560
the fact that can cause dehydration,

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.390
the fact that they can make
people feel kind of lightheaded

01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:57.410
and jittery makes them
not terrific choices

01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.040
for a number of people.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.150
There is an interesting
alternative choice.

01:44:01.150 --> 01:44:04.110
And when I say alternative,
I do mean alternative.

01:44:04.110 --> 01:44:06.660
The choice that I'm
referring to is spirulina,

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:09.040
which is actually a form of algae.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.070
Years ago, I think when I
first heard about spirulina,

01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:14.937
it sounded very much of the kind of 1970s,

01:44:14.937 --> 01:44:17.290
80s health food store variety.

01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:19.960
It seemed really kind
of mystical and wacky,

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.450
but actually now there are
some really nice studies

01:44:22.450 --> 01:44:25.240
and some data, and also an
understanding of the mechanism

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.010
by which spirulina can have potent effects

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:29.930
in reducing what's called rhinitis,

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:33.440
which is a fancy word for
congestion of the nose

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.820
and an inflammation of the nose.

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:39.820
Basically, anytime you hear
a word that includes "itis,"

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:41.850
at least if it's in the
medical or health context,

01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:44.200
it generally means
inflammation of some tissue.

01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:48.650
So rhinitis just being
inflammation of the nasal passages,

01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:50.530
but that's one of the most
uncomfortable symptoms

01:44:50.530 --> 01:44:52.080
of any kind of infection.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.330
So there are two studies
I'd like to highlight

01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:55.200
just very quickly.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.220
One is the effects of
spirulina on allergic rhinitis.

01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.020
And the other is a clinical comparison

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.970
to the efficacy of spirulina platensis,

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.802
that's a technical name,

01:45:06.802 --> 01:45:10.630
and cetirizine for the
treatment of allergic rhinitis.

01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:13.590
These looked at humans, so
this is not a mouse study,

01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:14.890
this is a study on humans.

01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:18.820
Both sexes, so males and females.

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:22.376
In one case, looking at 100
plus subjects, 129 subjects.

01:45:22.376 --> 01:45:24.700
The other, 65 subjects, so
decent number of subjects,

01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:27.480
randomized trial, double blind.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.480
Both cases saw significant
decreases in nasal obstruction,

01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:36.233
improved ability to smell, improved sleep,

01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:42.313
daily working inflammatory
cytokines were reduced as well,

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.460
reduction in nasal itching,

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.340
all the stuff that you'd
like to experience,

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:49.340
I can imagine, after taking two grams,

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:52.770
two grams, not milligrams,
but two grams of spirulina.

01:45:52.770 --> 01:45:55.210
Sometimes had to be
taken for a short while

01:45:55.210 --> 01:45:56.760
before the effect kicked in.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.480
So, that's pretty impressive, I would say,

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:01.320
but it doesn't really speak to mechanism,

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.240
but in exploring the underlying
mechanisms for spirulina's

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.280
effects on reducing rhinitis,

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.560
it's interesting to find that
spirulina actually can inhibit

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.570
the formation and/or activity of so-called

01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:19.550
histaminergic mast cells,
M-A-S-T, mast cells.

01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.620
We haven't talked a lot about mast cells,

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.800
but they are a very interesting cell type

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:25.610
in the immune response.

01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:29.510
Essentially what they are, are
little packets of histamine.

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:34.510
And when we have some sort
of injury or irritant rather

01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:40.290
to the skin, so a mosquito
bite, for instance,

01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:42.143
or poison oak or poison ivy,

01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:44.860
something that causes an itch

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.080
or something that causes
inflammation internally,

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.590
doesn't just have to be on the skin,

01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:51.690
these mast are these little
bubbles that contain histamine

01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:53.850
that go to that site [hissing],

01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:56.200
and release their histaminergic contents

01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.270
and cause swelling and
inflammation of whatever cells

01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:01.403
are affected locally.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.530
You might think, well, why
would I want to have a mechanism

01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:06.760
in my body that would cause
swelling and inflammation?

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.140
Ah, well then those cells in
turn send out cytokine signals

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.010
that recruit the very cell
types that we were talking about

01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:17.640
way back at the beginning of the episode,

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.470
the cells that are characteristics

01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:21.730
of the innate immune system that come in,

01:47:21.730 --> 01:47:24.290
the macrophages and the
other types of cells

01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:26.960
that will come in and gobble
up the foreign invaders

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.860
or will help sequester and move away,

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:34.040
say the poison from a bite
or from whatever irritant.

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.910
Again, it doesn't just have
to be at the skin surface.

01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:40.160
I'm describing an example of
at the skin, for instance,

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.180
if you've ever had hives of any kind,

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:47.060
that almost certainly involved mast cells.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:51.640
So, and when you take an
anti-histamine in order to deal

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.540
with seasonal allergies, for instance,

01:47:56.014 --> 01:47:57.970
you're taking a compound that's reducing

01:47:57.970 --> 01:47:59.690
histamines in mast cells.

01:47:59.690 --> 01:48:02.750
And spirulina has also been
used quite effectively as a way

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:06.330
to treat seasonal allergies
and some of the symptomatology.

01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:09.100
Equally on par with some
of the major prescription

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:11.420
and over the counter drugs for that.

01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:15.480
One cautionary note, spirulina
can carry some side effects

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.130
for people that have a genetic mutation

01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:20.350
leading to something called PKU.

01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:21.430
These people know who they are.

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:24.650
They're very sensitive to phenylalanine.

01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:26.520
These same people cannot drink any sort

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:30.130
of NutraSweet or diet soda for
reasons that they understand.

01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:31.010
It can be quite dangerous.

01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:33.300
It's a rare genetic
disorder, but nonetheless,

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:36.420
spirulina can be an
issue for those people.

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:40.310
For most people, the side effect
profile is pretty minimal.

01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:42.070
And just to be clear, I
don't have any relationship

01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:43.750
to spirulina company or anything.

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.480
I just find it interesting
that there are these compounds

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.080
that sound rather, forgive the phrase,

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.440
but rather new-agey because they come from

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.140
a algae, from a plant.

01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:55.700
But when you look at the
underlying mechanism,

01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.010
it makes perfect sense.

01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:59.500
So that's often what we
like to point out here

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:02.493
is that if there are these
so-called alternative therapies,

01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:05.040
alternative because most
people haven't heard of them,

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.040
it's always nice if they map
to a specific logical mechanism

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.880
and framework by which
that compound would work,

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.527
as opposed to just some anecdote of,

01:49:11.527 --> 01:49:13.520
"Oh, I hear spirulina
is great for allergies."

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.900
Well, now we know why,
it inhibits mast cells

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.810
and histaminergic mast
cells in particular.

01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:22.380
Earlier, I mentioned a new
and very exciting study

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.570
published as a full article in "Nature."

01:49:24.570 --> 01:49:28.490
Full article means that
it is a major finding.

01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:30.710
At the journal, "Nature,"
they have letters,

01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:32.120
which are important findings.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.630
They're still very high
stringency for getting

01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:36.610
a letter in "Nature" published.

01:49:36.610 --> 01:49:40.400
But the full articles, generally
there's only one or two

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.730
per issue in the weekly
edition of "Nature."

01:49:44.730 --> 01:49:47.770
And just last week, there
was a very exciting article

01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:51.420
published from Qiufu Ma's lab
at Harvard Medical School.

01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.360
Qiufu I've known for a number of years.

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.700
His group has done phenomenal
work on the mechanisms

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.980
of itch and pain and discovering
some of the receptors

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:00.370
and pathways for itch and pain.

01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:02.440
And more recently they've been exploring

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.660
the mechanistic basis of acupuncture.

01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:07.627
And the title of the article is,

01:50:07.627 --> 01:50:11.170
"A neuroanatomical basis for
electroacupuncture to drive

01:50:11.170 --> 01:50:13.130
the vagal adrenal axis."

01:50:13.130 --> 01:50:15.190
And while that's a mouthful,

01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:19.360
now most all of you are probably
familiar with what I mean

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.540
when I say vagal adrenal axis;

01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:23.420
vagal meaning of the vagus,

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:25.310
and adrenal of the adrenal glands.

01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:27.950
And so perhaps we should not be surprised,

01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:30.250
although excited, nonetheless,

01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:35.250
that when Qiufu's lab looked
at stimulation of the body

01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.802
with so-called electroacupuncture.

01:50:38.802 --> 01:50:40.740
So, these are needles where a small bit

01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:43.190
of electrical current, low
level of electrical current,

01:50:43.190 --> 01:50:47.540
is passed into the needle
and therefore into the body.

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:51.270
They located sites on the
body that can increase

01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:55.140
inflammation by way of releasing
inflammatory cytokines.

01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.630
These areas included the abdomen,

01:50:57.630 --> 01:51:01.720
and they found areas on the
body such as the lower limbs,

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.620
or the hind limbs in this case,

01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:07.370
that can stimulate the
vagal adrenal reflex

01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:10.790
and can lead to reduced inflammation.

01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:14.440
And what was really interesting
is that they figured out

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:17.230
that it was activation of nerve endings

01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:19.120
that resided in the fascia.

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:20.610
I mentioned earlier what fascia is,

01:51:20.610 --> 01:51:21.460
but just to remind you,

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.210
the fascia is a really
thick sheath of tissue

01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:26.970
that surrounds muscle.

01:51:26.970 --> 01:51:28.581
If ever you've heard of Rolfing,

01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:31.440
Rolfing is a form of very intense massage.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.560
I've never had this done,
but I've heard about this.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.070
It involves among other things,

01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:39.580
actually separating the muscle away

01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:40.840
from the fascia somewhat.

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:43.490
So it's a very, very deep tissue massage.

01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:47.070
Actually a good friend
of mine who had this done

01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:48.410
told me that it was probably

01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:51.880
the most challenging physical experience

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.250
that he had ever been
through going through

01:51:53.250 --> 01:51:54.260
this Rolfing procedure.

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:57.150
Maybe some of you have have
been Rolfed, as they say,

01:51:57.150 --> 01:51:59.030
and can report to the experience,

01:51:59.030 --> 01:52:00.620
whether or not it was
pleasant or unpleasant,

01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:02.140
or you felt benefits or not.

01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:04.970
In any case, this study
isn't about Rolfing per se,

01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:06.550
but it is about the fascia.

01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:09.280
And so what they discovered
is there's a specific

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.550
population of neurons.

01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:13.170
Those neurons have a name,
as they often do in science.

01:52:13.170 --> 01:52:15.260
Name isn't important, but
if you want to look it up,

01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:20.260
it's the PROKR2 neurons,
P-R-O-K R2 neurons.

01:52:20.490 --> 01:52:23.370
And they send a connection deep into

01:52:23.370 --> 01:52:26.070
the limb fascial tissue, okay?

01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:27.920
And then they send another connection,

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:30.140
the connections we're
referring to are axons,

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:30.973
neurons have axons.

01:52:30.973 --> 01:52:34.310
So a wire in one direction that goes

01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:37.850
into the deep fascial
tissue of the lower limb,

01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:39.490
near the calf and thigh.

01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:44.050
And then they send another
wire up into the spinal cord,

01:52:44.050 --> 01:52:47.590
into a region of the hind
brain in the back of your brain

01:52:47.590 --> 01:52:51.170
kind of near your neck
in the medulla oblongata,

01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:53.570
that neuron also has a name
called the DMZ, doesn't matter.

01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:56.840
And that neuron connects
to the adrenal gland

01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.160
to release our good old
friends, the catacholamines,

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:02.830
noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine,

01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:06.340
or norepinephrine,
epinephrin, and dopamine.

01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:11.340
And their release causes a
reduction in inflammation,

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.170
even in response to an
injection of something called

01:53:14.170 --> 01:53:16.400
lipopolysaccharide, which
can actually induce fever.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.300
So, what does all this saying?

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:21.490
This is saying that activation
of the deep fascial tissue

01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:26.490
causes a chain of neural
reactions that leads eventually

01:53:26.610 --> 01:53:29.000
to the release of
norepinephrine, noradrenaline,

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.310
adrenaline, and dopamine.

01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:33.480
And once again, lowers inflammation,

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.910
very much like the breathing study

01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:37.650
that we talked about
earlier in the pattern

01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:39.700
of cyclical hyperventilation
with retention,

01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.760
leading to reductions in inflammation.

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.360
I can't tell you how happy this makes me.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:44.670
I had nothing to do with this work,

01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:47.380
but the reason it makes
me happy is because

01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:51.150
I have a particular
fondness for when practices

01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:53.280
that have existed for many centuries

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.820
or even thousands of
years, such as acupuncture,

01:53:55.820 --> 01:54:00.380
such as respiration work,
start to converge with some

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.770
of the hardcore mechanistic science.

01:54:02.770 --> 01:54:05.780
And the reason this excites
me is not because we want to

01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.580
take science and erase the previous tools

01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:11.680
and methods of these ancient
practices, not at all.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.770
And it certainly isn't
the case that we just want

01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:17.190
to name things or rename
things with modern science.

01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:20.890
What's very exciting is when
we can discover mechanism

01:54:20.890 --> 01:54:23.680
that explains why certain practices work.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.470
First of all, that validates
those as legitimate practices,

01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:31.270
maybe even insurance
will start to cover them,

01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:33.110
whereas maybe they previously had not,

01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:34.390
I don't know what the current status

01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:36.750
is for insurance coverage of acupuncture.

01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:38.500
I'm guessing there are places that do it,

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.430
maybe others that don't.

01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:43.390
I personally am not somebody
who receives acupuncture.

01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:46.380
I have in the past, but it's
not that I'm in particular

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.770
a fan of it, but I think that
there are a number of people

01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:49.790
that have benefited from it.

01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:51.640
So, I think that's wonderful.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:54.280
Breath work and respiration
work is something

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.440
that I've cultivated as a
practice over the years.

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.910
I mentioned earlier, how
I use it to push back

01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:00.760
on incoming infections and so forth.

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:04.050
And now that doesn't sound like total...

01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:06.010
You know, like just a
figment of my imagination,

01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:06.970
there's actually a mechanism,

01:55:06.970 --> 01:55:09.140
a published mechanism to explain it.

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.640
But the most exciting
thing to me about all this

01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:15.120
is that practices that
traditionally have been shrouded

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.520
in complicated language
or were the unique domain

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:21.210
of the practitioners and relied on phrases

01:55:21.210 --> 01:55:23.870
like the meridians or the chakras,

01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:25.860
of which I think is
perfectly valid language,

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:27.350
but doesn't inform mechanism.

01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:31.190
And then in a separate community,
the community I come from,

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:32.440
the community of scientists,

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:35.960
have used language like PROKR2 neurons,

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.340
medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.

01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:40.760
And basically no one can
communicate with one another

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.990
because the language is shrouding.

01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:46.590
What we're now starting to see
is that at their convergence

01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:48.160
is a common mechanism.

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.670
And with that understanding,

01:55:49.670 --> 01:55:52.490
what's going to be really terrific

01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:55.100
is as new protocols start to emerge.

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.390
So in understanding
mechanisms and pathways,

01:55:57.390 --> 01:56:01.360
and in being able to understand
the base set of practices

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.160
like breathing, like
electroacupuncture, and so forth,

01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:08.030
we can now start to daydream
in a very realistic way

01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:10.330
about the development of new protocols,

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:11.700
more effective protocols.

01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:14.820
Protocols that perhaps one can
do at home without needles,

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:17.270
perhaps protocols such as the breathing

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:18.860
that you can do anywhere, anytime,

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:21.997
and be confident that you're
actually impacting the IL-6

01:56:21.997 --> 01:56:25.810
and the IL-8 pathways, reducing
those and increasing IL-10.

01:56:25.810 --> 01:56:29.210
So we are no longer
wandering around in the fog

01:56:29.210 --> 01:56:31.950
hearing about these magical
techniques without understanding

01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:34.950
why they work, nor are we
just seeing a bunch of science

01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:38.040
that is descriptive, but not mechanistic

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.730
or pointing to specific protocols.

01:56:39.730 --> 01:56:41.380
So, I'm just delighted.

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.840
Again, I had nothing to do with this work,

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.840
but really terrific work,
Qiufu and colleagues.

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.250
And I also want to acknowledge a journal

01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:53.620
as prominent as "Nature"
for featuring this upfront,

01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:55.610
because I think it really
does mark the beginning

01:56:55.610 --> 01:56:58.960
of a new path in medicine.

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.260
And just to underscore that
point a little bit further,

01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:03.610
the National Institutes of Health,

01:57:03.610 --> 01:57:05.810
of course has a cancer
institute, an eye institute,

01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:07.500
that deal with trying to combat cancer

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.430
and to cure blindness and so forth.

01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:12.850
And now they have what's called NCCIH,

01:57:12.850 --> 01:57:14.610
which has complimentary health.

01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:18.100
And so, there are good
tax dollars being put

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:20.160
to the kinds of explorations
that we're talking about

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:23.310
that undoubtedly are going
to lead to better treatments

01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:26.520
for immunological diseases,
neurological diseases,

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:29.040
the convergence of the immune
system and the nervous system.

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:32.180
Very exciting times and I
hope that by learning about

01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:34.470
some of this new and emerging
science and hearing about

01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:38.760
some of the protocols that are
either zero cost or low cost,

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.270
certainly for respiration that's the case

01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:43.130
or for the use of heat or cold,

01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:46.223
or maybe even electroacupuncture
if you have access to that,

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:50.100
that we can really see that
we're starting to evolve

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.310
as a field of health
and medicine and science

01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:53.300
and ancient practices,

01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:55.070
and that they're really
starting to converge

01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:56.440
and have a vector, as we say,

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:59.170
in a new and more exciting direction.

01:57:59.170 --> 01:58:01.500
Once again, we've covered
a lot of information today.

01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:02.820
We learned about the immune system,

01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:05.370
the adaptive immune system,
the innate immune system,

01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.680
and the nervous system
and how those interact.

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.740
And throughout, we discussed
protocols that can allow you

01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:12.800
to tap into this relationship between

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.670
the nervous system and immune system,

01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:18.280
and hopefully avoid
and/or shorten the course

01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.240
of any illnesses,
injuries, or inflammation

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.000
that you might encounter.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.710

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.050
A few times during this episode,

01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:09.200
and in many previous episodes,
I mentioned supplements.

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.810
Not everybody needs to take supplements,

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:13.040
but many people find benefit from them.

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:15.360
A key thing if you're going
to take supplements is to know

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.990
that the quality of the
supplements that you're taking

01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:20.400
is very high and that's
not always the case

01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.540
with many supplement brands.

01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:25.380
That's why we partnered with
Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.

01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.213
Thorne supplements are known to be

01:59:26.213 --> 01:59:29.730
of the very highest
quality and the specificity

01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:31.690
of the ingredients is very high as well.

01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:32.860
Meaning what they list on the bottle

01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:34.910
is actually what's
contained in that bottle.

01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:36.100
They've worked with the Mayo Clinic,

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.240
all the major sports teams.

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:40.500
So, trust is very, very
high with Thorne products.

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.070
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:47.030
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:49.280
And there, you can see all
the supplements that I take.

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.600
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.840
And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.180
you can get 20% off any of the supplements

01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:57.030
that Thorne makes.

01:59:57.030 --> 02:00:02.027
That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman,

02:00:03.450 --> 02:00:06.050
to see the supplements
that I take or get 20% off

02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:08.160
any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.960
