00:00:00.053 --> 00:00:02.300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.131
for everyday life.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:09.530
[energetic music]

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.350
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.420
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.630
Today, we are going to
talk all about dopamine

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.190
and what drives you to do
the things that you do.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.530
We're going to talk about
motivation and desire and craving,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.210
but also how dopamine
relates to satisfaction

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.110
and our feelings of wellbeing.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.630
And of course, any
discussion about dopamine

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.360
has to include a discussion
about the potential

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
for dopamine induced addiction.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.030
Indeed, dopamine lies at
the heart of addiction

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.660
to all things.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.000
But today we are mainly going to focus on,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.370
how what we do and how we do it,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.210
and how we conceptualize those things

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.250
leads to changes in this amazing molecule

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.200
in our brain and bodies
that we call dopamine.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.660
I'm going to teach you what
dopamine is and what it is not.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.070
There are a lot of myths
about the molecule dopamine.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.580
We often hear about
so-called dopamine hits.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.870
Today, we are going to
dispel many common myths

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.030
about dopamine,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.210
and we are going to talk about
how dopamine actually works.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.820
We're going to discuss
the biology of dopamine,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.860
the psychology.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.720
We will discuss some neural circuits

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.640
and a really exciting
aspect of dopamine biology

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.910
or so-called dopamine schedules.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.330
In other words, we are going to discuss

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.970
how things like food, drugs,
caffeine, pornography,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.840
even some plant-based compounds can change

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.910
our baseline levels of
dopamine and in doing so,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.720
they change how much dopamine
we are capable of experiencing

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.070
from what could be very satisfying events,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.220
or events that make us feel not so good

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.100
because of things that
we did or took prior.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.860
So I promise you it's going
to be a vast discussion,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.380
but I will structure it for you,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.630
and you'll come away
with a deep understanding

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.130
of really what drives you.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.580
You will also come away
with a lot of tools,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.330
how to leverage dopamine so
that you can sustain energy,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.800
drive and motivation for the things

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.720
that are important to you
over long periods of time.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.750
Before we dive into the
meat of today's discussion,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.230
I'd like to share with
you a fascinating result

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.160
that really underscores what dopamine

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
is capable of in our brains and bodies,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.970
and underscores the fact
that just through behaviors,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.900
no drugs, nothing of that sort,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.070
just through behaviors,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.000
we can achieve terrifically
high increases in dopamine

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.250
that are very long and
sustained in ways that serve us.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.440
This is a result that was published

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.540
in the European Journal of Physiology.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.180
I'll go into it in more detail later,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.750
but essentially what it involved
is having human subjects

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.920
get into water of different temperatures.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.490
So it was warm water,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.240
moderately cool water
and cold, cold water.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.160
Had them stay in that
water for up to an hour,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.040
and they measured by way of blood draw

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.373
things like cortisol,
norepinephrine and dopamine.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.570
What was fascinating is
that cold water exposure

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.270
led to very rapid
increases in norepinephrine

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.410
and epinephrine,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.720
which is also just called adrenaline.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.500
It also led to increases in dopamine.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.890
And these increases in
dopamine were very significant.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.270
They kicked in around 10 or
15 minutes after submersion

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.470
into the cold water.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.140
And I should mention the
head wasn't below water

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.900
is just up to the neck.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.520
And the dopamine release continued to rise

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.510
and rise and rise,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.830
and eventually reached
250% above baseline.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.930
Now, what was interesting
is after subjects got out

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.400
of this cold water,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.940
that dopamine increase was sustained.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.020
And I know nowadays many
people are interested

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.050
in using cold water therapy as
a way to increase metabolism

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.280
and fat loss,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.440
but also to improve sense of well-being,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.660
improve cognition,
improve clarity of mind.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.880
There's something really
special about this very alert,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.340
but calm state of mind

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.500
that seems to be the one that's optimal

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.010
for pretty much everything except sleep,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.650
but for all aspects of work
and for social engagement

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.020
and for sport that highly alert,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.370
but calm state of mind
really is the sweet spot

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.570
that I believe most of
us would like to achieve.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.490
And this cold water
exposure done correctly

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.440
really can help people
achieve that state of mind

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.330
through these increases in dopamine

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.150
that lasts a very long time.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.470
So I will later detail the
specifics of that study,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.030
what it entailed in terms of how long,

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.730
the variations, the different
subjects experienced,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.330
as well as how to limit the
amount of stress hormone,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.810
cortisol, that's released as a consequence

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.230
of the cold water.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.620
And we will also talk about
compounds, supplements

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.830
that people can take in order to increase

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.530
their levels of dopamine
should they choose.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.150
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.060
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.860
and research roles at Stanford.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.890
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.620
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.760
In keeping with that theme,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.700
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.850
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.730
Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.290
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.437
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system.

00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:14.880
And I can tell you that the visual system

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.090
has to go through a lot of work

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.790
in order to main clarity of what you see

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.200
when there are shadows,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.040
when you go into different
types of indoor lighting,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.873
and so on.

00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:24.500
And a lot of glasses don't work well

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.170
because you put them on,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.370
and then you're in bright
light and you can see fine,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.470
but then you move into a shadow

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.480
and then you have to take them
off and they don't adjust,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.230
or they don't adjust quickly enough.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.160
With Roka their eyeglasses
and sunglasses are designed

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.800
with the visual system biology in mind.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.720
So you always see things
with perfect clarity.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.030
The glasses are also terrific

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.360
because they're very lightweight,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.720
and they won't slip off your
face if you're exercising,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.760
if you're running or biking.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.440
In fact, they were
designed for the purpose

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.870
of being able to be worn
while you're engaging

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.860
in those sorts of activities
or simply working at your desk.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.840
I happen to wear readers at night

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.800
or when I drive or when I work,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.730
and I love their sunglasses
cause I can wear them anywhere.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.630
And also the aesthetics of
their sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.463
are terrific.

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.200
Unlike a lot of other performance glasses

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.610
that frankly make people
look like cyborgs.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.430
The aesthetics on Roka's
are really terrific.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.620
You could wear them
anywhere you'd like to go.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.130

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.197
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:06:29.197 --> 00:06:31.390
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.780
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.800
to help you better understand your body

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.750
and help you reach your health goals.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.800
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.060
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.380
you can also analyze your DNA to see

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.840
what you ought to be
doing for your immediate

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.350
and long-term health.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.200
We hear a lot these
days about optimization,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.400
optimizing hormones,
optimizing your metabolism,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.840
optimizing this, optimizing that,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.890
but unless you know the
measurements of metabolic factors,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.400
hormones and other things that
are in your blood and DNA,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.150
you don't know what to optimize.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.940
With InsideTracker it makes
all of that very easy.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.170
They can come to your house to
take the blood and DNA test,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.260
or you can go to a nearby clinic.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.100
They send you the information
and you take those results.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.360
And unlike a lot of laboratories
doing blood work out there

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.480
and DNA tests,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.610
they have a simple platform, a dashboard

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.560
that walks you through your results

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.010
and helps you identify
what sorts of nutritional

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.330
or behavioral or other types of practices

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.040
you might want to
incorporate into your life

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.590
in order to positively
impact your immediate

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.930
and long-term health.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.620
It's a very easy system to use,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.210
and you will gain a ton of information

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.370
simply by doing that test.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.770
Whether or not you end up making changes

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.540
to what you're doing or not.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.360

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.530
and has over 600,005 star reviews.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.130
I've been meditating for a long time,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.730
but I confess sometimes I meditate

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.030
and sometimes I'm very
inconsistent about my meditation.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.550
Ideally, I would meditate
every day for 20 or 30 minutes,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.630
but what I found over the years is that,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.140
I'll start a meditation practice

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.640
and then as life gets
more stressful or busier,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.700
which is exactly when I
need to meditate more,

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.020
I tend to meditate less often.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.140
Switching over to Headspace
as a meditation app

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.720
really helped me stay consistent

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.300
with my meditation practice.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.350
And that's because they have
a huge range of meditations

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.183
to select from.

00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:33.220
Some are short, some are longer.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.200
And in general, I try and
get 20 minutes of meditation

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.033
in every day,

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.320
but some days it's just five minutes

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.940
and they have some terrific
just five minute meditations.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.580
The science says that even
a five minute meditation

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.450
can be beneficial for
different aspects of our brain

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.800
and body.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.870

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.410
I'd like to announce that there's an event

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.740
that some of you may find very useful.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.730
This is an event put on by Logitech

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.410
that I will be speaking at.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.700
It's called Rethink Education,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.400
the Biology of Learning
Reimagining Learning

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.360
through Neuroscience.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.210
And at this event, I will be speaking,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.820
there will be other speakers as well,

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.130
and I will be talking
about neuroplasticity

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.170
and its applications for
teaching and for learning.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.040
I will describe what I call
the plasticity super protocol

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.860
that incorporates all of what
we know about rapid learning,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.890
efficient learning and the
best ways to teach and learn.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.200
It's geared towards
educators of all kinds.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.660
It is zero cost.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.500
So please feel free to sign up.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.500
The event is September 30th,
2021 at 3:00 p.m Eastern.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.840
You can find the registration
link in the caption

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.300
for this episode.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.030
So let's talk about dopamine.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.600
Most people have heard of dopamine,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.310
and we hear all the time
now about dopamine hits.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.300
But actually there's no such
thing as a dopamine hit.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.260
And actually the way that
your body uses dopamine

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.580
is to have a baseline level of dopamine.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.930
Meaning an amount of
dopamine that's circulating

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.370
in your brain and body all the time.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.940
And that turns out to be
important for how you feel

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.960
generally, whether or not
you're in a good mood,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.790
motivated, et cetera.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.890
And you also can experience
peaks in dopamine

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.540
above baseline.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.320
Now, this has a very specific name

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.973
in the neurobiology literature,

00:10:34.973 --> 00:10:39.400
so-called tonic and phasic
release of dopamine.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.460
And I'll explain what that
means in a couple of minutes.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.420
But if you remember nothing
else from this episode,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.080
please remember this,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.420
that when you experience
something or you crave something

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.343
really desirable, really exciting
to you, very pleasurable.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.430
What happens afterwards
is your baseline level

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.540
of dopamine drops.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.373
Okay?

00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:03.360
So these peaks in dopamine,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.150
they influence how much dopamine

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.420
will generally be circulating afterward.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.230
And you might think, oh, a big
peak in dopamine after that,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.360
I'm going to feel even better

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.430
because I just had this great event.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.360
Not the case.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.010
What actually happens is
that your baseline level

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.260
of dopamine drops.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.210
And I will explain the
precise mechanism for that.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.043
Okay?

00:11:22.043 --> 00:11:23.400
In the neuroscience literature,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.400
we refer to this as tonic and
phasic release of dopamine.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.290
Tonic being the low level baseline

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.950
that's always there circulating,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.250
released into your brain all the time.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.470
And then phasic these peaks
that ride above that baseline.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.200
And those two things interact.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.000
And this is really important.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.530
I'm going to teach you the
underlying neurobiology,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.450
but even if you have no
background in biology,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.700
I promise to make it all clear.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.060
I'll explain the terms and what they mean.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.320
And I'm excited to teach
you about dopamine,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.160
because dopamine has everything
to do with how you feel

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.880
right now as you're listening to this,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.340
it has everything to do
with how you will feel

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.640
an hour from now,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.920
has everything to do with
your level of motivation

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.350
and your level of desire,

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.900
and your willingness
to push through effort.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.930
If ever you've interacted with somebody

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.680
who just doesn't seem to have
any drive they've given up,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.160
or if you've interacted with somebody

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.920
who seems to have
endless drive and energy,

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.050
what you are looking at there
in those two circumstances

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.280
is without question a difference

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.970
in the level of dopamine
circulating in their system.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.870
There will be other factors too,

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.860
but the level of dopamine
is the primary determinant

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.940
of how motivated we
are, how excited we are,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.640
how outward facing we are
and how willing we are,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.190
to lean into life and pursue things.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.710
Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.090
Neuromodulators are different
than neurotransmitters.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.640
Neurotransmitters are
involved in the dialogue

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.720
between neurons nerve cells.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.910
And neurotransmitters tend to
mediate local communication.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.270
Just imagine two people talking
to one another at a concert,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.860
that communication
between them is analogous

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.170
to the communication carried
out by neurotransmitters,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.590
whereas neuromodulators
influence the communication

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.640
of many neurons.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.270
Imagine a bunch of people dancing

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.750
where it's a coordinated
dance involving 10 or 20

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.540
or hundreds of people.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.470
Neuromodulators are
coordinating that dance.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.430
In the nervous system
what this means is that,

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.280
dopamine release changes the probability

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.430
that certain neural
circuits will be active

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.610
and that other neural
circuits will be inactive.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.443
Okay?

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.080
So it modulates a bunch
of things all at once,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.000
and that's why it's so
powerful at shifting

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.290
not just our levels of energy,

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.990
but also our mindset,

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.760
also our feelings of
whether or not we can,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.400
or cannot accomplish something.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.750
So how does dopamine
work and what does it do?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.130
Well, first of all, it is not
just responsible for pleasure,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.550
it is responsible for
motivation and drive.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.560
Primarily, at the psychological level,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.960
also for craving.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.610
Those three things are sort of the same.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.240
Motivation, drive and craving.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.200
It also controls time perception,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.970
and we will get deep into how dopamine

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.570
can modulate time perception,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.210
and how important it is
that everybody be able

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.540
to access increases in dopamine
at different timescales.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.100
This turns out to be important
to not end up addicted

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.933
to substances,

00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:20.280
but it also turns out to be
very important to sustain effort

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.440
and be a happy person
over long periods of time.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.740
Which I think most everybody wants.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.930
It certainly is adaptive in
life to be able to do that.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.300
Dopamine is also vitally
important for movement.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.020
I'll explain the neural circuits
for dopamine and mindset,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.570
and dopamine in movement in a moment,

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.570
but in diseases like Parkinson's
or Lewy bodies dementia,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.453
which is similar to
Parkinson's in many ways.

00:14:45.453 --> 00:14:48.270
There's a depletion or
death of dopamine neurons

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.200
at a particular location in the brain

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.260
which leads to shaky movements,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.460
challenges and speaking,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.620
challenges in particular
in initiating movement.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.630
And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.010
to people with Parkinson's and Lew's bod,

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.340
excuse me, Lewy body dementia
also experience drops

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.180
in motivation and affect, meaning mood.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.820
They tend to get depressed and so on.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.420
When those people are properly treated,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.340
they can, not always,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.390
but they can recover some
fluidity of movement,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.160
some ability to initiate movement.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.010
And almost without question,

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.860
those people feel better psychologically,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.070
not just because they can move,

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.680
but also because dopamine
impacts mood and motivation.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.430
So what are the underlying
neural circuits?

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.060
For those of you that are
not interested in biology

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.130
and specific nomenclature,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.900
you can tune out now if you want,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.640
but it's actually pretty straightforward.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.630
You have two main neural
circuits in the brain

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:50.630
that dopamine uses in order
to exert all its effects.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.610
The first one is a pathway
that goes from this area

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.095
in the what's called
the ventral tegmentum.

00:15:57.095 --> 00:15:59.010
That's a fancy, but
ventral just means bottom,

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.090
and tegmentum actually means floor.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.880
So it's at the bottom of the brain,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.580
and it's the ventral part of the floor.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.360
So it's really low in
the back of the brain,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.820
the ventral tegmentum.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.570
And it goes from the ventral tegmentum

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.150
to what's called the ventral striatum

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.400
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.550
Now, that's a lot of language,

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.760
but basically what we call this is the,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.310
mesocorticolimbic pathway.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.280
This is the pathway by which
dopamine influences motivation,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.260
drive and craving.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.150
It involves structures that
some of you may have heard

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.983
of before.

00:16:29.983 --> 00:16:32.940
Things like nucleus accumbens
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.650
This is the pathway that
really gets disrupted

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.210
in addictions where in
particular drugs that influence

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.650
the release of dopamine like
cocaine and methamphetamine.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.100
We'll talk about those drugs today.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.610
They tap into this pathway.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.520
But if you are pursuing a partner,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.460
a boyfriend or girlfriend,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.430
if you're pursuing a degree in school,

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.830
if you're pursuing a
finish line in a race,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.300
you are tapping into this so-called

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.380
mesecorticolimbic pathway.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.380
This is the classic reward
pathway in all mammals.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.870
The other pathway emerges
from an area in the brain

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:08.720
called the substantia nigra.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.610
So-called because the cells
in that area are dark,

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.090
and the substantia nigra
connects to an area of the brain

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.450
called the dorsal striatum.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.530
This is not surprisingly called
the nigrostriatal pathway.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.530
For those of you who have
never done any neuroanatomy,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.370
I'm going to teach you a
little trick right now.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.760
Everything in neuroanatomy,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.460
the first part of a word tells
you where the neurons are.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.610
And then the second part tells you

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.790
where they are connecting to.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.330
So when I say nigropstriatal pathway,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.400
it means that the neurons
are in substantial nigra

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.560
and they connect to the
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.520
So while it's a lot of language
there, some logic there.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.353
Okay?

00:17:46.353 --> 00:17:47.700
So we've got these two pathways.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.900
One, mainly for movement, right?

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.060
This is the substantia
nigra to dorsal striatum.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.670
And we've got this other pathway,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.330
the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.963
that's for reward,
reinforcement and motivation.

00:18:00.983 --> 00:18:03.770
I want you to remember that
there are two pathways.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.980
If you don't remember the
two pathways in detail,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.813
that's fine.

00:18:06.813 --> 00:18:08.780
But please remember that
there are two pathways,

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.640
because that turns out
to be important later.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.720
Now, the other thing to
understand about dopamine is that,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.920
the way that dopamine is
released in the brain and body

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.510
can differ.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.330
Meaning it can be very local,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.700
or it can be more broad.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.510
Now, most of you have
probably heard of synapses.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.650
Synapses are the little
spaces between neurons,

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.760
and basically neurons
nerve cells communicate

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.350
with one another by making
each other electrically active,

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.840
or by making each other
less electrically active.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.673
So here's how this works.

00:18:40.673 --> 00:18:43.140
You can imagine one nerve
cell and another nerve cell

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.240
with a little gap between them,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.680
a little synapse.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.160
And the way that one nerve cell causes

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.900
the next nerve cell to fire.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.640
What we call fire really means
to become electrically active

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.520
is that it vomits out
these little packets,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.470
what we call vesicles.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.930
They're little bubbles
filled with a chemical,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.510
when that chemical enters the synapse,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.990
it some of it docks or
parks on the other side,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.350
in the other neuron.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.170
And by virtue of
electrical changes in the,

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.420
what we call the postsynaptic neuron,

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.610
that chemical will make that
neuron more electrically active

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.580
or less electrically active.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.990
Dopamine can do that like
any other neurotransmitter

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.490
or neuromodulator.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.990
So it can have one neuron
influence another neuron.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.280
But dopamine can also engage

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.490
in what's called a volume metric release.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:35.160
Volumetric release is like a
giant vomit that gets out to 50

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.850
or a hundred or even thousands of cells.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.510
So there's local release what
we call synaptic release,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.010
and then there's volumetric release.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.990
So volumetric release is like
dumping all this dopamine out

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.310
into the system.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.220
So dopamine is incredible
because it can change the way

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.900
that our neural circuits
work at a local scale

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.820
and at a very broad scale.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.330
And for those of you that
are only interested in tools,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.150
like how do I get more dopamine?

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.780
Let me tell you this
part is really important

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.650
because if you were to
take a drug or supplement

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.630
that increases your level of dopamine,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.730
you are influencing both the
local release of dopamine

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.890
and volumetric release.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.190
This relates back to
the baseline of dopamine

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.950
and the big peak above baseline.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.520
And that turns out to be important.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.240
And I'll just allude
to why it's important.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.740
Many drugs and indeed many supplements

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.110
that increase dopamine will
actually make it harder

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.110
for you to sustain dopamine release

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.830
over long periods of time.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.000
And to achieve those peaks
that most of us are craving

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.710
when we are in pursuit of things.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.670
Why?

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.560
Because if you get both
volume metric release,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.390
the dumping out of dopamine everywhere,

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.260
and you're getting local release,

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.367
what it means is that the
difference between the peak

00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:52.870
and baseline is likely to be smaller.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.120
And this is very important,

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.750
how satisfying or exciting or pleasureful

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.750
a given experience is,

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.920
doesn't just depend on
the height of that peak,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.920
it depends on the height
of that peak relative

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.110
to the baseline.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.410
So if you increase the baseline
and you increase the peak,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.830
you're not going to achieve
more and more pleasure

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.800
from things.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.890
I'll talk about how to
leverage this information

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.170
in a little bit,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.840
but just increasing your dopamine.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.260
Yes, it will make you
excited for all things.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.000
It will make you feel very motivated,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.270
but it will also make that
motivation very short-lived.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.750
So there's a better way
to increase your dopamine.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.300
There's a better way to optimize

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.300
this peak to baseline ratio.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.180
For now what we've talked about
is two main neural circuits,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.050
one for movement,

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.080
and one for motivation
and craving with dopamine.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.910
And we've talked about two
main modes of communication

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.500
between neurons with dopamine.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.943
One is this local synaptic release.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.540
One is more volume metric release.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.630
And in the back of your mind,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.880
you can relate this back to,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.270
again, this baseline versus
peaks above baseline.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.020
So that's a description
of what we would call

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.960
the spatial effects or the
spatial aspects of dopamine.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.280
I said this connects to that,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.150
that connects to this.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.960
You can get local or more
broad volumetric release.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.170
What about the duration of release

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.070
or the duration of action for dopamine?

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.330
Well, dopamine is unique
among chemicals in the brain,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.660
because dopamine unlike a
lot of chemicals in the brain

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.520
works through what are called
G protein-coupled receptors.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.150
And for those of you that
are about to pass out

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.040
from the amount of detail,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.010
just hang in there with me.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.020
It's really not complicated.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.280
There are two ways that
neurons can communicate

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.530
or mainly two ways.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:40.700
There are third and fourth,

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.650
but mostly neurons
communicate by two modes.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.020
One, are what we call
fast electrical synapses

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.950
ionotropic conduction.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:51.783
All right?

00:22:51.783 --> 00:22:52.616
You don't need to know what that means,

00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:56.350
but basically one neuron
activates another neuron

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.920
and little holes open up in that neuron,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.740
and ions rush in.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.850
Sodium is the main ion salt

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.740
by which one neuron influences
the electrical activity

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.020
of another neuron because
sodium ions contain a charge.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.041
Okay?

00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.490
There are other things like
chloride and potassium.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.720
If you're interested in looking this up,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.220
just look up ionic conductances
in the action potential,

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.730
or I could do a post on it some time

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.570
and we could go into detail.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.030
But just understand that when neurons

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.440
want to influence each other,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.560
they can do it by way of this
fast ionotropic conduction.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.630
This is a really quick way for one neuron

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.950
to influence the next.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.270
Dopamine doesn't communicate that way.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.810
Dopamine is slower.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.630
It works through what are
called G protein-coupled

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.560
receptors.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.620
So what happens is dopamine is released

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.600
in these little vesicles
that I've mentioned before,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.080
get vomited out into the synapse.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.340
Some of that dopamine will bind

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.450
to the so-called postsynaptic neuron,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.830
it'll bind to the next neuron,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.340
and then it sets off a cascade.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.300
It's kind of like a bucket
brigade of one thing,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.590
getting handed off to the next,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.070
to the next, to the next.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.460
It's G protein-coupled receptors.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.170
And anytime you hear about these GPCRs

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.410
or G protein-coupled receptors,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.660
pay attention because
they're really interesting.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.920
They're slow,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.160
but they also can have
multiple cascades of effects.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.370
They can impact even gene
expression at some level.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.270
They can change what a
cell actually becomes.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.610
They can change how well
or how poorly that cell

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.000
will respond to the same
signal in the future.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.790
So dopamine works through
the slower process.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.460
These G protein-coupled receptors.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.803
And so its effects tend to
take a while in order to occur.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.830
This aspect of dopamine
transmission is important

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.480
because it now underscores two things.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.560
One, there's two pathways
for dopamine to communicate.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.393
One for movement,

00:24:43.393 --> 00:24:44.690
one for motivation and craving.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:49.060
There's two spatial scales
at which dopamine can operate

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.250
synaptically or volumetrically.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.040
And dopamine can have slow effects,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.270
really slow effects,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.320
or even very long lasting effects.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.890
And it even can control gene expression.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.510
It can actually change
the way that cells behave.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.560
One thing that's not often
discussed about dopamine,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.940
but is extremely important to know

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.070
is that dopamine doesn't work on its own.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:15.910
Neurons that release dopamine
co-release glutamate.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.600
Glutamate is a neurotransmitter

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.230
and it's a neurotransmitter
that is excitatory,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.810
meaning it stimulates neurons
to be electrically active.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.387
So now even if you don't
know any cell biology,

00:25:28.387 --> 00:25:29.960
you should start to gain a picture

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.600
that dopamine is responsible for movement,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.074
motivation and drive.

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:35.770
It does that through two pathways,

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.720
but also the dopamine
stimulates action in general,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.020
because it releases this
excitatory neurotransmitter.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.930
It tends to make certain
neurons that are nearby

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.080
or even that are far away,

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.300
because of volumetric release,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.120
it tends to make those more active.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.290
So dopamine is really stimulating.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.370
And indeed we say that
dopaminergic transmission

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.650
or dopamine tends to
stimulate sympathetic arousal.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.730
Sympathetic doesn't have
anything to do with sympathy.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.330
It's just simply means that it tends

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.330
to increase our levels of alertness.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.730
It tends to bring an animal or a human

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.060
into a state of more alertness, readiness

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.340
and desire to pursue
things outside the confines

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.430
of its skin.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.080
So if I were to just put
a really simple message

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.850
around dopamine it would be,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.930
there's a molecule in your brain and body

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.930
that when released tends to
make you look outside yourself,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.540
pursue things outside yourself,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.793
and to crave things outside yourself.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.100
The pleasure that arrives
from achieving things

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.500
also involves dopamine,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.860
but is mainly the consequences
of other molecules.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.660
But if ever you felt
lethargic and like just lazy

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.310
and you had no motivation or drive,

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.530
that's a low dopamine state.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.980
If ever you felt really
excited, motivated,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.710
even if you're a little
scared to do something.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.090
Maybe you did your first skydive,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.040
or you're about to do your first skydive,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.013
or you're about to do some public speaking

00:27:00.013 --> 00:27:02.860
and you really don't want to screw it up,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.650
you are in a high dopamine state.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.930
Dopamine is a universal
currency in all mammals,

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.700
but especially in humans
for moving us toward goals

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.670
and how much dopamine is in
our system at any one time

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.570
compared to how much
dopamine was in our system

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.300
a few minutes ago,

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.900
and how much we remember
enjoying a particular experience

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.933
of the past.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.780
That dictates your
so-called quality of life

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.290
and your desire to pursue things.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.123
This is really important.

00:27:34.123 --> 00:27:36.310
Dopamine is a currency,

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.660
and it's the way that you track pleasure.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.390
It's the way that you track success.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.030
It's the way that you track

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.950
whether or not you are
doing well or doing poorly.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.040
And that is subjective,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.370
but if your dopamine is too low,

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.040
you will not feel motivated.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.210
If your dopamine is really high,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.410
you will feel motivated.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.810
And if your dopamine is
somewhere in the middle,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.720
how you feel depends on whether or not

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.290
you had higher dopamine a few
minutes ago or lower dopamine.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.800
This is important,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.830
your experience of life and
your level of motivation

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.830
and drive depends on how much
dopamine you have relative

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.130
to your recent experience.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.330
This is again, something
that's just not accounted

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.410
for in the simple
language of dopamine hits.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.243
Okay?

00:28:24.243 --> 00:28:26.910
A simple way to envision dopamine hits

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.380
is every time you do something you like,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.250
you to piece of chocolate,

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.083
dopamine hit.

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:30.990
You look at your Instagram,

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.823
dopamine hit.

00:28:31.823 --> 00:28:32.656
You see someone you like,

00:28:32.656 --> 00:28:34.340
dopamine hit.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.570
All these things
described as dopamine hits

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.680
neglect the fact that if
you scroll social media

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.930
and you see something you really like,

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:43.770
dopamine hit.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.840
Sure there's an increase in dopamine,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.430
but then you get to
something else and you go,

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.720
hmm, not that interesting.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.560
However, had you arrived
at that second thing first,

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.910
you might think that it
was really interesting.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.580
If you had arrived to
that second Instagram post

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.600
three days later or four days later,

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.990
you might find it extremely interesting.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.290
Again, how much dopamine you
experience from something

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.350
depends on your baseline level of dopamine

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.840
when you arrive there,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.180
and your previous dopamine peaks.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.013
Okay?

00:29:15.013 --> 00:29:16.650
That's super important to understand,

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.230
and it's completely neglected
by the general language

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.230
of dopamine hits.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.730
This is why when you
repeatedly engage in something

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.340
that you enjoy,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.090
your threshold for enjoyment
goes up and up and up.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.990
So I want to talk about that process.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.563
And I want to explain
how that process works,

00:29:32.563 --> 00:29:34.880
because if you understand that process,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.790
and you understand some of
these schedules and kinetics

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.623
as we call them around dopamine,

00:29:38.623 --> 00:29:40.860
you will be in a terrific position

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.580
to use any dopamine enhancing
tools that you decide to use.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.980
You'll be in an excellent
position to modulate

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.800
and control your own dopamine release

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.000
for optimal motivation and drive.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.390
I realized that was a lot of information

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.030
about the biology of dopamine,

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.510
sort of like trying to make you drink

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.320
from the fire hose of dopamine biology.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.600
However, I realized that some people

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.660
probably want even more information

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.750
about the biology of
dopamine transmission.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.290
If you're interested in that,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.890
I'll post a link to a
absolutely stellar review

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.400
that was published in
Nature Reviews Neuroscience

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.510
called spatial and temporal
scales of dopamine transmission.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.650
It is quite detailed,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.270
but they have beautiful diagrams

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.310
and can walk you through all the things

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.730
that I just described and
get into even more detail.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.323
We'll put a link to that
in the caption on YouTube.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.400
Right now, I want to share
with you two anecdotes,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.670
one from my own life,

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.260
and one from some fairly recent history

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.170
that illustrate some of the
core biology of dopamine

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.600
and how profoundly it
can shape our experience.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.023
The first one is a really
tragic situation that occurred.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.340
This was in the 80s,

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.240
there was a outbreak of what
looked like Parkinsonian

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.330
symptoms in a young population.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.240
So many of you heard
of Parkinson's disease.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.010
Parkinson's disease is a disease
in which people initially

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.120
start to quake, can't
generate smooth movements,

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.350
they'll have issues with speech,

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.590
sometimes cognition as well.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.980
There are examples like Michael J. Fox,

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.970
which are kind of early onset.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.300
Parkinson's typically it hits people

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.710
a little bit later in life.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.263
There's a genetic component.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.100
But there is this question,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.200
and there's always been this question

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.280
whether or not certain lifestyle factors

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.620
can also create Parkinson's?

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.786
And some years ago there was a situation

00:31:31.786 --> 00:31:35.320
where street laboratories,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.390
illicit laboratories were
trying to make a drug

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.800
called MPPP, which is an
opioid light compound.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.193
It's a bit like heroin,

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.104
and heroin addicts seeking
heroin went out and bought

00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:50.723
what they thought was MPPP.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.160
Unfortunately, it was not MPPP.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.040
I mean, it would have been
tragic if it was anyway

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.230
because they were drug addicts,

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.320
but what they ended up taking
turned out to be a lot worse.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.750
What they ended up taking was MPTP,

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:10.750
and MPTP can arise in
the synthesis of MPPP.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.730
So someone in a lab someplace,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.700
this was mainly in the
Central Valley in California,

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.880
but elsewhere as well.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.190
Somebody created MPTP,

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.860
and what ended up happening
was a large number

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.830
of young people who were opioid addicts

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:30.270
became completely boxed in paralyzed.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.780
Couldn't speak, couldn't blink,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.270
couldn't do anything.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.830
Couldn't function, couldn't move.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.830
So both aspects of dopamine
transmission were disrupted.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.330
They had no motivation and drive.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.760
They couldn't generate
any movement of any kind.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.760
They were literally locked in frozen.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.570
And sadly, this is irreversible.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.770
It's irreversible,

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:57.770
because what MPTP does is it
kills the dopaminergic neurons

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.940
of the substantia nigra
that nigrostriatal pathway

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.830
that's involved in generating movement.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.230
And it kills the dopaminergic neurons

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.010
of the so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.020
I was in college when this
whole MPTP thing happened.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.140
And I remember hearing this story.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.410
At the time, I had no understanding

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.440
of what it is to have very
high levels of dopamine

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.710
or extremely depleted levels of dopamine.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.590
There was no reason why I
should have that understanding.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.740
I mean, of course I had
experienced different pleasures

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.690
of different kinds and
I've had lows in my life,

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:32.523
but nothing to the extreme
that I'm about to discuss.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.600
I got Giardia.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.790
And Giardia is a stomach bug
that if any of you ever had it,

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.790
it is terrible.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.010
It's terrible diarrhea.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.970
You end up very dehydrated very quickly.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.970
You drop a ton of weight and
it is extremely unpleasant.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.700
I ended up going to the emergency room,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.830
and in the emergency room,

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.130
I begged them for something
to stop up my guts.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.380
And they gave it to me.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.530
They put a saline line into rehydrate me

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.700
and they injected something
into the saline bag.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.700
And within minutes I felt more sadness,

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.360
more overwhelming sense of depression,

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.630
basically, lower than I'd
ever felt in my entire life.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.200
It was absolutely profound.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.720
I was crying endlessly without
knowing why I was crying.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.800
I was miserable.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.780
And I asked them, what did you inject?

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.060
And they said, "We injected Thorazine."

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.570
Thorazine is an antipsychotic drug.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.160
It's actually used to
block dopamine receptors.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.420
It's what's given to people
who have schizophrenia.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.480
Often is given to people
who have schizophrenia,

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.890
because schizophrenia
involves among other things

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.543
elevated levels of dopamine.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.900
It was horrible.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.660
The experience of it was miserable,

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.190
unlike anything I'd ever experienced.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.827
And so I actually said to them,

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:56.660
"What did you give me?"

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.840
They said, "Thorazine."

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.657
And I said, "You have to give me l-DOPA.

00:35:00.657 --> 00:35:03.357
"You have to give me something
to get my dopamine levels

00:35:03.357 --> 00:35:04.190
"back up again."

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.023
And they did.

00:35:05.023 --> 00:35:07.360
They gave me an injection
of l-DOPA into the bag,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.550
went straight to my bloodstream.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.260
And within minutes I felt fine again.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.093
It was incredible.

00:35:13.093 --> 00:35:16.300
And it really opened up
my mind and my experience

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.890
to what it is to have
absolutely plummeted levels

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:20.723
of dopamine.

00:35:20.723 --> 00:35:23.160
And there's nothing more
miserable than that I'll tell you.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.870
And these poor souls who
had this MPTP experience,

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.850
unfortunately, they couldn't
recover those cells.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.030
People who have severe Parkinson's

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.400
are struggling with this as well,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.540
because in Parkinson's
and in Lewy body dementia,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.830
the dopaminergic neurons often die.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.440
It's not just a problem with those neurons

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.980
releasing enough dopamine.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.250
Later, we're going to
talk about some approaches

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.080
to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.830
and things that we can all do for that.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.010
But I will tell you these dopamine neurons

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.560
that we all have are very
precious for movement

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.280
and mood and motivation.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.200
Having experienced what it is
to have very, very low levels

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.790
of dopamine or in this case
to have my dopamine receptors

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:05.790
blocked from Thorazine was
eye-opening to say the least,

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.670
and has given me tremendous
sensitivity to the fact

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:13.940
that dopamine is perhaps one
of the most powerful molecules

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.480
that any of us has inside of us.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.320
And the one that we ought to
all think very carefully about

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.153
how we leverage,

00:36:20.153 --> 00:36:24.410
because while most
experiences and most things

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.290
that we do, and take and eat and cetera,

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.883
won't create enormous highs
and enormous lows in dopamine.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:34.410
Even subtle fluctuations
in dopamine really shape

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.880
our perception of life
and what we're capable of,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.120
and how we feel.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.620
And so we want to guard those
and we want to understand them.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.700
So let's lean into that
understanding about dopamine.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.050
And then let's talk about some tools

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.510
that we can all use to leverage dopamine

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.610
in order to keep that
baseline in the appropriate,

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:50.560
healthy place,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.840
and still be able to access
those peaks in dopamine.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.210
Because those, after all are
some of what makes life rich

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.420
and worth living.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.660
So let's talk about the
baseline of dopamine

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.670
that we all have and the peaks in dopamine

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:07.080
that we all can achieve
through different activities

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.573
and things that we ingest.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.780
All of us have different
baseline levels of dopamine.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.040
Some of this is sure to be genetic.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.270
Some people just simply ride
at a level a little bit higher.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.540
They're a little bit more excited,

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.660
they're a little bit more motivated,

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.660
or maybe they're a lot more
excited or a lot more motivated.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.400
Some people are a little mellower,

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.500
some people are a little less excitable.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.530
And some of that has to do with the fact

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.890
that dopamine doesn't act alone.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:41.330
Dopamine has close cousins or
friends in the nervous system.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.340
And I'll just name off a
few of those close cousins

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.173
and friends.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.660
Epinephrin also called adrenaline

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.040
is the main chemical driver of energy.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.130
We can't do anything, anything at all,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.020
unless we have some level of epinephrin

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.650
in our brain and body.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.070
It's released from the adrenal glands

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.220
which right on top our kidneys.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.470
It's released from an
area of the brainstem

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.460
called locus coeruleus.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.293
And its release tends to
wake up neural circuits

00:38:08.293 --> 00:38:11.910
in the brain and wake up various aspects

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.810
of our body's physiology
and give us a readiness.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:16.970
So it should come as no surprise

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:20.880
that dopamine and
epinephrin aka adrenaline

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.330
hang out together.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:26.290
In fact, epinephrin and adrenaline
are actually manufactured

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.360
from dopamine.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.570
There's a biochemical
pathway involving dopamine

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.230
which is a beautiful pathway.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.740
If ever you want to look it up,

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.160
you can just look up
biochemistry of dopamine.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.270
But what you'll find is that,

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.283
l-DOPA is converted into dopamine.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.397
Dopamine is converted
to two noradrenaline.

00:38:47.397 --> 00:38:49.530
Norepinephrin, it's also called.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.870
And noredrenaline,
norepinephrin is converted

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.500
into adrenaline.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.850
So not only are dopamine and
epinephrin aka adrenaline

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.060
close cousins,

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.290
they are actually family members.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.123
Okay?

00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:04.110
They're closely related.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.300
I'm not going to get too
deep into epinephrin today.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.420
I'm not going to talk too
much about those pathways,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.060
but anytime I'm talking about
dopaminergic transmission

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.080
or that you have a peak in dopamine,

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.140
inevitably, that means
that you have a peak

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.700
and release of epinephrin as well.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.600
What dopamine does is
dopamine really colors

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.380
the subjective experience of an activity

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.370
to make it more pleasureful,

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.730
to make it something
that you want more of.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.850
Epinephrin is more about energy.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.810
Epinephrin alone can be
fear, paralysis, trauma.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:38.280
Not physical paralysis,
but mental paralysis,

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.193
you know, frozen in fear or
being traumatized or scared.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.030
But the addition of dopamine
to that chemical cocktail,

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.410
if dopamine is released in the brain,

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:53.100
well, then that epinephrin
becomes one of excitement.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.933
Okay?

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:54.900
I'm using a broad brush here,

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.930
but essentially what you
need to know is that,

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:00.860
dopamine and epinephrin aka
adrenaline are family members.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.200
And they tend to work
together like a little gang

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.070
to make you seek out certain things.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.150
So what sorts of activities?

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.240
What sorts of things increase dopamine?

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.020
And how much do they increase dopamine?

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.740
Well, let's take a look
at some typical things

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.370
that people do out there
or ingest out there

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.890
that are known to increase dopamine.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.610
So let's recall that you have
a baseline level of dopamine

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.220
and that everybody does.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.400
And even within a family,

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.950
you might have family members
who are very excitable,

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.180
happy and motivated,

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.140
and others who are less
excitable, happy and motivated.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.390
But your level of dopamine has everything

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.840
to do with those genetics,

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.680
but also with what you've
experienced in the previous days

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.413
and the previous months and so on.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.470
When you do or ingest certain things,

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.530
your levels of dopamine
will rise above baseline

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.623
transiently.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:58.040
And depending on what you do or ingest,

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.820
it will rise either more or less,

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.730
and it will be very brief
or a last a long time.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.570
So let's take a look at
some of the typical things

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.870
that people take and do and eat.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:09.730
Some are good for us,

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.413
some are not good for us.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.760
And let's ask how much dopamine
is increased above baseline?

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.970
Now, of course, these are averages,

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.150
but these are averages
that have been measured

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.900
in so-called micro dialysis
studies in animals.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.050
So actually extracting
from particular brain areas

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.460
how much dopamine is released?

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.380
Or from measuring the serum,

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.763
the circulating levels
of dopamine in humans.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:32.933
Chocolate.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.860
They didn't look at milk
versus dark chocolate.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.233
But chocolate will increase
your baseline level of dopamine

00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:41.730
1.5 times.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:42.563
Okay?

00:41:42.563 --> 00:41:44.450
So it's a pretty substantial
increase in dopamine.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.730
It's transient.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:50.350
It goes away after a few
minutes or even a few seconds.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.320
I'll explain what determines
the duration in a minute.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.653
But 1.5 times for chocolate.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:57.990
Sex.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:02.350
Both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:06.350
increases dopamine two times.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.020
So it's a doubling above baseline.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.330
Now, of course, there's
going to be variation there,

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.260
but that's the average
increase in baseline dopamine

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.763
caused by sex.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:22.330
Later, I will talk about
how the different aspects

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.980
of the so-called arousal art,

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.310
the different aspects of sex,

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.940
believe it or not have a
differential impact on dopamine.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.100
But for now as a general
theme or activity,

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.520
sex doubles the amount
of dopamine circulating

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.353
in your blood.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.520
Nicotine.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.390
In particular, nicotine that is smoked

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.973
like cigarettes and so forth,

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.950
increases dopamine two and
a half times above baseline.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:53.290
So there's a peak that
goes up above baseline

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.673
two and a half times higher.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.200
It is very short-lived.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.520
Anyone who's ever been a chain smoker

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.490
or observed a chain smoker understands

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.630
that the increase in
dopamine from nicotine

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.453
is very short-lived.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.320
Cocaine will increase
the level of dopamine

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.123
in the bloodstream two and
a half times above baseline.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.360
And amphetamine another
drug that increases dopamine

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.030
will increase the amount of
dopamine in the bloodstream

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.460
10 times above baseline.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.250
A tremendous increase in dopamine.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.810
Exercise.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.490
Now, exercise will have a different impact

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:35.700
on the levels of dopamine,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.890
depending on how much
somebody subjectively enjoys

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:40.620
that exercise.

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.350
So if you're somebody who loves running,

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:47.770
chances are it's going to
increase your levels of dopamine

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.990
two times above your baseline,

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.333
not unlike sex.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.880
People who dislike exercise will achieve

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.800
less dopamine increase or
no increase in dopamine

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.040
from exercise.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.160
And if you like other
forms of exercise like yoga

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.960
or weightlifting or
swimming or what have you.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.350
Again, it's going to vary by
your subjective experience

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.410
of whether or not you enjoy that activity.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:12.750
This is important.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.150
And it brings us back to something

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:15.320
that we talked about earlier.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.340
Remember that mesocorticolimbic pathway?

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.610
Well, the cortical part is important.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.260
The cortical part actually
has a very specific part,

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.010
which is your prefrontal cortex.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.110
The area of your forebrain
that's involved in thinking

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:34.070
and planning and involved in assigning

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.610
a rational explanation to something,

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.830
and involved in assigning
a subjective experience

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:41.150
to something, right?

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.290
So for instance, the pen
that I'm holding right now,

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.620
it's one of these Pilot V5s.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.730
I love these Pilot V5s.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:46.660
They don't sponsor the podcast.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.530
I just happen to like them.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:48.870
I liked the way that they write,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.773
how they feel.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.510
If I spent enough time thinking about it,

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.343
or talking about it,

00:44:53.343 --> 00:44:54.730
I could probably get a dopamine increase

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.270
just talking about this Pilot V5.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.880
And that's not because
I have the propensity

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.300
to release dopamine easily,

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.830
it's that as we start
to engage with something

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.070
more and more and what we say about it,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:08.030
and what we encourage
ourselves to think about it,

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.120
has a profound impact on its rewarding

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.330
or non rewarding properties.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.810
Now, it's not simply the case
that you can lie to yourself,

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.300
and you can tell yourself I love something

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.630
and when you don't really love it,

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.920
and it will increase dopamine.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.790
But what's been found over and over again,

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.610
is that if people journal about something

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.810
or they practice some form of
appreciation for something,

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.580
or they think of some aspect
of something that they enjoy,

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.610
the amount of dopamine that
that behavior will evoke

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.190
tends to go up.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:38.710
So for people that hate exercise,

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.610
you can think about
some aspect of exercise

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:42.690
that you really enjoy.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:47.690
However, I will caution you
against saying to yourself,

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.730
I hate exercise or I hate
studying or I hate this person,

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.960
but I love the reward I
give myself afterward.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.320
Later, we're going to talk about
how rewards given afterward

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.690
actually make the situation worse.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.640
They won't make you like
exercise more or study more,

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.120
they actually will undermine
the dopamine release

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.490
that would otherwise
occur for that activity.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:13.610
So certain things chemicals
have a universal effect.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.090
They make everybody's dopamine go up.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.570
So some people like chocolate,

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.420
some people don't of course,

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.410
but in general, it make has causes

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:22.910
this increase in dopamine.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.406
But sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine,

00:46:25.406 --> 00:46:28.070
those things cause increases in dopamine

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:29.570
and everybody that takes them.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.430
Things like exercise, studying, hard work,

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.350
working through a
challenge in a relationship

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:38.160
or working through
something hard of any kind

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.320
that is going to be subjective

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.780
as to how much dopamine will be released.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.370
And we will return to
that subjective component

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:46.840
in a little bit.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.940
But now you have a sense
of how much dopamine

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.110
can be evoked by different activities

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.020
and by different substances.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.460
One that you might be
wondering about is caffeine.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.360
I'm certainly drinking my caffeine today,

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.540
and I do enjoy caffeine
in limited quantities.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.383
I drink yerba mate and I
drink coffee and I love it.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.140
Does it increase dopamine?

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.860
Well, a little bit.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.420
Caffeine will increase
dopamine to some extent,

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.630
but it is pretty modest
compared to the other things

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:18.840
that I described.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.690
Chocolate, sex, nicotine,
cocaine, amphetamine and so on.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.430
However, there's a
really interesting paper

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.910
published in 2015.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:27.870
This is Volkow et al.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.610
You can look up it's very easy to find.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.640
That showed that regular
ingestion of caffeine,

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.150
whether or not it's from
coffee or otherwise,

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:40.980
increases up regulation of
certain dopamine receptors.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.980
So caffeine actually makes
you able to experience

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:47.960
more of dopamines effects.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.100
Because as I mentioned before,

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.310
dopamine is vomited out into the synapse

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.600
or it's released volumetrically,

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.000
but then it has to bind someplace

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.880
and trigger those G
protein-coupled receptors.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.750
And caffeine increases the number,

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.583
the density of those G
protein-coupled receptors.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.060
Now, sitting back and thinking about that,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.440
you might think, oh yeah, you know,

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.350
sometimes I'll notice people,

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:11.940
at least in the old days
that used to be a cigarette

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.150
and a cup of coffee.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:14.700
Or when people drink alcohol,

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.310
oftentimes they'll smoke.

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.020
And it's well-known
that different compounds

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:23.070
like alcohol and nicotine
or caffeine and nicotine

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.700
or certain behaviors and
certain drugs can synergize

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.800
to give bigger dopamine increases.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.630
And this is not terribly uncommon.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.190
There are a lot of people nowadays

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.790
who for instance take
pre-workout energy drinks.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:35.760
They'll drink,

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.593
I won't name names,

00:48:36.593 --> 00:48:38.690
but they'll drink a canned energy drink

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.530
or they'll drink a pre-workout

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.940
and they'll try and get
that big stimulation

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.710
that stimulant effect for the dopamine,

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.060
the norepinephrin, that
family of molecules

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.810
that works together to make you motivated.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.760
And then they'll also exercise
to try and get even more

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.980
of a dopaminergic experience
out of that workout.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:59.130
Sometimes it's also to perform
better as well, of course,

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.880
but as we'll talk about in a few minutes,

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.180
that aspect or that approach rather

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.600
of trying to just get your dopamine

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.080
as high as you possibly can,

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.580
in order to get the
most out of experience,

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.870
turns out to not be the best approach.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:16.030
And what you'll find as we
talk about dopamine schedules

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:19.690
is that layering together multiple things,

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.750
substances and activities

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.070
that lead to big increases in dopamine,

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.020
actually can create pretty severe issues

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.500
with motivation and energy
right after those experiences

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.210
and even a couple of days later.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.000
So I'm not saying that
people shouldn't take

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.830
the occasional pre-workout
if that's your thing,

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.630
or drink a cup of coffee
or two before working out

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:39.463
now and again.

00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:40.720
Some people really enjoy that.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.770
I certainly do that every once in a while,

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.290
but if you do it too often,

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:48.400
what you'll find is that your
capacity to release dopamine

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.520
and your level of motivation
and drive and energy overall

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.410
will take a serious hit.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.800
Now, I've been alluding
to this dopamine peaks

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.580
versus dopamine baseline things

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:58.890
since the beginning of the episode.

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.000
I talked about tonic and
phasic release and so forth.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.340
But now let's really drill
into what this means,

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:08.010
and how to leverage it
for our own purposes.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:10.240
In order to do that, let's
take a step back and ask,

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.827
why would we have a
dopamine system like this?

00:50:12.827 --> 00:50:15.150
Why would we have a
dopamine system at all?

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:19.660
Well, we have to remember
what our species primary

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.940
interest is?

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.030
Our species like all
species has a main interest,

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:26.780
and that's to make more of itself.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.620
And it's just about sex and reproduction.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.350
It's about forging for resources.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:32.600
Resources can be food,

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.210
it can be water can be salt,

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.140
it can be shelter,

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.143
it can be social connection.

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:44.090
Dopamine is the universal
currency of forging and seeking,

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.216
right?

00:50:45.216 --> 00:50:46.820
We call sometimes talk about
motivation and craving,

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.630
but what we mean in the
evolutionary adaptive context,

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.200
what we mean is forging and seeking.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.820
Seeking water, seeking
food, seeking mates.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.350
Seeking things that make us feel good

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.310
and avoiding things that
don't make us feel good.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:59.760
But in particular seeking things

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.800
that will provide sustenance
and pleasure in the short-term

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.390
and will extend the
species in the long-term.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.460
Once we understand that
dopamine is a driver for us

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.280
to seek things,

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.290
it makes perfect sense as to why

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.440
it would have a baseline
level and it would have peaks.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.920
And that the baseline and
peaks would be related

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.960
in some sort of direct way.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.850
Here's what I mean by that.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.130
Let's say that you were not alive now,

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.950
but you were alive 10,000 years ago.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.680
And you woke up and you
looked and you realized

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:36.170
you had minimal water and
you had minimal food left.

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.180
Maybe you have a child,

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.590
maybe you have a partner,

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:39.980
maybe you're in an entire village,

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.660
but you realize that you need things.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.493
Okay?

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.290
You need to be able to generate the energy

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.070
to go seek those things.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:52.140
And chances are there were
dangers in seeking those things.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.910
Yes, it could be saber-tooth tigers

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.190
and things of that sort,

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.880
but there are other dangers too.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.490
There's the danger of a cut to your skin

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.530
that could lead to infection.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:00.810
There's the danger of storms,

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:01.940
there's the danger of cold,

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.720
there's the danger of leaving
your loved ones behind.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.510
So you go out and forage, right?

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:08.970
You could be hunting,
you could be gathering,

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:10.950
or you could be doing both.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:13.517
The going out and foraging process

00:52:13.517 --> 00:52:17.050
was we are certain driven by dopamine.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.770
I mean, there's no fossil
record of the brain,

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.040
but the circuits have existed.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.790
We know for tens of thousands,

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.860
if not hundreds of thousands of years.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:27.040
And they are present in every
animal, not just mammals,

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.880
but even in little worms like C. elegans,

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.970
it's the same process.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.310
It's mediated by dopamine.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.130
So dopamine drives you to
go out and look for things.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.540
And then let's say you
find a couple berries,

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.420
and these ones are rotten,

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.540
these ones are good.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.700
Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it,

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.710
or you find an animal
that was recently killed

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:45.310
and you decide to take the meat.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.010
You are going to achieve,

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.600
or I should say, experience
some sort of dopamine release.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.860
You found the reward.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.020
That's great.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.520
But then it needs to
return to some lower level.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.353
Why?

00:52:58.353 --> 00:53:00.430
Well, because if you just stayed there,

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.653
you would never continue
to forage for more.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.770
It doesn't just increase your
baseline and then stay there.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.270
It goes back down.

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:09.900
And what's very important to understand

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.500
is that it doesn't just go back down

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.560
to the level it was before,

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.130
it goes down to a level below

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:19.060
what it was before you went
out seeking that thing.

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.990
Now, this is counter-intuitive.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.823
We often think,

00:53:21.823 --> 00:53:24.370
Oh, okay, I'm going to
pursue the win, right?

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.313
Let's move this to modern day.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.540
I'm going to run this marathon,

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.730
I'm going to train for this marathon.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.240
Then you run the marathon and you finish,

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.300
you cross the finish line,

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.480
you feel great.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.230
And you would think, okay, now
I'm set for the entire year,

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.240
I'm going to feel so much better,

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.170
I'm going to feel this
accomplishment in my body,

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.500
it's going to be so great.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.930
That's not what happens.

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:44.360
You might feel some of those things,

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.830
but your level of dopamine
has actually dropped

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.480
below baseline.

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.360
Now, eventually it will ratchet back up.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.740
But two things are really important.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.840
First of all, the extent to
which it drops below baseline

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.050
is proportional to how high the peak was.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.750
So if you cross the
finish line pretty happy,

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:06.030
it won't drop that much
below baseline afterward.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:08.980
If you cross the finish line ecstatic,

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.160
well, a day or two later,

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.400
you're going to feel quite a bit lower

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.410
than you would otherwise.

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.510
You might not be depressed,

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.220
because it depends on where
that baseline was to begin with.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.100
But the so-called postpartum depression

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.770
that people experience after giving birth

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.670
or after some big win a graduation

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.810
or any kind of celebration
that postpartum drop

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:33.210
in mood and affect and
motivation is the drop

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:35.090
in baseline dopamine.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.440
This is very important to understand,

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.780
because this happens on
very rapid timescales

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.683
and it can last quite a long time.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:45.360
It also explains the
behavior that most of us

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.193
are familiar with,

00:54:46.193 --> 00:54:48.270
of engaging in something
that we really enjoy.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.100
Going to a restaurant
that we absolutely love,

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.180
or engaging in some way with some person

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.260
that we really, really enjoy.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.340
But if we continue to
engage in that behavior

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.370
over and over again,

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.230
it kind of loses its edge.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:05.323
It starts to kind of
feel less exciting to us.

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:10.940
Some of us experienced that
drop in excitement more quickly

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.900
and more severely than others,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.390
but everyone experiences
that to some extent.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:20.320
And this has direct roots
in these evolutionarily

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.220
conserved circuits.

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.417
Some of you may be hearing this and think,

00:55:23.417 --> 00:55:25.530
no, no, no, no that's
not how it works for me.

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.580
I'm just riding higher
and higher all the time.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.550
I love my kids,

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:29.460
I love my job,

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.293
I love school,

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.140
I love wins,

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.060
I don't want losses.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:33.893
I agree.

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:37.510
We all feel good when
we are achieving things,

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.150
but oftentimes we are feeling good

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:43.900
because we are layering in
different aspects of life,

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.983
consuming things and doing things

00:55:44.983 --> 00:55:46.500
that increase our dopamine.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.300
We're getting those peaks,

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.740
but afterward the drop in baseline occurs,

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.860
and it always takes a
little while to get back

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.190
to our stable baseline.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:01.540
We really all have a sort
of dopamine set point.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.820
And if we continue to
indulge in the same behaviors

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.460
or even different behaviors
that increase our dopamine

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.040
in these big peaks over
and over and over again,

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.600
we won't experience the same level of joy

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.380
from those behaviors or
from anything at all.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.300
Now, that has a name.

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.620
It's called addiction.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.020
But even for people who aren't addicted,

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.020
even for people don't an attachment

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.400
to any specific substance or behavior,

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.210
this drop in bay below baseline
after any peak in dopamine

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:31.800
is substantial.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.360
And it governs whether or not
we are going to feel motivated

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.010
to continue to pursue other things.

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:39.930
Fortunately, there's a
way to work with this,

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:42.150
such that we can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.250
but also keep that baseline of dopamine

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:46.430
at an appropriate, healthy level.

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:48.740
A previous guest on the
Huberman Lab Podcast

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:49.920
was Dr. Anna Lembke.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.700
She's head of the Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.650
at Stanford.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:54.597
Has this amazing book,

00:56:54.597 --> 00:56:58.050
"Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance
in the Age of Indulgence".

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.100
If you haven't read the book,

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.220
I highly encourage you to check it out.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.053
It's fantastic.

00:57:02.053 --> 00:57:04.010
The other terrific book about dopamine

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:05.550
is the "Molecule of More",

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.040
which is a similar in some regard,

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.480
but isn't so much about addiction,

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.880
it's more about other types of behaviors.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.550
Both books really focus on
these dopamine schedules

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:16.937
and the relationship between these peaks

00:57:16.937 --> 00:57:18.613
and baselines of dopamine.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.520
In Dr. Lembke's book,

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.370
and when she was on the
Huberman Lab Podcast

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.203
and other podcasts,

00:57:24.203 --> 00:57:26.070
she's talked about this
pleasure pain balance

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.820
that when we seek something
that we really like,

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.653
or we indulge in it,

00:57:29.653 --> 00:57:31.210
like eating a little piece of chocolate,

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.160
if we really liked chocolate,

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.570
there's some pleasure.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:37.120
But then there's a little bit of pain

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.740
that exceeds the amount of pleasure,

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.270
and it's subtle,

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:43.740
and we experience it as
wanting more of that thing.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:44.759
Okay?

00:57:44.759 --> 00:57:45.810
So there's a pleasure pain balance,

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:48.670
and I'm telling you that
the pleasure and the pain

00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:50.700
are governed by dopamine to some extent.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.880
Well, how could that be?

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.713
Right?

00:57:52.713 --> 00:57:54.930
I said before, when you
engage in an activity

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:56.957
or when you ingest something
that increases dopamine,

00:57:56.957 --> 00:57:58.880
the dopamine levels go up,

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.350
you know, to substantial degree

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:02.283
with all the things I listed off.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:06.100
Where's the pain coming from?

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.120
Well, the pain is coming
from the lack of dopamine

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.970
that follows.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:15.970
And you now know what that
lack of dopamine reflects.

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:17.110
How do you know?

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.710
Well, earlier we were
talking about how dopamine

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:22.050
is released between neurons.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:23.140
And I mentioned two ways.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.670
One, is into the synapse
where it can activate

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:26.760
the postsynaptic neuron.

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.810
And the other was what I
called volumetric release

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:31.040
where it is distributed more broadly.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.683
It's released out over a bunch of neurons.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:37.990
In both cases it's
released from these things

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:39.210
we call synaptic vesicles,

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.210
literally little bubbles,
tiny, tiny little bubbles

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.300
that contain dopamine.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.820
Prrr! They get vomited out into the area

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.600
or into the synapse.

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.713
Well, those vesicles get depleted.

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.440
For the synaptic physiologists out there,

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:58.930
we call this the readily
releasable pool of dopamine.

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.130
We can only deploy dopamine
that is ready to be deployed.

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:05.470
That's packaged in those little
vesicles and ready to go.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.550
It's like when you order a
product and they say out of stock

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:10.570
until two months from now.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.350
Well, it's not ready to be released.

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:13.250
Same thing with dopamine.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:16.480
There's a pool of
dopamine that synthesized,

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.050
and you can only release the dopamine

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:20.970
that's been synthesized.

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:22.853
It's the readily releasable pool.

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:27.030
The pleasure pain balance
doesn't only hinge

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.430
on the readily releasable
pool of dopamine,

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:33.200
but a big part of the
pleasure pain balance

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.680
hinges on how much dopamine is there?

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.420
And how much is ready and
capable of being released

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.323
into the system?

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:45.010
So now we've given some meat to this thing

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:47.270
that we call the pleasure pain balance,

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:49.720
and now it should make perfect sense

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.660
why if you take something or do something

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.810
that leads to huge increases in dopamine,

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:58.260
afterward your baseline should drop

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.010
because there isn't a
lot of dopamine around

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:02.773
to keep your baseline going.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.290
Fortunately, most people do not experience

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.160
or pursue enormous increases in dopamine

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.393
leading to the severe drops in baseline.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.560
Many people do, however,

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.930
and that's what we call addiction.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.440
When somebody pursues
a drug or an activity

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.840
that leads to huge increases in dopamine.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.350
And now you understand that afterward

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:26.476
the baseline of dopamine drops

01:00:26.476 --> 01:00:28.393
because of depletion of dopamine,

01:00:28.393 --> 01:00:30.560
that readily releasable pool.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.097
The dopamine is literally
not around to be released,

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:35.670
and so people feel pretty lousy

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:39.390
and many people make the mistake
of then going and pursuing

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:42.740
the dopamine evoking the
dopamine releasing activity

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.350
or substance again thinking mistakenly

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:48.130
that it's going to
bring up their baseline.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:50.370
It's going to give them that peak again.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.060
Not only does it not give them a peak,

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.230
their baseline gets lower and lower

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:57.310
because they're depleting
dopamine more and more and more.

01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:59.520
And we've seen this over and over again

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.690
when people get addicted to something

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.423
then they're not achieving
much pleasure at all.

01:01:05.778 --> 01:01:08.280
You can even see this with video games.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.860
People will play a video game,

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:10.970
they love it,

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.640
it's super exciting to them,

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.240
and then they'll keep playing
and playing and playing,

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.580
and either one of two things
happens typically both.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.790
First of all,

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:23.750
I always say addiction is
a progressive narrowing

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:25.160
of the things that bring you pleasure.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.150
So oftentimes what will
happen is the person

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:31.650
only has excitement and can
achieve dopamine release

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:33.730
to the same extent doing that behavior

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.190
and not other behaviors.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.600
And so they start losing
interest in school,

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.940
they start losing
interest in relationships.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.350
they start losing interest
in fitness and wellbeing

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.614
and depletes their life.

01:01:44.614 --> 01:01:47.990
And eventually what typically happens is,

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.260
they will stop getting dopamine release

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.260
from that activity as well,

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.160
and then they drop into a
pretty serious depression

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.030
and this can get very severe and people

01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:00.260
have committed suicide from
these sorts of patterns

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.730
of activity.

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:04.250
But what about the more typical scenario?

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.690
What about the scenario of somebody

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.130
who is really good at
working during the week,

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.840
they exercise during the week,

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.700
they drink on the weekends?

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.250
Well, that person is
only consuming alcohol

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.030
maybe one or two nights a week,

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:22.540
but oftentimes that same
person will be spiking

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.400
their dopamine with food
during the middle of the week.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.550
Now, we all have to eat
and it's nice to eat foods

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.383
that we enjoy.

01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:29.490
I certainly do that.

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:31.410
I love food in fact.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.340
But let's say they're eating foods

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.210
that really evoke a
lot of dopamine release

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.180
in the middle of the week,

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:39.800
they're drinking one or
two days on the weekend,

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.570
they are one of these
work, hard play hard type.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.370
So they're swimming a
couple miles in the ocean

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.759
in the middle of the week as well.

01:02:47.759 --> 01:02:49.960
They're going out dancing
once on the weekend.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.390
Sounds like a pretty balanced
life as I describe it.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:55.223
Well, here's the problem.

01:02:56.110 --> 01:03:00.350
The problem is that
dopamine is not just evoked

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.560
by one of these activities,

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.330
dopamine is evoked by
all of these activities.

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:08.930
And dopamine is one currency
of craving motivation

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:11.280
and desire and pleasure.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.500
There's only one currency.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.780
So even though if you
look at the activities,

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.520
you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.883
so this thing is only a
couple of times a week.

01:03:20.883 --> 01:03:23.900
If you looked at dopamine
simply as a function,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.970
as a chemical function
of peaks and baseline,

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.520
it might make sense why this person

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.500
after several years of
work hard, play hard

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.070
would say, yeah, you know I'm
feeling kind of burnt out.

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:35.890
I'm just not feeling like
I have the same energy

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.380
that I did a few years ago.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.310
And of course there
are age-related reasons

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:42.450
why people can experience drops in energy,

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.250
but oftentimes what's happening

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:48.140
is not some sort of depletion
and cellar metabolism

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.120
that's related to aging.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.460
What's happening is they're
spiking their dopamine

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.810
through so many different
activities throughout the week,

01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:57.260
that their baseline is
progressively dropping.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.570
And in this case it can be very subtle.

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:00.930
It can be very, very subtle.

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:05.930
And that's actually a very
sinister function of dopamine

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.193
we could say.

01:04:07.193 --> 01:04:10.780
Which is that it can often
drop in imperceptible ways,

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:15.370
but then at once it reaches
a threshold of low dopamine,

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.310
we just feel like,

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.640
hmm, we can't really get
pleasure from anything anymore.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.490
What used to work doesn't work anymore.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.120
So it starts to look a lot
like the more severe addictions

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.030
or the more acute addictions
to things like cocaine

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.420
and amphetamine which lead
to these big increases,

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.650
these big spikes in dopamine,

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:33.410
and then these very severe
drops in the baseline.

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:37.030
Now, of course, we all
should engage in activities

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.290
that we enjoy.

01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:39.130
I certainly do,

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:39.963
everybody should.

01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:42.763
A huge part of life is
pursuing activities and things

01:04:42.763 --> 01:04:44.720
that we enjoy.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.260
The key thing is to
understand this relationship

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.670
between the peaks and the baseline,

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:50.970
and to understand how they
influence one another.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.340
Because once you do that,

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.360
you can start to make really
good choices in the short run

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.660
and in the long run to
maintain your level of dopamine

01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.890
baseline.

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:02.900
Maybe even raise that
level of dopamine baseline

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.290
and still get those peaks and
still achieve those feelings

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:10.040
of elevated motivation,
elevated desire and craving.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.030
Because again, those peaks
and having a sufficiently

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.740
healthy high level of dopamine baseline

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.468
are what drove the
evolution of our species,

01:05:19.468 --> 01:05:21.900
and they're really what drive
the evolution of anyone's life

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.800
progression too.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.633
So they're a good thing.

01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:25.430
Dopamine is a good thing.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:27.550
Just very briefly, because
it was also covered

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.980
in the interview episode
I did with Anna Lembke

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.500
about addiction.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.190
Some of you might be asking,

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.660
what should I do if I experience a drop

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.850
in my baseline level of dopamine

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.880
because of engagement with
some activity or some substance

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.133
that led to big peaks?

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.130
Just to put some color
and example on this,

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:50.980
a few episodes ago I talked about a friend

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.400
who I've known a long time.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.940
So it actually the child of a friend

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.560
who has basically become
addicted to video games,

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.240
he decided actually after
seeing that episode with Anna

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.430
to do a 30-day complete fast from phone,

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:07.500
from video games and from
social media of all kinds.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.060
He's now at day 29 has
really accomplished this,

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.430
not incidentally, his
levels of concentration,

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:14.570
his overall mood are up.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.920
He's doing far far better.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.130
What he did is hard.

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:20.640
In particular first 14
days is really hard,

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.960
but the way that you
replenish the releasable pool

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.640
of dopamine is to not
engage in these dopaminergic

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.120
seeking behaviors.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.880
Because remember typically
people arrive at a place

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.120
where they want to stop
engaging in these behaviors

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.170
or ingesting substances when
that dopamine is depleted,

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:38.700
when they're not getting the same lift.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.270
In his case, he was feeling depressed.

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.580
He thought he had ADHD.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.530
They were starting to treat it as ADHD.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.200
And certainly there are people
out there who have ADHD,

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.360
but what he found was that
his levels of concentration

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.193
are back.

01:06:50.193 --> 01:06:52.377
He does not need to be treated for ADHD.

01:06:52.377 --> 01:06:55.140
And actually the psychiatrist
wondered if he did prior

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.070
to this video game, social media fast.

01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:58.920
He's feeling good.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.530
He's exercising again.

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:01.610
I'm not making this up.

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:04.900
This is really a very specific,

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.470
but very relevant example
of how the dopamine system

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.690
can replenish itself.

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.220
Of course, if there's a clinical
need for ADHD treatment,

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.740
by all means pursue that.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:19.340
But I think a lot of
ADHD does go misdiagnosed

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.410
because of this depletion in dopamine

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:24.020
that occurs because of
overindulgence in other activities

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.700
in the drop in baseline.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.740
So for anyone that's experienced
a real drop in baseline

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.210
who has addictive tendencies,

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.870
whether or not their
behaviors or substances,

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:37.030
that is always going
to be the path forward.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.920
Is going to be either cold turkey

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.810
or through some sort of
tapering to limit interactions

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:45.830
with the, what would otherwise
be the dopamine evoking

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:47.440
behavior or substance.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.960
So let's talk about the optimal
way to engage in activities

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.720
or to consume things that evoke dopamine.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.940
And by no means am I
encouraging people to take drugs

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.773
of abuse.

01:07:58.773 --> 01:07:59.606
I would not do that,

01:07:59.606 --> 01:08:00.570
I am not doing that.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:03.230
But some of the things on these lists

01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:07.200
of dopamine evoking activities
are things like chocolate,

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.523
coffee, even if it's indirect.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.980
Sex and reproduction,

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:15.130
provided it's healthy
consensual context appropriate,

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:17.510
age appropriate, species
appropriate of course,

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:21.860
is central to our evolution
and progression as a species.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.800
So certain things like
cocaine, amphetamine,

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.900
I will put in the classification of bad.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.760
I'm willing to do that.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.730
And other things are part of life,

01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:32.610
food, exercise if that
evokes your dopamine.

01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:35.650
How are we supposed to engage
with these dopamine evoking

01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:38.560
activities in ways that are
healthy and beneficial for us?

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.280
How do we achieve these peaks,

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.060
which are so central to our
wellbeing and experience of life

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.070
without dropping our baseline?

01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:50.070
And the key lies in intermittent
release of dopamine.

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:55.290
The real key is to not
expect or chase high levels

01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:58.800
of dopamine release every time we engage

01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.993
in these activities.

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:05.210
Intermittent reward schedules
are the central schedule

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:08.830
by which casinos keep you gambling.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:12.380
The central schedule by
which elusive partners

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.250
or potential partners keep
you texting and pursuing

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.830
on either side of the relationship.

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:22.080
Intermittent schedules are
the way that the internet

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.080
and social media and all
highly engaging activities

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.420
keep you motivated and pursuing.

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:35.380
And we can take this back
to our evolutionary adaptive

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.410
scenario where you are out
there looking for water,

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:40.040
looking for food,

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.330
not every trail, not every
pursuit, not every hunch

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.700
about where the animals will be?

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.840
Where the food will be?

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.820
Where the berries will be?

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.903
Not every single one of those played out.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.600
There's something called
dopamine reward prediction error.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.920
When we expect something to happen,

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.943
we are highly motivated to pursue it.

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:04.750
If it happens great, we get the reward.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:06.680
The reward comes in various chemical forms

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.897
including dopamine,

01:10:07.897 --> 01:10:11.060
and we are more likely to
engage in that behavior again.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.610
This is the basis of casino gambling.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:14.870
This is how they keep you going back

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:15.980
again and again and again,

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.093
even though on average
the house really does win.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.270
You can transplant that
example to any number

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:24.700
of different pleasureful activities.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.170
If you're not a gambler and
that doesn't appeal to you,

01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:29.380
I have to imagine there's
something that appeals to you,

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.970
something that you do
repeatedly because you enjoy it.

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:35.450
And almost inevitably it's
because there's an intermittent

01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:36.283
schedule.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.040
There's a intermittent
schedule by which dopamine

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.250
sometimes arrives,

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:43.370
sometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot,

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:44.960
sometimes a medium amount.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.920
Okay?

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.250
That intermittent reinforcement schedule

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:53.250
is actually the best schedule
to export to other activities.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.970
How do you do that?

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:59.510
Well, first of all, if you
are engaged in activities

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:01.800
school, sport, relationship, et cetera,

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.150
where you experience a win,

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:06.870
you should be very careful
about allowing yourself

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:09.140
to experience huge peaks in dopamine,

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.550
unless you're willing to
suffer the crash that follows

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.090
and waiting a period of
time for it to come back up.

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:19.010
What would this look like
in the practical sense?

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:20.240
Well, let's say you are somebody

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.400
who really does enjoy exercise,

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.680
or let's say you're somebody
who kind of likes exercise,

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.310
but forces yourself to do it,

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.560
but you make it pleasureful
by giving yourself

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.500
your favorite cup of coffee first,

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.550
or maybe taking a pre-workout drink

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:34.160
or taking an energy drink

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.690
or listening to your favorite music.

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.610
And then you're in the gym

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:37.480
and you're listening to your music.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.120
That all sounds great, right?

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.300
Well, it is great except
that by layering together

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.840
all these things to try and
achieve that dopamine release,

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.820
and by getting a big peak in dopamine,

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.950
you're actually increasing the
number of conditions required

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:53.590
to achieve pleasure from
that activity again.

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:56.730
And so there is a form
of this where sometimes

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.240
you do all the things that you love

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.380
to get the optimal workout.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.900
You listen to your favorite music,

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.640
you got your favorite time of day,

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.860
you have your pre-workout drink,

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:04.693
if that's your thing.

01:12:04.693 --> 01:12:08.310
You do all the things that
give you that best experience

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:09.893
of the workout for you.

01:12:10.955 --> 01:12:13.730
But there's also a version
of this where sometimes

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:17.220
you don't do the dopamine
enhancing activities.

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.890
You don't ingest anything
to increase your dopamine.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.830
You just do the exercise.

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:27.420
You don't do the exercise
and expect dopamine to arrive

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.277
through some what we call
exogenous source as well.

01:12:30.277 --> 01:12:31.900
You might think, well, that sounds lame.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:35.030
I want to continue to enjoy exercising.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:36.873
Ah, well, that's exactly the point.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:40.630
If you want to maintain
motivation for school, exercise,

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:44.160
relationships or pursuits
of any duration in kind,

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.770
the key thing is to make sure
that the peak in dopamine,

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:50.453
if it's very high,
doesn't occur too often.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.420
And if something does occur very often

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.870
that you vary how much
dopamine you experience

01:12:57.910 --> 01:13:00.300
with each engagement in that activity.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.370
Now, some activities naturally
have this intermittent

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:05.290
property woven into them, right?

01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:07.717
We sometimes have classes that we like

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.410
and other classes we don't like.

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.410
We don't always get straight A's,

01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:13.860
sometimes we don't get
rewarded with the outcome

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.760
that we would like.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.030
We don't always have the
perfect relationship outcome,

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.470
but understand that your
ability to experience motivation

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.550
and pleasure for what comes next

01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:26.000
is dictated by how much
motivation and pleasure

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.283
and dopamine you experienced prior.

01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:32.450
The reason I can't give
a very specific protocol

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:36.070
like delete dopamine or lower
dopamine every third time,

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:38.240
is that that wouldn't be intermittent.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.740
The whole basis of
intermittent reinforcement

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.500
is that you don't really
have a specific schedule

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.640
of when dopamine is going to be high,

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.050
and when dopamine is going to be low

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.880
and when dopamine is going to be medium.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.360
That's a predictable schedule,

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.950
not a random intermittent schedule.

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:57.200
So do like the casinos do
certainly works for them

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.640
and for activities that you
would like to continue to engage

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.840
in over time,

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.010
whatever those happen to be.

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:07.150
Start paying attention
to the amount of dopamine

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:09.370
and excitement and pleasure
that you achieve with those,

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:12.010
and start modulating
that somewhat at random.

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.090
That might be removing
some of the dopamine

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:18.130
releasing chemicals that
you might take prior.

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:21.060
Maybe you remove them every time,

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.590
but then every once in a
while you introduce them,.

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.490
Maybe it involves sometimes
doing things socially

01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:28.620
that you enjoy doing socially,

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:30.803
sometimes doing the same thing, but alone.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.230
There are a lot of
different ways to do this.

01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:36.270
There are a lot of different
ways to approach this,

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:39.610
but now knowing what you know
about peaks and baselines

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:42.380
in dopamine and
understanding how important

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.980
it is not just to achieve peaks,

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.410
but to maintain that
baseline at a healthy level,

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:48.520
it should be straightforward
for you to implement

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.993
these intermittent schedules.

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.360
For those of you that are
begging for more specificity,

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.760
we can give you a tool.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.300
One would be, you can flip
a coin before engaging

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.780
in any of these types of activities

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.797
and decide whether or not
you are going to allow

01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:07.600
other dopamine supportive elements

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.560
to go for instance, into the gym with you.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.030
Are you going to listen to music or not?

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:12.630
If you enjoy listening to music,

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:13.650
well then flip a coin,

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:14.720
and if it comes up heads,

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.553
bring the music in,

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.120
if it comes up tails, don't.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:17.953
Okay?

01:15:17.953 --> 01:15:19.980
It sounds like you're
undercutting your own progress,

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:23.080
but actually you are
serving your own progress

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.780
both short-term and
long-term by doing that.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.622
Now, the smartphone is
a very interesting tool

01:15:28.622 --> 01:15:30.993
for dopamine in light of all this.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.200
It's extremely common
nowadays to see people texting

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.240
and doing selfies and
communicating in various ways,

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.700
listening to podcasts, listening to music,

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.650
doing all sorts of
things while they engage

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:45.300
in other activities or going to dinner

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.870
and texting other people or making plans,

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:48.830
sharing information.

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:49.690
That's all wonderful,

01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:52.600
it gives depth and
richness and color to life,

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.940
but it isn't just about
our distracted nature

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.480
when we're engaging with the phone,

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.350
it's also a way of layering in dopamine.

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:06.700
And it's no surprise
that levels of depression

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.703
and lack of motivation are
really on the increase.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:13.410
Everything that we've
talked about until now

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.590
sets up an explanation or interpretation

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:21.250
of why interacting with digital technology

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.460
can potentially lead to disruptions

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:27.013
or lowering in baseline
levels of dopamine.

01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:30.650
I can use a personal example for this.

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.250
I happen to really enjoy working out,

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:33.950
I've always really enjoyed it.

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:37.440
But in recent years I noticed that,

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.820
if I was bringing my phone to my workouts,

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.020
then not only was I a
little bit more distracted

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.620
and not focusing on what I was doing

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.840
as much as I could have or should have,

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.430
but also I started to lose
interest in what I was doing.

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:50.870
It wasn't as pleasureful,

01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:53.100
I would feel like it
just didn't have the same

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:53.933
kind of oomph.

01:16:53.933 --> 01:16:55.763
And I was beginning to
question my motivation.

01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:59.680
As I started learning more
about this relationship

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.050
between the peaks and the
bass lines in dopamine.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.420
What I realized was that some time ago

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.600
I probably experienced
a incredible increase

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.940
in the amount of dopamine
during one of my workouts,

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:13.810
because I enjoy working out
and I enjoy listening to music.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:15.320
I also enjoy listening to podcasts,

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.400
I also enjoy communicating with people.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.730
Those are all wonderful pursuits,

01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:22.410
but I had layered in too
many of them too many times.

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:25.960
And then it essentially
wasn't working for me anymore.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.170
Much in the same way a drug
wouldn't work for somebody

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:30.490
who takes it repeatedly because
their baseline of dopamine

01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:31.560
is dropping.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.890
So at least for this calendar year,

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:35.430
I've made a rule for myself,

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:40.430
which is I don't allow my
phone into my workouts at all.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.610
No music, at least not from the phone.

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:43.710
It can be in the room.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.960
I might listen to a podcast in the room,

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.100
but I don't listen to anything

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.560
or engage in anything on my phone.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.490
No texting whatsoever.

01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:53.490
And most of the time I just
don't even bring it with me

01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:54.520
for that period of time.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.380
It's only a short period of time.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.023
I'm not training that often.

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:03.980
This is something that I
think has been misinterpreted

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.430
as people can't be alone now.

01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:07.920
People talk about, oh, you know,

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.000
they can't walk across the
street or they can't go anywhere,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.360
ride the bus,

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.760
can't be on the plane
without being in contact.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.410
They can't handle just their thoughts.

01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:19.160
I don't think that's
really what's going on.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.400
I think what's happened
is that we achieved

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.820
the great dopamine increase

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.560
that comes from this incredible thing

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.160
which I personally enjoy being
able to communicate by phone,

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.410
by text and exchange
pictures and send links

01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:33.540
and these kinds of things, social media.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.720
But then what happens is
it doesn't have that same

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.660
fulfilling aspect to it.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.290
And it tends to remove the excitement

01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.000
and the pleasure of the very activities

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.690
that we are engaged in.

01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:46.900
So I know this is a hard
one for many people,

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:51.130
but I do invite you to
try removing multiple

01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:52.870
sources of dopamine release

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:56.140
or what used to be multiple
sources of dopamine release

01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.980
from activities that you
want to continue to enjoy,

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:00.850
or that you want to enjoy more.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:03.040
And now you understand
the biological mechanisms

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.437
that would underlie a statement like that.

01:19:05.437 --> 01:19:07.850
It takes a little bit of working with,

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.370
I know it can be challenging
in the first week

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.760
or so of not engaging with the phone

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.200
during any kind of workout.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.060
That actually was really tough,

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.000
but now I'm back to a place
where I enjoy it that much more.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.590
I also feel as if I conquered something

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.330
in terms of the circuitry
related to dopamine.

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:25.790
I now understand why something

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:29.450
that I enjoyed so much had
become less pleasureful for me.

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:31.610
And there's a deep, deep satisfaction

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:32.590
that comes from understanding,

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:34.670
okay, there wasn't anything wrong with me

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:38.470
or what I was doing or anything at all.

01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:40.760
It was just there was something
wrong with the approach

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.593
I was taking,

01:19:41.593 --> 01:19:43.680
which was layering in all
these sources of dopamine

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.270
and dropping my baseline.

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:46.640
For this very same reason,

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.980
I caution people against
using stimulants every time

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:54.950
they study or every time they work out

01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:57.410
or every time that they do anything

01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:59.090
that they would like to continue to enjoy

01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:00.940
and be motivated at.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.700
There's one exception which is caffeine,

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.800
because as I mentioned before,

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.710
if you like caffeine,

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:07.760
that actually could be a good thing

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.690
for your dopamine system,

01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:11.790
because it does upregulate
these D2, D3 receptors.

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:13.880
So it actually makes whatever dopamine

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.200
is released by that activity,

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.900
more accessible or more
functional within the biochemistry

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.983
and the pathways of your brain and body.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.940
However, a number of energy drinks

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.450
and particular pre-workouts contain things

01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:30.450
that are precursors to dopamine,

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:33.830
and on their own, even if you
didn't engage in the activity

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:36.750
would cause the release of
dopamine to a substantial degree.

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.490
They do cause the release of dopamine

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.110
to a substantial degree.

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.123
And over time that will
deplete your dopamine.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.340
So energy drinks, pre-workout drinks,

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:51.320
drugs of various kinds
that people take to study

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.153
and pay attention.

01:20:52.153 --> 01:20:54.090
We talked about some of
these for the ADHD episode,

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:57.090
things like Adderall, Ritalin,
armodafinil or modafinil

01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:01.646
taken repeatedly over time will reduce

01:21:01.646 --> 01:21:03.670
the level of satisfaction and joy

01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:05.190
that you get from the activities

01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:10.070
you engage in while under the
influence of those compounds.

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:11.870
I'm not trying to demonize those compounds

01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:13.050
for their clinical use.

01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:14.930
What I'm saying is taking stimulants

01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:16.660
and then engaging in activities

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.250
that you would like to
continue to feel pleasureful

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.960
is undercutting the process.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.710
And inevitably might not happen tomorrow,

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:24.940
might not happen in a month,

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:27.970
but inevitably you will have
challenges with motivation

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:30.510
and drive related to those activities.

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:32.260
Now, some people can
keep it right in check.

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.760
They can just do the one
can have the energy drink

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.410
or they only do their pre-workout
before really hard days,

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:39.960
for instance.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.033
More power to you.

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:44.770
I actually do that sometimes, frankly.

01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:47.450
But people who are trying
to get into that peak

01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:49.680
super motivated, driven, driven state,

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.910
really focused every time
they engage in an activity,

01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:55.320
you are absolutely
undercutting the process

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.800
and you are undermining your
ability to stay motivated

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.930
and focused.

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:03.000
So just as we talked about
intermittent reward schedules

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.853
a moment ago,

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:09.000
intermittent spiking of
dopamine if you do it at all

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.310
is definitely the way to go,

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:13.030
and chronically trying
to spike your dopamine

01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:15.950
in order to enhance your
motivation, focus and drive

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:19.430
will absolutely undermine your
motivation focus and drive

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:20.500
in the long run.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.800
Ingestion of caffeine is
somewhat of an exception

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.540
among the other examples of things

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.010
I've mentioned to avoid before

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:32.290
what would otherwise be
dopamine increasing activities.

01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:37.290
Because again, caffeine
can increase the density

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.323
and the efficacy of
these dopamine receptors.

01:22:41.715 --> 01:22:45.180
It turns out that the source
of caffeine could also matter

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.910
while coffee or tea or
other forms of caffeine

01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:51.723
will have this effect of
increasing dopamine receptors.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.400
Yerba mate something
I've talked about before

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:58.210
on this podcast has some
interesting properties.

01:22:58.210 --> 01:22:59.940
First of all, it contains caffeine.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.040
It's also high in antioxidants.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.690
It also contains something called GLP-1

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:07.813
which is favorable for
management of blood sugar levels.

01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:13.030
Yerba mate turns out has also been shown

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:17.980
to be neuroprotective specifically
for dopaminergic neurons.

01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.150
Now, I should mention this
is just a couple of studies,

01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:23.060
so we don't want to conclude
too much from these studies

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.500
more needs to be done.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.830
But they showed that in a model of damage

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:31.331
to dopamine neurons,
ingestion of yerba mate,

01:23:31.331 --> 01:23:33.330
and some of the compounds
within yerba mate

01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:35.820
can actually serve to
preserve the survival

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:38.927
of dopamine neurons in both
the movement related pathway

01:23:38.927 --> 01:23:41.290
and the motivation pathway.

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:44.150
So perhaps you need that incentive

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:46.200
in order to ingest your yerba mate,

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.260
perhaps you don't need any incentive.

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:49.770
In my case, I don't need any incentive.

01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:52.170
I already enjoy yerba mate as my principle

01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:53.260
source of caffeine,

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.140
although I do drink coffee as well.

01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:57.900
But if one were going to consume caffeine,

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.170
you might consider consuming that caffeine

01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.870
in the form of yerba mate
both for sake of upregulating

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:07.840
dopamine receptors and getting
more of a dopamine increase.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.430
And of course, for the
similar properties of caffeine

01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:12.550
if that's what you're seeking.

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.020
And in addition to that,

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.190
because your yerba mate does appear

01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:18.560
to have some sort of neuroprotective

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.130
and a particular dopamine
neuron protective properties.

01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:24.580
Now, that doesn't mean that
caffeine is always beneficial.

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.580
And actually there's one
instance related to dopamine

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.760
where caffeine can be
particularly dangerous.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.370
And this relates to
MDMA so-called ecstasy.

01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:37.490
MDMA is under investigation
in various clinical trials

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:40.363
for its potential to treat
trauma and depression.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.790
It's also of course, a drug
that's used recreationally.

01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:47.623
It's still illegal at
least in the United States.

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:52.640
Whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.860
has been very controversial.

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.280
Early on it was thought
that it is neurotoxic

01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.923
that it can destroy serotonergic neurons.

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.720
There were other papers that came out

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.570
which argued that's not the case.

01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:07.700
And that's in particular
because one of the early papers

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.490
published in science magazine claiming

01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:12.263
that MDMA was neurotoxic.

01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:14.740
That paper was retracted.

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.450
It turns out that that
study had mistakenly

01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:19.530
used methamphetamine instead,

01:25:19.530 --> 01:25:21.903
and methamphetamine is
known to be neurotoxic.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.470
I think most of the data point to the idea

01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:28.030
that MDMA might not be neurotoxic,

01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:32.310
but in any case, caffeine
has been shown to increase

01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:34.630
the toxicity of MDMA receptors.

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.470
And you might say, "Well,
how could that be?"

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:39.090
Well, now you understand
why that could be.

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.500
Caffeine increases the
density and efficacy

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.320
of these dopamine receptors,
D2 and D3 receptors.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.320
MDMA is a potent drug for
increasing concentrations

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.850
of dopamine as well as serotonin
and other neuromodulators.

01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:57.200
And it appears that caffeine
ingestion by upregulating

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.270
these receptors,

01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:02.450
can lead to more toxicity of MDMA.

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:06.770
So caffeine can be a beneficial
substance in one context,

01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:08.850
and actually can be a detrimental

01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:11.970
if not dangerous substance
in another context.

01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:14.710
Two substances that
greatly increase dopamine,

01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:19.710
namely amphetamine and cocaine
can cause long-term problems

01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:22.580
with the dopaminergic pathways.

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.850
And this is largely based on a study

01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:27.880
that was published some years ago, 2003,

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.850
but still holds a lot of merit.

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:31.850
This is a paper published in proceeds

01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:33.280
in the National Academy of Sciences,

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.970
a very high tier stringent journal.

01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:38.940
First author is Kolb, K-O-L-B.

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:42.430
And the title of the paper
pretty much tells the story.

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:45.160
Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.890
of later experience to
promote structural plasticity

01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:49.430
in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.

01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:54.120
Neocortex is the outer shell
of the brain more or less.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.220
And the nucleus accumbens is part of that,

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:59.950
mesolimbic dopamine pathway
for motivation drive

01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:01.440
and reinforcement.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.220
Neuroplasticity of course, is
the brain's ability to change

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.250
in response to experience.

01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:09.640
And neuroplasticity is the
basis of learning and memory

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.430
and essentially remodeling
of our neural circuitry

01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:15.450
in positive ways of all kinds.

01:27:15.450 --> 01:27:18.830
And this study was really
one of the first to show

01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:21.770
that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:25.420
because of the high peak in dopamine

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:28.030
that it creates and
the low dopamine state,

01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:31.770
the baseline drop that
it creates afterwards,

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:34.250
limits plasticity and learning subsequent

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:36.370
to taking amphetamine and cocaine.

01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:38.880
It was at least in this study shown

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.410
to be a long lasting effect.

01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:41.890
I doubt it's a permanent effect,

01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:45.300
but this should serve as
a serious cautionary note

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:48.630
that amphetamine and cocaine
not only can cause a drop

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.680
in baseline dopamine,

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.980
but can actually put
the brain into a state

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:55.330
in which it cannot learn and
modify itself to get better

01:27:55.330 --> 01:27:57.330
at least for some period of time.

01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:00.260
In a previous episode on ADHD,

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.790
I talked about the widespread use of drugs

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:05.410
like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil and armodafinil,

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:07.890
all of which lead to very
large increases in dopamine,

01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:12.720
and for people with ADHD can
really improve their symptoms.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.340
But of course there's a
lot of non-prescription,

01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:18.020
non-clinical use of
those compounds as well.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.260
And it stands to reason that
the use of those substances

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:25.020
to increase dopamine
could very well provide

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.170
the same sort of blockade
of neuroplasticity

01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:28.660
that cocaine and amphetamine do.

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.000
Because when you look at the
amount of dopamine increase

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.700
that's triggered by those compounds,

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.360
it's really comparable.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.620
So again, a cautionary note
against spiking one's dopamine

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:41.560
too much on a regular basis,

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.550
unless there's a valid
clinical need for doing that.

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:48.190
So we've been focusing a
lot for the last few minutes

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:50.900
on the kind of darker side of dopamine

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.570
and how getting big peaks in
dopamine can be detrimental,

01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:56.500
but I want to acknowledge the truth,

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:59.100
which is that dopamine feels great.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.870
Being in pursuit and
motivated and craving things

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.350
feels wonderful.

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:05.440
And I don't want to demonize dopamine.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.470
What I'm trying to do
today is to illustrate

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:09.310
how dopamine works in your brain

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:12.150
so that you can continue to engage

01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:15.790
in dopamine evoking activities.

01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:18.172
And certainly there is a
place for ingesting things

01:29:18.172 --> 01:29:21.090
that can increase dopamine
provided that they are safe

01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:23.713
for us in the short and long-term.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.930
There are activities that
we can do that will give us

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:31.640
healthy, sustained increases in dopamine,

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.470
both the peaks when they
happen and to maintain

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.750
or even increase our
baseline levels of dopamine.

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:39.140
So how do we do that?

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.030
What are some of these activities?

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:43.240
Well, in recent years,

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.660
there's been a trend toward more people

01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.670
doing so-called cold exposure.

01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:51.160
In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof,

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:54.010
the so-called 'Iceman'
getting into cold showers,

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:57.400
taking ice baths, exposing
oneself to cold water

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.640
of various kinds can in fact
increase our levels of dopamine

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.333
as well as the neuromodulator
norepinephrine.

01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.113
This is not a new phenomenon.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:12.090
In the 1920s, a guy by the
name of Vincent Priessnitz

01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:15.660
was one of the first people
to popularize and formalize

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.360
cold water therapies.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.245
He was an advocate of cold water exposure

01:30:20.245 --> 01:30:22.910
in order to boost the immune system

01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:24.600
and increase feelings of wellbeing.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.540
And actually this practice dates back long

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:30.120
before Vincent's popularized it.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.370
And Wim Hof is the more
recent iteration of this.

01:30:33.370 --> 01:30:35.260
First of all, some of
the safety parameters.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.640
Let's establish those first.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.220
Getting to very, very cold water.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:39.860
You know, 30 degree Fahrenheit

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:42.150
or even low 40 degree Fahrenheit

01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:44.680
can put somebody into a
state of cold water shock.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.500
I mean, people can die doing that.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.600
So obviously you want to
approach this with some caution,

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.970
but for most people getting
into 60 degree water

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:54.140
or 50 degree water,

01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:57.122
or if you're acclimated
and comfortable with it,

01:30:57.122 --> 01:30:59.734
you know, 40 degree
water or 45 degree water

01:30:59.734 --> 01:31:03.340
can have tremendously beneficial results

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:06.343
on your neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine.

01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:09.740
What temperature of water you can tolerate

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.910
will depend on how cold
water adapted you are,

01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:15.550
and how familiar you
are with the experience

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:17.040
of getting into cold water.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.700
And when I say comfortable with,

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:21.130
I should mention, there is never a case

01:31:21.130 --> 01:31:25.542
in which getting into
cold water does not evoke

01:31:25.542 --> 01:31:27.650
a release of epinephrin.

01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:30.304
So the quickening of the breath,
the widening of the eyes,

01:31:30.304 --> 01:31:32.920
the feeling as if you
can't catch your breath

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.460
and even some physical pain
at the level of the skin

01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.290
that happens almost every time,

01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:39.390
or every time that you
get into cold water,

01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:41.180
even if your cold water adapted.

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:44.500
What almost everybody knows
and understands is that,

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.040
that wall, as I like to
refer to it is coming.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.810
That's always the first experience

01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:50.120
of getting into cold water.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.470
There's no real way around that.

01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:55.380
Now, this study that I mentioned earlier,

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.330
human physiological responses
to immersion into water

01:31:58.330 --> 01:31:59.240
of different temperatures,

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:02.260
really interesting study
that was done and published

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.010
in the university of, excuse me,

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:06.240
the European Journal
of Applied Physiology.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.730
I can provide a link to that
study in the show caption.

01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:11.020
It's a really interesting study.

01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:14.500
They looked at people
getting exposed to water

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.820
that was warm, moderately
cold or very cold.

01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:19.060
It was 32 degrees Celsius,
20 degrees Celsius,

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.150
or 14 degrees Celsius.

01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:23.430
You can just put those
online and do the conversion,

01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:25.780
or you can do the conversion
to Fahrenheit if you like.

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:29.870
But in any case, what they
looked at were the concentrations

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:34.170
of things like epinephrin
and dopamine and so on.

01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:36.410
And what they found
was really interesting.

01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:41.410
First of all, upon
getting into cold water,

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:46.000
the changes in adrenaline
and noradrenaline,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.770
epinephrin and norepinephrine
were immediate and fast,

01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:52.060
and these were huge increases.

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.870
So that's the getting into the cold water

01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:55.210
that everybody experiences

01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:57.320
these huge increases in adrenaline.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.188
But then what was
interesting is they observed

01:32:59.188 --> 01:33:03.210
that dopamine levels started
to rise somewhat slowly

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:06.490
and then continued to
rise and reach levels

01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:10.790
as high as 2.5 times above baseline.

01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:12.790
That's a remarkably high increase.

01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:17.780
Remember if we go back to our
examples of chocolate, sex,

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.210
a doubling above baseline,

01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:23.040
nicotine two and a half times
above baseline, cocaine.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.090
The increase in dopamine
from a cold water exposure

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:31.120
of this kind was comparable
to what one sees from cocaine,

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.950
except, except in this case,

01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:36.640
it wasn't a rise and crash.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.050
It was actually a
sustained rise in dopamine

01:33:40.050 --> 01:33:42.540
that took a very long
time up to three hours

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.320
to come back down to baseline.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.120
Which is really remarkable,

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.720
and I think this explains
some of the positive,

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.969
mental and physical effects
that people report subjectively

01:33:52.969 --> 01:33:55.370
after doing cold water exposure.

01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:57.350
One question that many of
you are probably asking

01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:59.990
is just how cold should the water be?

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:01.710
Well, you could mimic what
was done in this study

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:03.250
and do 14 degrees Celsius.

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:05.300
But for some people that
won't be cold enough,

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.620
for some people that will be too cold.

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.100
They did look at the
release of stress hormones

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.200
like cortisol in addition
to the release of things

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.660
like epinephrin and adrenaline.

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.320
And it's interesting that
they noted that in all cases,

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.210
but especially at that
coldest temperature,

01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:20.670
there was an increase in cortisol,

01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:22.200
but that it was transient,

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.947
That eventually people's cortisol,

01:34:23.947 --> 01:34:26.820
the stress hormone subsided a bit.

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.780
There are basically two
different approaches

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:31.720
to remaining in the cold
when it's uncomfortable.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.230
One is to try and relax yourself.

01:34:34.230 --> 01:34:36.830
Two, try and practice slow breathing,

01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:38.270
to try and dilate your gaze.

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:40.140
I've talked about this
before in previous podcasts,

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:41.810
you go into panoramic
vision to essentially try

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:45.380
and calm yourself so that
it's not as stressful

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.690
in the cold.

01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:51.120
Other people however, take the
approach of trying to ramp up

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.810
their level of internal autonomic arousal,

01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:55.750
meaning to get really energized

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:58.340
and kind of lean into
the friction of the cold.

01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.770
And they find that easier.

01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:01.230
Other people distract themselves,

01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:02.330
they recite the alphabet,

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:05.160
or they do something, anything to try

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.100
and distract themselves
from the discomfort.

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:09.110
To be totally honest,

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:12.070
it does not matter for
sake of dopamine release.

01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:14.110
Because the dopamine release is triggered

01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:17.940
and then continues even after
you get out of the cold water.

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:22.440
Now, in this study, it was
long exposure to cold water.

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.516
It was an hour.

01:35:23.516 --> 01:35:25.610
That's a long period of time.

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.897
And I do warn you against
getting into cold water

01:35:28.897 --> 01:35:32.210
that's so cold that it will
make your temperature drop

01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.830
and make you hyperthermic for an hour.

01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:35.540
That actually could be
dangerous for a lot of people.

01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.000
You might have a hard time reheating,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.570
and hypothermia is not a good thing.

01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:43.010
They had people monitoring
subjects in these studies

01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:45.280
and paying attention to
their core body temperature.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.870
They were able to reheat them afterwards.

01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:51.250
It's well-established now
that getting into cold water,

01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:52.240
whether or not it's a shower,

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.253
an ice bath circulating cold
water, a stream, et cetera,

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.410
that can evoke the norepinephrine
release immediately,

01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:01.620
and the long arc of that dopamine release.

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.720
Why would that be good?

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.630
Up until now, I've basically
said getting increases

01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:09.370
in dopamine are detrimental
to your baseline.

01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:12.440
Well, this does appear to
raise the baseline of dopamine

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.980
for substantial periods of time.

01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:18.920
And most people report feeling
a heightened level of calm

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.100
and focus after getting out of cold water.

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.530
So cold water exposure turns out

01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:26.250
to be a very potent stimulus for shifting

01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:27.360
the entire milieu,

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.560
the entire environment
of our brain and body

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.709
and allowing many people
to feel much, much better

01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:36.800
for a substantial period of time

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.600
after getting out of the ice
bath or cold water of any kind

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.180
than they did before.

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.370
Now, you might ask how often to do this?

01:36:44.370 --> 01:36:46.020
Some people do this every day.

01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:47.300
It can be very stimulating.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.010
So typically doing it early in the day,

01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:50.843
it's going to be better.

01:36:50.843 --> 01:36:53.730
I don't necessarily recommend
doing it right before sleep,

01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:55.630
but some people do it in the afternoon.

01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:58.530
And some people will indeed
do that seven days a week,

01:36:58.530 --> 01:36:59.680
other people three days a week,

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.250
other people every once in a while.

01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:05.330
What I can say is once you
become cold water adapted,

01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:09.150
once it no longer has the
same impact of novelty

01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:10.950
and feeling a bit like a,

01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:12.280
I don't want to say a
shock to your system,

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.790
'cause you don't want to
go into cold water shock,

01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:17.990
but once it is comfortable for you,

01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:20.280
then it will no longer evoke this release.

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.380
There really does seem to
be something in the pathway

01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:25.500
from cold water exposure through
the norepinephrine pathway

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.290
and into the mesolimbic brainstem

01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:29.400
that causes this release in dopamine.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.600
But nonetheless, it's
a basically zero cost.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.420
I mean, you need access
to water of some sort,

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:35.620
cold water shower, et cetera,

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:39.010
but basically zero cost way
of triggering a long lasting

01:37:39.010 --> 01:37:41.050
increase in dopamine
without ingesting anything,

01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:42.810
no pharmacology whatsoever.

01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:46.030
Please again, approach it with
a safety and caution in mind,

01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:47.950
but it is a very potent stimulus.

01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:51.383
Again, 250% of a rise in baseline,

01:37:51.383 --> 01:37:53.930
two and a half times
rise in baseline rivals

01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:56.800
that of cocaine which
is really remarkable.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.980
Now, I'd like to talk
about the positive aspects

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.460
of rewards for our behavior,

01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:03.050
and the negative aspects of
rewards for our behavior.

01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:06.090
And from that, I will suggest a protocol

01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:09.240
by which you can achieve
a better relationship

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.090
to your activities and
to your dopamine system.

01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:14.530
In fact, it will help tune
up your dopamine system

01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:18.293
for discipline, hard work and motivation.

01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:22.600
Hard work is hard.

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.050
Generally, most people
don't like working hard.

01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:27.060
Some people do,

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:31.403
but most people work hard in
order to achieve some end goal.

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.950
End goals are terrific
and rewards are terrific

01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:38.833
whether or not they are
monetary social or any kind.

01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:43.870
However, because of the
way that dopamine relates

01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:45.513
to our perception of time,

01:38:46.468 --> 01:38:50.550
working hard at something
for sake of a reward

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:52.350
that comes afterward,

01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:55.740
can make the hard work
much more challenging

01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:58.880
and make us much less likely
to lean into hard work

01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.870
in the future.

01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:02.490
Let me give you a couple
examples by way of data

01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:03.870
and experiments.

01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:07.670
There's a classic experiment
done actually at Stanford

01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:12.020
many years ago in which
children in nursery school

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.870
and kindergarten drew pictures,

01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:17.730
and they drew pictures
cause they like to draw.

01:39:17.730 --> 01:39:20.690
The researchers took
kids that liked to draw

01:39:20.690 --> 01:39:23.580
and they started giving
them a reward for drawing.

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.610
The reward generally was a gold star

01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:28.993
or some thing that a young
child would find rewarding.

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.520
Then they stopped giving
them the gold star.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.700
And what they found is the children

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:40.700
had a much lower tendency
to draw on their own.

01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:42.150
No reward.

01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:44.330
Now, remember this was an activity

01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:46.490
that prior to receiving a reward,

01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:50.503
the children intrinsically
enjoyed and selected to do.

01:39:50.503 --> 01:39:52.529
No one was telling them to draw.

01:39:52.529 --> 01:39:54.560
What this relates to
is so-called intrinsic

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.290
versus extrinsic reinforcement.

01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:58.840
When we receive rewards,

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:02.010
even if we give ourselves
rewards for something,

01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:05.520
we tend to associate less
pleasure with the actual activity

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.990
itself that evoked the reward.

01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:09.470
Now, that might seem counterintuitive,

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:10.700
but that's just way that the way

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.290
that these dopaminergic circuits work.

01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:16.670
And now understanding these
peaks in baselines in dopamine

01:40:16.670 --> 01:40:18.670
which I won't review again,

01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:20.340
this should make sense.

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.310
If you get a peak in
dopamine from a reward,

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:25.780
it's going to lower your baseline

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.090
and the cognitive interpretation

01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:31.570
is that you didn't really do the activity

01:40:31.570 --> 01:40:32.810
because you enjoyed the activity.

01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:34.450
You did it for the reward.

01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:37.360
Now, this doesn't mean all
rewards of all kinds are bad,

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.790
but it's also important to understand

01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:42.820
that dopamine controls
our perception of time.

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.240
When and how much dopamine we experience

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.200
is the way that we carve up

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.580
what we call our experience of time.

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.170
When we engage in an activity,

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:55.030
let's say school or hard work of any kind

01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:58.240
or exercise because of the reward

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.310
we are going to give ourselves
a receive at the end,

01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:05.310
the trophy, the sundae, the
meal, whatever it happens to be.

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:10.540
We actually are extending the time bin

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:15.540
over which we are analyzing
or perceiving that experience.

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:19.400
And because the reward comes at the end,

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:22.860
we start to dissociate the neural circuits

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:26.390
for dopamine reward that would
have normally been active

01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:28.620
during the activity.

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:32.920
And because it all arrives
at the end over time,

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.840
we have the experience
of less and less pleasure

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.220
from that particular activity
while we're doing it.

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:43.160
Now, this is the antithesis
of growth mindset.

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.830
My colleague at Stanford, Carol
Dweck, as many of you know,

01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:49.080
has come up with this
incredible theory and principle,

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.970
and actually goes beyond
theory and principle

01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:52.020
called "Growth Mindset",

01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:55.170
which is this striving to be
better to be in this mindset

01:41:55.170 --> 01:41:56.790
of I'm not there yet,

01:41:56.790 --> 01:42:00.930
but striving itself is the end goal.

01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:03.360
And that of course delivers
you to tremendous performance.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.190
It's been observed over
and over and over again,

01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:06.610
that people that have growth mindset,

01:42:06.610 --> 01:42:09.470
kids that have growth mindset
end up performing very well

01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:11.690
because they're focused
on the effort itself.

01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:15.570
And all of us can
cultivate growth mindset.

01:42:15.570 --> 01:42:18.200
The neural mechanism of
cultivating growth mindset

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:22.650
involves learning to access
the rewards from effort

01:42:22.650 --> 01:42:23.810
and doing.

01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:27.910
And that's hard to do
because you have to engage

01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:30.390
this prefrontal component
of the mesolimbic circuit.

01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:33.700
You have to tell yourself,
okay, this effort is great,

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:35.220
this effort is pleasureful.

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.800
Even though you might
actually be in a state

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.460
of physical pain from the exercise,

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.140
or I can recall this from college,

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.280
just feeling like I wanted
to get up from my desk,

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.690
but forcing myself to study,

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:45.180
forcing myself and forcing myself.

01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:48.450
What you find over time is
that you can start to associate

01:42:48.450 --> 01:42:49.410
a dopamine release.

01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:53.070
You can evoke dopamine
release from the friction

01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:55.850
and the challenge that
you happen to be in.

01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:59.610
You completely eliminate
the ability to generate

01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:02.850
those circuits and the
rewarding process of being able

01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:06.080
to reward friction while in effort,

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:09.580
if you are focused only on the
goal that comes at the end.

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:12.540
Because of the way that
dopamine marks time.

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:15.460
So if you say, oh, I'm going
to do this very hard thing,

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.380
and I'm going to push and
push and push and push

01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:19.473
for that end goal that comes later.

01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:25.020
Not only do you enjoy the process
of what you're doing less,

01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:27.090
you actually make it more painful

01:43:27.090 --> 01:43:28.560
while you're engaging in it.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.320
You make yourself less efficient at it,

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.540
because if you were able to
access dopamine while in effort,

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.390
dopamine has all these
incredible properties

01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:37.980
of increasing the amount
of energy in our body,

01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:39.910
and in our mind, our ability to focus

01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:43.250
by way of dopamines
conversion into epinephrin.

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:47.290
But also you're undermining
your ability to lean back

01:43:47.290 --> 01:43:48.580
into that activity the next time.

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.520
The next time you need
twice as much coffee

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.720
and three times as much loud music,

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.750
and four times as much energy drink

01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:58.400
and the social connection
just to get out the door

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.770
in order to do the run or to study.

01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:04.830
So what's more beneficial
in fact can serve

01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:07.680
as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.400
that you engage in.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.760
Especially hard endeavors is to A,

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.690
not start layering in
other sources of dopamine

01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:17.530
in order to get to the starting line,

01:44:17.530 --> 01:44:19.990
not layering in other sources of dopamine

01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:21.250
in order to be able to continue,

01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:24.640
but rather to subjectively start to attach

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:27.550
the feeling of friction and effort

01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:30.360
to an internally generated reward system.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.410
And this is not meant to be vague,

01:44:32.410 --> 01:44:35.160
this is a system that exists in your mind,

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.040
that exists in the minds of humans

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.940
for hundreds of thousands of years,

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.780
by which you're not
just pursuing the things

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.770
that are innately pleasureful,

01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:47.900
food, sex, warmth, water
when you're thirsty.

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:51.220
But the beauty of this
mesolimbic reward pathway

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.240
that I talked about earlier is that,

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.420
it includes the forebrain.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:59.270
So you can tell yourself the
effort part is the good part.

01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:00.110
I know it's painful,

01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:01.300
I know this doesn't feel good,

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:02.430
but I'm focused on this.

01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:04.990
I'm going to start to access the reward.

01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:07.041
You will find the rewards,

01:45:07.041 --> 01:45:10.090
meaning the dopamine
release inside of effort

01:45:10.090 --> 01:45:11.788
if you repeat this over and over again.

01:45:11.788 --> 01:45:14.040
And what's beautiful about it is that,

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.470
it starts to become reflexive
for all types of effort.

01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:19.320
When we focus only on the trophy,

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.320
only on the grade,

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:23.000
only on the win as the reward,

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.550
you undermine that entire process.

01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:27.440
So how do you do this?

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.470
You do this in those moments
of the most intense friction.

01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:34.670
You tell yourself this is very painful

01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.950
and because it's painful,

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:40.630
it will evoke an increase
in dopamine release later,

01:45:40.630 --> 01:45:43.950
meaning it will increase
my baseline in dopamine,

01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:46.580
but you also have to tell yourself

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.490
that in that moment you
are doing it by choice

01:45:50.490 --> 01:45:53.680
and you're doing it because you love it.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.120
And I know that sounds
like lying to yourself,

01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:58.430
and in some ways it is lying to yourself,

01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:01.310
but it's lying to yourself
in the context of a truth

01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:05.070
which is that you want it to feel better.

01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:07.820
You want it to feel even pleasureful.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.850
Now, this is very far and away different

01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:14.330
from thinking about the
reward that comes at the end,

01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:17.040
the hot fudge sundae for after
you cross the finish line

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:18.370
and you can replace hot fudge sundae

01:46:18.370 --> 01:46:22.030
with whatever reward happens
to be appealing to you.

01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:24.010
We revere people who are capable of doing

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.840
what I'm describing.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.090
David Goggins comes to mind
is a really good example.

01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:30.220
Many of you are probably
familiar with David Goggins,

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:32.670
former Navy SEAL who essentially

01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:37.670
has made a post-military
career out of explaining

01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:40.950
and sharing his process
of turning the effort

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:42.670
into the reward.

01:46:42.670 --> 01:46:45.320
There are many other examples
of this too, of course.

01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:48.770
Throughout evolutionary history,

01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:50.630
there's no question that we revered people

01:46:50.630 --> 01:46:53.970
who were willing to go out
and forage and hunt and gather

01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:57.940
and caretake in ways that other members

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.290
of our species probably found exhausting

01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:02.770
and probably would have preferred
to just put their feet up

01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:04.060
or soaked them in a cool stream

01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:06.100
rather than continue to forage.

01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:09.780
The ability to access
this pleasure from effort

01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:13.360
aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:17.407
is without question the most
powerful aspect of dopamine

01:47:17.407 --> 01:47:19.570
and our biology of dopamine.

01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:23.070
And the beautiful thing is
it's accessible to all of us.

01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:25.990
But just to highlight the
things that can interfere with,

01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:29.940
and prevent you from
getting dopamine release

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.170
from effort itself,

01:47:32.170 --> 01:47:35.559
don't spike dopamine prior
to engaging in effort.

01:47:35.559 --> 01:47:39.470
And don't spike dopamine
after engaging in effort,

01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:43.020
learn to spike your
dopamine from effort itself.

01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:46.640
One straightforward example
of learning to attach dopamine

01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:51.870
to effort and strain
as opposed to a process

01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:55.290
or a reward that naturally
evokes dopamine release

01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:57.150
is so-called intermittent fasting.

01:47:57.150 --> 01:47:59.540
I know this is very popular nowadays.

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.190
Some people like to do
intermittent fasting,

01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:02.350
some people don't.

01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:05.200
Some people have a 12 hour
feeding window every 24 hours,

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.300
some people do long fasts
of two to three days even.

01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:11.600
I personally don't
monitor a feeding window

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:12.690
with a lot of precision.

01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:14.080
I tend to skip one meal a day,

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.400
either breakfast or lunch,

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:16.890
and then I eat the other
two meals of the day

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.160
depending on which meal I skipped.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.780
So it's either breakfast, lunch

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:22.320
and maybe a little
something in the evening,

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.730
or I'll skip breakfast and do
lunch and dinner and so on.

01:48:25.730 --> 01:48:28.800
Many people are now
eating this way in part,

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.950
because many people find
it easier to not eat at all

01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:36.020
than to eat a smaller
portion of some food.

01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:39.380
And that has everything to
do with the dopamine reward

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:42.050
evoking properties of food.

01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:45.980
When we ingest food or when
we are about to ingest food,

01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:47.210
our dopamine levels go up.

01:48:47.210 --> 01:48:49.350
And typically when we ingest food,

01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:51.040
if it evokes some dopamine release,

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.730
then we tend to want even more food.

01:48:52.730 --> 01:48:56.010
Remember dopamine's main
role is one of motivation

01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:56.843
and seeking.

01:48:56.843 --> 01:48:59.993
And what dopamine always wants
more of is more dopamine.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.220
More activity or thing that
evokes more dopamine release.

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:07.980
Well, let's just look at fasting

01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:10.427
from the perspective of dopamine schedules

01:49:10.427 --> 01:49:13.223
and dopamine release
and peaks and baselines.

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:18.850
Typically, when we eat
we get dopamine release,

01:49:18.850 --> 01:49:21.550
especially when we eat
after being very hungry.

01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:22.610
If you've ever gone camping,

01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:24.220
or you're very, very hungry,

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:26.110
the food tastes that much better.

01:49:26.110 --> 01:49:28.110
And that's actually because of the way

01:49:28.110 --> 01:49:32.840
that deprivation states increase the way

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.110
that dopaminergic circuits work.

01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:38.580
Our perception of dopamine is heightened

01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:40.360
when the receptors for dopamine

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.470
have not seen much dopamine lately,

01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:43.890
they haven't bound much dopamine.

01:49:43.890 --> 01:49:45.800
So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.910
and then you finally eat,

01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:49.690
it evokes more dopamine release.

01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:52.900
So this is the big reward
that comes at the end.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:56.250
Even bigger because you deprived yourself.

01:49:56.250 --> 01:49:59.040
This is true for all rewarding
behaviors and activities

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.250
by the way.

01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:03.000
The longer you restrict
yourself from that activity,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.020
the greater the dopamine
experience when the dopamine

01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:06.853
is finally released,

01:50:06.853 --> 01:50:09.713
because of an upregulation of
the receptors for dopamine.

01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:13.470
but I just spent five
minutes or more telling you

01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:16.470
that you should avoid too
much reward at the end,

01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:19.830
and you should actually
focus on the dopamine

01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:24.190
that you can consciously evoke
from the deprivation strain

01:50:24.190 --> 01:50:25.023
and effort.

01:50:25.023 --> 01:50:28.110
And in fact, this is what
happens for many people

01:50:28.110 --> 01:50:31.190
that start doing fasting
and take a liking to it.

01:50:31.190 --> 01:50:34.010
Many people say that their state of mind

01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:35.950
when they fast is clearer,

01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:39.110
that they actually start to
enjoy the period of fasting.

01:50:39.110 --> 01:50:41.870
In fact, some people start
pushing out their eating window

01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:44.250
or skipping entire days
of eating more and more

01:50:44.250 --> 01:50:47.605
in order to get deeper
into that state of mind

01:50:47.605 --> 01:50:50.530
where surely it's not just dopamine,

01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:51.950
but dopamine is released.

01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:53.390
They will track their clock.

01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:56.040
Oh, I've been fasting 12
hours, 16 hours, et cetera.

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:58.470
They are starting to
attach dopamine release

01:50:58.470 --> 01:51:01.480
or create dopamine release
from the deprivation,

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.460
not from the food reward itself.

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:06.270
And this I think makes it
an interesting practice.

01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:10.260
And one that certainly has
been practiced by for centuries

01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:12.250
in different cultures
and different religions

01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:14.290
of deliberately restricting food,

01:51:14.290 --> 01:51:16.560
not just to increase
the rewarding properties

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:18.020
of food itself,

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.550
but also to increase
the rewarding properties

01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:22.090
of deprivation.

01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:25.080
And I should emphasize that a
lot of the subjective aspects

01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:27.510
of the knowledge of
the benefits of fasting

01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:32.510
serve as reinforcing dopamine
amplifying aspects to fasting,

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.610
meaning if somebody does
intermittent fasting

01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:38.380
and they are deep into their fast

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:39.280
and they're telling themselves,

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.920
oh, my blood lipid profiles
are probably improving.

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.500
And my glucose management
is probably improving.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.310
My insulin sensitivity is going up,

01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:47.210
and I'm going to live longer.

01:51:47.210 --> 01:51:51.010
All these things that have
some basis from animal studies

01:51:51.010 --> 01:51:53.770
and some basis or not from human studies,

01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:55.810
it's all kind of still
an emerging literature,

01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:57.650
but it does seem to be
pointing in that direction

01:51:57.650 --> 01:52:01.507
that fasting can encourage
things like autophagy,

01:52:01.507 --> 01:52:04.560
the engulfment of dead cells
and things of that sort.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.800
Well, as people tell
themselves these things,

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:10.980
they are enhancing the
rewarding properties

01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:12.880
of the behavior of fasting.

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:15.000
And so this is a salient example

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.860
of where knowledge of
knowledge can actually help us

01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:23.060
change these deep primitive
circuits related to dopamine.

01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.490
And this illustrates how the forebrain,

01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:28.290
which carries knowledge
and carries interpretation

01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:32.720
and rational thought can be
used to shape the very circuits

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.300
that are involved in generating reward

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:37.440
for what would otherwise
just be kind of primitive

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.110
behaviors, hardwired behaviors.

01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:41.380
And that's the beauty of
these dopamine circuits.

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:42.570
That's the beauty of dopamine.

01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:47.280
It's not just attached to the
more primitive of food, sex,

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.520
heat, et cetera.

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.530
It's also attached to the things

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:54.710
that we decide are good for
us and are important for us.

01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:57.380
So telling yourself
that exercise or fasting

01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:00.210
or studying or listening better

01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:01.820
or any kind of behavior is good for you

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:04.680
will actually reinforce the extent

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:08.050
to which it is good for
you at a chemical level.

01:53:08.050 --> 01:53:10.850
And a somewhat eerie example
of what I just mentioned

01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:13.790
was a study that was published last year

01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:15.480
in the journal Neuron, Cell Press journal,

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:16.780
excellent journal.

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:20.220
That showed that hearing something

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.960
that reinforces one's prior beliefs

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:25.430
actually can evoke dopamine release.

01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:28.490
So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable

01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:30.690
to subjective interpretation

01:53:30.690 --> 01:53:33.620
that it actually makes it such
that when we see something

01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:35.740
or hear something that validates a belief

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:36.880
that we already have,

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:40.600
that itself can increase dopamine release.

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:44.180
Along the lines of how
dopamine and dopamine schedules

01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:46.660
and our perception of
things can shape the way

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:49.701
that we experience things
as pleasureful or not.

01:53:49.701 --> 01:53:53.370
There are beautiful studies
mainly looking at sugar appetite

01:53:53.370 --> 01:53:55.900
and our sense of pleasure
from sweet things,

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:58.690
but also for savory foods, et cetera.

01:53:58.690 --> 01:54:00.320
And essentially the results that come out

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.580
of this are the following.

01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:03.850
If you ingest something that you like,

01:54:03.850 --> 01:54:05.120
it tastes good to you,

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.930
but then you ingest
something that's even sweeter

01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:09.670
or even more savory.

01:54:09.670 --> 01:54:13.570
And then you go back to the
food that you ate previously.

01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:15.610
Well, you don't like it as much,

01:54:15.610 --> 01:54:18.350
and that might seem like a duh, obviously.

01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:22.600
But that shift in
perception can be blocked

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:25.180
by blocking the shift in dopamine.

01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:28.190
And so this really speaks
to these peaks and valleys

01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:29.530
in dopamine that I mentioned before

01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:33.080
and how your experience of
anything is going to depend

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.920
on your prior experience of other things

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.880
that evoke dopamine.

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:39.870
Big dopamine release
makes it more challenging

01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:43.020
to experience more big dopamine release.

01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:44.313
So dopamine is one of those things

01:54:44.313 --> 01:54:47.860
that you don't want too high
or too low for too long.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.140
It's all about staying
in that dynamic range

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:52.510
and that's going to be
different for everybody.

01:54:52.510 --> 01:54:57.510
So for the very savory foods
that are now everywhere,

01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:59.583
those highly savory foods

01:54:59.583 --> 01:55:02.190
or I think they call them
highly palatable foods

01:55:02.190 --> 01:55:06.040
are making more bland foods, whole foods,

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.440
meaning foods that aren't processed.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.180
It's making those tastes less
good at least for a while.

01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:13.530
And all it takes is a short
period of time, even just days,

01:55:13.530 --> 01:55:17.950
two days or so of not consuming
any highly palatable foods

01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:22.450
and suddenly broccoli with
just a little bit of seasoning

01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:23.850
tastes delicious to you.

01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:24.683
All right?

01:55:24.683 --> 01:55:27.220
So again, this just speaks
to the fact that dopamine

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:29.170
is this universal currency.

01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:31.600
It establishes value based on,

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.230
not just what you're
experiencing in the moment,

01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:36.630
but what you experienced in
the days and minutes before.

01:55:36.630 --> 01:55:39.620
Now, that you understand
how your previous level

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:42.710
of dopamine relates to your
current level of dopamine,

01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:46.100
and how your current level
of dopamine will influence

01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.600
your future level of dopamine,

01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:52.590
it should become obvious
why things like pornography,

01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:54.700
not just the accessibility of pornography,

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:59.670
but the intensity of
pornography can negatively shape

01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:02.720
real world romantic and
sexual interactions.

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.050
This is a serious concern.

01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:06.210
The discussion is happening now.

01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:08.300
The underlying neurobiological mechanisms

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.840
you now understand.

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.890
And this isn't to pass judgment on whether

01:56:11.890 --> 01:56:14.780
or not people like or
don't like pornography,

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:15.940
that's an ethical discussion,

01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:18.050
and it's a moral discussion
that has to be decided

01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:21.343
for each individual by
virtue of age, et cetera.

01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:26.170
But again, any activity that evokes

01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:28.860
a lot of dopamine release
will make it harder

01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:33.750
to achieve the same level and
certainly the greater level

01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:36.890
of dopamine through a
subsequent interaction.

01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:40.440
So yes, indeed many people
are addicted to pornography

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.530
and yes, indeed many people
who regularly indulge

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:46.840
in pornography experienced challenges

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.140
in real-world romantic interactions.

01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:50.910
You now understand the mechanisms behind

01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:52.300
what I'm telling you.

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:55.080
Now, there are circumstances
in which increasing levels

01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:57.870
of dopamine is desirable and advantageous

01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:59.410
and clinically helpful.

01:56:59.410 --> 01:57:01.770
Good example of this would
be the drug Welbutrin

01:57:01.770 --> 01:57:04.610
also called bupropion
which increases dopamine

01:57:04.610 --> 01:57:06.160
and norepinephrine.

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:07.840
Wellbutrin bupropion was developed

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:10.220
as an alternative treatment for depression

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.880
because some people who
take the so-called SSRI,

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.610
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:17.860
which as the name suggests
increased serotonin

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:21.380
suffer from serotonin
related side effects.

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:24.780
Things like decreased
appetite, decreased libido,

01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:28.850
or sometimes increased
appetite or other side effects

01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:30.400
that they don't want.

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.240
And Wellbutrin seems to avoid
the sexual side effects.

01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.500
It can blunt at appetite
and these sorts of things

01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:41.880
because of the increase in
norepinephrine and dopamine

01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:44.530
increases levels of
motivation and craving,

01:57:44.530 --> 01:57:49.160
but also can create a
state of elevated alertness

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:52.160
that can sometimes get in
the way of healthy eating

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:52.993
and things of that sort.

01:57:52.993 --> 01:57:56.680
So one has to work with their
clinician as psychiatrist.

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.280
It is a prescription drug in order

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:01.860
to find the dosage of Welbutrin
that's correct for them.

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.440
In addition, things
like Welbutrin bupropion

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.977
can increase anxiety because
of the way that dopamine

01:58:06.977 --> 01:58:09.080
and norepinephrine are stimulating

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.960
and tend to place people
into heightened levels

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.793
of alertness.

01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:14.680
Nonetheless, many people
have gained terrific relief

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:17.378
from depression from Wellbutrin bupropion,

01:58:17.378 --> 01:58:19.810
and many of those same
people had serious trouble

01:58:19.810 --> 01:58:21.090
with some of the SSRI.

01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:23.210
So it does seem to be a very useful drug

01:58:23.210 --> 01:58:24.043
in certain contexts,

01:58:24.043 --> 01:58:26.850
both for depression and for
the treatment of smoking

01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:29.180
for people desiring to quit smoking.

01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:31.250
And of course there are
a lot of people out there

01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:33.550
who are seeking to increase
their baseline levels

01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:36.810
of dopamine without
taking any prescription

01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:38.700
pharmaceutical compounds.

01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.440
And nowadays there exist a
lot of supplements to do that.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.790
The two most common ones that are directly

01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:48.450
within the dopamine
pathway are Macuna Pruriens

01:58:48.450 --> 01:58:53.450
which is actually a velvety
bean whose contents are l-DOPA.

01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:56.320
Believe it or not, the
content of this being

01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:58.630
is the precursor to dopamine.

01:58:58.630 --> 01:59:01.520
So Macuna Pruriens is
sold over the counter

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:03.210
at least in the United States.

01:59:03.210 --> 01:59:07.110
And it literally is the
precursor to dopamine.

01:59:07.110 --> 01:59:08.210
Meaning if you take it,

01:59:08.210 --> 01:59:11.190
you will experience very
large increases in dopamine.

01:59:11.190 --> 01:59:14.110
Those increases are transient
and very, very intense.

01:59:14.110 --> 01:59:17.810
And in fact, if you look at
the constellation of effects

01:59:17.810 --> 01:59:19.630
of Macuna Pruriens,

01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:21.510
what you find is that
they're pretty striking

01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:25.680
and they look a lot like
if not identical to l-DOPA.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:28.400
The most obvious of
those is in the context

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:29.690
of Parkinson's disease.

01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:31.780
There are at least five
studies that have shown

01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:35.190
that Macuna Pruriens
can reduce the symptoms

01:59:35.190 --> 01:59:36.250
of Parkinson's disease,

01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:39.220
much in the same way
that l-DOPA can reduce

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.320
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:42.960
And that shouldn't come as any surprise

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:46.850
given what I just told you
that is essentially l-DOPA.

01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:50.280
It also can reduce a particular
hormone called prolactin.

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:52.860
Dopamine and prolactin
tend to be in somewhat

01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:53.910
push pull fashion.

01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:54.770
When dopamine is up,

01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:57.290
prolactin is down and vice versa.

01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:59.630
Prolactin is involved in
milk letdown in women.

01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:02.330
It's involved in setting
the refractory period

02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:06.040
for sex after ejaculation in males.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.590
The reason mating can
occur and then not occur

02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:11.120
after a ejaculation is because
of an increase in prolactin.

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:14.950
Macuna Pruriens is often
used a blunt prolactin,

02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:17.060
and they're actually a
couple of studies showing

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:19.017
that it can indeed do that.

02:00:19.017 --> 02:00:21.800
Macuna Pruriens has a
number of other effects

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:24.930
that lie in the sex and
reproduction pathway

02:00:24.930 --> 02:00:26.030
that are worth noting.

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:29.690
Sperm concentration, sperm quality

02:00:29.690 --> 02:00:32.560
is actually greatly
increased by Macuna Pruriens.

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:34.672
These are kind of curious
effects until you understand

02:00:34.672 --> 02:00:36.450
a little bit more about
the biology of dopamine

02:00:36.450 --> 02:00:37.940
which I'll mention in a moment,

02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:40.340
but there are several studies,

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:45.340
four in fact that describe
how Macuna Pruriens

02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:48.190
can increase sperm count, sperm quality,

02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:49.680
and sperm motility.

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.970
So for those of you seeking
to conceive children,

02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:54.980
Macuna Pruriens might
be an interesting choice

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:56.510
if you're interested in exploring

02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:58.140
non-prescription compounds.

02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:01.930
However, I should mention that any time

02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:06.080
you consume a substance
that increases dopamine

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.520
by mimicking dopamine or
acting as a direct precursor

02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:10.650
to dopamine,

02:01:10.650 --> 02:01:15.080
there's almost inevitably
a crash or a reduction

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:18.690
in the baseline in dopamine
that we referred to previously.

02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:20.810
So many people who take Macuna Pruriens

02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:24.890
feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert,

02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:26.660
all the sorts of things
that one would expect

02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:30.440
from a dopaminergic drug
which Macuna Pruriens is.

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.537
And then they feel a low
or a reduction in drive

02:01:34.537 --> 02:01:38.190
and excitement and enthusiasm
after the drug wears off.

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:40.740
Just like they would with other dopamine

02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:42.000
increasing compound.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.370
For that reason, many people have turned

02:01:45.370 --> 02:01:47.390
to the use of L-tyrosine.

02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:50.800
L-tyrosine is an amino
acid precursor to l-DOPA.

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.200
So it lies further up the
dopamine synthesis pathway.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.570
And nowadays it's very
common because all L-tyrosine

02:01:57.570 --> 02:02:00.090
is sold over the counter
in the United States

02:02:00.090 --> 02:02:02.890
that people will take L-tyrosine as a way

02:02:02.890 --> 02:02:06.310
to get more energized alert and focused.

02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:09.603
Indeed, there are data that
L-tyrosine will accomplish that.

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:13.200
L-tyrosine is typically
taken in capsule form

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:16.537
or powder form anywhere from 500 to 750

02:02:16.537 --> 02:02:18.540
to a 1000 milligrams.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:21.880
It is a potent stimulus
for increasing dopamine.

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.730
And the timescale for increasing dopamine

02:02:23.730 --> 02:02:26.530
is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion.

02:02:26.530 --> 02:02:28.380
Dopamine levels start to peak.

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:31.310
The classic study that really nailed down

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:34.040
the fact that tyrosine has this effect

02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.770
was published way back in 1983,

02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:39.560
Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology and Metabolism

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:42.950
that directly compared
L-tyrosine supplementation

02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:47.950
with tryptophan ingestion on
plasma dopamine and serotonin.

02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.360
Tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.030
And indeed what they found is
that ingestion of L-tyrosine

02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:58.830
can increase the amount of
dopamine circulating in the blood

02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:01.193
and in the brain too, of course.

02:03:02.117 --> 02:03:04.190
The L-tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine

02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:07.670
increases within 45 minutes
and they were short-lasting

02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:10.990
after about 30 minutes
the effect had dissipated,

02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:13.970
meaning the levels of dopamine
had dropped down to baseline.

02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:16.100
And even though they didn't look at levels

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:19.190
of baseline dopamine past that time point,

02:03:19.190 --> 02:03:21.640
the expectation based
on everything we know

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.190
about dopamine biology is
that it would then drop

02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:27.280
below baseline due to the depletion

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.930
of the readily reservable
pool of dopamine vesicles

02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:31.710
that we talked about way
back at the beginning

02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:33.360
of this episode.

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.800
The nice thing about this study
is it does show specificity

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.320
of effect because ingestion of tryptophan

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:42.350
did not increase dopamine
instead it increased serotonin.

02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:44.300
So there's really
specificity of these pathways

02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:46.623
that rule out any placebo type effects.

02:03:48.210 --> 02:03:51.160
I'm not suggesting that anybody, everybody

02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.617
increase their dopamine
levels by way of tyrosine

02:03:53.617 --> 02:03:55.617
or Macuna Pruriens.

02:03:55.617 --> 02:03:57.500
For those of you that
are seeking to increase

02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:59.820
your dopamine levels
without prescription drugs,

02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:01.950
those are the most direct route to that.

02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:04.140
Of course, if you have a pre-existing

02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:05.480
dopaminergic condition,

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.680
so schizophrenia or psychosis of any kind,

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:11.610
bipolar, anxiety,

02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:14.120
things like Macuna Pruriens and L-tyrosine

02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:15.910
will not be good for you.

02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:19.990
And if you don't, you should
just understand and expect

02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:23.380
that it's going to lead to
an increase in dopamine.

02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:25.190
You'll certainly feel an elevated state

02:04:25.190 --> 02:04:27.860
for some of you that might be agitating,

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.630
for some of you that might
be really pleasureful,

02:04:29.630 --> 02:04:31.920
and then you will feel a crash afterwards.

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.160
How deep is that crash will
really depend on your biology

02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:38.350
and where your dopamine baseline began.

02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:41.070
So I personally am not
a fan of using things

02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:43.660
like Macuna Pruriens at all for myself

02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:45.720
for the reasons I mentioned earlier,

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:48.330
just too intense and too much of a crash.

02:04:48.330 --> 02:04:50.730
I do use L-tyrosine from time to time

02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:52.500
for enhancing focus and motivation,

02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.230
but I want to emphasize from time to time.

02:04:55.230 --> 02:04:58.520
So I might use it once a week,
occasionally twice a week,

02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.370
but I've never been one to
take L-tyrosine regularly

02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:04.930
in order to focus or train or
do any kind of mental work.

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:08.970
I just don't want to rely
on any exogenous substance

02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:12.360
in order to get my dopamine
circuits activated.

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:15.160
And I don't want to experience
the drop in dopamine

02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:18.470
that inevitably occurs some
period of time afterwards.

02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:21.378
I should also mention
things that can reduce

02:05:21.378 --> 02:05:23.980
your levels of baseline dopamine.

02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:27.640
One that is rarely discussed is melatonin.

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:30.510
I have talked before on this
podcast about melatonin,

02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:33.250
why I am not a fan of using melatonin

02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:35.140
in order to enhance sleep.

02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:36.460
It can help one get to sleep,

02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:37.690
but not stay asleep.

02:05:37.690 --> 02:05:39.330
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert

02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:41.430
from University of California, Berkeley.

02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:43.890
I think I don't want to
put words in his mouth,

02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:48.650
but in our discussion about
melatonin on this podcast

02:05:48.650 --> 02:05:51.430
when Matt was a guest in his
book and on other podcasts,

02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:54.690
Matt has generally stated
that the use of melatonin

02:05:54.690 --> 02:05:56.620
except for treatment of jet lag

02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:58.290
is generally not a good idea.

02:05:58.290 --> 02:05:59.770
And I agree.

02:05:59.770 --> 02:06:03.210
I think that melatonin is
not often thought about

02:06:03.210 --> 02:06:04.840
as impacting the dopamine pathway,

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:08.720
but there's at least one
study published in 2001

02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:12.550
first author is Nishiyama
just as it sounds.

02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:14.510
It's spelled just as it sounds.

02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:16.470
Acute effects of melatonin administration

02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:19.050
on cardiovascular autonomic
regulation in healthy men.

02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:21.840
So the study wasn't
specifically about dopamine,

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.200
but they looked at norepinephrine
and dopamine levels,

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:28.750
and they found a statistically
significant decrease

02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:32.730
in dopamine 60 minutes after
melatonin administration.

02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:36.090
I've talked before about
how viewing bright lights

02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:38.210
between the hours of
10:00 p.m and 4:00 a.m

02:06:38.210 --> 02:06:40.540
has been shown in studies
by Dr. Samer Hattar,

02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:42.950
David Bersin, excellent
circadian scientists

02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:47.030
to reduce levels of
dopamine for several days

02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:48.320
after that light exposure.

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.460
So dim the lights at night,

02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:53.720
if you can avoid exogenous melatonin,

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:56.290
meaning if you don't
have to take melatonin

02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:58.120
and you can find a better alternative

02:06:58.120 --> 02:06:58.980
that would be a good idea

02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:01.730
if you want to maintain
healthy levels of dopamine.

02:07:01.730 --> 02:07:04.510
Now, there is one compound
that you are all familiar with,

02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:07.580
and you've probably actually
taken without realizing it,

02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:08.810
that increases dopamine.

02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:13.020
And that's something called
PEA for phenethylamine,

02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:16.110
technically beta phenethylamine.

02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:19.210
And PEA is found in various foods.

02:07:19.210 --> 02:07:23.050
Chocolate just happens to
be one in enriched in PEA

02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:25.713
and can increase synaptic
levels of dopamine.

02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:29.650
I personally take PEA from time to time

02:07:29.650 --> 02:07:34.440
as a focus and work aid
in order to do intense

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.430
bouts of work.

02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:36.890
Again, I don't do that too often.

02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:39.330
This might be once a week
or once every two weeks.

02:07:39.330 --> 02:07:40.420
I might use it for training,

02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:41.720
but typically I don't,

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:43.080
it's usually for mental work.

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.330
And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA

02:07:46.210 --> 02:07:49.260
and I'll take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC.

02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:50.840
That's something that I personally do.

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:51.880
That's what's right for me,

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:54.370
it's within my margins
of safety for my health.

02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:56.520
Again, you have to check
with your doctor and decide

02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:57.960
what's right for you.

02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:02.540
It leads to a sharp but very
transient increase in dopamine

02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:05.530
that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.

02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:09.410
And at least in my system
I've found to be much more

02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:13.310
regulated and kind of even
than something like L-tyrosine

02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:15.640
and certainly much more regulated and even

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:18.010
and lower dopamine release than something

02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:20.240
like Macuna Pruriens.

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.870
One of the lesser talked about
compounds that's out there,

02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:26.560
but that's gaining popularity
for increasing dopamine

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:28.760
and as a so-called nootropic is something

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:30.260
called huperzine A.

02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:33.820
Huperzine A is a compound
sold over the counter

02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.210
at least in the United States

02:08:35.210 --> 02:08:38.130
that can increase
acetylcholine transmission,

02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:40.410
a different neuromodulator entirely.

02:08:40.410 --> 02:08:43.700
But what's interesting is
that huperzine A somehow

02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:46.680
by way of interactions
between the cholinergic system

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:51.060
and the dopaminergic system
leads to increases in dopamine

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.690
in the medial prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus.

02:08:53.690 --> 02:08:55.650
Hippocampus, of course,
being an area of the brain

02:08:55.650 --> 02:08:57.200
associated with learning and memory.

02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:59.010
And prefrontal cortex being associated

02:08:59.010 --> 02:09:01.480
with the mesolimbic pathway,
decision-making focus,

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:02.313
et cetera.

02:09:02.313 --> 02:09:04.630
And so I think the reason
why we're seeing an increase

02:09:04.630 --> 02:09:07.847
in popularity of companies
including huperzine A

02:09:07.847 --> 02:09:11.220
and nootropic compounds is
both for the cholinergic

02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:12.170
stimulating properties,

02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:15.560
but also for stimulating dopamine release.

02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.550
I personally have never tried huperzine A.

02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:20.650
You can go to www.examine.com
or put huperzine A

02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:22.710
into PubMed if you'd like to search around

02:09:22.710 --> 02:09:24.400
and see some of the science behind it.

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.340
Again, I'm not recommending
anyone take these things.

02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.510
In fact, I recommend against
anyone just diving in,

02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:31.210
and starting to consume things
without gaining knowledge

02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:32.490
about how they function,

02:09:32.490 --> 02:09:33.970
whether or not they're right for you.

02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:36.110
But nonetheless, I think
in the years to come,

02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:39.350
we are going to see a
lot more of L-tyrosine,

02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:43.330
PEA phenethylamine and
huperzine as a way of tapping

02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:46.010
into the dopaminergic
and cholinergic circuits

02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:48.390
certainly along with things like Alpha-GPC

02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:50.900
as non-prescription, short-lived

02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:54.250
somewhat milder alternatives to things

02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:56.380
that really spike dopamine,

02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:59.510
things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:09:59.510 --> 02:10:00.650
and similar.

02:10:00.650 --> 02:10:02.940
And I can't help but share
with you one more result.

02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:04.950
It's not related to pharmacology.

02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:08.580
It's related to behaviors
and social interactions.

02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:10.270
And that's the very interesting

02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:12.360
and I would say important finding

02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:15.403
that was made a few years ago
by my colleague, Rob Malenka,

02:10:15.403 --> 02:10:17.560
who's in our department
of psychiatry at Stanford,

02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:20.850
showing that oxytocin
and social connection

02:10:20.850 --> 02:10:24.800
is actually directly stimulating
the dopamine pathway.

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:26.410
I think for many years,

02:10:26.410 --> 02:10:30.320
all of us including me
would hear and thought

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:33.810
that oxytocin was in
the serotonergic pathway

02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:35.340
that it was about pair bonding,

02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:37.430
and it was about some
of these neuromodulators

02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:40.120
that were more associated
with things related

02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:43.530
to feeling good with what we
have in the present moment.

02:10:43.530 --> 02:10:45.020
That's typically what we
think of when we think

02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:48.110
of the opioid system or
the serotonergic system.

02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:50.960
The dopamine system is really
about seeking and reward,

02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:53.840
but in a paper published in
2017 in the journal Science,

02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:55.223
excellent journal.

02:10:56.270 --> 02:11:00.070
The papers titled gaining of
social reward by oxytocin,

02:11:00.070 --> 02:11:02.610
excuse me, in the ventral tegmental area.

02:11:02.610 --> 02:11:04.170
You now know what the
ventral tegmental area,

02:11:04.170 --> 02:11:06.320
it's that area of the mesolimbic pathway.

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.580
What this paper
essentially showed is that,

02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:13.160
oxytocin social connection
and pair bonding itself

02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:15.030
triggers dopamine release.

02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:18.440
And as everyone read this
result, we all realized,

02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:21.920
ah, this makes total sense
that for the evolution

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.753
of our species,

02:11:22.753 --> 02:11:25.180
indeed for any species
where social connections

02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.680
are important,

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:29.270
it's also important to go
seek social connections.

02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:31.610
And so, while it's fun to
think about pharmacology

02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:34.940
and underlying neurocircuitry
and cold water baths

02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:38.530
and all these different things
related to dopamine schedules

02:11:38.530 --> 02:11:41.350
and reward mechanisms and
attaching reward to effort

02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:43.390
and all the various things
that we've talked about today

02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:45.590
in terms of science and
tools and protocols,

02:11:46.730 --> 02:11:49.750
I'd be remiss if I didn't include
description of this result

02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:53.780
and just emphasize that
social connections,

02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:55.900
close social connections in particular

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:57.380
that evoke oxytocin release.

02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:59.210
So those are romantic type,

02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:01.250
those are parent-child type,

02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:02.770
those are friendship related,

02:12:02.770 --> 02:12:06.410
and those can even be just
friends at a distance related,

02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:07.362
right?

02:12:07.362 --> 02:12:08.770
It doesn't actually require skin contact

02:12:08.770 --> 02:12:11.370
to get oxytocin release,

02:12:11.370 --> 02:12:14.110
but oxytocin release is
central to stimulating

02:12:14.110 --> 02:12:15.950
the dopamine pathways.

02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:18.763
So the take home message
there is quite simple,

02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:24.110
engage in pursue quality,
healthy social interactions.

02:12:24.110 --> 02:12:26.330
I know I've covered a
lot of material today.

02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:28.150
I've really tried hard to focus on things

02:12:28.150 --> 02:12:31.300
that lie directly within
the dopamine pathway

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:32.720
and circuitries,

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.700
as well as things that directly stimulate

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:37.000
those pathways and circuitries.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.600
What I haven't talked
about are all the things

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.920
that indirectly serve
the dopamine pathways.

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.370
And out there on the internet

02:12:44.370 --> 02:12:46.400
and indeed in the scientific literature,

02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:47.670
you will find for instance,

02:12:47.670 --> 02:12:50.250
that things like Maca root
can increase dopamine.

02:12:50.250 --> 02:12:53.550
Things like the gut microbiome
can influence dopamine.

02:12:53.550 --> 02:12:54.950
And indeed they can,

02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:57.070
but they do that through
indirect mechanisms.

02:12:57.070 --> 02:12:59.040
By creating a environment,

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.200
a milieu in which dopamine
and dopamine circuits

02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:03.470
can flourish.

02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:04.840
Maca is a good example of that.

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:08.200
It will reduce cortisol and
through some indirect pathways

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:10.890
related to cortisol can increase dopamine.

02:13:10.890 --> 02:13:13.100
But it's not a direct
increase in dopamine.

02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:15.210
And so as a consequence,
it's rather subtle

02:13:15.210 --> 02:13:17.430
compared to the various
compounds and behaviors

02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:18.780
that I talked about today.

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:23.270
Indeed cold water exposure
leads to huge increases

02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:25.600
in dopamine as we talked about before,

02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:27.573
and very sustained ones at that.

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:31.750
I realize in giving you a lot
of information about science

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:34.700
and mechanism all the way
from psychological biological

02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:36.540
to circuitry and synaptic transmission,

02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.827
volumetric transmission and so forth,

02:13:38.827 --> 02:13:40.770
that it might seem overwhelming.

02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:42.590
The most important thing is to understand,

02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:43.840
or that these dopamine pathways

02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:45.930
really are under your control.

02:13:45.930 --> 02:13:49.070
And the locus of control
resides in the fact

02:13:49.070 --> 02:13:51.330
that your previous levels of dopamine

02:13:51.330 --> 02:13:54.100
are influencing your levels
of dopamine right now.

02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:55.600
And your current levels of dopamine

02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:57.010
and where you take them next,

02:13:57.010 --> 02:13:59.320
will influence your dopamine
levels in the next days

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:00.350
and weeks to come.

02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:04.030
So I hope both with the mechanisms
that you now have in hand

02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:06.760
plus some of the tools to tap
into the dopaminergic system,

02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:09.170
both behavioral,
pharmacologic prescription,

02:14:09.170 --> 02:14:10.800
and non-prescription, et cetera,

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:12.220
that you'll feel that
you have more control

02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:13.490
over your dopamine system.

02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:15.530
And certainly that you
have a better understanding

02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:18.430
of your dopamine system
so that you can modulate

02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:20.340
and adjust your levels
of dopamine in the ways

02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:22.110
that serve you best.

02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:22.400
we talked a bit about supplements.

02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.350
Supplements certainly aren't necessary,

02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:25.980
but many people find them beneficial

02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:27.970
for things like adjusting
their levels of dopamine

02:15:27.970 --> 02:15:29.950
or for other purposes.

02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:31.130
If you're going to use supplements,

02:15:31.130 --> 02:15:33.320
it's very important that
the supplements you use

02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:34.690
be of very high quality,

02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:36.760
and that the quantity of ingredients

02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:38.320
that are on the label match

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.610
what's actually in those bottles.

02:15:39.610 --> 02:15:41.300
For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne.

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:44.410
T-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne
has the highest levels

02:15:44.410 --> 02:15:46.610
of stringency with respect to quality

02:15:46.610 --> 02:15:50.450
and how much of each supplement
they put in the products

02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:51.283
that they sell.

02:15:51.283 --> 02:15:52.870
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:53.703
you can go to Thorne,

02:15:53.703 --> 02:15:58.030
www.T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.

02:15:58.030 --> 02:15:59.300
And there, you can see what I take.

02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:02.040
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:04.080
And if you navigate into the Thorne site

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.314
through that portal,

02:16:05.314 --> 02:16:08.070
then you can get 20% off
any of the supplements

02:16:08.070 --> 02:16:09.100
that Thorne makes.

02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:11.210
If you're not already
following us on Instagram

02:16:11.210 --> 02:16:12.770
at Huberman Lab, please do so.

02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:16.010
There I teach neuroscience
tools and information.

02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:17.620
Oftentimes, it's tools and information

02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:19.700
that I don't cover on the podcast.

02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:22.310
We're also on Twitter,
also at Huberman Lab.

02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:24.540
And last but certainly not least,

02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:26.260
thank you for your interest in science.

02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:29.093
