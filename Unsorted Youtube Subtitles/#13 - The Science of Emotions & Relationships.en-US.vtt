00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.417
where we discuss science

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:05.983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:10.890
- My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.258
and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.980
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.200
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.268
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:21.740
It is however part of my desire and effort

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.760
to bring zero-cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.890
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.015
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:32.320
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.532
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:37.656
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:40.456
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.600
to help you better understand your body

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.500
and inform your health goals.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.040
I'm a big believer in
getting blood test taken,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.095
because it's simply the only
way to get in-depth data

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:52.711
about your metabolic factors, hormones,

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.050
all the things that inform your immediate

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.448
and long-term health.

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:58.987
Nowadays, there are
also excellent DNA tests

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:00.770
that can further inform you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.200
about your immediate and long-term health.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.740
Now the problem with most
blood tests out there

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.190
is that you get information
back, you get a lot of numbers,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.110
and they'll tell you whether or not

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.663
your numbers are in normal
range or high or low,

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:12.990
but they don't inform you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.729
what steps to take as a consequence.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270
In addition, they can
often be very confusing,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.650
what all the factors are
and what they really mean.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.320
InsideTracker has a
dashboard and a platform

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.490
that makes interpreting all
that information really easy.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.120
It also points you in the direction

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.650
of certain lifestyle factors,
exercise, nutrition et cetera,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.660
that you might want to change

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.555
in order to bring the numbers
into the ranges that you want.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:36.130
So InsideTracker is something

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.750
that I've been doing for some time now,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.890
and it's really helped
me inform the choices.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.190
For instance, I've swapped out

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.050
some of the foods that
I was eating regularly.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.800
I found out I was actually too high

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.270
in certain vitamins and minerals,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.670
I was too low in others.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.130
It's really helped me adjust my diet

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770
and my exercise regimes.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.040
And it really gives me the confidence

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460
that I'm on the path to long-term health.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.000
So if you want to try InsideTracker,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.290
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.630
to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.730
Use the code Huberman at checkout,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.350
that's insidetracker.com/huberman

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.190
to get 25% off any of InsidTracker's plans

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.690
and use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.115
Our next sponsor is ExpressVPN.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.010
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.460
that keeps your data safe

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.240
and secure and private.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.450
It does that by routing
your internet activity

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.600
through their servers and encrypting it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.875
so that no one can see or sell your data.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.010
I started using ExpressVPN

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.450
because my bank account got hacked.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.070
I still don't know
exactly how it happened,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.170
but it was an absolute mess.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.050
I lost money,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.320
I lost a lot of time.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.613
I wouldn't want to have
it happen to anybody.

00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:42.880
When that happened,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.374
I talked to my friends
in the tech community

00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:46.400
and they told me that even though

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.610
you think your internet
connection is secure

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.987
oftentimes it's not.

00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:51.900
So I tend to use internet connections

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.940
on planes, in hotels, in
cafes, but also at home.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.094
And I was told that even at home,

00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:00.340
your data may not be
as secure as you think.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
And so with ExpressVPN, your
data is absolutely secure,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.650
so are your online activities.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.550
The great thing is

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.710
you don't even notice that it's operating,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.830
it's running in the background.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.010
You just turn it on and it
goes without you realizing

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.480
that your data is being protected,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.904
it doesn't interfere with any
of your online activities.

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:19.731
So I use ExpressVPN when I travel,

00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:22.270
anytime I'm outside the
house, when I'm at work

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.790
and when I'm at home.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.096
If you want to try ExpressVPN,

00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:29.580
you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.044
And if you do that, you'll
get an extra three months free

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.490
on one of their one-year packages.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.730
That's expressvpn.com/huberman

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.359
to get three months free
on a one-year package.

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.430
The final sponsor of today's
podcast is Magic Spoon.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.150
Magic Spoon is a zero-sugar,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.319
grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.280
As I've mentioned before on the podcast,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.230
I'm neither ketogenic, nor am
I all-meat, nor am I vegan.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.960
The way I eat is that
early in the day I fast,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.210
and then sometime around
noon I eat my first meal,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.760
and that meal is always low carbohydrate,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.810
and then throughout the day,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.230
I maintain a low carbohydrate diet.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.780
The fasting and low carbohydrate
diet during the daytime

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.760
optimizes alertness and wakefulness,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.840
I want to be awake and be able to work.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.830
And then at night is when
I eat my carbohydrates,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.200
'cause it facilitates
the transition to sleep.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.793
So for me, Magic Spoon is a
terrific snack in the afternoon.

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:24.200
I'll sometimes even have it with lunch.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.180
And the reason I like it

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.930
is because it tastes really delicious,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.680
and it's compatible with the keto-friendly

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.224
or keto-like meals that
I eat throughout the day.

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:34.693
They come in a variety of flavors,

00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:37.590
cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.170
I particularly like the frosted

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.350
because it tastes like
donuts, in my opinion,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.940
and I love donuts.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.773
As a consequence,

00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:45.486
I love Magic Spoon cereal.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:46.680
I can consume it.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.430
It tastes like a pastry and
it has zero grams of sugar,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.263
and it's compatible

00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:54.120
with this nutritional
regimen I mentioned earlier.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.530
If you want to try Magic Spoon,

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.390
you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.704
to grab a variety pack.

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:04.210
Use the code Huberman at checkout
and get $5 off your order.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.670
That's magicspoon.com/huberman,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.760
and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.086
This month, we're talking all
about the science of emotions

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:15.002
and tools related to
the science of emotions.

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:18.239
We've talked about the science
of stress and resiliency,

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:20.620
tools to access more calm,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.120
tools raise your stress threshold,
to become more resilient.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.420
We've talked about motivation

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.074
and the role of the dopamine system.

00:05:27.074 --> 00:05:29.290
I'd like to make a couple of announcements

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.786
about some new resources.

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:33.525
The first one is that
we have now captioned

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:35.448
all the Huberman Lab episodes

00:05:35.448 --> 00:05:37.434
in English and in Spanish.

00:05:37.434 --> 00:05:38.770
We were able to do that,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.706
thanks to your support of
our sponsors and on Patreon.

00:05:41.706 --> 00:05:44.370
So now, all of the podcasts

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.347
have a captioning feature on YouTube,

00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:48.707
and those were done by experts.

00:05:48.707 --> 00:05:51.335
So while there might be
the occasional error,

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.746
for the most part, they're very precise.

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:54.920
We've done that

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.792
so that people that prefer to
consume the content in Spanish

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:00.030
or that like to read the content

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.350
from the English subtitles can do so.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.450
And we're going to continue

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.040
to expand the number of
languages that are captioned

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.270
for the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.828
So we want to thank you for that resource.

00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:11.900
It's now available for all episodes.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.190
In addition, in previous episodes

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.550
I've talked about NSDR
or non-sleep depressed.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.410
NSDRs come in in a variety
of different forms,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.690
there's self-hypnosis.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.530
I've pointed you to some
resources for that previously.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.220
There's yoga nidra.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.990
NSDR is really about
achieving calm quickly,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.270
and doing that in a self-directed
way, for many reasons,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.290
in order to access sleep more readily,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.710
in order to de-stress very deeply,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.374
in order to replace
sleep that you've lost.

00:06:42.374 --> 00:06:45.310
It also seems to aid neuroplasticity.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.170
It can enhance

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.070
the rearrangements of
connections in the brain

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.060
that occur during learning,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.559
there's scientific support for that.

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:56.559
There's a link in today's
episode caption to a new site.

00:06:56.606 --> 00:06:58.094
This is a YouTube video

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.850
that was brought free of cost

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.440
by the folks over at Madefor,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.990
a company that's been a sponsor
of the podcast previously.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.302
So this is an NSDR script

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.908
that doesn't contain any of the intentions

00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:14.060
or some of the more typical
language of yoga nidra,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.536
instead it's focused purely
on the breathing protocols,

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:20.020
as well as includes a sort of body scan

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.853
where you direct

00:07:20.853 --> 00:07:22.970
your attention to different
locations around your body.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.162
It has all the core elements
of non-sleep deep rest,

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:28.902
but is distinct from yoga nidra.

00:07:28.902 --> 00:07:31.280
I just offer this to you as a resource.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.370
If you'd like to use it,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.120
it's about 30 minutes long,
and should be very effective

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.350
in bringing you into
deep states of relaxation

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.100
for all the reasons I mentioned before.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.900
So let's talk about emotions.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.470
Emotions are a fascinating

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.913
and vital aspect of our life experience.

00:07:45.913 --> 00:07:47.960
It's fair to say that emotions

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.960
make up most of what we think
of as our experience of life,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.026
even the things we do,

00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:55.077
our behaviors and the places we go,

00:07:55.077 --> 00:07:57.639
and the people we end up
encountering in our life,

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:02.450
all of that really funnels
into our emotional perception

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.181
of what those things mean,
whether or not they made us happy

00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:10.181
or sad or depressed or
lonely, or were all inspiring.

00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:12.630
Now one thing that is absolutely true

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.820
is that everyone's perception of emotion

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.033
is slightly different.

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:20.280
Meaning, your idea of happy
is very likely different

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.626
than my idea of what a
state of happiness is.

00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:27.720
And we know this also for
color vision, for instance,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.098
even though the cells
in your eye and my eye

00:08:30.098 --> 00:08:33.640
that perceive the color red are identical

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.599
right down to the genes that they express,

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:39.177
we can be certain based
on experimental evidence,

00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:41.186
and what are called
psychophysical studies,

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:45.540
that your idea of the most intense red

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.570
is going to be very different

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.840
than my idea of the most intense red

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.050
if we were given a selection
of 10 different reds

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.700
and asked which one is most intense,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.980
which one looks most red,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.200
and that seems crazy,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.790
you would think that
something as simple as color

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.962
would be universal, and yet it's not.

00:09:00.962 --> 00:09:03.135
And so we need to agree at the outset

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:07.450
that emotions are complicated
and yet they are tractable.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.650
They can be understood.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.990
And today we're going to talk about

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.421
a lot of tools to
understand what emotions are

00:09:13.421 --> 00:09:16.750
for you to understand what
your emotional states mean

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.250
and what they don't mean.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.620
And in doing that, that will
allow you to place value

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.453
on whether or not

00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:25.740
you should hold an emotional
state as true or not true,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.170
whether or not it has
meaning or it doesn't,

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.040
as well as whether or not
the emotions of others

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.032
are important to you in a given context.

00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:35.390
We're going to talk a
lot about development.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.330
In fact, we're going to center

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.891
a lot of our discussion today
around infancy and puberty.

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:41.840
We're also going to talk about tools

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.798
for enhancing one's emotional range

00:09:43.798 --> 00:09:48.490
and for navigating difficult
emotional situations.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.060
I'm not a clinical psychologist,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.896
I'm not a therapist,

00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:53.627
but I do have some
background in psychology.

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:56.090
And today I'm going to be drawing

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.200
from the psychology greats, not me,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.230
but from the greats of
psychology who studied emotion,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.884
who studied emotional development,

00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:05.420
and linking that to the
neuroscience of emotion.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.720
Because nowadays we understand
a lot about the chemicals

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.670
and the hormones and the neural circuits

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.260
in the brain and body
that underlie emotion.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.240
So while there's no

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.358
one single universally
true theory of emotion,

00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:20.660
at the intersection of many
of the existing theories,

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.970
there are really some ground truth.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.893
So today we're going to
visit those ground truths.

00:10:23.893 --> 00:10:26.440
We're going to talk about the
tools that emerge from them.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.310
And we're going to talk about

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.730
some absolutely wild and wacky experiments

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.520
that people are doing out there right now,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.650
that I don't necessarily recommend you do,

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.460
of inhaling different types of hormones

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.420
and trying to get attached more quickly.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.253
You're actually going to do

00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:40.180
some experiential stuff today if you like.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.910
There's some things that
you can do in real time

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.987
while listening to the podcast,

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:46.180
in order to tap into

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.190
some of the mechanisms
that I'll be referring to.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.780
So today's going to be very interactive

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.740
in a way that previous
podcast episodes have not.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.319
If we want to understand emotions,

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:57.356
we have to look at where
emotions first develop.

00:10:57.356 --> 00:11:00.180
In fact, this is a critical central theme

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.019
if you want to understand
brain science and psychology.

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:05.447
There's a rule in neuroanatomy.

00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:09.200
Because if you look at 50
different brains of humans

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.120
or you compare the brains
of dogs and humans,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.540
there are a lot of differences.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.430
Certain things are the same

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.870
but certain things are different.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.840
And the rule that every
good neuroanatomist knows

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.430
is that if you want to understand

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.036
what a part of the brain does,

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:23.910
you have to address two questions.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.946
First, you have to know what connections

00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:27.670
does that brain area make?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.640
What is it connected to?

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.650
Where does it get inputs from
and where does it send inputs?

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.830
So for instance, if there's
an area of the brain

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.863
that gets direct input from
the neurons in the nose,

00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:41.150
you can be pretty certain

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.170
that it has some role in analyzing smell

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.530
in measuring something about odors

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.223
or analyzing something about odors.

00:11:48.223 --> 00:11:50.790
Now if it also gets input from the eye,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.720
you can also conclude that it gets input

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.084
from the visual system that it cares about

00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:57.080
light and photons.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.019
This is sort of obvious.

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:00.246
And yet you need to
know that connectivity,

00:12:00.246 --> 00:12:03.330
and you need to know what's called

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.630
the developmental origin
of that structure.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.224
You need to know where it
was early in development,

00:12:08.224 --> 00:12:11.630
because things move around
a lot as the brain develops.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.490
The brain, of course

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.354
is this more or less squishy thing

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:16.010
floating around in some liquid

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.830
that stuffed inside your skull.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.130
And as a consequence,
things move around a lot.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.680
They are not always in the same place

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.336
in two different species

00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:26.137
or two individuals of the same species.

00:12:26.137 --> 00:12:28.530
So you have to know
where they started out,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.800
because where they started out

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.351
informs what they do as well.

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.049
And when we're talking about emotions,

00:12:33.049 --> 00:12:36.060
we cannot point to one area of the brain.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.060
We can't say that's the area of the brain

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.496
that's responsible for emotions.

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:41.758
There is this so-called limbic system

00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:45.640
that has been linked to
emotions in various ways.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.056
We're going to talk about that today.

00:12:47.056 --> 00:12:49.685
But the limbic system
is just one component

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:52.450
of the inputs to create emotions.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.100
It's not the place for emotions.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.398
You can't go in and lesion
one location in the brain

00:12:57.398 --> 00:13:02.398
and eliminate emotions entirely,
just doesn't work that way.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.684
So, first of all, we have to ask,

00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:07.210
what are the circuits for emotion?

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.800
What are the brain areas for emotion?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.080
And nowadays there's a
lot of debate about this.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.823
For years, it was thought
that there might be circuits,

00:13:13.823 --> 00:13:15.570
meaning connections in the brain

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.270
that generate the feeling of being happy

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.410
or circuits that generate

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.349
the feeling of being sad, et cetera.

00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:22.360
That's been challenged.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.700
In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.400
has been the person who's
really challenged this head-on,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.600
and has very good evidence

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.640
for the fact that such
circuits probably don't exist.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.286
And yet I think there's good evidence

00:13:33.286 --> 00:13:35.350
for circuits in the brain,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.462
such as limbic circuits and other circuits

00:13:37.462 --> 00:13:40.070
that shift our overall states

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.360
or our overall level of
alertness or calmness,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.193
or whether they're not,

00:13:44.193 --> 00:13:46.740
they bias us toward
viewing the outside world

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.980
or paying more attention

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.119
to what's going on inside our bodies.

00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:51.840
If none of this makes sense right now,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.370
I promise it will make sense soon.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.010
But the important thing to understand

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.372
is that emotions do arise
in the brain and body.

00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:01.221
They arise because there
are specific connections

00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:03.907
between specific areas
in the brain and body.

00:14:03.907 --> 00:14:07.670
And if we want to understand
how emotions work,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.089
we have to look how emotions are built.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:15.089
And they are built during
infancy, adolescence, and puberty,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.510
and then it continues into adulthood.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.440
But the groundwork is laid
down early in development

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.340
when we are small children.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.210
So let's think about

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.625
what happens to a baby
that comes into the world.

00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:28.440
A baby comes into the world.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.460
You were born into this world

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.901
without really any understanding
of the things around you.

00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:36.700
Now, there are two ways that
you can interact with the world

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.850
and you're always doing them more or less

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.065
to some degree at the same time.

00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:43.790
Those are interoception,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.360
paying attention what's
going on inside you,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.730
what you feel internally,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.740
and exteroception,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.420
paying attention to what's
going on outside you.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.750
Hold that in mind, please.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.650
Because the fact that
you're both interocepting

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.930
and exterocepting is true
for your entire life,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.230
and it sets the foundation
for understanding emotions.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.556
It's absolutely critical.

00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:05.633
As an infant,

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.280
you didn't have any
knowledge of what you needed.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.760
You didn't understand hunger,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.180
you didn't understand toys

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.280
when you first came into the world,

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.758
you didn't understand cold
or heat or any of that.

00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:20.609
When you needed something, you
experienced that as anxiety.

00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:23.160
You would feel an increase in alertness

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.018
if you had to use the bathroom.

00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:27.320
you would feel an increase in alertness

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.209
if you were hungry,

00:15:28.209 --> 00:15:29.930
and you would vocalize,

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.410
you would cry out, you would act agitated.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.900
You might cue, you might do
a number of different things,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.572
but all you knew was what
you were feeling internally.

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:41.100
And then your caregiver,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.580
whoever that might've been
would respond to that.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.873
So you would feel some agitation,

00:15:44.873 --> 00:15:47.270
a caregiver would come
and make a decision,

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.130
Oh, you need food, and give you milk,

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.750
or change your diaper
or wrap you in a blanket

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.696
if you were cold,

00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:56.620
but they didn't know if you were cold,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.700
they could just assume that you were cold.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.790
So this is actually really
important to understand

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.060
that a baby, when you were a
baby, and when I was a baby,

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.590
we didn't have any sense
of the outside world

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.590
except that it responded to our
acts of anxiety essentially.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.330
Now this isn't Freudian theory,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.030
There are components of it

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.520
that are embedded in Freudian theory,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.290
but all developmental
psychologists agree that

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.694
babies lack the ability

00:16:20.694 --> 00:16:23.153
to make cognitive sense
of the outside world,

00:16:23.153 --> 00:16:26.230
but in this feeling of anxiety

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.330
and registering one's own internal state,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.380
and then crying out to the outside world,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.851
either through crying
or subtle vocalizations,

00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:35.641
or even just cuing, making some noise,

00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:39.350
we start to develop a relationship
with the outside world

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.830
in which our internal states,

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.642
our shifts and anxiety
start to drive requests,

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:48.870
and people come and respond
to those requests, hopefully.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.730
And the reason I say hopefully

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.703
is that we've all heard

00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:54.750
presumably about these cases of neglect.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.340
There are a lot of cases
where if you neglect a baby,

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.930
you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.630
development doesn't go well,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.980
and we'll touch on some of those.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.560
But those are really extreme cases.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.160
They're sort of like the
parallel to experiments

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.059
that are often done in the
laboratory with animals,

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:11.440
where you've probably heard
of these enriched environments

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.640
where they'll give mice a bunch of toys,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.632
and they'll give them

00:17:14.632 --> 00:17:17.120
some different foods
every once in a while,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.810
and they'll house them
together with other mice.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.110
And then what you find
is that the animals,

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.350
they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.480
and their neurons have more
branches to them and all that."

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.047
But that's really comparing
deprivation with normalcy.

00:17:30.047 --> 00:17:32.409
What we want to center on today instead

00:17:32.409 --> 00:17:35.547
is what happens when things go well,

00:17:35.547 --> 00:17:38.820
and why things might not go well

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.590
in certain circumstances is interesting.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.020
But to me, not as interesting

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.240
as what healthy emotional
development looks like.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.470
And if you haven't achieved
healthy emotional development,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.900
what can be done as an intervention

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.320
at later times in order to rescue that?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.959
So the baby, you as a baby,

00:17:53.959 --> 00:17:56.482
you're flopping around there in your crib,

00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:59.040
you're getting care where you need it

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.471
and when you need it, presumably,

00:18:00.471 --> 00:18:05.471
and this gets to the basis
of what emotions are about,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.533
which are emotions are
really about forming bonds

00:18:09.533 --> 00:18:12.558
and being able to predict
things in the world.

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:15.174
That's really what emotions are about.

00:18:15.174 --> 00:18:18.180
Whether or not the baby
feels angry or happy or sad,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.600
we don't know, we can
guess, but we don't know.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.700
In fact, most of the time we
don't even know how we feel,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.030
let alone how other people feel,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.170
and that's true for adults.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.609
So if I asked you how you feel right now,

00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:29.640
I don't know that you could tell me

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.387
in any kind of rich
language that I would say,

00:18:32.387 --> 00:18:34.150
"Oh I really understand."

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.070
If you said you were very, very depressed

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.040
or very, very happy,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.710
I'd have some sense because
of how extreme that is,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.190
but I don't know that I would really know,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.230
and I don't think you know
how I feel right now either.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.601
I could be furious right now

00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:45.860
or I could be very happy,

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.906
you don't have any idea.

00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:48.951
And of course, we have these
things called expressions,

00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:50.560
our pupils dilate.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.690
There are various cues of how people feel.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.752
We're going to talk about those cues,

00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:55.124
but you really don't know.

00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:57.640
And at this point I
actually just want to pause

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.985
and mention a really interesting tool

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:02.680
that is trying to address this question

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.788
of what are emotions and
what do they consist of,

00:19:04.788 --> 00:19:06.900
that you can use if you like.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.733
This is an app,

00:19:07.733 --> 00:19:08.566
I didn't develop it,

00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:09.708
I don't have any relationship to them,

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:12.923
but the app was developed
by people at Yale,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.375
by groups at Yale who do research,

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:18.000
and it's called Mood Meter.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.460
And it's actually quite interesting.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.320
I think it's either free or it's 0.99.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.180
Again, no business relationship to them.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.150
But what they're trying
to do is put more nuance,

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.090
more subtlety on our words,

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.980
and our language for emotions,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.740
and be able to allow you

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.170
to predict how you're going
to feel in the future.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.560
And it's actually quite interesting.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.610
I'm on the app right now, and
I know you can't see this,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.960
but it's called Mood Meter.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.285
And you can find on Apple or Android.

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.181
And you go into and it asks you,

00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:50.380
it says to me, "Hi, Andrew,
how are you right now?

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.390
And I click the little
tab that says I feel.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.560
And I can either pick high
energy and unpleasant,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.450
high energy and pleasant,
low energy unpleasant

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.880
or low energy pleasant.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.800
And I would say right now I
feel high energy pleasant.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.370
So I just revealed to you how I feel.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.454
So I click on that,

00:20:08.454 --> 00:20:11.540
and then it gives you a gallery of colors,

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.153
and you just move your
finger to the location

00:20:13.153 --> 00:20:15.860
where you think it matches most.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.592
And as you do that, little words pop up.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:20.950
I know some people are
listening to this on audio only.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.980
So it say motivated, cheerful, inspired.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.668
I would say, I'm feeling
right now, cheerful.

00:20:24.668 --> 00:20:27.780
So you click that and then you
just go to the next window,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.017
and it just says, what are you doing?

00:20:29.017 --> 00:20:30.930
And this feels like play to me,

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.150
but I'm going to call it work.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.540
And then that's it.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.560
And then what it does

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.300
is it basically starts
to collect data on you.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.450
You're giving it information.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.455
And it starts to link
that to other features

00:20:41.455 --> 00:20:43.487
that you allowed access to if you like,

00:20:43.487 --> 00:20:46.110
and it starts helping
you be able to predict

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.320
how you're going to feel
different times a day.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.455
It's actually quite
accurate in certain ways,

00:20:50.455 --> 00:20:51.442
quite interesting.

00:20:51.442 --> 00:20:55.100
And it points to a couple of
really interesting features,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.280
which is that we don't
really have enough language

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.229
to describe all the emotional states,

00:21:00.229 --> 00:21:02.627
and yet there's some core truths

00:21:02.627 --> 00:21:04.700
to what makes up an emotion.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.790
And I want to review that
twice during today's podcast,

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.240
because this can really help people,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.710
kids and adults understand better

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.080
what they're feeling and why,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.537
and when best to engage
in certain activities,

00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:22.370
and thankfully, when best to
avoid certain activities too.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.363
So the way this works is the following.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.038
You need to ask yourself at any point,

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:29.900
you could do this right now if you like,

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.420
what's your level of autonomic arousal?

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.750
Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.890
the range of alert to calm.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.890
So if you're in a panic right now,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.300
you are like 10 out of
10 on the arousal scale.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.337
If you're asleep,

00:21:46.337 --> 00:21:49.185
you're probably not
comprehending what I'm saying,

00:21:49.185 --> 00:21:51.080
although maybe a little bit.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.480
But let's say you're very drowsy,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.424
you might be at a one or a two.

00:21:54.424 --> 00:21:57.210
So you always have to ask,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.440
where are you on the arousal scale?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.571
And then there's this other
axis, this other question,

00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:06.310
which is what we call valence.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.760
Now valence is a value.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.370
Do you feel good or bad?

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.650
I would say I feel pretty good right now.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.970
On a scale of one to 10,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.021
I'm like, I dunno, I feel like a seven.

00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:15.525
Got good night's sleep last night,

00:22:15.525 --> 00:22:18.438
had a good walk with
Costello this morning,

00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:20.370
I'm fed, I'm hydrated.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.203
I feel good,

00:22:21.203 --> 00:22:22.036
So I'm like a seven.

00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:24.325
So I'm alert and I feel pretty good.

00:22:24.325 --> 00:22:26.510
And then there's a third thing,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.090
which is how much we are interocepting

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.138
and how much we are exterocepting.

00:22:32.138 --> 00:22:35.141
So how much our attention
is focused internally

00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:39.089
on what we're feeling and how
much it's focused externally.

00:22:39.089 --> 00:22:42.303
And this is always going
to be in a dynamic balance.

00:22:42.303 --> 00:22:46.050
So for instance, if you're
really, really stressed,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.090
oftentimes that puts you in a position

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.270
to be really in touch with
what's going on in your body.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.100
If you start having a lot of somatic,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.480
a lot of bodily sensations,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.062
like your heart is beating so
fast that you can't ignore it,

00:22:56.062 --> 00:22:59.490
then you're really strongly interoceptive.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.040
But also sometimes you're really stressed

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.330
because someone's stressing you out

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.528
or somebody sends you a text message

00:23:03.528 --> 00:23:05.650
or makes a comment about

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.720
a YouTube thing you posted or something,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.070
and you're really triggered by it.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.020
That never happens to me.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.390
But if it does happen to you,
then you're exterocepting.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.430
So these three things,

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.797
how alert or sleepy you are, that's one,

00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:20.640
how good or bad you feel, that's two,

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.473
and then whether or not

00:23:21.473 --> 00:23:23.490
most of your attention
is directed outward,

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.720
or whether or not it's directed inward.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.770
And much of what we call emotions

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.200
are made up by those three things.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.140
And so let's return now to development,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.150
but tuck that away and just
kind of think about it,

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.613
alert versus asleep, good versus bad,

00:23:38.613 --> 00:23:41.430
and focused internally
or focused externally.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.527
Because when I looked at

00:23:43.527 --> 00:23:47.070
all the theories of emotion
that were out there,

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.802
there were a lot of
different components to them,

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:50.390
but they all seem to center back

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.090
to these same three features

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.560
in some way or to some degree or another.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.220
And it can be very powerful to understand

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.499
and look at your emotions
through that lens.

00:23:59.499 --> 00:24:02.630
So let's return to the infant.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.146
There's the baby in the crib.

00:24:04.146 --> 00:24:06.069
It's mostly interocepting.

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:10.270
As caregivers bring it
what it needs, you hope,

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.080
milk, diaper changes, et cetera,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.210
a warm blanket if it's cold,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.290
pull off the blanket

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.220
when the baby's fussing and it's too warm,

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.798
'cause babies get too warm also,

00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:21.923
it starts to exterocept.

00:24:23.037 --> 00:24:24.680
Excuse me, I misspoke,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.513
I want to be very clear,

00:24:25.513 --> 00:24:27.800
it starts to exterocept.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.380
The baby starts to look
into the outside world

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.420
and start making predictions.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.198
It starts wondering how much
it needs to cry or predicting,

00:24:37.198 --> 00:24:40.210
"Well, if I cry like a little bit,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.632
then mom comes over and I get my milk.

00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:48.200
Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't
come over and give me milk,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.732
so I need to really scream
at the top of my head."

00:24:50.732 --> 00:24:55.510
So babies are starting to
evaluate and do all this,

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.858
but they're not doing it consciously.

00:24:56.858 --> 00:24:59.350
They're doing this strategically

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.958
in order to relieve anxiety.

00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:05.300
And I won't propose that that's
what we do into adulthood.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.550
But a lot of what we do in adulthood

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.980
is when we feel something,
we start exterocepting.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.813
Some people are much better

00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:13.530
at just sitting as a container
and just interocepting

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.523
and paying attention to what
they're feeling internally.

00:25:15.523 --> 00:25:18.295
But most people do a little
bit of a balance of both.

00:25:18.295 --> 00:25:19.420
We don't feel good,

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.260
so we look for an item or food

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.400
that might make us feel better.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.080
We're feeling anxious
heading into the dentist

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.913
or something like that,

00:25:25.913 --> 00:25:26.746
so we text somebody.

00:25:26.746 --> 00:25:28.450
We do this almost reflexively,

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.678
it's not always conscious.

00:25:29.678 --> 00:25:33.564
So infants do this, and
we continue to do this.

00:25:33.564 --> 00:25:35.500
We start to now balance our interoceptive

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.762
and exteroceptive focus,

00:25:38.762 --> 00:25:42.170
looking inward and looking outward.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.350
And as we do that,

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.770
we're starting to figure
out what gets our needs met.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.510
Remember, emotions are
really there to form bonds

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.800
and to make predictions.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.880
And so our needs are going to
be met to some degree or not.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.950
Sometimes sadly there is neglect.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.480
Sometimes people don't show up for us

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.830
the way that we would like.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.424
And in general, our responses to that

00:26:02.424 --> 00:26:04.590
have to do with whether or not

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.140
we predict whether or
not they would or not.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.450
When we expect something
and it doesn't happen,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.400
It's a big let down.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.950
That was the discussion
about dopamine last episode.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.620
So the many theories of emotion,
the triune brain theory,

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.480
that you have a primitive
and involved brain,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.488
something that's a little bit
on shaky ground these days.

00:26:20.488 --> 00:26:22.370
The idea that Darwin proposed,

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.476
that there are these universal
expressions of emotions.

00:26:24.476 --> 00:26:27.820
The work of Helen Fisher on love,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.520
that you have circuits in the brain

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.320
for lost circuits in the brain,

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.229
for love and circuits in the
brain for long-term bonds,

00:26:34.229 --> 00:26:36.877
as well as the work of
Lisa Feldman Barrett,

00:26:36.877 --> 00:26:39.410
saying that emotions are contextual,

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.803
that they have a social component.

00:26:40.803 --> 00:26:43.810
And I'll be talking more about this,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.092
but the work of Allan Schore,

00:26:45.092 --> 00:26:49.430
a clinical psychologist
and researcher at UCLA,

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.830
about right brain, left brain,

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.420
and its role in emotional development.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.940
All of them have strong elements

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.660
of this idea of paying attention

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.932
to what's going on inward and outward.

00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:04.622
As a young creature, an
infant and young toddler,

00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:06.620
you were mainly focused inward,

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.040
and you started to understand
what was going on outward

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.500
as a way of predicting what
would bring you relief,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.200
what would remove your anxiety.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.310
And that's where the fundamental
rules of your experience,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.367
your emotional experience were laid down.

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:22.130
And I realized that's a lot of information

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.032
and it's somewhat of an academic talk,

00:27:24.032 --> 00:27:25.686
but there were two tools in there

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:27.090
that I just want to highlight,

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.390
one is the Mood Meter app.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.500
If you're interested in, it
can give you some insight

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.860
into the different kinds
of nuance within emotions

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.978
and allow you to actually
predict emotional states,

00:27:34.978 --> 00:27:37.247
if you want to try that

00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:39.090
and you might find that interesting.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.470
The other one is this idea that

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.094
there are three axes two emotion,

00:27:42.094 --> 00:27:44.369
three continuum that interact,

00:27:44.369 --> 00:27:46.658
the level of alertness and calmness,

00:27:46.658 --> 00:27:48.244
how good or bad you feel,

00:27:48.244 --> 00:27:50.750
and whether or not you're mainly
focused inward or outward,

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.483
because those are going
to form a useful tool kit

00:27:53.483 --> 00:27:55.790
for the information going forward.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.983
So now let's talk about
what kind of baby you were,

00:27:58.983 --> 00:28:03.145
because that actually informs
your emotionality now.

00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:04.680
These are classic.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.106
They're actually famous experiments

00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:08.300
done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.630
Anyone that study psychology

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.900
or has taken a psychology class

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.121
might have learned about this.

00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:14.907
This is this classic experiment

00:28:14.907 --> 00:28:19.745
of what was called the strange
situation task in which,

00:28:19.745 --> 00:28:22.920
and I'm describing it very
coarsely here, I realize.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.033
But a mother and child
come into the laboratory.

00:28:27.033 --> 00:28:29.823
Yes, this is now also
been done with fathers.

00:28:31.053 --> 00:28:35.830
The baby and the mother or
father play together for a bit,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.844
and then the mother leaves.

00:28:37.844 --> 00:28:40.680
The mother leaves for some period of time

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.246
and then comes back.

00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:45.730
And the research is devoted

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.750
to understanding the response of the child

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.650
when the caretaker,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.610
the mother or the father
returns, most all children,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.550
not every child, but
most children will cry

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.340
when their primary caretaker leaves.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.060
They don't like that.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.750
And there are good reasons for that.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.480
They formed a bond and an attachment.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.313
And we will talk about

00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:09.849
some of the deeper chemical
reasons for those bonds.

00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:12.930
However, the experiment is focused

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.200
on the return of the caregiver.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.570
Because Bowlby and Ainsworth,

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.835
and many of their scientific
offspring and colleagues

00:29:20.835 --> 00:29:25.835
identified at least four
patterns that babies display

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.460
when their caretaker returns,

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.830
and they group these
into group a, b, c, d,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.730
so much so that the kids
were referred to as a babies,

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.860
b babies, c babies or d babies.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.150
You may know which one you were.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.050
But the categories are really interesting.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.112
The first babies are the a babies.

00:29:46.112 --> 00:29:47.320
So these were kids

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.254
that would get upset when
their caretaker would leave.

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:52.051
But when their caretaker would return,

00:29:52.051 --> 00:29:55.310
the infant would respond with happiness,

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.670
with what looked like delight.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.910
They would go to the caretaker.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:58.743
They seemed happy.

00:29:58.743 --> 00:30:02.473
If they had been fussy before
or sad, they felt relieved.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.034
These are referred to
as secure attached kids.

00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:10.130
So they have a healthy
response to separation,

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.134
and they have a healthy response

00:30:11.134 --> 00:30:14.396
to re-engaging with the caretaker.

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:16.345
The b babies as they're called

00:30:16.345 --> 00:30:21.119
were less likely to seek
comfort from their caregiver

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:23.650
when the caregiver would return.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.984
So they would sometimes
continue to play with their toys

00:30:25.984 --> 00:30:29.740
or if they had an adult in the room

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.447
while the parent was gone,
they would stay with them.

00:30:31.447 --> 00:30:34.245
It was sometimes complicated and nuanced,

00:30:34.245 --> 00:30:37.503
but these were referred
to as avoidant babies.

00:30:38.561 --> 00:30:40.190
Don't run away with any conclusions

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.013
about the language here just yet.

00:30:42.013 --> 00:30:45.373
It's not clear that avoidant
babies become avoidant adults,

00:30:45.373 --> 00:30:47.500
but bear with me.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.114
The c babies would respond to
the return of the caregiver

00:30:52.114 --> 00:30:54.930
with acts of annoyance.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.635
They seemed kind of angry.

00:30:56.635 --> 00:30:58.640
So it wasn't that they ignored them,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.340
they seem kind of angry.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.900
And those were referred
to as ambivalent babies,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.290
not to be confused with a babies.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.878
These are the c babies,
were the ambivalent babies.

00:31:06.878 --> 00:31:08.800
So the infant's reaction

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.765
to the returning caregiver
were inconsistent.

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:15.310
It seemed like they wanted
to bond with them again

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.499
but that they seem kind of annoyed.

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:19.348
I think we've all felt this way before

00:31:19.348 --> 00:31:21.130
with people that we care very much about,

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.500
especially people we care very much about.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.430
And then the third category, the d babies,

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.900
were the disorganized babies,
that's what they call them.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.511
They weren't disorganized
and that they were messy,

00:31:29.511 --> 00:31:32.771
the child avoided
interactions with everyone

00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:35.686
and acted fearful when
the caregiver returned,

00:31:35.686 --> 00:31:38.210
and their behavior didn't really change

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.070
whether or not the
caregiver was there or not.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.750
And that fourth category was
actually added rather late

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.024
in the course of this research.

00:31:44.024 --> 00:31:47.780
I should mention these
experiments have been repeated

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.823
with a huge variety of different contexts.

00:31:50.823 --> 00:31:52.950
There was work done by Mary Main

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.393
at UC Berkeley and many others,

00:31:55.393 --> 00:31:58.900
looking at all sorts of
variations on this theme.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.240
But over time, it made it clear

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.930
that certain babies
are able to feel secure

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.110
upon re-engaging with their
caregiver and others don't,

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.030
or they're confused about it.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.240
So we probably don't know

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.458
whether or not you were
an a, b or c, d baby,

00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:19.260
unless you were in these experiments

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.070
and somehow you had that knowledge.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.408
But this work, this classic work

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:26.772
opened up a huge set
of important questions

00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:30.200
that relate to what is the reestablishment

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.580
of the bond really about.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.230
I mean, what's actually
being figured out here

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.500
is not whether or not there
are four categories of babies,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.580
that's interesting,

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.370
but it presumably is more interesting

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:45.150
to focus on what is it that
defines a really good bond,

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.730
a secure attachment, or
an insecure attachment

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.258
or an avoidant attachment.

00:32:49.258 --> 00:32:54.258
And the four things are
gaze. literally eye contact,

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.950
and doesn't have to be
direct beaming eye contact

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.950
with no blinks like people
have accused me of before.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.170
It can just be gaze,
people look at each other,

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.540
you see couples, they look at each other,

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.510
they don't always stare each
other long periods of time,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.463
sometimes they do.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.653
Vocalizations, so what
we say and how we say it.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.210
Affect or emotion,

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.177
so the way that we express
it, crying, smiling

00:33:18.177 --> 00:33:22.000
et cetera, and touch, those four things.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.540
And you probably could
add a fifth dimension

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.320
once language and written
language develops,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.740
which is written word,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.780
exchange of letters,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.670
exchange of texts,

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.490
exchange of things of that
sort, emails, are another way

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.400
in which people can bond.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.355
But gaze, vocalization, affect
and touch are really the core

00:33:40.355 --> 00:33:44.453
of this thing that we call
social bonds and emotionality.

00:33:44.453 --> 00:33:46.180
Now that's important.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.290
We know for instance

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.240
that there are brain areas
like the fusiform face area

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.334
which is deep in the brain

00:33:51.334 --> 00:33:54.970
that is responsible for
the processing of faces.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.060
Children's recognition of
their parents' faces and voices

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.842
is extremely accurate and strong.

00:34:00.842 --> 00:34:05.730
Likewise, parents recognition
of their child's vocalizations

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.750
not just voices, but cries are remarkable.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.210
If you've ever had the
experience of being at a party

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.510
with somebody who has small children

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.343
and you're talking to them,

00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:15.750
and all of a sudden they
hear something but you don't,

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.070
it's as if they've got wolf hearing,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.680
and all of a sudden, they go
running into the other room.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.390
And indeed the kid is like, I don't know,

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:23.870
some kid is beating up their kid

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.590
or their kid's beating up some other kid,

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.740
or the kid injure themselves

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.270
or feels emotionally injured.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.626
This perception of voices.

00:34:30.626 --> 00:34:32.600
There's very good evidence

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.190
to support the fact that we are tuned

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.770
to the frequencies of voices

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.790
and vocalizations of
people that we care about.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:39.927
It's not just true in rodents

00:34:39.927 --> 00:34:41.650
and in birds and other mammals,

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.340
it's definitely true in humans as well.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.170
And babies are very tuned in

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.970
to the sound of their mother's voice,

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:48.889
even, yes, while they're in the womb.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.970
There's this whole world of
what's called mother-ease,

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:56.880
which is the particular
style of speech that mothers

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.250
and other caretakers now
we know use with children.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:01.295
So those are the core elements.

00:35:01.295 --> 00:35:04.390
How you look at somebody
and how they look at you,

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:08.344
what you say, what they say,
what they seem to be feeling,

00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:11.210
and how that makes you
feel, smiles, frowns.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.772
If you know someone really
well, you can read inflections,

00:35:13.772 --> 00:35:15.970
like even little subtle things like,

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.460
mm, they don't really believe me,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.690
or, oh they're really excited by this,

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.957
or, oh, now I know what they're thinking.

00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:27.430
That kind of processing,

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.580
some people are better at it than others,

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.010
but everyone's better at doing that

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.850
with people that we recognize and know.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.946
In fact, couples come to know
each other exceedingly well,

00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:38.680
so much so that it can both benefit

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.440
and injure their relationship

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.750
to constantly be making these perceptions.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.583
But there's a range.

00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:46.040
Some people are more tuned
into this than others.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.614
And that probably has roots

00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:50.820
in the sorts of attachments
that you form early on.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.620
So Bowlby and colleagues
develop these a, b, c, d thing.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.435
And it has a lot to do
with face processing

00:35:57.435 --> 00:36:00.580
and gaze and vocalizations and touch,

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.820
all of those happen on
return with the mother,

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.980
but they weren't parsing those,

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.670
they weren't looking at them individually.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:10.113
So this raises a really
interesting question, which is,

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.730
what is it when we feel something?

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:15.810
Is it because of something

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.300
that happened spontaneously
in us, it's a memory,

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.530
or it's something that we
realize, we saw on the internet

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.670
or we got news about somebody?

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.280
Nowadays people get so much information

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.113
about the people they know,

00:36:25.113 --> 00:36:26.970
both the people they like and dislike

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:30.540
by way of viewing online activities.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.760
So they're exterocepting,

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.770
and then it's impacting
your internal state.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.100
And it's clear

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.051
from most all of the
theories of emotional health,

00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:41.124
that an ability to recognize

00:36:41.124 --> 00:36:43.110
when your own internal state

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.298
is being driven primarily
by external events,

00:36:46.298 --> 00:36:50.663
as important for being able
to emotionally regulate.

00:36:50.663 --> 00:36:52.430
People who are constantly

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.162
being yanked around by the
external happenings in the world,

00:36:55.162 --> 00:36:57.236
you would say are emotionally labile,

00:36:57.236 --> 00:37:00.186
they are not in control of their emotions,

00:37:00.186 --> 00:37:02.501
even if they're calm all the time,

00:37:02.501 --> 00:37:04.460
if that calmness only arrives

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.160
because they're in a placid environment

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.430
and then you put a cracker
in that environment

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.760
and they freak out, well,
then they're not really calm.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.930
Their calm in so far

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.300
as there isn't something
disturbing in the environment.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.240
So how much the outside environment

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.724
disrupts your internal environment

00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:20.840
has everything to do

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.340
with this balance of interoception
and an exteroception.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.760
And it very likely has roots

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.610
in whether or not you were secure attached

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:28.840
or insecure attached,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.220
disorganized or ambivalent as a baby.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.340
And of course, you can't
travel back in time and know,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.450
but there are some hints

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.357
as to what kind of
emotionality each of us has

00:37:38.357 --> 00:37:41.630
by examining two periods of development,

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.660
one is adolescence and puberty
and the other is adulthood.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.479
So while we can't travel back in time,

00:37:47.479 --> 00:37:49.728
there is an exercise that you can do

00:37:49.728 --> 00:37:52.804
to address at least in this moment,

00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:55.765
whether or not you have
a bias for exteroception

00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:58.280
or a bias for interoception,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.215
whether or not you are better
at least in this moment,

00:38:01.215 --> 00:38:02.390
at paying attention

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.110
to what's going on
internally or externally.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.328
And of course, this will
vary with circumstance.

00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:10.370
I think we all know people
that, maybe it's you,

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.828
you go to a party and you get there,

00:38:12.828 --> 00:38:14.720
and everyone seems to be talking

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.778
and having a really good time,

00:38:15.778 --> 00:38:17.378
and you're wondering whether or not

00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.370
you have any food in your teeth

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:20.850
or whether or not there's
something on your face

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.740
or whether or not your hair is right

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.903
or whether or not you said
something the wrong way,

00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:27.410
whether or not you're turning red.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.498
People also experience this
a lot with public speaking.

00:38:29.498 --> 00:38:33.990
It's not just about learning
to clamp your level of stress,

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.030
it's also about how much
you're exterocepting,

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.240
how much you're out of
your head, they call it.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.812
But how much you're focused
on the events around you

00:38:40.812 --> 00:38:43.930
versus the events inside you.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.798
Actually, it's interesting

00:38:44.798 --> 00:38:49.201
when you talk to people who
are very effective athletes

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:51.965
or they have very high
stress high consequence jobs,

00:38:51.965 --> 00:38:55.210
they talk about this notion
of getting out of your head.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.580
You only have so much
attentional resource,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.910
and it can be split between two things,

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.887
you'll see that in a moment.

00:39:00.887 --> 00:39:02.950
They can be anchored to one thing.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.763
It can be fully focused on
what's going on internally

00:39:05.763 --> 00:39:08.260
or it can be fully focused on
what's going on externally.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.550
And if you want to be
effective in the world,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.836
effective being in quotes,

00:39:11.836 --> 00:39:16.049
it is useful when in very
dynamic environments,

00:39:16.049 --> 00:39:17.812
especially social environments,

00:39:17.812 --> 00:39:21.090
to have a lot of your
attention focused outward

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.530
as opposed to trying to pay attention

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.050
to whether or not you're
saying things correctly

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.380
or the tambour of your own voice,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.780
that is more or less destructive

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.030
for the ability to engage socially.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.688
So here's the exercise.

00:39:34.688 --> 00:39:35.900
You can do this.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.275
Please don't do this if you're driving.

00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:41.320
But let's just try and illustrate

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.153
or allow you

00:39:42.153 --> 00:39:45.780
to experience this interoceptive,
exteroceptive balance,

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.330
and the extent to which you can move

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.075
interoception and
exteroception deliberately.

00:39:51.075 --> 00:39:54.453
If you close your eyes right now

00:39:54.453 --> 00:39:59.453
and concentrate on the contact
of any portion of your body

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.840
with say the chair or your car seat,

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.673
although please, again,

00:40:02.673 --> 00:40:03.701
don't do this while you're driving,

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.470
anywhere that you are,

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.314
even if you're just standing
up or you're in the kitchen,

00:40:07.314 --> 00:40:08.526
you're laying on the couch,

00:40:08.526 --> 00:40:11.610
and trying to bring as
much of your attention

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.880
to that point of contact as possible.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.713
And then from there,

00:40:16.713 --> 00:40:19.100
you're going to move your
attention even more deeply

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.400
into say the sensation of
what's going on in your gut.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.233
Are you full?

00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:24.066
Are you empty?

00:40:24.066 --> 00:40:24.899
Are you hungry?

00:40:24.899 --> 00:40:26.000
Are you not?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.780
Is your heart beating, at what rate?

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.260
What's the cadence of your breathing?

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.539
Basically bringing your
focus and attention

00:40:31.539 --> 00:40:34.830
to everything at the surface
of your skin and inward.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:37.750
So I'm going to do a rare thing
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.930
I'm going to introduce about
five to eight seconds of silence

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.383
in order to allow you
to do that a little bit.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.570
Now this is an exercise

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.870
that you can continue afterward

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.050
if you want to extend
how long you do this.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.400
But now try and do something that,

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.270
for most people actually
is a little bit harder,

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.331
which is to purely exterocept,

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:10.904
put your eyes or your ears, or both

00:41:10.904 --> 00:41:14.610
on anything in your
immediate space, one thing.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:18.045
And I would restrict that
thing to something small enough

00:41:18.045 --> 00:41:20.700
that at least in your field of view

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.090
it would occupy 20% of your field of view.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.510
So it doesn't have to be a pinpoint

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.130
unless the pin is right in front of you

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.610
and you're holding it real close.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.010
I would say, look across the
room, pick a panel on the wall

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.640
or a leg of a table or something,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.473
and try and bring

00:41:35.473 --> 00:41:38.483
as much of your attention
to that as possible.

00:41:38.483 --> 00:41:42.260
And again, I'll take about
five seconds of silence

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.210
to allow you to exterocept.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.990
So what you probably found is that

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.920
you were able to do that,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.640
but that some degree of
interoception is maintained.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.930
It's hard to place 100% of your attention

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.105
on something externally,

00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:05.017
unless it's really exciting, really novel.

00:42:05.017 --> 00:42:06.895
If you've ever watched
a really great movie,

00:42:06.895 --> 00:42:09.628
presumably you're exterocepting

00:42:09.628 --> 00:42:11.660
more than you're interoceptive

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.058
until something exciting happens

00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:14.240
and then you feel something.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.418
You're actually tethering

00:42:15.418 --> 00:42:18.280
your emotional experience
to something external.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.160
And now you can also do this dynamically.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.960
You can decide to focus
internally and externally.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.960
You can decide to split
it 50%, 50% or 70/30.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.845
You can develop a heightened
ability to do this.

00:42:35.845 --> 00:42:38.270
And the power of doing that

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.390
is actually that when
you are in environments

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.100
where you feel like you're
focused too much internally

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.369
and you'd like to be
focused more externally,

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:47.230
you can actually do that deliberately.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.220
But as you notice, it takes work,

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.730
it involves taking your
attentional spotlight,

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.792
and what we call the
aperture of your attention,

00:42:53.792 --> 00:42:57.455
and narrowing that
aperture to either the self

00:42:57.455 --> 00:43:00.229
or something externally
or splitting the two.

00:43:00.229 --> 00:43:03.010
And yet there are practices

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.890
that have been developed that center on

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.262
moving interoception and exteroception

00:43:09.262 --> 00:43:13.470
from one being more heavily
weighted than the other,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:14.480
more focused outward

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.040
or more focused inward.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.280
And it's dynamic.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.470
And the circuits in the brain

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.767
that underlie intero and exteroception

00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:22.160
aren't exactly known,

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.440
but they are anchored in
the areas of the brain

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.450
that are involved in attention,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:26.690
like the frontal eye fields

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.830
and areas that when you
third-person yourself,

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.670
when you can see yourself doing something,

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.520
like if you put your hand
out in your environment

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.696
and you focus on your hand,

00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:36.370
you know that that's your hand

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:37.730
as opposed to some random object.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.460
There are areas of the brain
that are involved in that,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.020
in recognizing location of self

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.720
relative to the rest of your body.

00:43:46.032 --> 00:43:50.560
These exercises are really
what are at the core

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.820
of these development of emotional bonds.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.610
Because as we mentioned
before, these four things,

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.191
the gaze, vocalization, touch and affect,

00:43:59.191 --> 00:44:02.170
those are happening very dynamically.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:03.600
So if somebody winks at you,

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.950
you're paying attention to their wink,

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.958
but then you also notice how you feel.

00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:08.290
Then they might say something,

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.300
then you might say something,
this is very dynamic.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.520
So if it seems overwhelming

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.870
to try and interocept an exterocept

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.030
and then shift the balance,

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.170
you do that all the time.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.713
Your brain and nervous system
are fantastic at doing this.

00:44:18.713 --> 00:44:21.810
Now, some people have a very hard time

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:25.105
breaking out of a very
strongly interoceptive mode.

00:44:25.105 --> 00:44:26.528
Some people have a harder time

00:44:26.528 --> 00:44:30.320
breaking out of their exteroceptive mode.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.802
It's very interesting note

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:35.110
the extent to which we have biases

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.920
in how interoceptive or
exteroceptive we are.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.266
Remember those three axes
that we talked about earlier,

00:44:40.266 --> 00:44:42.490
you have valence, good or bad,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.900
you have alertness, alert or calm,

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.502
and you have interoceptive
or exteroceptive bias.

00:44:48.502 --> 00:44:51.970
And it's going to differ across the day,

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.900
it's going to differ across the lifetime.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.160
It's certainly going to differ

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.550
according to whatever it
is that you're engaged in.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.600
But early in development,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.951
you start off with this
interoceptive bias.

00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:06.010
You are starting to develop
expectations, predictions

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.177
about how the outside
world is going to work.

00:45:08.177 --> 00:45:12.130
And you are trying to
figure out the reliability

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.768
of outside events in people.

00:45:13.768 --> 00:45:16.165
And where things are reliable,

00:45:16.165 --> 00:45:18.773
when people are reliable,

00:45:18.773 --> 00:45:22.190
we are able to give up
more of our interoception.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:25.890
There's literally trust
that our interoceptive needs

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.610
our internal needs will be met

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.931
through bonds and actions of others.

00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:32.035
This starts to veer toward

00:45:32.035 --> 00:45:34.540
the discussion about neglect and trauma.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.610
We are going to devote entire episodes,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.930
probably an entire month
to trauma and PTSD.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.830
But those have roots in what
we're talking about now.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.340
And it's important to internalize

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.720
and understand what
we're talking about now

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.820
in order to get the most out
of those future conversations.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.070
So if all of this seems like

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.511
a lot of information and very complicated,

00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:57.073
I just invite you to pay
attention from time to time

00:45:57.073 --> 00:46:00.323
how much you happen to be
interocepting or exterocepting,

00:46:00.323 --> 00:46:03.947
because emotions and the
intensity of those emotions

00:46:03.947 --> 00:46:06.160
will grow or shrink

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.930
depending on how much we're interocepting.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.122
If we are feeling extremely sad,

00:46:10.122 --> 00:46:15.122
and there is an outside
event that made us sad,

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.910
chances are there's going to be a balance,

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.713
but that the extreme
grief, the extreme sadness

00:46:20.713 --> 00:46:23.688
is going to lead us to
mostly interoceptive.

00:46:23.688 --> 00:46:27.220
Whereas when we're
feeling extremely happy,

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.114
the same is true.

00:46:28.114 --> 00:46:30.650
Something great happens in the world,

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.710
and we're just going to feel it.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:33.080
Most of our perception,

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.830
most of our awareness is going
to be on our internal state.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.520
So we are always tethered
to the outside world

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.815
to some degree or another.

00:46:39.815 --> 00:46:42.160
That was true when you were an infant,

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.110
and it was true when
you were an adolescent,

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.359
and it's true as an adult.

00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:48.587
So now I want to just pause,

00:46:48.587 --> 00:46:51.030
just shelve the discussion

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.270
about interoception,
exteroception for a moment.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.266
And I want to talk about

00:46:54.266 --> 00:46:57.688
what is arguably the second most, if not,

00:46:57.688 --> 00:47:01.537
equally important aspect
of your development

00:47:01.537 --> 00:47:04.153
as it relates to emotionality

00:47:04.153 --> 00:47:07.030
and as it relates to
this, what I call trust,

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:08.630
but this ability to predict

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.540
whether or not things in the outside world

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.270
are reliable or not reliable

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:14.387
in terms of their ability

00:47:14.387 --> 00:47:17.150
to help you meet your interoceptive needs.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.880
And that period is puberty.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.430
So up until now, we've been
talking mainly about psychology,

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.530
not a lot of biology,
not a lot of mechanism.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:26.980
And now we're going to transition

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.500
into talking about mechanism,

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.270
hormones, receptors, et cetera.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:34.477
Puberty is a absolute biological event.

00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:39.016
It has a beginning, and it
has a specific definition,

00:47:39.016 --> 00:47:42.401
which is the transition
into reproductive maturity.

00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:44.220
So there are a lot of hormonal changes.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.980
Yes, there are also a
lot of brain changes.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.190
And most people don't realize it,

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.450
but the brain changes occur first.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.020
The brain turns on the hormone systems

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.883
that allow puberty to occur.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.470
Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.164
than it did in the past.

00:48:00.164 --> 00:48:03.650
The current numbers
that I was able to find

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.960
is that in females and girls,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.610
the transition is starting around age 10,

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.970
whereas in boys, it's about age 12,

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.845
that's going to differ

00:48:12.845 --> 00:48:14.900
by way of a number of different factors.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.350
Those are averages.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.620
So it depends on where
you are in the world,

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.210
depends on all sorts of things.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.833
One of the primary triggers for puberty

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.921
is actually body fat.

00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:26.622
This is interesting.

00:48:26.622 --> 00:48:31.622
The peptide hormone, leptin,
some people call it a peptide,

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.270
some people call it a hormone,

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:34.920
but it meets both definitions

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.510
depending on how you look
at it, is made by fat.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:42.810
So leptin had a lot of
popularity in the '90s,

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:46.182
because it was discovered
as being produced by fat,

00:48:46.182 --> 00:48:48.480
and it was seen in animal studies

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.350
that it could promote leanness.

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.350
It actually communicates to the brain

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:53.860
that there's enough body fat

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.956
in order to allow the metabolic factors

00:48:56.956 --> 00:48:59.760
and processes to occur
to liberate more fat.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.100
This is why people have trouble

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.740
losing that last five pounds.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.810
It's because leptin levels are very low.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.840
This was actually the basis

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.040
for the whole cheat day, refeed thing,

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:12.040
that the idea was if you
eat a lot for one day a week

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.035
while dieting hard,

00:49:13.035 --> 00:49:15.250
that you can signal to the brain

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.311
that there's enough leptin.

00:49:16.311 --> 00:49:18.130
I don't know if that's the reason

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:19.330
or whether or not the cheat days

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.880
just provided some psychological
relief, probably both.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.880
But in any case, leptin
is made by body fat.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.290
And when there's enough leptin,

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.630
it signals the brain to trigger puberty.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.400
There was a paper
published in the mid '90s

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.295
in the Journal Science, excellent journal,

00:49:35.295 --> 00:49:39.912
showing that leptin could be
injected into younger females

00:49:39.912 --> 00:49:44.420
that would not have yet gone into puberty.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.920
And you could accelerate the
onset of puberty with leptin.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.860
So more body fat, the
earlier puberty, that's true.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.450
Leptin is also involved

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:55.280
in various growth effects
in the body generally.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.572
And it's interesting, very obese children

00:49:57.572 --> 00:50:00.820
don't necessarily undergo puberty earlier.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.190
Sometimes they do, but they
do tend to be larger boned.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.780
Their bones actually grow more quickly,

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.530
and they tend to have higher bone density

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.930
because leptin is also
involved in bone density.

00:50:11.824 --> 00:50:14.048
The whole issue of onset of puberty

00:50:14.048 --> 00:50:17.580
also has some really
interesting social effects.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.830
And I want to really highlight

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.780
that most of these effects,
also called pheromone effects.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.700
Remember a hormone

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.680
is a substance secreted from
one area of the body, travels,

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.330
and impacts tissues and
cells elsewhere in the body.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.420
A pheromone is a chemical

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.900
that's released by one member of a species

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.630
that goes and acts on

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.820
and impacts other members of that species

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.499
or even other species.

00:50:39.499 --> 00:50:42.340
So for instance, rodents are very good

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.750
at detecting the urine

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.450
and the scent markings of large carnivores

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:49.450
that want to eat them.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.653
So that's a pheromone interaction.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.970
Whether or not they're
pheromonal effects in humans

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.200
is very debated.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.480
I did a post on this on
Instagram a little while ago

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.680
about some pheromone effects
that were reported in humans.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.097
And I had a couple of
people come at me saying,

00:51:04.097 --> 00:51:06.630
"Look, it's never really
been shown in humans

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.290
that there's a pheromonal vomer,"

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:09.770
what's called the vomeronasal organ.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:11.600
There's something called Jacobson's organ.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.662
It's rudimentary.

00:51:12.662 --> 00:51:16.610
Some people have it, some people
don't, very controversial.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:17.570
So I want to point out

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.860
that human pheromone
effects are controversial.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.798
Although I think there's, in my opinion,

00:51:21.798 --> 00:51:24.110
there's ample evidence for them,

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.662
synchronization of menstrual cycles.

00:51:25.662 --> 00:51:27.709
Many people report,

00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:29.970
then people say there's some studies

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.162
that show that it's not true.

00:51:31.162 --> 00:51:35.140
Then there've been some
data showing very impressive

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.525
pheromonal effects of female partners

00:51:39.525 --> 00:51:43.750
being able to detect the odor
of their significant others

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.820
on t-shirts that were
washed several times.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.250
So they can't consciously perceive it,

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.480
but they say this one smells like them,

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.030
this one smells like my partner.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:55.176
And indeed, the match
was way above chance.

00:51:55.176 --> 00:51:58.610
So there does seem to be
weak pheromonal effects

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.540
at least in my opinion
when I look at the data,

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.270
but much more needs to be done.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:05.270
So one of the more
interesting pheromone effects

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:08.415
that impacts puberty, at
least in animal models

00:52:08.415 --> 00:52:11.310
is the so-called Vandenbergh
effect, which is,

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.847
if you take a pre-pubertal female,

00:52:13.847 --> 00:52:17.786
so a female that has not
undergone sexual maturation,

00:52:17.786 --> 00:52:21.410
and you introduce a novel male

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.400
that is not the father or
a brother, not a sibling,

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.099
she will undergo puberty
almost immediately.

00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:30.640
So this is really striking.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.473
For years,

00:52:31.473 --> 00:52:33.550
this was thought not to
occur in primate species,

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.522
but there was a paper published last year

00:52:35.522 --> 00:52:38.840
in Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal,

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.161
showing that mandrills, a
particular type of primate,

00:52:42.161 --> 00:52:45.336
they exhibit this Vandenbergh effect.

00:52:45.336 --> 00:52:49.940
There are also all sorts
of other pheromone effects.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.310
There's the most infamous one

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:53.313
is called the Bruce effect,

00:52:53.313 --> 00:52:56.814
where the introduction of a novel male

00:52:56.814 --> 00:53:01.814
to a pregnant female animal
causes spontaneous miscarriage.

00:53:03.788 --> 00:53:07.040
And that effect seems
to be protected against

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.823
by the presence of the father.

00:53:10.046 --> 00:53:12.090
This interpretation of this,

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.270
and I want to really highlight

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.972
that these are animal studies,

00:53:15.972 --> 00:53:18.970
but the way this works

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.731
is that if a pregnant female

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:25.662
is in the company of the
male that impregnated her,

00:53:25.662 --> 00:53:29.030
then her young are protected

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:31.780
by his scent presence or
his pheromone presence.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:35.149
But if he's gone and
a novel male shows up,

00:53:35.149 --> 00:53:39.543
there's a tendency for her
to spontaneously miscarry,

00:53:39.543 --> 00:53:43.840
and essentially for the fetus to be lost.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.500
Now, whether or not this occurs in humans

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.890
is still very controversial,
but nonetheless,

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.960
these pheromone effects exist.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.360
And that one is called the Bruce effect,

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.850
named after Hilda Bruce,

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.761
who is the scientist that discovered it.

00:53:58.761 --> 00:54:00.250
The one that's relevant

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.010
to the puberty discussion
is the Vandenbergh effect,

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.860
which I mentioned a few minutes ago,

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.358
which is a novel male showing up,

00:54:07.358 --> 00:54:10.050
has to be a sexually competent male,

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.488
so he has to have already
passed through puberty,

00:54:12.488 --> 00:54:17.460
and his presence triggers
activation of puberty

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.180
in a female that otherwise

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.710
would have remained
pre-pubertal for longer.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.615
Again, whether or not this
happens in humans is unclear.

00:54:24.615 --> 00:54:29.615
Well, what can we be sure about
when we think about puberty?

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:33.050
Puberty is triggered by a
number of different factors.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.390
There are changes in GABA
expression in the brain,

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.720
an inhibitory transmitter.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.954
One of the more interesting molecules

00:54:37.954 --> 00:54:40.939
that triggers puberty in all individuals

00:54:40.939 --> 00:54:43.610
is something called kisspeptin,

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:48.610
K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.950
Kisspeptin is made by the brain.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:52.917
And it stimulates

00:54:52.917 --> 00:54:55.905
large amounts of all different hormone

00:54:55.905 --> 00:55:00.905
called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone to be released.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:02.481
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

00:55:02.481 --> 00:55:04.404
then causes the release of another hormone

00:55:04.404 --> 00:55:07.818
called luteinizing hormone or LH,

00:55:07.818 --> 00:55:09.719
which travels in the bloodstream

00:55:09.719 --> 00:55:13.406
and stimulates the ovaries of
females to produce estrogen

00:55:13.406 --> 00:55:17.683
and the testes of males
to produce testosterone.

00:55:17.683 --> 00:55:20.523
Kisspeptin has other effects as well.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.780
But those are some of the main ones

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.790
as they relate to puberty.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.670
This is interesting,
because at this point,

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.320
the testes in males

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.320
start churning out tons of testosterone

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.680
in order to trigger

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.700
the development of secondary
sexual characteristics,

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.410
body hair and all the others,
deepening of voice, et cetera.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:43.250
And in females, estrogen is
doing various other things,

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:45.557
breast development, et cetera.

00:55:45.557 --> 00:55:48.379
Normally, in an adult,

00:55:48.379 --> 00:55:50.709
somebody who has passed puberty,

00:55:50.709 --> 00:55:53.960
a big increase in
gonadotropin releasing hormone

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.910
and luteinizing hormone would
eventually be shut down,

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.180
because the way that the brain works,

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.030
the hypothalamus and the pituitary

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:03.710
are actually measuring how
much hormone is in the blood.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:05.540
And if testosterone or estrogen

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.580
or any other hormone goes too high,

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.468
they shut down

00:56:08.468 --> 00:56:10.930
the release of things
like luteinizing hormone.

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.150
It's called a negative feedback loop.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.100
Basically is like a
thermostat in the house.

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.210
It's more complicated than that,

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:19.410
but once levels get too
high in the blood stream,

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:20.430
it shuts down.

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:22.160
But kisspeptin is able to drive

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.620
very high levels of these
hormones in an ongoing way

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:28.350
so that puberty can
commence and can continue.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:31.046
And incidentally,
kisspeptin has now become

00:56:31.046 --> 00:56:36.046
yet another of the panoply of hormones

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:39.290
and peptides and cocktails
that athletes take

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:42.199
in order to try and stimulate
natural hormone production,

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:44.040
essentially to create their own

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.773
performance-enhancing drugs endogenously.

00:56:46.773 --> 00:56:48.930
No judgment there, but that's a fact,

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:51.210
there's a lot of kisspeptin used.

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:53.550
I truly not suggesting anyone do this,

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:56.800
but people are buying
and injecting kisspeptin

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.220
for the specific reason
that even past puberty

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.740
can stimulate the large increases
in things like estrogen,

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.850
large increases in testosterone
and things of that sort.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:09.789
Has a number of psychological effects too,

00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:12.942
seems to have big effects
on libido, et cetera.

00:57:12.942 --> 00:57:15.730
All these things of course
are subject to feedback loops,

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.060
so they don't work indefinitely.

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:18.893
And I'm going to highlight,

00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:20.300
again, I'm not suggesting anyone do it,

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.040
but I do like to pay
attention to what's out there.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.832
And kisspeptin, because it
wasn't discovered that long ago

00:57:25.832 --> 00:57:28.048
is one of the things that
you don't often hear about

00:57:28.048 --> 00:57:31.810
when people talk about
performance-enhancing drugs

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:33.990
or therapeutic endocrinology.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:35.861
These things also have therapeutic uses

00:57:35.861 --> 00:57:39.300
in the endocrine setting.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.380
So for instance, kids
that don't undergo puberty

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.330
or kids that are hypogonadal
or adults that are hypogonadal,

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:45.690
they're not making enough hormone

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:49.780
will take things like
kisspeptin among other things.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.040
So that's how puberty happens
at the biological level,

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.584
gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin.

00:57:54.584 --> 00:57:57.272
And then this young child

00:57:57.272 --> 00:58:02.270
is now a different
creature to to some extent,

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.521
not just because

00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:05.620
they're reproductively
competent, of course,

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.670
but because there's a shift

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:11.573
in a number of the things that
underlie these social bonds,

00:58:11.573 --> 00:58:14.220
there's a market shift

00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:15.480
in a number of the things

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.030
that allow children and adults

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:22.300
to engage in predictive
behavior about each other.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.648
And the whole nature of
adolescence and puberty

00:58:25.648 --> 00:58:30.034
is to take a child that was a generalist

00:58:30.034 --> 00:58:31.920
and to make them a specialist.

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.096
And this is very important

00:58:33.096 --> 00:58:35.830
as it relates to the
conversation about emotionality.

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:40.800
But it's important in terms
of aspects of brain function

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.870
and in terms of learning

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:44.440
and in terms of who
each and every one of us

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.963
will and has become.

00:58:47.132 --> 00:58:49.800
In adolescents and in childhood,

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.769
sure, there are some genetic biases,

00:58:51.769 --> 00:58:54.790
hair color, eye color,
height, and things like that.

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.940
A lot of that's programmed
into the genome.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.167
There are other genetic
biases too of course,

00:59:01.167 --> 00:59:02.727
that we inherit.

00:59:02.727 --> 00:59:06.650
But it's in adolescents in puberty

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:08.520
that we go from essentially

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.857
being somewhat good at a bunch of things

00:59:10.857 --> 00:59:13.650
or somewhat poor at a bunch of things,

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.057
to be coming very good at a few things

00:59:16.057 --> 00:59:18.055
and very poor at a lot of other things.

00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:19.370
And that's because

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:22.006
of the relationship to
puberty and neuroplasticity,

00:59:22.006 --> 00:59:25.160
this ability to change the
brain in response to experience

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.631
is starting to taper off
such that by our early 20s,

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.819
it's harder to achieve.

00:59:30.819 --> 00:59:34.400
Now, the transition from
generalist to specialist

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.820
is one aspect of adolescence and puberty,

00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.230
but the other is the formation

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.800
of social and emotional bonds.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.220
And most of what consumes the minds

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.140
and waking hours of adolescents

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.760
and children who have gone through puberty

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.110
and going through puberty

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:54.362
is questions about how they
relate to social structures,

00:59:54.362 --> 00:59:56.089
who they can rely on,

00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:59.050
and how they can make reliable
predictions in the world,

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:00.640
now that they have more urgency

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.945
that they are physically changed.

01:00:02.945 --> 01:00:04.500
In fact, you could argue

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.240
that puberty is the
fastest rate of maturation

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.400
that you'll go through at
any point in your life.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.300
It's the largest change
that you'll go through

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.073
at any point in your life
in terms of who you are,

01:00:14.073 --> 01:00:16.720
because your biology has
fundamentally changed

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.190
at the level of your brain
and your bodily organs,

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.686
all your organs from the skin inward.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:26.223
So I want to visit a
little bit of the research

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:30.060
about some of the core needs that occurred

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.748
during puberty and adolescence,

01:00:31.748 --> 01:00:33.220
not just for parents

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.290
or for the people that might
be in puberty and adolescence,

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:38.470
but also so that people can reflect

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:42.840
on which of the sort of boxes
were checked off for them

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.363
as they approached emotional maturity.

01:00:46.363 --> 01:00:49.070
So there's a terrific review article

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:52.360
that was published in the
journal Nature, which is,

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.540
if not the premier,

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.101
then certainly among the
top three premier journals

01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:57.960
in the field of science

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.660
about the biology of
adolescence and puberty,

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.570
as well as some of the
core needs and demands

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:07.770
that have to be met

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:11.040
for successful emotional
maturation during that time.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.651
We will provide a link to that,

01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.930
but I just want to highlight

01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:18.230
a few of the things that they
place in the final table.

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:19.777
I don't want to go through
all the results right now,

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:22.113
because you could do that
on your own if you like.

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:23.263
They mainly highlight

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:27.127
a lot of the changes in
neurons and neural circuits.

01:01:27.127 --> 01:01:29.150
For instance, I'll just highlight one,

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:30.414
there's a connection

01:01:30.414 --> 01:01:32.790
between the dopamine centers in the brain

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.010
and an area of the brain

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:37.680
that's involved in emotion and dispersal.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.290
Dispersal is very interesting.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.800
What you observe in animals and humans

01:01:42.725 --> 01:01:45.450
is that around the end of adolescence

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.927
and during the transition to puberty,

01:01:46.927 --> 01:01:51.291
both because of changes in the
brain and changes in hormones

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:56.291
there's an intense desire
on the part of the child

01:01:56.327 --> 01:02:01.327
to get further and further
away from primary caregivers,

01:02:01.653 --> 01:02:04.090
not permanently, they always return,

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:05.960
similar to a child that walks off

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.920
and then looks back and
sees if everything's safe

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.203
and then continues on.

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:11.366
During adolescence and puberty,

01:02:11.366 --> 01:02:13.942
both in animals and in kids,

01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:16.800
it almost seems like
there's a bias for action,

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.633
and the action

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:21.170
is always in a direction away
from the primary caregiver.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.160
Now, as soon as I say that,
I can just imagine in my mind

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.127
that somebody out there saying,

01:02:25.127 --> 01:02:27.500
"Well, no, my kid as
soon as they hit puberty,

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.680
they just want to stay
home with us all the time."

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.860
That's not typical.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.570
It happens, but it's not typical.

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:33.690
Mostly there's a desire

01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:35.740
to start spending more time with friends,

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.130
more time with peers and
less time with adults.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.920
And I find it extremely interesting

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.780
to note that that's not
just true in humans,

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.000
that's true in other primate species.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.360
That's true in rodents.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.729
That's true in almost every
other mammalian species.

01:02:49.729 --> 01:02:52.330
So there's something about these hormones

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:55.063
that don't just allow sexual reproduction.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:56.810
They don't just change the brain

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:59.292
and bodily organs and the shape of us,

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:03.110
they also bias us towards dispersal,

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.430
getting further and further away

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.290
from primary caregivers in particular.

01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:09.010
So parents of teenagers
or future teenagers,

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:10.860
it is not just normal,

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.270
it is baked in to the biology of humans

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:18.190
to disperse around adolescents
and in the teen years.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.740
So again, I just want to
highlight a few of these,

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:21.763
what were listed

01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:24.043
as intervention strategies

01:03:24.043 --> 01:03:27.553
to promote healthy
adolescence and puberty.

01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:29.955
It's very interesting
because the entire article,

01:03:29.955 --> 01:03:34.743
I should mention who wrote
this article, apologies.

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:37.530
One of them is a friend of mine.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:40.450
So the first author is Ronald Dahl,

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:43.053
not the children's book
author, I'm assuming,

01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:45.840
no, from the School of Public Health

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.515
at University of California, Berkeley

01:03:47.515 --> 01:03:51.520
and Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbert

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.560
and Anna Balanoff Suliman,

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.200
forgive me for the
pronunciation of the last one.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.880
I know Dr. Wilbert quite well.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.350
She's done the work on dispersal,

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.458
is quite well known for that work,

01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:06.807
and it's a very extensive review,

01:04:06.807 --> 01:04:10.080
but I think you'll find it accessible.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.890
A lot of changes and
thickness of the brain

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:14.240
at different stages, et cetera.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.840
But I think most people will be interested

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.680
in what that translates
to in the real world.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.564
And what's interesting is during puberty,

01:04:23.564 --> 01:04:26.500
there's increased connection,

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.390
connectivity as we call it
between the prefrontal cortex,

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:31.732
which is involved in
motivation and decision-making,

01:04:31.732 --> 01:04:33.726
being able to suppress action

01:04:33.726 --> 01:04:37.430
for making long-term goals possible,

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:41.200
as well as dopamine
centers and the amygdala.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.610
So there's this really broad
integration and testing.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.230
I think this is the key element here,

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:49.440
testing of circuits
for emotions and reward

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.600
as they relate to decisions.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.007
And I think that's useful because

01:04:53.007 --> 01:04:55.730
when you look at the behavior
of adolescents and teens,

01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:57.530
they are testing social interactions,

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:00.136
they are testing physical
interactions with the world.

01:05:00.136 --> 01:05:02.943
Oftentimes they're engaging
in unsafe behavior.

01:05:05.344 --> 01:05:07.493
I would never try and justify that

01:05:07.493 --> 01:05:09.372
with the underlying neurology,

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:13.570
but the neuroscience points
to increased connectivity

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.900
between areas of the brain that
are related to emotionality

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.470
and to threat detection like
the amygdala, but also reward.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.314
So it's a time of testing behaviorally

01:05:23.314 --> 01:05:26.842
how different behaviors
lead to success or not.

01:05:26.842 --> 01:05:31.230
It's how different behaviors
lead to fear states or not.

01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:32.063
Now, of course you could say that

01:05:32.063 --> 01:05:33.270
of any stage of development,

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:36.730
but it seems like puberty is
a very, very heightened stage

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:39.040
in which testing of contingencies,

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.280
good or bad is taking place.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.190
And of course it's operating in a body

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.820
that's now more capable than the infant.

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:50.150
So an infant can damage
themselves through error,

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.730
but it's harder for them
to damage themselves

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:53.957
through deliberate planning.

01:05:53.957 --> 01:05:55.780
That's why it's important of course,

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.790
to lock up all the
medications in the house,

01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:59.329
make sure infants can't get to them,

01:05:59.329 --> 01:06:02.700
but it's not likely that the infant

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.710
is going to devise an
extremely diabolical plan

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:08.737
to get into the cabinet to
get a certain substance.

01:06:08.737 --> 01:06:10.763
Whereas a teenager might.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.470
So you can start to map the neurology

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.010
onto some of this emotional exploration.

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:19.260
I do realize that this
episode is about emotions.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.529
Puberty is a time in which

01:06:20.529 --> 01:06:25.010
the internal state of
the person or the animal

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:27.267
is being sampled and tested against

01:06:27.267 --> 01:06:29.240
different exteroceptive events,

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.960
only now they are able

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.570
to guide those events with more urgency.

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.950
It's no longer just about
whether or not the caregiver

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:39.330
is bringing you milk or bringing you food.

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:40.787
Now, of course, the parents will all say,

01:06:40.787 --> 01:06:42.550
"Yeah, but I'm paying for
everything that they're doing.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.600
I'm paying for the car and
I'm paying for the food."

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.613
Ah, true.

01:06:45.613 --> 01:06:49.050
But the biology doesn't
care about the source,

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:52.410
the child or the adolescent is now able,

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:55.390
the teen really, is able to now sample

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:59.480
many, many more exteroceptive
events through behavior.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.840
So some of these
recommendations are interesting.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.920
The theory is that one of the motivations

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.038
is to learn to mitigate the
risk of famine and malnutrition.

01:07:08.038 --> 01:07:10.970
As teenagers get older,
they start questioning

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:11.836
whether or not their parents

01:07:11.836 --> 01:07:14.320
are everything they thought they were,

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.535
whether or not they're the
greatest thing that ever was

01:07:16.535 --> 01:07:19.160
or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.330
Including whether or not

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:23.360
they will be able to
provide them resources.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.450
So they test whether or not

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.140
they can actually feed themselves,

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.327
whether or not they
can support themselves.

01:07:28.327 --> 01:07:30.864
Although rarely not,

01:07:30.864 --> 01:07:32.530
certainly it happens,

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:35.390
but rarely are they really
taking care of themselves.

01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:37.560
Although some teens are forced
to take care of themselves

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.967
of course, because parents

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:40.638
and other caretakers aren't available.

01:07:40.638 --> 01:07:45.330
The recommendations that
map to the biology include,

01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:48.200
there's been a big push for
later start times in schools

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.730
to match their shifts in circadian rhythms

01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:52.020
and the need for extended sleep.

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.593
Something we talked about
during the sleep episodes.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:59.418
To insist on sleep interventions for youth

01:07:59.418 --> 01:08:02.940
who are at increased risk
for mental health problems.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.210
Almost every mental
health issue is supported

01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:10.440
by getting regular quality
sleep of sufficient duration.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.732
Sufficient duration is going
to vary from person to person.

01:08:12.732 --> 01:08:16.530
Leveraging different kinds
of social relationships

01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:18.430
that reinforce positive behavior.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.034
This is starting to sound like
kind of a boiler plate stuff.

01:08:21.034 --> 01:08:24.490
And yet, really the goal is during puberty

01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:28.240
to encourage as many
safe forms of interaction

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.896
that allow children, teens,
really and adolescents,

01:08:31.896 --> 01:08:33.210
I keep calling them children,

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.848
but what I mean are children
going through puberty,

01:08:35.848 --> 01:08:38.969
that allow them to test
this thing of autonomy

01:08:38.969 --> 01:08:43.460
so that they can start
to make good assessments

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.800
about their exteroceptive
events that they are selecting

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.480
and how those make them feel internally.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.330
So they're essentially doing a buffet.

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:52.711
The buffet has now broadened

01:08:52.711 --> 01:08:56.020
to not just include the
events and experiences

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.570
that their parents and
other caretakers bring them,

01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:00.550
but they can now expand the buffet

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:03.110
into things that they
can provide themselves.

01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:05.460
And so adolescence and puberty

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.912
is really seen as the
period of development

01:09:07.912 --> 01:09:11.550
in which one self-samples
for these two elements

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.477
that we talked about at
the beginning, which are,

01:09:13.477 --> 01:09:17.870
how do I form bonds and
how do I make predictions

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:19.569
about what will make me feel good

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:22.094
at a level of interoception.

01:09:22.094 --> 01:09:24.641
Some of that might sound
a little transactional,

01:09:24.641 --> 01:09:26.610
that all we're trying to do

01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:29.440
is figure out how we can bond with people

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.046
so we can get what we need
so we can feel how we need.

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:34.340
I think that's true to some extent,

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.880
of course, there's a richer,

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.880
more abstract aspect to
relationships too, which are,

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.950
in relationships you can access

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:45.070
things you couldn't do
before, you can cooperate.

01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:46.320
There's things like teamwork.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.418
You can do all sorts of things.

01:09:47.418 --> 01:09:49.410
But in terms of the biology,

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:51.792
it's clear that there's
this stage of development

01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:54.007
where more autonomy,

01:09:54.007 --> 01:09:56.280
more physical capability

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.368
is triggered by these
hormone changes in the brain,

01:09:58.368 --> 01:10:01.360
and these peptide changes
in the brain and body.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.630
And that nonetheless

01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:05.742
brings us back to the exact same model

01:10:05.742 --> 01:10:07.820
that we started with in infancy,

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:12.552
of alert or calm, feel good or feel bad,

01:10:12.552 --> 01:10:17.010
primarily exterocepting,
primarily interocepting.

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:18.410
So I keep going back to this,

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:20.530
I'm sort of like a
repeating record on that,

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:22.950
because the same core algorithm,

01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:26.790
the same core function is at
play throughout the lifespan.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.009
And that's a useful
framework in my opinion,

01:10:29.009 --> 01:10:32.500
because it allows you to
sort through all the data

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.810
and information that's out there about,

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:36.060
well, this area, the
astria terminalis is active

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.750
or the basal lateral amygdala is active

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.250
or gray matter thickening

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:40.620
or this hormone or that hormone,

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.033
and return to a kind of kernel

01:10:43.033 --> 01:10:45.840
of certainly not exhaustive truth,

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.180
it doesn't cover all
aspects of emotionality,

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.210
but at least establishes some groundwork

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:52.900
from which you can start to evaluate

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:56.159
how different behaviors might
or might not make sense,

01:10:56.159 --> 01:10:58.610
how certain emotional responses

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:00.030
might or might not make sense,

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:03.670
regardless of the age of
the person or the organism.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:06.800
A discussion about emotions
would not be complete

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.706
without talking about the
right brain, left brain stuff.

01:11:11.706 --> 01:11:16.706
And this is a very interesting
aspect of sociology,

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.505
psychology and neuroscience.

01:11:19.505 --> 01:11:22.260
There's a theory of emotional development

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.880
that I find particularly interesting,

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.970
which is from Allan Schore at UCLA,

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.803
that talks about

01:11:27.803 --> 01:11:30.652
how most of our testing
of bonds and relationships

01:11:30.652 --> 01:11:35.100
is this seesawing back and
forth between very dopaminergic,

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.360
so driven by dopamine

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.640
or serotonergic, driven
by serotonin states.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.800
And this starts with infant and
mother or infant and father.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.260
I talked a little bit about
this in the previous episode,

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.178
but just to remind you,

01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:48.250
or for anyone that didn't hear about it,

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.070
that during development,

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:51.340
healthy emotional development

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:56.340
clearly begins with an ability
for the caretaker and child

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.310
to be in calm, peaceful,
soothing, touch-oriented,

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.820
eye gazing type of behaviors.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:06.973
Those really drive serotonin,
the endogenous opioid system,

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:10.940
oxytocin, things are very calming

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:14.060
and are centered around
pleasure with the here and now,

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.110
as well as excited states of
what we're going to do next.

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:19.630
There's actually a characteristic sign

01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:21.812
of the dopaminergic interaction,

01:12:21.812 --> 01:12:26.440
where both caretaker
and child are wide-eyed,

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.370
the pupils dilate.

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:28.900
That's a signature of arousal.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:29.860
They get really excited.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.385
Oftentimes the baby will look
away if it gets really excited

01:12:32.385 --> 01:12:35.184
those are signatures of
dopamine release in the body,

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.526
and in adolescents, these
same things carry forward,

01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:40.310
where their good bonds

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:44.583
are achieved through
hanging around, watching TV,

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.540
playing video games

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.500
or texting together or talking,

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.333
whatever it is

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:53.450
that the soothing local
activity happens to be,

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:56.100
as well as adventure and
things that are exciting,

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.860
so it could be sports,
it could be shopping,

01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:59.880
it could be a summer adventure.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.770
It could be the next big thing.

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.610
And so this kind of
seesawing back and forth

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:08.410
between the different reward
systems seems to be the basis

01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.830
from which healthy
emotional bonds are created.

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:12.500
And I invite anyone
who's interested in this

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:16.133
to look up some of Dr. Schore's work.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.700
I think I misspoke on the last episode.

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:19.630
He's not a psychiatrist,

01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:22.260
he's a clinical psychologist
and psychoanalyst,

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:24.320
but has deep routings in neuroscience.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.814
So I think a fascinating aspect.

01:13:26.814 --> 01:13:29.970
But the way it's framed in his book

01:13:31.112 --> 01:13:32.110
and in some of the language

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:34.440
around right brain, left brain.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.930
And we've all heard this stuff before,

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:39.280
that the right brain is thought
to be the emotional side.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.413
This is the characteristic
thing that you hear out there.

01:13:41.413 --> 01:13:43.770
That the right brain is holistic,

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.080
that it's emotive,

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.200
and that the left brain is
logical, sequential and analytic.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.713
And that's not what Schore was proposing.

01:13:51.713 --> 01:13:54.800
There are some right brain,
left brain differences.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.500
But the idea that the right brain

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.361
is synthetic, holistic and emotive,

01:13:59.361 --> 01:14:00.560
and that the left brain

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.460
is logical, sequential
and analytic is false.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.253
There is zero neuroscience
evidence for that whatsoever.

01:14:08.253 --> 01:14:11.510
We're going to address this in more detail

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:12.990
during a month talking about learning

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.750
and memory and dementia,

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.930
but let's talk about some truths,

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:19.040
some differences between the
left brain and right brain,

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.780
because we can't have a
discussion about emotion

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.730
without doing that.

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:27.340
The left brain, at least for
people who are right-handed

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.130
is linguistically dominant.

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:31.200
Meaning, most of language

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.428
is centered in the left side of the brain

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:36.189
for right-handed people.

01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:38.180
If you are a left-hander

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.280
and you were forced to
become right-handed,

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.940
chances are this is still true,

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:47.330
because of when language
gets laid down in the brain.

01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:48.915
For left-handers,

01:14:48.915 --> 01:14:51.880
people that naturally
write with their left hand

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.125
and always did,

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:56.728
language is still mostly in
the left side of the brain,

01:14:56.728 --> 01:15:00.802
but it's also found more often

01:15:00.802 --> 01:15:02.520
in the right side of the brain.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.810
So it's not as lateralized as we say,

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:06.840
it's kind of distributed between both.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.825
So right-handers,

01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:08.900
most of your language

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.238
is coming from the left
side of your brain.

01:15:10.238 --> 01:15:12.170
Left-handers, it's probably

01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:13.940
a little bit more evenly distributed.

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.120
And there are some variations,

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.780
whether or not you're a
hook righty or a hook lefty,

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.280
there's all sorts of nuance to this,

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.050
but that's the general aspect.

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.412
So language tends to be centered

01:15:23.412 --> 01:15:25.020
in the left side of the brain.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.850
And that includes
lexicon, grammar, syntax,

01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:29.810
all of it, except for one.

01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:31.540
And we'll talk about
one aspect of language

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.940
that seems to be more right brain.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.960
That's very interesting.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.437
There does seem to be
some arithmetic advantage.

01:15:39.437 --> 01:15:43.710
So ability in math in the
left side of the brain.

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:44.543
And I'm going to talk about

01:15:44.543 --> 01:15:46.139
how all this was discovered in a minute.

01:15:46.139 --> 01:15:51.050
And the right brain, however,
is linguistically primitive.

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:52.090
Most people don't realize this

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.690
because the right brain
is always described

01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:54.790
as the emotive side,

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:56.840
it's super emotional and holistic,

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.170
but it's actually
linguistically primitive.

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.003
And there's a way

01:16:00.003 --> 01:16:02.764
that that's been teased
out through experiment.

01:16:02.764 --> 01:16:06.680
It's very good at
manipulating spatial things

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.000
and visual spatial tasks.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.960
It's primarily handling that stuff,

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.562
but it sort of non-language
except one aspect.

01:16:14.562 --> 01:16:16.650
And there isn't a ton
of evidence for this,

01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:19.187
but the evidence is
strong, which is prosody.

01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:23.943
Prosody is the LILting
and falling of language.

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:26.990
So a good example would be Italian.

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.900
I don't speak Italian.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.284
I only know a little bit of Italian,

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.300
but the most of the Italian I know

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.276
is when my Italian
colleagues have said to me,

01:16:34.276 --> 01:16:35.160
[speaks in foreign language],

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.411
which means like what
are you trying to say,

01:16:36.411 --> 01:16:37.360
what are you saying?

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.130
I think I'm getting that right.

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.590
Basically they're saying
I don't speak Italian,

01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:41.600
which is true.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.510
Or because one of them knows
I loves Costello very much,

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.510
they always say [speaks
in foreign language],

01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:49.250
which means big, lazy guy,

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:51.560
which accurately captures Costello.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.906
So even those few examples,

01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:57.516
[speaks in foreign language],

01:16:57.516 --> 01:17:00.010
there's a lot of LILt and fall in Italian,

01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:00.997
other languages, not so much.

01:17:00.997 --> 01:17:02.570
And it varies by language.

01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:04.640
One of the reasons I find
Italian so beautiful,

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.700
not the Italian I speak,

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.318
but the Italian that other people speak

01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:08.990
so beautiful to listen to

01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:10.240
that that prosody

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.020
and the shifts in intonation
are really quite remarkable.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.950
It's almost like a singing song

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:17.360
listening to them speak.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.070
And I used to like to go
to scientific meetings.

01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:20.750
And I always hang out with the Italians,

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.720
'cause I had some good
friends in Italian labs,

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.470
but also 'cause they always
knew where the best food was,

01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:26.670
their standards for food are incredible.

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:29.320
They would rather starve
than eat terrible pasta,

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.352
and the pasta they do find

01:17:30.352 --> 01:17:33.120
and that they're willing
to eat is always fantastic.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.470
But in addition to that,
they always brought a guitar.

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:36.400
They were a lot more fun

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.950
than a lot of my other colleagues

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:39.330
to hang out with at meetings.

01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:40.430
So in any event,

01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:41.984
the right brain is doing things

01:17:41.984 --> 01:17:45.260
that are more about manipulating
spatial information.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.181
And I'll talk about this
more in a future episode.

01:17:48.181 --> 01:17:50.820
This was discovered in
split-brain patients,

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:52.090
the people that lack connection

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:53.467
between the two sides of the brain,

01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:55.540
this had to be teased out

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.900
through very complicated experiments.

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.400
People like Roger Sperry who
won a Nobel Prize for this,

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.396
who was at Caltech,

01:18:00.396 --> 01:18:02.350
Mike Gazzaniga and others

01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:05.820
figured out these lateralized differences.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:09.269
but let's just try and demolish the myth

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:13.670
that the right side is synthetic
and holistic and emotive,

01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:15.950
and that the left side is
logical, sequential, and analytic,

01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:18.370
that you're a left brain
person or a right brain person.

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:19.810
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:21.910
There's no scientific
evidence to support that.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:24.130
And there's a few lesion studies

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:25.320
that can tease out effects

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.276
that make you think
that's what's happening,

01:18:27.276 --> 01:18:29.150
but the really careful work

01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:31.220
points in a totally different direction.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.695
We can't have a complete conversation

01:18:32.695 --> 01:18:36.710
about emotions and bonds
and social connection

01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:38.740
without talking about oxytocin.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.750
Oxytocin has come to such prominence

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.870
in the last decade or so,
and seems to be everywhere.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:44.873
Anytime you hear a discussion

01:18:44.873 --> 01:18:49.274
about neuroscience in the
brain or hormones in the brain,

01:18:49.274 --> 01:18:54.274
oxytocin is released in response
to lactation in females,

01:18:55.286 --> 01:19:00.286
it is released in response
to sexual interactions.

01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:04.484
It is released in response
to non-sexual touch.

01:19:04.484 --> 01:19:07.871
It's released in males and females,

01:19:07.871 --> 01:19:11.119
and indeed it's involved in pair bonding

01:19:11.119 --> 01:19:14.513
and the establishment of
social bonds in general.

01:19:16.015 --> 01:19:21.015
How it does that seems to be
by matching internal state.

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.278
It seems to both increase

01:19:23.278 --> 01:19:26.413
synchrony of internal state somehow,

01:19:26.413 --> 01:19:29.490
maybe it sets a level of
calmness or alertness.

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:31.391
That seems like a reasonable hypothesis,

01:19:31.391 --> 01:19:34.656
as well as raising people's awareness

01:19:34.656 --> 01:19:38.965
for the emotional state of their partner.

01:19:38.965 --> 01:19:40.660
And again, this brings us

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.481
back to this alertness calmness axis

01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:46.673
and this interoceptive,
exteroceptive axis.

01:19:47.569 --> 01:19:49.140
In order to form good bonds,

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.280
we can't just be thinking
about how we feel,

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.920
we also need to be paying
attention to how others feel,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.300
and we're evaluating a match.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:58.740
We're trying to see whether or not

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.500
there seems to be some sort
of synchrony between states.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.919
And oxytocin, both seems
to increase that synchrony

01:20:05.919 --> 01:20:10.423
and increase awareness for
the emotional state of others.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.333
Now I know many of you

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:15.570
are probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons.

01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:17.367
Mirror, neurons, as some of you may know,

01:20:17.367 --> 01:20:19.220
and some of you perhaps may not,

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:22.267
are neurons that were
discovered in animals and humans

01:20:22.267 --> 01:20:25.380
for their ability to respond

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.830
when people engage in
certain physical actions

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:31.240
like lifting of a pen,

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.216
but the same neurons would respond

01:20:33.216 --> 01:20:37.140
when somebody watched
someone else lift a pen.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.780
So they were really mirrors of,

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.479
were representing mirrors of behavior,

01:20:42.479 --> 01:20:44.893
both in self and in others.

01:20:46.168 --> 01:20:49.040
Mirror neurons are very controversial.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.210
There are many neuroscientists
who I respect a lot,

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:53.105
who don't think they exist,

01:20:53.105 --> 01:20:55.850
because they look at the data,

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.780
and the data, at least in their mind

01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:01.019
were over interpreted
in the realm of empathy

01:21:01.019 --> 01:21:04.956
and in assigning value to the
emotional states of others.

01:21:04.956 --> 01:21:06.604
And when I look at the literature,

01:21:06.604 --> 01:21:11.604
my opinion is that indeed
there are neurons in the brain

01:21:12.094 --> 01:21:14.921
that clearly represent
the actions of others,

01:21:14.921 --> 01:21:16.180
but it's not clear

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.510
that they're wired into the
emotion and empathy system

01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:19.900
in any direct way.

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.670
And I think the growing
consensus is that mirror neurons,

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:26.370
while the name is terrific
and it's so catchy,

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:28.330
and encompasses so much

01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:29.950
of what you would love
for it to encompass,

01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:32.120
but that the data don't
really support that.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.050
But this is controversial,
and I'm perfectly happy

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.960
to get experts on here

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.990
that could debate it better than I could.

01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:41.170
There are however neurons in the brain

01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:43.630
that were discovered by my colleague,

01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:46.373
Keren Haroush at Stanford

01:21:46.373 --> 01:21:48.633
when she was working in Noam Ziv's Lab,

01:21:49.991 --> 01:21:54.991
that clearly point to the
fact that primate species

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.670
are making assumptions

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.810
and are trying to predict the behavior

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:03.900
of other members of their species.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:04.733
It's an experiment,

01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:06.180
I don't have time to
go into in real detail,

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.000
we should probably just get Keren on here.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:08.833
For those of you

01:22:08.833 --> 01:22:10.280
that are familiar with
the prisoner's dilemma,

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.160
which is really a model of cooperation,

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.119
you can either cooperate

01:22:14.119 --> 01:22:18.832
or one member of a given
interaction can cooperate

01:22:18.832 --> 01:22:20.100
and the other one won't,

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.148
where you can both not cooperate.

01:22:22.148 --> 01:22:25.010
There are ways in which
you can solve this,

01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:26.273
so-called prisoner's dilemma,

01:22:26.273 --> 01:22:28.460
by looking at previous behavior

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.378
and making predictions about
the likely next behavior

01:22:32.378 --> 01:22:35.690
that the other individual will engage in.

01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:36.990
And there do seem to be neurons

01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:40.623
that are doing these sorts of
predictions or computations.

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:44.234
Again, I'll go into this in
more detail in the future.

01:22:44.234 --> 01:22:46.530
So rather than thinking
about mirror neurons,

01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:47.755
like neurons for empathy,

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:50.256
I think it's more correct

01:22:50.256 --> 01:22:51.940
to think about neurons

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.310
that are trying to predict
the behavior of others.

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:55.460
And that's, as we said,

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:58.830
one of the core features of emotions,

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:01.460
which are to establish bonds,

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.490
and through those bonds,

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:04.010
to be able to predict behavior.

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:07.174
So oxytocin is one
component of this ability

01:23:07.174 --> 01:23:11.450
to predict others' behavior
and to guide our own behavior.

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:13.601
So here's some experiments

01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:17.593
that involve the administration
of intranasal oxytocin.

01:23:18.522 --> 01:23:20.450
Now I think you need a prescription,

01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:21.680
although in some places you don't.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.470
There are people who are
taking intranasal oxytocin

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:26.826
in order to try and increase
the depth of bonding.

01:23:26.826 --> 01:23:29.610
And I don't recommend you do that.

01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:30.650
I've never tried that.

01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:32.520
Whatever oxytocin I've released,

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.463
I've made without an intranasal
exogenous application.

01:23:36.463 --> 01:23:39.550
But what's been reported

01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:43.070
is increased positive
communication among couples.

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:46.620
So people have taken
intranasal oxytocin in studies.

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.210
So that study,

01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:49.043
for those of you like,

01:23:49.043 --> 01:23:50.500
was published in Biological Psychiatry,

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.483
which my psychiatry colleagues
tell me is a fine journal.

01:23:53.483 --> 01:23:54.930
And the title is

01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:57.860
intranasal oxytocin increases
positive communication

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:00.350
and reduces the stress
hormone cortisol levels

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:02.556
during couple conflict,

01:24:02.556 --> 01:24:03.634
they have them fight,

01:24:03.634 --> 01:24:07.559
or they have them fight
with and without oxytocin.

01:24:07.559 --> 01:24:08.658
So interesting.

01:24:08.658 --> 01:24:12.340
Very much in line with
the idea that oxytocin

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.242
is the "trust hormone."

01:24:14.242 --> 01:24:16.920
That's sort of in keeping with that.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.107
That was a 2009 paper.

01:24:19.107 --> 01:24:20.949
There's other evidence, for instance,

01:24:20.949 --> 01:24:25.410
that men report a greater sense
of connection and intimacy

01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:26.660
with their partners during sex

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.736
after taking intranasal oxytocin.

01:24:29.736 --> 01:24:32.670
There are studies in autistic children.

01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:34.986
Giving them intranasal oxytocin as a way

01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:38.934
to try and help them establish
better social connection

01:24:38.934 --> 01:24:42.820
and "empathy" or theory of mind.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.470
I've talked about theory of mind before,

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:48.200
were understanding of what other children

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.160
and adults are experiencing.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:54.012
Oxytocin does seem to create
these general effects,

01:24:54.012 --> 01:24:58.850
and how nuanced they are in
one situation or another,

01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:59.860
I don't know.

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.420
I'm aware and I was told,

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.930
and I'm definitely not recommending this,

01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:07.390
that there's a marketed
oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.

01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:08.662
Now I have no idea.

01:25:08.662 --> 01:25:10.470
Maybe someone can put in the comments

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:14.240
why you'd want to combine
oxytocin and ketamine.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.672
I can't imagine why.

01:25:15.672 --> 01:25:18.250
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.036
that's used for the treatment of PTSD.

01:25:20.036 --> 01:25:22.373
It used to be used as a recreational drug.

01:25:22.373 --> 01:25:27.373
It's very similar to PCP,
seems quite dangerous in fact.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:32.135
I don't know why those two
things would be combined,

01:25:32.135 --> 01:25:34.670
why one would want to combine them.

01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.020
But there are products out there

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.590
that seem to combine those two things.

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:41.620
And I'm not certain why one would do that,

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.220
but it's interesting to
note that it's happening.

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.910
A particularly interesting
study about oxytocin is that,

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:49.670
that was published in the
journal, Neuroscience,

01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:50.503
which is a good journal,

01:25:50.503 --> 01:25:53.440
that oxytocin modulates

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:56.047
social distance between males and females.

01:25:56.047 --> 01:25:57.510
So that's interesting.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:59.474
What they did is they gave oxytocin

01:25:59.474 --> 01:26:03.500
to people that were in
monogamous relationships,

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.650
and then they evaluated
the extent to which the,

01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:07.483
in this case,

01:26:07.483 --> 01:26:08.460
the males in those relationships

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.840
would pay attention to visual attention

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.120
to attractive other potential partners.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:14.953
And it seemed like

01:26:14.953 --> 01:26:16.860
that the general takeaway from this study

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.610
is that oxytocin administration

01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:20.930
seemed to promote monogamous behavior.

01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:22.290
So behavior that wasn't in line

01:26:22.290 --> 01:26:24.450
with monogamy of the
relationship that they were in

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:28.040
as opposed to a foraging
for potentially new mates.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.290
Now of course, these are
somewhat artificial experiments

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:31.620
or very artificial experiments,

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.400
depending on how you interpret them.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.170
But the general theme

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:40.010
is that oxytocin is promoting monogamy,

01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:41.510
it's promoting pair bonding,

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:42.380
it's promoting

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:46.286
a understanding of the
internal state of others,

01:26:46.286 --> 01:26:49.360
which requires enhanced exteroception

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.890
for those particular others.

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:54.070
So not just generally
having them look everywhere

01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:55.250
and see what's going on in the world,

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:56.799
but particularly paying attention

01:26:56.799 --> 01:26:59.222
to the emotional states of others.

01:26:59.222 --> 01:27:01.167
I'm sure several of you will be asking,

01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:03.186
"Well, what can I do
to increase oxytocin,"

01:27:03.186 --> 01:27:04.425
if that's your goal.

01:27:04.425 --> 01:27:05.710
There's some evidence.

01:27:05.710 --> 01:27:06.630
And I invite you again

01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:11.160
to go to examine.com or
another such site like PubMed

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.473
if you want to forage PubMed,

01:27:12.473 --> 01:27:16.340
that vitamin D is required
for proper production,

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.190
and in some cases

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:20.610
can increase levels of
oxytocin when supplemented,

01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:21.730
which is interesting.

01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:23.860
And that believe it or not, melatonin,

01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:24.950
or old friend melatonin,

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:29.370
which I have pushed back against
as a supplement for sleep,

01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:32.210
because of what I view

01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:35.278
as untoward side effects
of melatonin in most cases,

01:27:35.278 --> 01:27:38.152
but it seems like melatonin in some cases

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:41.680
can prime the system

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.690
for slightly increased oxytocin release.

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:45.870
There's even one report,

01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:48.240
although it didn't look that strong to me

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.850
that low doses of caffeine
could increase oxytocin release.

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.550
But that to me falls under the category

01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.100
of what was once described

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:59.630
as a drug when injected
into a person or animal

01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:02.810
is always effective at
producing a scientific paper.

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.210
Meaning that you can get a result,

01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:06.200
but the result isn't always so robust.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.530
So you always want to read past
the titles and the abstracts

01:28:08.530 --> 01:28:10.310
and get into the meat of the paper.

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:11.143
And when I did that,

01:28:11.143 --> 01:28:13.240
the effects were pretty negligible

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.560
with caffeine on oxytocin.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.910
But it's interesting that
vitamin D and melatonin

01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:19.640
may have some positive
effects on oxytocin release.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.530
But like I said,

01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:22.004
many people are just taking oxytocin

01:28:22.004 --> 01:28:24.770
directly through these intranasal sprays.

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:28.270
I'm pretty sure it's prescription
in most places, but check.

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.360
And again, I'm not
recommending anybody do that.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.193
I've never tried it.

01:28:31.193 --> 01:28:32.300
I don't know that I will.

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.300
I think I'm going to stick with
the oxytocin that I've got.

01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.730
The other molecule that we make

01:28:36.730 --> 01:28:39.812
that's extremely important for
social bonds and emotionality

01:28:39.812 --> 01:28:41.940
is one that we're going to talk about more

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.792
in the month on hormones,
that's vasopressin.

01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:48.733
Vasopressin suppresses urination.

01:28:50.112 --> 01:28:51.298
It's made by the body,

01:28:51.298 --> 01:28:53.970
but it was developed as a treatment

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:55.850
for something called diabetes insipidus,

01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:57.635
where people urinate excessively,

01:28:57.635 --> 01:28:59.576
and they actually risk dehydration

01:28:59.576 --> 01:29:02.030
and they can lose a lot of
electrolytes, et cetera.

01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:03.527
So it causes water retention.

01:29:03.527 --> 01:29:06.960
Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.390
So large amounts of alcohol,

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:11.940
many people excrete, a
lot of fluid and so forth.

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.705
Vasopressin has effects
on the brain directly.

01:29:14.705 --> 01:29:18.444
It actually creates
feelings of giddy love.

01:29:18.444 --> 01:29:22.710
It also increases memory
in very potent ways.

01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:24.606
There's a whole biohacking community

01:29:24.606 --> 01:29:28.709
that has been dabbling with
vasopressin for some time.

01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:30.090
I have never tried it.

01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.020
I certainly don't recommend it.

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.950
It is prescription.

01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:37.517
It is a pretty serious
compound to start messing with,

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.040
because it has so many
different effects in the body.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.141
It's interesting because it
creates the sense of giddy love.

01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:49.706
It's also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac,

01:29:49.706 --> 01:29:51.778
so it's similar to oxytocin.

01:29:51.778 --> 01:29:54.000
It also has very interesting effects

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.827
on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior.

01:29:56.827 --> 01:29:59.490
This, again, we will
revisit in the future.

01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:02.380
But there's a beautiful set of experiments

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.500
that have been done in
a little rodent species

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.910
called a prairie vole.

01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:06.743
It turns out

01:30:06.743 --> 01:30:08.130
there are two different
populations of prairie voles,

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.130
some are monogamous,

01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:12.750
they always meet with the
same other prairie vole,

01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:16.300
and some are very robustly non-monogamous,

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.680
they mate with as many other
prairie voles as they can.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.750
And turns out that levels of vasopressin

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.680
and/or vasopressin receptor

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.627
dictate whether or not
they're monogamous or not.

01:30:24.627 --> 01:30:27.168
And there's actually some
interesting evidence in humans.

01:30:27.168 --> 01:30:29.520
When people report their behavior,

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.034
assuming they're reporting accurately,

01:30:31.034 --> 01:30:33.498
that vasopressin and vasopressin levels

01:30:33.498 --> 01:30:35.006
can relate to monogamy

01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:37.430
or non-monogamy in humans as well.

01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:41.010
We're going to talk about
this in the month on hormones.

01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:42.810
If we're talking about the
neuroscience of emotions,

01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:44.542
we have to talk about the vagus nerve.

01:30:44.542 --> 01:30:47.840
I described what the vagus
nerve is in a previous episode,

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.260
that it's these connections

01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.560
between the body and the viscera,

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.100
including the gut, the heart, the lungs

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:55.040
and the immune system and the brain,

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.570
and that the brain is also
controlling these organs.

01:30:57.570 --> 01:30:58.983
So it's a two-way street.

01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:02.105
There's this big myth out
there that I mentioned before,

01:31:02.105 --> 01:31:05.465
that stimulating the vagus in various ways

01:31:05.465 --> 01:31:07.050
leads to calmness.

01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:08.664
That it's always going to calm you down.

01:31:08.664 --> 01:31:10.680
And that is false.

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.400
I just want to repeat
that is completely false.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.040
In fact, it was just
paper, yet another paper

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.210
published the other day,

01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:18.820
which is fantastic, which
is from David McCormick Lab

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:19.741
up at the University of Oregon.

01:31:19.741 --> 01:31:22.491
It's published in Current
Biology, excellent journal,

01:31:22.491 --> 01:31:24.824
showing, I'm just reading the title,

01:31:24.824 --> 01:31:28.700
vagus nerve stimulation
induces widespread cortical,

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:31.340
the neocortex and behavioral activation.

01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:32.918
I've read the paper, it's fantastic.

01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:35.255
It illustrates yet again,

01:31:35.255 --> 01:31:38.480
stimulation of the vagus
increases dopamine release,

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.836
increases activation
of the brain alertness.

01:31:41.836 --> 01:31:45.260
It is a stimulant of alertness,

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.800
it is not calming people down.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.809
Now this is interesting
in light of emotionality

01:31:50.809 --> 01:31:55.670
because of work that's
been done by many groups,

01:31:55.670 --> 01:31:56.930
but in particular,

01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:58.820
I'm going to focus on the
work of a colleague of mine,

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.410
Karl Deisseroth at Stanford,
who's a psychiatrist,

01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:02.801
but has also developed a lot of tools

01:32:02.801 --> 01:32:07.180
to adjust the activity
of neurons in real time

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.644
using light and electrical
stimulation and so forth.

01:32:09.644 --> 01:32:12.670
I'll refer you to an
article in the New Yorker

01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:14.240
that was published about
this a few years ago

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.940
I'm going to read a brief excerpt.

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.159
I'll put the link in the caption as well.

01:32:18.159 --> 01:32:23.087
He's talking to an extremely
suicidal depressed patient

01:32:23.087 --> 01:32:26.440
who has a small device implanted

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.070
that allows her to adjust
her vagus nerve activity.

01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:30.360
Now vagus stimulation

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.910
was originally developed for
the treatment of epilepsy.

01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:35.762
It's now being used for
various other purposes.

01:32:35.762 --> 01:32:40.660
Vagus stimulation can even
increase plasticity, it seems.

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:43.470
So again, increasing activity of the vagus

01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:44.397
increases alertness,

01:32:44.397 --> 01:32:48.160
and it's just incredible to
see what happens in real time

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.884
to emotionality when
the vagus is stimulated,

01:32:50.884 --> 01:32:54.760
again, not calming, but
activating alertness.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.280
They're in his office and they're talking,

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.400
and he asks her how she's doing,

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.547
and she describes how
she's been doing previously

01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.550
as "going pancake,"

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:08.460
which for her just means
totally laid out flat,

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:09.572
not much going on.

01:33:09.572 --> 01:33:13.080
She talks about how she
doesn't want to pursue a job.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.157
She's really depressed.

01:33:14.157 --> 01:33:18.947
And he says in typical
good psychiatrist fashion,

01:33:18.947 --> 01:33:20.320
"Well, that's a lot to think about,"

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.620
that's actually the quote.

01:33:23.107 --> 01:33:26.150
And they talk about her
blood pressure, et cetera.

01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:27.848
And then she says,

01:33:27.848 --> 01:33:30.350
mood's been down, just spiraling down,

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:33.361
talks about insomnia,
bad dreams, low appetite.

01:33:33.361 --> 01:33:35.800
So this is severe depression.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.061
This is what we call major depression.

01:33:37.061 --> 01:33:39.147
And then she requests,

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:43.110
"Can we please go up to
1.5 on vagus stimulation?"

01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:45.448
She'd been receiving 1.2 milli amps

01:33:45.448 --> 01:33:48.062
of stimulation every five
minutes to 30 seconds

01:33:48.062 --> 01:33:50.613
but was no longer able
to feel the effects.

01:33:50.613 --> 01:33:51.547
So he says,

01:33:51.547 --> 01:33:53.030
"Okay, I think we can go up a little,

01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:54.580
you're tolerating things well."

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.767
They start the stimulation and,

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:03.437
"In the course of the next few
minutes," her name was Sally,

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:06.040
"underwent a remarkable
change, her frown disappeared.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.065
She became cheerful,

01:34:07.065 --> 01:34:08.810
describing the pleasure she'd had

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:09.810
during the Christmas holiday

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:10.990
and recounting how she'd recently

01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:13.243
watched some YouTube videos of Deisseroth.

01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:17.026
She was still smiling and
talking when the session ended,

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:19.420
and they walked out to
the reception area."

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.940
So this is just by stimulating
and activating the vagus.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.190
Now why am I bringing this up?

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:27.680
Well, for several reasons, one
is the vagus is fascinating

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.160
in terms of the brain body connection,

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.135
two, I'd like to, trying
to dispel the myth

01:34:33.135 --> 01:34:35.980
that vagus stimulation
is all about being calm,

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.086
it's really about being alert.

01:34:37.086 --> 01:34:39.830
I don't know how that
originally got going backwards,

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:41.933
but it's about being alert.

01:34:41.933 --> 01:34:46.150
And once again, level of
alertness or level of calmness

01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:47.830
is impacting emotion,

01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:49.761
that this axis of alertness and calmness

01:34:49.761 --> 01:34:54.430
is one primary axis in emotion.

01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:55.550
It's not the only one,

01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:58.546
because there's also this
valence component of good or bad.

01:34:58.546 --> 01:35:00.440
Those two aren't the only ones,

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.660
because there's also this component

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.330
of interoceptive, exteroceptive

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:04.210
that we talked about earlier.

01:35:04.210 --> 01:35:05.710
And there will be others too.

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:07.220
Again, it's not exhaustive.

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.257
But I find it fascinating,

01:35:08.257 --> 01:35:11.200
and it really brings us
back to where we started,

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.209
which is what are the
core elements of emotion,

01:35:13.209 --> 01:35:15.220
and what can you do about them?

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:18.990
And before we close up today,
I just want to make sure that

01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:20.360
even though I've mentioned some tools,

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.840
I talked about the Mood Meter app,

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.187
I talked about oxytocin

01:35:25.187 --> 01:35:27.236
and some of the things
that impact oxytocin,

01:35:27.236 --> 01:35:29.830
I talked about some of the ways

01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:31.919
that you can conceptualize emotions.

01:35:31.919 --> 01:35:34.700
This business of how you
conceptualize emotions

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:37.760
is really the most powerful
tool you can ever have

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.850
in terms of understanding

01:35:39.850 --> 01:35:41.490
and regulating your emotional state.

01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:44.400
If you're willing to try and
wrap your head around it,

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.760
I realize it's not the
simplest thing to do.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.640
But rather than think of
emotions as just these labels,

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.743
happy, sad, or depressed,

01:35:52.743 --> 01:35:55.631
thinking about emotions, excuse me,

01:35:55.631 --> 01:36:00.242
as elements of the brain and body

01:36:00.242 --> 01:36:03.000
that encompass levels of alertness

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.570
that include a dynamic
with the outside world

01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:07.427
and your perception of
your internal state.

01:36:07.427 --> 01:36:10.300
And starting to really
think about emotions

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.411
in a structured way

01:36:11.411 --> 01:36:14.400
cannot only allow you to understand

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.460
some of the pathology

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.190
of when you might feel
depressed or anxious

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:19.415
or others are depressed and anxious,

01:36:19.415 --> 01:36:20.950
but also to develop

01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:23.810
a richer emotional experience to anything.

01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:25.190
Now of course, I don't expect that

01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:27.610
as you're out there
interacting with friends

01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:29.520
and you're watching TV
and experiencing life,

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.590
that you should be parsing
every bit of your experience

01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:34.860
in some sort of reductionist
and mechanistic way.

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:35.994
That's not the goal here.

01:36:35.994 --> 01:36:37.842
But for those of you
that are practitioners,

01:36:37.842 --> 01:36:39.720
teachers of any kind,

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.970
for those of you that are kids,

01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:43.980
for those of you that
are trying to understand

01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:46.190
what your emotional life
and your consciousness,

01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:47.408
dare I say the word,

01:36:47.408 --> 01:36:49.080
really consists of,

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.884
I do believe that these
are fundamental elements

01:36:51.884 --> 01:36:54.420
that are well-supported by the science

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:56.009
across a variety of researchers

01:36:56.009 --> 01:36:59.512
doing things from a variety
of different perspectives

01:36:59.512 --> 01:37:01.500
and some of whom agree with one another

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.720
and some of whom don't.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.950
So I offer it to you as
a source of knowledge

01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:08.200
from which you can start

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.973
to think about your emotional
life differently, I hope,

01:37:11.973 --> 01:37:13.690
as well as others

01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:16.350
in a way that builds more
richness into that experience,

01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:18.510
not that detracts from it.

01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:20.813
One last point as it relates to that,

01:37:20.813 --> 01:37:24.610
many of you have asked me
about psychedelic therapies

01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:27.869
that are now emerging, things
like psilocybin and MDMA,

01:37:27.869 --> 01:37:29.820
we are of course

01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:32.300
going to dive into that topic deeply.

01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:35.181
We have an expert guest coming
on to discuss that topic.

01:37:35.181 --> 01:37:40.181
Those compounds clearly affect
the aspects of emotionality

01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:42.921
that we were talking about today,

01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:47.290
calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad,

01:37:47.290 --> 01:37:50.548
interoceptive, exteroceptive positioning.

01:37:50.548 --> 01:37:55.390
And so rather than just do a
kind of cursory exploration

01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:56.250
of those compounds

01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:58.350
and what the therapeutic
and scientific community

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.809
is thinking about them
and how they function,

01:38:00.809 --> 01:38:02.700
I think it's more important

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.934
to embed that framework in our thinking

01:38:04.934 --> 01:38:07.480
so that when we address psychedelics

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.048
and we address other sorts of therapies,

01:38:09.048 --> 01:38:10.608
cognitive behavioral therapy,

01:38:10.608 --> 01:38:12.535
different types of emotive therapies

01:38:12.535 --> 01:38:15.648
that relate to individuals
and couples et cetera,

01:38:15.648 --> 01:38:18.485
that we are able to think about them

01:38:18.485 --> 01:38:20.658
with some sort of structure and rigor

01:38:20.658 --> 01:38:23.669
rather than just talk about
them as a bunch of chemicals

01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:25.698
that produce these amazing experiences

01:38:25.698 --> 01:38:28.130
that people need to tell you about.

01:38:28.130 --> 01:38:29.820
Because if there's one truth,

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.830
it seems that psychedelic
seem to promote activity

01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:35.240
of storytelling about
psychedelic experience.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.730
But that itself is not really
what the therapeutic community

01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:41.462
and the academic communities
are interested in,

01:38:41.462 --> 01:38:43.478
they're interested in trying to understand

01:38:43.478 --> 01:38:45.303
the universal truths,

01:38:45.303 --> 01:38:48.940
the universal biological
shifts and psychological shifts

01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.840
that occur in the clinical
use of those compounds.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.560
And so we're going to hold off for now,

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.010
but we will get to them.

01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:56.040
Once again, we've covered

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.840
an enormous amount of material today.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.130
It's really the equivalent of two

01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:02.649
if not three university
lectures in one podcast episode.

01:39:02.649 --> 01:39:05.657
I want to thank those of you
that have supported the podcast

01:39:05.657 --> 01:39:07.221
and point to ways in which

01:39:07.221 --> 01:39:08.921
all of you can support the podcast.

01:39:08.921 --> 01:39:11.158
Many of these are cost-free.

01:39:11.158 --> 01:39:13.459
The first is to please
subscribe on YouTube

01:39:13.459 --> 01:39:16.600
and as well to hit the
notifications button

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.564
so that when we release new videos,

01:39:18.564 --> 01:39:20.448
which typically is every Monday

01:39:20.448 --> 01:39:21.890
for the full length episodes,

01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:23.274
but we also know how short clips,

01:39:23.274 --> 01:39:25.599
that you'll be notified.

01:39:25.599 --> 01:39:29.248
As well if you could subscribe
on Apple and Spotify,

01:39:29.248 --> 01:39:31.750
and leave us a review on Apple.

01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:33.810
You have the opportunity to
leave us a five-star review

01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:35.670
if you think we deserve
a five-star review.

01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:38.350
Please tell your friends
and family and co-workers

01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:39.183
about the podcast

01:39:39.183 --> 01:39:40.062
if you think the material

01:39:40.062 --> 01:39:42.921
would be of interest and
informative for them,

01:39:42.921 --> 01:39:45.962
and if you want to send them
links, that's terrific too.

01:39:45.962 --> 01:39:48.175
We also have a Patreon account.

01:39:48.175 --> 01:39:51.880
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.683
And there you can support us
at any level that you like.

01:39:54.683 --> 01:39:57.410
In addition, if you could
check out our sponsors,

01:39:57.410 --> 01:40:00.422
we always provide links to
those sponsors in the captions.

01:40:00.422 --> 01:40:03.020
That's the best way to
support the podcast.

01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.895
And several of you have
asked about supplements.

01:40:05.895 --> 01:40:08.670
I talk about supplements
in various episodes.

01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:09.900
We've partnered with Thorne

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.660
because we think Thorne

01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:13.442
has the very highest levels of stringency

01:40:13.442 --> 01:40:15.757
in terms of the purity of the contents

01:40:15.757 --> 01:40:18.030
and the amounts of the contents.

01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:20.650
They really put in the bottle
what's listed on the bottle,

01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:23.107
which is not true for a lot
of supplement companies.

01:40:23.107 --> 01:40:25.510
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:27.080
as well as get a discount on those

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:29.370
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes,

01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:33.826
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:40:33.826 --> 01:40:36.678
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

01:40:36.678 --> 01:40:39.120
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.120
So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E
dotcom slash the letter U

01:40:45.263 --> 01:40:47.200
slash Huberman

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.303
to get 20% off any
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:40:50.303 --> 01:40:52.760
And last but certainly not least,

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.714
I want to thank you for
your time and attention.

01:40:54.714 --> 01:40:57.203
And thank you for your
interest in science.
