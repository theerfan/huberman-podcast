00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.880
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.208
for everyday life.

00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:09.290
[Upbeat music]

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.190
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.040
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.210
Today, we are going to
talk about the biology,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.931
psychology and utility of play.

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:23.410
Play is something that
normally we associate

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.200
with children's games

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.740
and indeed with being a child,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.820
much of our childhood
development centers around play,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.320
whether or not it's organized play

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.570
or spontaneous play,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.320
but as adults, we also need to play.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.030
And today I'm going to talk about

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.290
what I like to refer to
as The Power of Play.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.600
The Power of Play,
resides in plays ability

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630
to change our nervous system

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.630
for the better,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.500
so that we can perform many activities,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.490
not just play activities, better.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.110
Play can also function

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.890
as a way to explore new ways of being

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.830
in different scenarios in work,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.480
in relationships, in settings of all kind,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.610
and indeed also in the
relationship to oneself.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.443
In fact,

00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:10.220
we are going to explore how
assuming different identities

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.900
during the same game of play

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.720
or the same forms of play

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.634
has been shown to be immensely powerful

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:18.140
for allowing people

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.080
to engage in more creative thinking

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.800
and dynamic thinking and
indeed to better leaders

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.140
and more effective workers

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.534
and students and learners
and happier people.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:29.800
I'm also going to cover
some data that shows

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.290
that learning to play properly

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.210
can enhance one's ability to focus

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.590
and is an active area of research

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.470
for treatment of things like ADHD,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.660
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.130
just as a little sneak preview
of where that's headed,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.960
children who do not access enough play

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.830
during certain stages of childhood

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.100
are more prone to develop ADHD.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.933
The good news,

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.500
is all of us regardless of
whether or not we have ADHD

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.333
or not,

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.850
whether or not we had ample access to play

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.790
during childhood or not,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.824
can engage and grow the neural circuits

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:07.817
that allow for this
incredible power of play.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:10.290
And this can be done again
at any stage of life today.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.520
We're going to talk about the protocols,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.330
the science, we will review all of that.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.850
And I promise you'll come away

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.786
with a lot of knowledge,

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:17.570
whether or not you're a parent,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.800
whether or not you're a child,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.710
whether or not you're a person of any age,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.610
you're going to have tools

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.670
and knowledge that will benefit you.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.503
Before we begin,

00:02:24.503 --> 00:02:25.420
I want to share with you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.370
the results of what I think
to be an extremely exciting

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.030
and certainly an actionable study

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.330
that was just published in the
journal Scientific Reports.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.250
This is an excellent journal
Nature Press journal,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.800
Peer Reviewed, et cetera,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.900
and the finding center around

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.970
what sorts of devices we
happen to be reading on

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.280
and accessing information on

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.920
and how that's impacting our physiology

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.940
and our capacity to learn.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.610
One of the more frequent questions I get

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.160
is what are all these
devices, phones, tablets,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.730
computers, video games et cetera,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.270
doing to our brains.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.103
And finally,

00:02:58.103 --> 00:02:59.530
there's some good Peer reviewed data

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.000
to look at that and to
address it directly.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.840
This study, first author Honma

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.640
H O N M A

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.220
Honma et al,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.053
is entitled

00:03:09.053 --> 00:03:12.020
"Reading on a smartphone
affects sigh generation.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.820
That's SIGH sigh generation

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.750
brain activity and comprehension."

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.653
And to just summarize what they found,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.040
they ran a study on 34 healthy individuals

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.420
and had them either read
material on a smartphone

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.233
or on regular printed paper or a book.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.590
And what they found is that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.671
comprehension on devices
in particular smartphones

00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:40.130
is much poorer much worse than it is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.650
when one reads on actual paper.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.030
Now some of you may
experience this yourselves.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.610
Now they compared smartphones with paper.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.050
And what they found was

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.810
that when they looked
at people's breathing,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.290
the normal patterns of breathing

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.500
that people were engaging in

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.510
did not differ between people
reading on a smartphone

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.740
or reading from paper.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.080
However, one particular feature
of breathing did differ.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.730
And that particular
feature is what we call

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.130
physiological sighs.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.940
I've talked a lot about
physiological sighs on this podcast,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.960
and on social media,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.470
we had a terrific guest,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.780
Professor, Jack Feldman from

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.230
University of California Los Angeles.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.250
Who's a world expert in
breathing and respiration

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.860
and its impacts on the brain

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.450
and how brain controls
breathing and respiration

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.230
and what you can learn from that episode.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.390
Or I'll just tell you again right now,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.720
is that every five minutes or so,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.180
whether or not we are asleep or awake,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.910
we do what's called a physiological sigh,

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.750
which is a big, deep inhale,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.230
often a double inhale
followed by a long exhale.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.323
It goes something like this.

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:40.361
[Inhaling]

00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.440
[Sighs]

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.850
Now you might think, oh,
I never breathe like that,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.010
but you do,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.540
unless there's something severely
wrong with your brain stem

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.040
every five minutes or so

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.900
you do one of these physiological sighs,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.570
which reopens all the little
hundreds of millions of sacks

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.270
in your lungs called alveoli

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.770
that bring in more oxygen
as a consequence of that

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.530
big deep, double inhale.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.250
And then you are able to
exhale carbon dioxide,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.690
offload carbon dioxide

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.690
through that long exhale.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.180
I've also encouraged people
to use the physiological sigh

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.013
deliberately,

00:05:10.013 --> 00:05:10.901
not just spontaneously

00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.420
as a way to reduce their stress quickly.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.630
And indeed my lab works
on physiological sighs

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.140
and it's been exploring this

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.100
and they're quite effective in reducing

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.030
our stress very fast.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.640
Reading on our smartphone,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.000
seems to suppress physiological sigh.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.470
People aren't aware that it's happening,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.350
but it's happening.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.260
Some people have talked
about so-called email apnea,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.560
which is the fact that
people hold their breath

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.220
while they email or while they text.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.420
And indeed many people do that.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.490
This is distinct from
email or texting apnea.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.930
What's happening here is
people are reading on the phone

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.470
and for whatever reason,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.640
and I'll talk about what
the likely reason is,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.870
but for whatever reason,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.660
they're suppressing their sighing

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.070
And as a consequence,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.030
the brain is not getting enough oxygen

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.560
and is not offloading
enough carbon dioxide.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.830
And another finding in this study,

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.480
was that the prefrontal cortex,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.900
an area of the brain that's
involved in focus and attention

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.733
and learning

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:04.880
becomes hyperactive in a kind
of desperate attempt to focus.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.840
All of this can be summarized by saying,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.680
if you happen to read on a device,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.730
whether or not it's a tablet,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.000
a standard computer screen of any kind,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.010
but in particular on a smart phone,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.290
regardless of how small or
large that smartphone screen is,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.590
you want to remind yourself

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.400
to engage in these physiological
sighs fairly regularly.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.460
And it might even be better to just

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.160
read the most or at least the key issues

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.740
and things that you're trying to learn

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.680
about the key information from paper,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.370
either books or printed out material

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.660
of some other sort.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.070
What's the underlying mechanism here?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.020
Well,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.728
one of the reasons I
like this study so much,

00:06:39.728 --> 00:06:42.560
is that it brings together
two of my laboratories

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.990
and my particular
interests in neuroscience,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.700
which is how does our visual system

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.350
and the aperture meaning the
size of our visual window

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.360
relate to our so-called autonomic function

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.930
or our internal state.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.580
And basically what's happening here is

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.860
as any of us bring our visual
window in more narrowly

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.370
as we contract our visual window,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.620
which is exactly what happens

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.430
when we're looking at a little
smartphone in front of us.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.140
It seems to suppress
the breathing apparatus

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.020
because we know that physiological sighs

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.940
are controlled by a
specific set of neurons

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.740
in the brain stem called
the parafacial nucleus

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.430
discovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.700
And so there must be a mechanism whereby

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.200
when we tighten our visual window,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.710
we somehow, and we don't
know yet how this happens,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.420
but somehow suppress the
activity of these neurons

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.380
in the parafacial nucleus

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.000
that generate this physiological sighs.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.833
So again,

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:32.450
you have two choices or I
suppose you have many choices,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.650
but two main choices

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.220
to contend with this new information.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.010
One is that you remind yourself

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.280
to engage in deep breathing

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.790
and in particular, physiological sighs

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.000
every five minutes or so,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.120
while reading anything or
texting on your smartphone,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.960
the other would be,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.290
again, if there's material
that you really need to learn

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.350
for sake of regurgitation later,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.353
or for something particularly important,

00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:56.080
try and read that from
either a larger screen

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.980
or even better would be from
printed materials or books.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.430
Another reason I bring all that up

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.900
is that it relates to a larger theme,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.320
which is that I get many,
many questions about ADHD

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.600
and about people's challenges with focus

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.110
and much of what we're
told these days is that

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.330
we are challenged with focus

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
because of the hundreds of videos

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.940
that we can see streaming by
us in any moment on our phone,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.590
which probably is true.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.990
The fact that the information
that we're reading

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.713
on the internet and on our phones

00:08:21.713 --> 00:08:24.290
is emotionally disturbing
or distressing in some way.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.007
And that probably is true
as well in many cases.

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.240
This study really points to
the fact that independent

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.240
of the information that we are looking at

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.270
or consuming

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.320
independent whether or
not it's movies or texts

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.790
or anything of that sort,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.210
the mere size of the window, the aperture,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.010
the screen that we are looking at

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.140
is also strongly impacting
our ability to learn

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.660
and remember information.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.368
So broaden that visual window

00:08:49.368 --> 00:08:51.040
print things out,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.873
look at a book.

00:08:51.873 --> 00:08:54.500
I didn't design the system.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.490
I always say, you know,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.619
however our visual system
and respiratory system

00:08:57.619 --> 00:08:59.080
happened to evolve.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.640
I wasn't consulted at the design phase.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.230
This is just simply how
your brain circuits work.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.410
So if you want to learn things,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.590
widen that visual window and
even better print things out,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.410
pick up a book or read on a tablet even,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.620
but try and make that tablet larger

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.490
than a smartphone screen size.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.590
Before we begin our discussion
about The Power of Play,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.270
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.160
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.993
It is however,

00:09:22.993 --> 00:09:25.610
part of my desire and effort
to bring zero cost to consumer

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.290
information about science
and science related tools

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.700
to the general public

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.780
in keeping with that theme,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.530
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.580
Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens also now called AG1.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.470
I started drinking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.010
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.440
Athletic Greens is an all in one

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.570
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.910
The reason I started drinking it in 2012,

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.690
and the reason that I still
drink it once or twice a day,

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.340
is that with Athletic Greens,

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.300
I cover all of my basic
foundational vitamin mineral

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.649
probiotic needs.

00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:00.200
It's filled with adaptogens for recovery.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.160
The probiotics are particularly important

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.310
because they encourage health

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.330
of the so-called gut microbiome.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.068
We're going to be talking a
lot about the gut microbiome

00:10:07.068 --> 00:10:10.030
on this podcast in the
weeks and months to come,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.040
but to make a long story short,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.210
we have a lot of bacteria
living in our gut

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.410
that are healthy bacteria

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.510
that support them like
digestion immune system,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.428
metabolic function, hormone systems.

00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:21.978
And perhaps most interestingly to me,

00:10:21.978 --> 00:10:24.660
the gut microbiome
supports brain function,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.410
including mood cognition and so forth.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.880
The probiotics in Athletic Greens

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.680
strongly support the gut microbiome

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.880
and thereby the other systems of the body,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.930
including the gut brain access,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.340
which I just referred to.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.100
If you like to try Athletic Greens again,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.290
also called AG1,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.570
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.990
to claim a special offer.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.730
They're giving away five free travel packs

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.750
and a year supply of vitamin D3, K2,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.640
vitamin D3 is extremely important

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.660
for many biological functions.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.110
We are told that we can get
enough D3 from sun exposure,

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.560
but many of us we're getting sun exposure.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.460
And many of us who are not
getting enough sun exposure

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.310
still don't have ample
levels of vitamin D3

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.370
So supplementing with
vitamin D3 is necessary

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.490
for many many people.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.190
And K2 is important for
cardiovascular function

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.860
for proper calcium balance, et cetera.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.630
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.210
you can get the five free travel packs

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.420
a year supply of vitamin the D3 K2,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.400
and of course your Athletic Greens.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.564
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

00:11:22.564 --> 00:11:24.790
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.000
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.440
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.220
And one of the many challenges
that your visual system

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.200
has to deal with

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.610
is for instance, when you
move from a bright environment

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.960
to a dimer environment, you have to adapt.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.540
You have have to be able
to see things clearly,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.320
many sunglasses and eyeglasses
don't allow that adaptation

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.680
to occur seamlessly,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.890
ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.580
allow that to occur in
concert with your biology

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.380
and in a way that makes it very seamless.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.510
You just don't notice
the transition at all,

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.420
which is wonderful.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.340
I love it 'cause I don't have
to constantly be taking off

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.490
and putting on my
sunglasses when I'm outside.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.950
I happen to wear readers at
night, eye glass readers.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.530
It's also terrific as the luminance

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.592
in your environment changes.

00:12:02.592 --> 00:12:04.340
So they work under low luminance,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.940
high luminance, et cetera.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.900
They're very lightweight.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.950
In fact, you can wear them
when running, when cycling,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.610
they were designed by
two All-American swimmers

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.443
from Stanford.

00:12:13.443 --> 00:12:14.610
And so originally they were designed

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.990
for the purpose of being
worn during exercise,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.490
but you can wear them anywhere.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.470
They have a great aesthetic,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.530
so you can wear them to dinner,

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.563
to work, et cetera.

00:12:21.563 --> 00:12:24.230
And while a lot of performance
eyeglasses out there,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.310
in my opinion, make
people look like cyborgs,

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.780
ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.070
have just a terrific aesthetic

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.850
that you can wear truly anywhere.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.280
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.620
you can go to roka.com that's ROKA.com

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.930
and enter the code Huberman

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.807
to get 20% off your first order.

00:12:38.807 --> 00:12:42.890
Again, that's ROKA ROKA.com
and enter the code Huberman

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.723
at checkout.

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:46.580
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.570
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.120
that are second to none.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.410
I started sleeping on a Helix
mattress about a year ago now,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.610
and it's the best sleep
that I've ever had.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.362
What's unique about Helix mattresses

00:12:57.362 --> 00:13:00.332
is that they tailor their
mattresses to your sleep needs.

00:13:00.332 --> 00:13:02.470
So if you go to their website,

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.360
you can take a brief two minute quiz

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.260
that asks questions like,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.380
do you sleep on your stomach

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.240
or your back or on your
side, maybe you don't know,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.280
do you tend to run hot or
cold throughout the night?

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.240
Or maybe you don't know,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.080
and it matches you to the mattress.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.730
that's perfect for your sleep needs.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.690
I matched to the so-called Dusk mattress,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.920
D U S K,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.950
because I wanted a mattress
that wasn't too firm

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:20.783
and not too soft.

00:13:20.783 --> 00:13:22.138
And so I sleep on a Dusk mattress.

00:13:22.138 --> 00:13:24.956
You should figure out what
mattress would be ideal for you.

00:13:24.956 --> 00:13:27.000
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.044
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:31.380
take their two minute sleep quiz

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.210
and the match you to
a customized mattress.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.470
And you'll get up to $200 off

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.760
any of your mattress orders
and two free pillows.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.730
Again, that's $200 off
and two free pillows.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.563
The pillows are excellent.

00:13:41.563 --> 00:13:43.000
I also use Helix pillows.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.270
They have a 10 year warranty.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.670
You get to try out the mattress

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.280
for up to a hundred nights, risk free.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.580
If you don't like it,
they'll come pick it up,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.430
take it away.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.860
But I think you'll love it.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.700
Again if interested,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.720
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.370
There can get up to $200 off

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.910
and the two free pillows.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.970
Let's talk about play.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.540
Now in researching this episode,

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.310
I thought that I was going to
come across a bunch of papers

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.160
that say this brain area

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.760
connects to that brain area,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.700
which controls play in animals.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.630
And there's similar areas
in babies and in adults.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.600
And indeed, that's true.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.120
And we will talk about brain circuitry,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.590
but I think more
importantly is to understand

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.610
what is the utility of play?

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.170
You know, why do we
play when we're younger?

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.600
Why do we tend to play
less as we get older?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.480
And what in the world is play for?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.187
Some of us would be
categorized as more playful.

00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:32.300
I'm sure that you know, people like this,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.150
maybe you are like this

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.110
people that can walk into a room,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.520
a social setting of any kind,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.200
and they seem to already
kind of have a playful,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.050
maybe even a mischievous
quality about them.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.860
We'll talk about mischief
a little bit later,

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.920
but they sort of look at an environment

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.790
or a social setting as an opportunity

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.280
for different kinds of novel interactions.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.832
Other people and I'd probably
put myself into this category.

00:14:51.832 --> 00:14:53.870
If I walk into a novel environment,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.700
I tend to be more in the
mode of just assessing

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.938
what that environment is like.

00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:01.070
I'm not a particularly
spontaneously playful person,

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.420
although around certain individuals,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.930
I might be more spontaneously playful.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.960
We are all on a continuum
of this kind of seriousness

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.577
to playful nature.

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:12.420
Turns out that all young animals,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.710
including humans

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.950
have more playfulness and tend to engage

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.430
in more spontaneous play

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.450
in their earlier years

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.740
than in their later years.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.980
And therein lies a very interesting portal

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.590
to understanding what the utility,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.620
what the purpose of play is.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.453
First of all,

00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:31.850
I want to lay down a couple
of key facts about play

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.670
that point to the fact that
play is not just about games.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.130
Play is about much, much more

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.850
and play and in particular,

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.905
how we played as a child

00:15:41.905 --> 00:15:44.580
and still how we can play as adults

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.020
is really how we test

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.720
and expand our potential roles
in all kinds of interactions.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.010
One of the most important,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.690
interesting and surprising
features of play

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.700
that I'd like everyone to know about

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.630
is that it is homeostatically regulated.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.650
Some of you are familiar
with the term homeostasis.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.260
Homeostasis is just this
aspect of biological systems

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.926
to try and remain in balance.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.640
You know, if you stay awake
for a long period of time,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.670
you tend to want to sleep
for a long period of time.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.270
If you slept for a long period of time

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.103
and you're very rested,

00:16:15.103 --> 00:16:16.810
then you tend to be very
energetic the next day.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.900
And of course, I know people
out there will immediately say,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.150
oh, well, if I sleep too long,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.250
then I'm groggy the next day.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.620
Of course there are exceptions,

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.579
but in general,

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:27.900
sleep and wakefulness are
in homeostatic balance.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.070
Thirst and water consumption
are in homeostatic balance.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.810
If you don't drink any fluids for a while,

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.180
you tend to get more thirsty,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.590
you drink fluids

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.470
and your thirst tends to diminish

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.660
likewise with food.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.580
Likewise, with most all
motivated behaviors.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.413
Well,

00:16:42.413 --> 00:16:43.370
one of the most important discoveries

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.498
of the last century,

00:16:44.498 --> 00:16:47.690
was largely the work of a
guy named Jaak Panksepp.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.160
No, it's not Jack it's Jaak Panksepp

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.320
who really pioneered this understanding

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.950
of the biology of play

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.870
and relating that to
the psychology of play

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.240
in animals and humans.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.217
He's considered kind of
luminary in the field of play,

00:17:01.217 --> 00:17:02.870
and what a great title to have, right?

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.730
If you could have a title
and be a scientific luminary,

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.990
you might as well be the, the play guy.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.950
In fact he was known and I'll
get into this later as to why,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.180
but he was known as the "Rat Tickler"

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.360
because he tickled rats.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.470
And he actually found that
rodents and animals of many kind

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.280
generate laughter in response to tickling.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.220
And in fact,

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.680
they don't have the capacity
to tickle themselves

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.720
something we'll also
talk about why that is.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.660
And he was called the "Rat tickler,"

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.630
but then he discovered that
many species of animals

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.490
engage in laughter in response to tickling

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.780
and they tickle each other.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.730
And the reason you don't
hear them laughing,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.330
no you can't hear your dog laughing

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.140
that isn't laughing it's something else

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.410
is that most animals besides humans laugh

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.500
at kind of ultrasonic
levels of auditory output.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.820
Meaning the frequencies
of sound are just too high

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.653
for you to hear,

00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:49.583
but with the appropriate devices,

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:51.700
he was able with his colleagues

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.780
to isolate this so-called
the "Rat Laughter"

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.430
and then turns out there's kitten laughter

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.550
and there's puppy laughter.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.340
And of course there's human laughter.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.100
So Jaak Panksepp was a very interesting

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.320
and pioneering person in this field.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.920
And he also discovered that play

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.530
is homeostatically regulated.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.920
Meaning if animals including children

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.730
are restricted from playing
for a certain amount of time,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.220
they will play more when
given the opportunity

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.950
in the same way that
if I food restrict you

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.977
for a long period of time,

00:18:17.977 --> 00:18:20.270
you'll eat more when you
are finally allowed to eat.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.550
Now this is important

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.130
because it moves this thing that we call

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.550
play from the dimension
of higher order functions

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.722
or things evolved recently,

00:18:30.722 --> 00:18:34.450
you know, that are really
kind of at the front edge

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.654
of human evolution,

00:18:35.654 --> 00:18:39.220
deeper into the circuitry of the brain,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.960
whereby we say the brain stem,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.910
the kind of ancient parts of the brain

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.820
are going to be involved.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.210
And in fact, that's the case

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.312
as we're going to learn
later in the podcast,

00:18:48.312 --> 00:18:51.660
play is generated through the connectivity

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.230
of many brain areas.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.770
But one of the key brain areas

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.140
is an area called PAG Periaqueductal Gray.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.194
The Periaqueductal Gray
is a brain stem area.

00:19:02.194 --> 00:19:04.030
So it's pretty far back

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.660
as the brain kind of transitions
into the spinal cord.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.990
And it's rich with neurons
that make endogenous opioids.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.550
So these are not the kinds of opioids

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.900
that are causing the opioid crisis.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.820
These are neurons that you and I all have

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.120
that release endogenous, meaning self-made

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.620
or biologically made opioids.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.510
They go by names like enkephalin

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.934
and things of that sort.

00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:30.934
Play evokes small amounts of
opioid release into the system.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.410
They kind of dope you up a little bit,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.660
not so much as one would see if

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.280
one were to take exogenous opioids.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.200
And in fact exogenous
opioids as we now know,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.910
are potentially very hazardous,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.730
highly high addiction potential

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.810
high overdose potential.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.210
They cause all sorts of problems.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.790
Yes there are clinical uses for them,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.490
but they're causing a
lot of problems nowadays,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.170
but these endogenous opioids

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.680
are released in children and adults

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.540
anytime we engage in play.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.580
And that turns out to be a
very important chemical state

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.870
because there's something about

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.300
having an abundance of
these endogenous opioids

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.702
released into the brain

00:20:05.702 --> 00:20:07.720
that allows other areas of the brain,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.080
like the prefrontal cortex,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.650
the area of the front that's responsible

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.120
for what we call executive function.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.380
Executive function is the
ability to make predictions,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.920
to assess contingencies.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.230
Like if I do this,

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.063
then that happens.

00:20:19.063 --> 00:20:20.610
If I do that, then that happens.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.570
Well prefrontal cortex is often seen

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.860
as a kind of rigid executive
of the whole brain.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.180
That's one way to view it,

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.620
but probably a better way to view it

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.690
is that the prefrontal cortex works

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.070
in concert with these other
are more primitive circuitries.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.700
And when the periaqueductal gray releases

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.200
these endogenous opioids during play,

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.760
the prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.260
It actually gets smarter.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.830
It develops the ability
to take on different roles

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.880
and explore different contingencies.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.530
And we're going to talk about role play

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.050
later in different contexts.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.170
And what we will find
is that so much of play

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.640
is really about exploring things in a way

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.820
that feels safe enough to explore, right?

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.980
This is not what happens
when we drive down the street

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.154
or when we bike down the street,

00:21:06.154 --> 00:21:07.730
when we are headed to work,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.000
commuting on our bicycle
or walking or driving,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.220
we tend to be very linear

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.870
and we tend to be very goal directed.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.250
We're not going to just take
a new street just because

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.900
we're not going to be
spontaneously riding in the middle

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.733
of the road

00:21:18.733 --> 00:21:20.250
and then on the sidewalk
and then back and forth.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.230
Although I can remember as a kid,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.063
I was doing some of that.

00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:23.670
I like to jump off curb
cuts when I was a kid.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.410
And then eventually I
graduated, sorry to the cyclist,

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.840
but I graduated to skateboarding.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.390
And then I look on skateboarding.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.450
You're always kind of exploring terrain,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.990
but you know, as I got older,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.900
actually I find myself
becoming much more linear.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.440
I just don't play with
my commute very much.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.610
It's really just about getting
to work and then working.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.880
When endogenous opioids are in our system,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.713
when we're in this mode of play,

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.320
the prefrontal cortex starts seeing

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.740
and exploring many more
possibilities of how we interact

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.950
with our environment,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.760
with others and the roles that
we can assume for ourselves.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.390
And so we're going to dissect one by one,

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.040
the different aspects of play,

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.570
role play, social play,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.393
individual play, imaginary
play, competitive play

00:22:04.393 --> 00:22:06.650
they are enormous number
of dimensions of play.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.139
And by the end of this episode,

00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:11.160
we are going to arrive
at a very key feature.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.800
The key feature is one that's called

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.150
your personal play identity.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.840
All of us have what we call
a personal play identity.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.250
This personal play identity

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.200
was laid down during development.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.600
And it is the identity that you
assume in playful scenarios.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.597
And it is identity that you
adopt in non playful scenarios.

00:22:31.597 --> 00:22:34.820
Now the great news is that
your personal play identity

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.130
is plastic throughout
your entire lifespan.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.980
You can adjust your personal play identity

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.840
in ways that will benefit
you in work in relationships

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.440
and your overall level of happiness.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.990
We will discuss protocols
and ways to do that.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.160
But I do want to give
a nod to the late jack,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.323
Jaak excuse me,

00:22:50.323 --> 00:22:53.270
Jaak Panksepp, "The rat tickler."

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.570
And I also want to just give
a nod to play generally,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.940
as we move forward in the discussion.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.410
What I'd love for everyone to do

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.265
is to stop thinking about
play as just a child activity,

00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:07.110
not just a sport related activity,

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.640
but really as an exploration
in contingencies.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.240
Again, it's an exploration of,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.290
if I do A, what happens?

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.890
If I do B, what happens?

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.390
If someone else takes on
behavior or attitude C

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.740
what am I going to do?

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.210
And play is really where
we can expand our catalog

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.540
of potential outcomes,

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.640
and it can be enormously enriching.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.730
And indeed as we'll talk about
the tinkerers of the world,

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.949
the true creatives,

00:23:34.949 --> 00:23:38.700
the people that building
incredible technologies and art,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.710
and also that just have incredibly rich,

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.400
emotional and intellectual
and social lives

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.070
all have a strong element of play.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.640
And so today I hope to convince you

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.130
of some protocols that
will allow you to expand

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.550
your various roles in life,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.310
through the portal of play.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.800
So we establish that play is homeostatic,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.610
meaning we all need to do it.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.593
Many of us, including myself,

00:23:59.593 --> 00:24:01.960
haven't played that much as adults.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.330
We're all pretty busy.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.360
Number of us are stressed.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.372
We got a lot to do in life,

00:24:05.372 --> 00:24:07.240
but as children,

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.283
most all of us engage in a lot of play.

00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:14.000
And in looking at the way
that very young children

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.120
and especially toddlers play,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.460
we can learn a lot

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.970
because it reveals the fundamental rules

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.420
by which the toddler brain
interacts with the world.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.253
Now,

00:24:24.253 --> 00:24:25.450
one of the key things

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.030
about the baby brain

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.370
is that the baby brain somehow

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.590
knows that it can't do
everything in the world, right?

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.120
If a baby needs something,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.870
it generally will cry or make
some sort of vocalization

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.650
or some sort of facial expression
or combination of those.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.210
And the caretaker, whoever
that may be will provide it.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.370
This is an ancient hard wired mechanism

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.270
whereby the so-called
autonomic nervous system

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.510
that generates stress

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.980
will create this kind of
whining and discomfort,

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.920
maybe arriving,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.180
maybe the baby gets
kind of red in the face

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.690
and the caretaker delivers some thing

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.440
based on a good guess
of what that baby needs.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.980
So maybe it's breast milk,

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.240
maybe it's bottle milk.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.760
Maybe it's a diaper change.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.220
Maybe it's to be warmed
up if the baby is cold,

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.490
maybe it's to be cooled
down if the baby's too warm,

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.590
maybe if the baby's in
its a little onesie thing,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.480
it's feeling restricted
and it just wants to move

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.093
and they'll get taken out of their,

00:25:17.093 --> 00:25:18.810
their crib or their stroller,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.290
whatever it is and allowed
to stretch out on the floor.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.460
Remember the baby doesn't
know exactly what it needs.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.950
It only knows the state of discomfort.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.570
And of course we don't know
exactly what babies and toddlers

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.440
are thinking

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.360
because they can't express
themselves with language yet.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.650
But what's key to understand

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.180
is the rule or the
contingency that is set up

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.180
in that scenario.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.620
In that scenario,

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.340
the child feels some discomfort

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.280
expresses that discomfort verbally

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.170
or through a facial expression or both

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.760
and then some force some
person from the outside world

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.930
resolves it.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.873
And so the very young baby

00:25:53.873 --> 00:25:56.570
and indeed many children
up to certain ages

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.310
and let's confess many adults

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.530
are not able to meet or
adjust their internal states

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.363
of stress.

00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:04.690
And so they look to
things outside of them.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.960
That's the first rule,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.190
the fundamental rule

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.160
that we all learn when we come into life,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.135
that when in a state of discomfort

00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:14.493
to look outside our immediate biology,

00:26:14.493 --> 00:26:17.950
beyond the confines of our
skin and find a solution,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.070
a sip of water for adults,
it might be sip of alcohol,

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.903
right?

00:26:21.903 --> 00:26:23.530
Probably not the best
tool to relieve stress,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.720
but that's one that many people do.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.070
In fact engaging for
the baby that's hungry.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.790
The bottle milk comes from the outside.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.150
As we gain more proficiency
in moving through life

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.970
and we can get things for ourselves.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.382
We still often bring things
from the external world in

00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:37.960
to resolve this what I'm calling

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.960
autonomic discomfort or
autonomic dysregulation.

00:26:43.584 --> 00:26:47.170
That's not a game, but that's a rule.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.360
As we advance from infant to toddler,

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.980
we start to think more
in terms of where we are

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.040
and what we own relative to
what's out there in the world.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.740
And now in the world of child psychology,

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.650
there's a somewhat famous poem

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.810
that was written by a
research child psychologist.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.240
His name was Burton White,

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.847
and he wrote a poem called
"The Toddlers Creed"

00:27:09.847 --> 00:27:11.990
"The Toddlers Creed" defines well,

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.520
what the rules and
contingencies of play are

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.750
in very young children.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.590
And it reveals to us just how narrow

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.130
and limited their world view is

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.910
and how self entered their world is.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.840
So "The Toddlers Creed" read quickly,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.737
cuz' I don't want to take up
too much time with this is.

00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:29.690
"If I want it.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.740
It's mine.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.330
If I give it to you and
change my mind later,

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.163
it's mine."

00:27:34.163 --> 00:27:35.210
For anyone that's played with a toddler,

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.727
you can imagine this in your mind.

00:27:36.727 --> 00:27:39.480
"If I can take it away
from you, it's mine.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.450
If I had a little while ago, it's mine.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.013
If we are building something together,

00:27:44.013 --> 00:27:46.090
all the pieces are mine.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.600
If it looks just like mine,

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.730
it's mine.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.130
If it's mine, it will never
belong to anyone else,

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:52.482
no matter what."

00:27:52.482 --> 00:27:55.440
And of course, as we hear this

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.730
sounds quite awful, right?

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.040
And yet this is actually
a reflection of what

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.890
a healthy toddler would
think about the world.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.300
That the objects and things,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.190
and even the people in
the world are theirs,

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.560
that they are actually
possessions that belong to them.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.490
Now of course,

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.820
some people never actually
transition beyond this stage

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.350
of moral and social development.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.243
And there are indeed some adults

00:28:16.243 --> 00:28:18.130
that fit "The Toddlers Creed."

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.014
And you're welcome to
share this with them.

00:28:20.014 --> 00:28:22.310
If ever you think that
it might be of benefit

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.190
to their self-reflection.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:27.457
But in all seriousness Burton White's

00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:29.950
"Toddlers Creed" is really grounded

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.520
in this transition from
when we are infants.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.750
And we have to have
things delivered to us,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.440
to the point where we are toddlers

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.510
and we can access things in the world,

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.830
but we tend to assume
that they are all ours.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.730
And then the next stage

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.870
is the really key stage
as it relates to play

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.460
because is in the next
stage of development

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.310
is where young children start

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.810
to interact with other children

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.340
and there's an exchange and a possession

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.790
and then a letting go of certain things,

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.110
learning that not everything is yours

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.190
and that the entire world is not about you

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.990
is one of the key contingencies

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.670
that is established during play.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.220
It's one of the key way
in which children go

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.010
from being very self-centered

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.370
and basically unable to
engage with other kids

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.203
for very long,

00:29:12.203 --> 00:29:14.080
without some sort of eruption of crying

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.400
and some sort of battle of, you know,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.300
kind of push pull over an object

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.560
to things like sharing and
things like cooperative play.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.720
So as we transition from forms of play

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.140
that are all about the self

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.367
that are all me, me, me, me,

00:29:26.367 --> 00:29:27.435
"The Toddlers Creed"

00:29:27.435 --> 00:29:29.502
to forms of play that involve

00:29:29.502 --> 00:29:32.240
some discomfort in assuming roles

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.051
that maybe we don't want and
not getting what we want.

00:29:35.051 --> 00:29:37.980
It's really an opportunity for the brain

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.370
to start to explore different
roles that people take,

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.700
how they work as individuals

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.220
and as pairs and in larger groups.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.300
And to do that in a low
stakes environment, right?

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.350
You wouldn't want this to be worked out

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.890
on the battlefield or
when searching for food

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.880
or in some high stakes environment

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.160
where the survival of the
species was important.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.920
It appears that these
circuitry for play evolved.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.460
So that rules and contingencies
around who's most important,

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.840
whether or not the group is important,

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.870
whether or not individuals
are going to be leaders

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.240
or followers, et cetera,

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.750
that can be explored in
a low stakes environment.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.860
Now there are hundreds of
different types of play

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.610
and hundreds of different
types of contingency testing.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.530
But the key theme here is that

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.950
play allows children and
adults for that matter

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.820
to explore different outcomes

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.570
in a kind of low stakes environment.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.213
If you're playing a board
game or a card game,

00:30:30.213 --> 00:30:32.370
you might get really into that game,

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.570
but unless there's a lot of
money on the table, so to speak,

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.640
or you're really playing
for something important

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.030
or unless your ego is swollen
way out of proportion,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.220
to reality,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.470
if you lose, you might
not feel good about it,

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.070
but it's truly not the end of the world.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.170
And if you win,

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.440
you might feel really good about it,

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.240
but you're not really incredible.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.090
You were just incredible in
that particular situation

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.250
for that particular moment,

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.880
it doesn't really transform
the rest of your life,

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.520
unless that game is of a
particular type for sport

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.860
for instance.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.550
We'll talk about sport later.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.740
So the key theme here is that
play is contingency testing.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.580
play is contingency
testing under conditions

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.460
where the stakes are sufficiently low,

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.550
that individuals should feel comfortable

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.660
assuming different roles,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.510
even roles that they're
not entirely comfortable

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.590
within their outside life.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.180
And that all relates again

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.420
to the release of these
endogenous opioids,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.460
in this brain center periaqueductal gray

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.980
and the way that it allows
the prefrontal cortex

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.200
in a very direct way I mean,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.423
truly it allows it in a biological way

00:31:30.423 --> 00:31:34.640
to expand the number of
operations that it can run,

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.540
and start thinking about, oh, well, okay.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.240
Normally I'm kind of a loner

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.932
and I like to read and work

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:43.140
and you know, hang out
alone maybe and play alone

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.010
but you know okay,

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:44.930
I'll play a board game

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.240
or a game of tennis

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.990
where I have a partner and
we're going to play as partners

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.080
against two other people.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.800
Okay, that's a little
uncomfortable, but I'll do it.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.680
And in doing that,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.000
you discover certain ways

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.920
in which you are
proficient in certain ways,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.580
in which you are less proficient,

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.090
you discover that the other person

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.010
actually tends to cheat a little bit

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.150
or the other person is
extremely rigid about the rules,

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.680
or maybe it is extremely rigid
about the way they organize

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.130
their pieces on the board,

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.290
or they're crossing the line

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.760
into your side of the tennis court.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.540
There are all sorts of
things that we learn

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.680
in these rather low stake scenarios.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.350
That's the key theme here.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.540
So before I continue,

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.660
I just want to point to a
tool that anyone can use,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.860
but in particular, the
less playful of the group.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.370
And I would put myself into this category.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.040
Again, I'm not somebody who really engages

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.092
in spontaneous play.

00:32:31.092 --> 00:32:32.450
I enjoy sports.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.620
I enjoy exercise,

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.990
but that is distinct from play

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.060
because the sports and
exercise that I engage in,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.150
I take pretty seriously.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.890
They're not low stakes for me.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.980
I put actually I put a
lot of importance on them.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.820
Which is I'm saying all this,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.530
I probably should put a
little less importance on them

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.280
and have a little more fun with those.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.259
And yet what I'm about to tell you is that

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:53.370
anyone and everyone can
benefit from engaging

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.540
in a bit more of this playful mindset,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.610
the playful mindset is not necessarily

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.970
about smiling and jumping
around or being silly.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:02.803
That's not it at all.

00:33:02.803 --> 00:33:04.680
It's not Tigger character

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.280
from "Winnie the Pooh" necessarily.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.370
It could be,

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.920
but it's really about allowing yourself

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.090
to expand the number of outcomes

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.430
that you're willing to entertain

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.560
and to think about how you relate

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.960
to those different outcomes.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.020
So what this means is putting yourself

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.170
into scenarios where

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.040
you might not be the top performer, right?

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.140
Playing a game that you're
not really that good at.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.353
I had this experience recently,

00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:29.250
friends that like to play cards,

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.960
they like to do some low stake gambling.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.420
This is non illegal gambling ring.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.210
They play for trivial things.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.220
And I generally don't buy into the game.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.610
I generally don't play

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.040
mostly because they end
up winning and taking

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.710
whatever it is that I have.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.220
But in the mode of assuming
a more playful spirit,

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.330
the idea would be well,

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.520
if the stakes are low enough,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.810
then to play simply for
the sake of playing,

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.300
because there's something to learn there

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.840
about the other people in the group

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.270
and about one's self

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.230
and how one reacts to things like

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.440
someone who's clearly trying
to take everybody's money

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.512
or somebody who is clearly trying to cheat

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:10.510
or somebody who's clearly very, very rigid

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.730
about every last detail,

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.113
including how the cards are
dealt and shuffled right?

00:34:14.113 --> 00:34:16.850
There is learning in this exploration.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.870
And that is at a biological
level, the prefrontal Cortex,

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.430
starting to entertain
different possibilities,

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.070
starting to entertain different outcomes

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.290
in this low stakes way.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:27.710
And if you think about it,

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.880
that's not something
that we allow ourselves

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.292
to do very often.

00:34:31.292 --> 00:34:33.700
Even if we listen to new forms of music

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.350
or we go see new art or new movies,

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.540
those are new experiences,

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.860
but that's not us making new predictions

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.250
about what's going to happen next.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.620
It's not the brain working to figure out

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.060
new possibilities.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.780
And so you can immediately see how

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.070
just a small increase in your willingness

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.620
to put yourself into conditions

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.500
where you don't understand
all the rules perhaps,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.330
or you're not super
proficient at something,

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.480
but you enter it

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.360
because it is low stakes.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.090
And because there is information to learn

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:02.290
about yourself and others

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.300
could start to open up these
prefrontal cortex circuits.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.560
And when I say open up,

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.330
I don't mean that literally
there's an opening

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.163
in your skull.

00:35:09.163 --> 00:35:12.020
What I mean is that your prefrontal cortex

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.560
can work in very rigid ways.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.110
Meaning if A then B,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.080
if I go down this street turn
left and go that way to work,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.913
it is fast.

00:35:18.913 --> 00:35:20.130
If I go down the other street, it's slow.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.380
If there's a traffic jam there,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.360
I'm going to go there

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.640
but it's starting to explore
different possibilities.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.340
And there are very, very
few opportunities in life

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.019
to explore contingencies
in this low stakes way,

00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:33.310
such that it engages neuroplasticity,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.800
the prefrontal cortex.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.670
So play is powerful

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.340
at making your prefrontal
cortex more plastic,

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.290
more able to change in
response to experience,

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.050
but not just during the period of play,

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.400
but in all scenarios,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.900
because you get one prefrontal cortex,

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.150
you don't get a prefrontal
cortex just for play.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.340
You get a prefrontal cortex
that engages in everything.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.173
So going forward,

00:35:54.173 --> 00:35:58.220
I will layer on some more
concrete aspects of tools,

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.053
but for now,

00:35:59.053 --> 00:36:00.560
if you're somebody that
doesn't consider yourself,

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.800
particularly playful

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.633
consider,

00:36:02.633 --> 00:36:05.431
and maybe even engage in
just a little bit of play

00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:06.970
in some way,

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.810
that is of discomfort to you

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.998
with the understanding that is increasing

00:36:10.998 --> 00:36:13.550
your prefrontal cortical plasticity.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:17.010
Another really interesting
and important aspect of play

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.240
is so-called play postures.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.540
These are seen in animals,

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.420
and these are seen in humans.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.480
And for those of you that
are watching this podcast

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.450
on YouTube, I'll do my
best to adopt them here.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.440
For those of you that are listening,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.150
you'll just have to imagine
them in your mind's eye,

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:35.040
but Jaak Panksepp and
indeed Darwin himself,

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.830
study these play postures

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.538
that all animal engage in.

00:36:38.538 --> 00:36:41.710
Perhaps the most familiar one

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.340
is seen in dogs and in wolves

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.410
where they will lower
their head to the ground

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.000
and they'll put their
paws out in front of them

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.820
and they will make eye contact

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.678
with another typically dog or wolf

00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:55.360
to so-called call the play.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.340
Now, when they do this posture,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.070
it's obvious that they're
lowering themselves.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.670
They're not in an aggressive stance,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.250
because they're lowering their head.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.523
And this is universally known
among canines as play posture.

00:37:06.523 --> 00:37:08.440
There's some famous videos online.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.560
You can look these up

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.010
of dogs actually doing this with bears

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.350
that they're confronted with

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.238
and the bears, at least in these videos

00:37:16.238 --> 00:37:18.740
in exchange also lowering their head,

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.208
and there you see bear
dog playful interactions.

00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:25.810
Now you always have to be
cautious with bears in general.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.470
I would say you have to
be cautious with bears,

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:32.010
but this speaks to the
universality of this bowing,

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:32.860
this sort of the, the,

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.170
what some people call the puppy bow

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.150
or the play bow that dogs do

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.910
turns out that humans do this as well.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.220
Although in a different form,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.720
I'm sure there are some that go into the,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.140
the down-dog play posture,

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.240
but more typically when
humans want to play,

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.950
they will do a subtle or
not so subtle head tilt.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.820
The head tilt with eyes open

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.940
is considered the universal head

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.000
and facial expression
posture of play in humans.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.700
So when two people see one another,

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.563
if they are aggressive
towards one another,

00:38:01.528 --> 00:38:03.060
they will assume certain facial
expressions and postures.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.900
But if they're feeling
playful towards one another,

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.500
oftentimes they'll tip
their head to the side

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.240
just a little bit and
they'll open their eyes.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.500
They might even raise
their eyebrows briefly.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.710
This has been seen again
and again and again.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.630
Another hardwired feature
of so-called play postures

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.700
is what's called soft eyes.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.300
When animals are aggressive,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.100
or when they're sad,

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.920
they tend to reduce the
size of their eye openings

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.380
by basically making their
eyelids closer together,

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.213
somewhat,

00:38:29.213 --> 00:38:30.046
by keeping their eyes together

00:38:30.046 --> 00:38:30.879
in particular for aggression,

00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:31.970
they'll bring their eyes towards

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.350
what we call a vergence eye movement.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:34.490
Bring it towards the center

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.240
that actually narrows the
aperture of the visual field.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.310
When people or animals
want to engage in play,

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.640
they tend to open their eyelids somewhat,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.900
and they tend to purse their
lips just a little bit.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.080
So it's not like stronger
pursing when your lips like this,

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.260
it's, pursing their lips.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.310
They'll open their eyes a little bit.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.890
And they'll often do
the head tilt as well.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.700
Sometimes with a little bit of a smile.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.190
These are reflexive
these are not trained up.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.230
Children do this.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.500
Adults do this dogs, wolves do this.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.480
Even certain birds will do this.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.110
Most birds have eyes on
the side of their heads,

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.700
but they do a sort of form
of this soft eyes approach.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.950
And certainly in raptors,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.200
you see a softening of the eyes

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.670
and indeed raptors like Hawks and Eagles

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.630
they actually do have
a certain form of play,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.186
but only early in life.

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.840
The other thing that we see during play,

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.740
or what are called partial postures,

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.146
partial postures are a
kind of play enactment

00:39:23.146 --> 00:39:26.190
of postures that would
otherwise be threatening.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:30.270
So a partial posture that we
see during play in animals

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.950
and humans that relates
to aggressive play.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.240
So things like wrestling

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.040
or things like rough and tumble play,

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.145
which is very common in animals
and kids and some adults.

00:39:39.145 --> 00:39:42.618
Is that because there's going
to be physical interaction

00:39:42.618 --> 00:39:44.190
in animals,

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.396
what will happen is

00:39:45.396 --> 00:39:48.710
they will march toward one
another often very slowly,

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.330
but rather than having their hair up,

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.110
which is we call piloerection,

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.240
which is when the hair goes up,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.840
animals do this to make
themselves look bigger.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.800
Think of about the, the cat.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.620
That's trying to look bigger or an animal

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.460
that's being aggressive,
trying to look bigger

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.600
in the presence of a foe,

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.480
a different animal that
they're either going to try

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.110
and kill or fight in some way,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.090
even if it's to defend themselves,

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.950
partial postures occur
when animals will approach

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.783
one another,

00:40:13.783 --> 00:40:15.540
but they'll keep their fur down.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.539
Humans will do this to,

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:19.100
they will approach during play,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.140
but unless it's highly competitive play

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.880
like a football game or a boxing match,

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.370
they will actually shrink
their body size somewhat.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.028
We have hair on our bodies,

00:40:28.028 --> 00:40:29.627
some of us more than others,

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:32.353
and that hair is capable of piloerection.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.123
It can stand up.

00:40:34.123 --> 00:40:36.605
That's the hair standing
up on end phenomenon,

00:40:36.605 --> 00:40:39.650
but most of us don't have
enough hair on our bodies

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.750
that we can actually use that
to make ourselves larger.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.070
So what you see with people
who are about to engage in play

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.710
is they tend to make their
body a little bit smaller

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.470
unless they are highly competitive

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.010
and highly competitive play

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.580
is its own distinct form of play.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.450
That we'll talk about later,

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.970
such as during sport,
when the stakes are high,

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.880
a Super Bowl football game,

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.688
I'm revealing my ignorance
about sports here.

00:41:01.688 --> 00:41:04.740
The Super Bowl as it's typically called

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.070
is a very high stakes game, right?

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.220
Salaries depend on it.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.550
Sponsorships depend on it.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.230
It's on television,

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.380
reputations depend on it.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.630
So that's not really playing a game.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:17.580
That's playing a very high stakes game

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.230
and there you're not going to
see these partial postures.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:23.100
You're not going to see soft
eyes and tilting of the head.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.330
At least not between the
opposing players on the team,

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.880
you're going to see quite the opposite.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.990
Grunting, screaming, shouldering

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.410
people not blinking lowering their eyes,

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.450
or rather shrinking their eyes down to be,

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.750
to appear more aggressive.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:36.583
These kinds of things

00:41:36.583 --> 00:41:38.090
staring right through the other person,

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.520
you know verbal threats et cetera.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.130
So that's not really play,

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.310
even though we say they're
playing a game of football,

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.847
it's very high stakes play.

00:41:45.847 --> 00:41:46.920
What I'm referring to here

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.770
is when it's fairly low stakes.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.630
And we see this again
in animals and human.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.500
So there are many, many
of these partial postures.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.720
Again, they happen spontaneously.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.110
So if someone ever looks at you

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.330
and they tilt their head a little bit

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.560
and they raise their eyebrows

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.940
and they maybe smile a little bit,

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.620
they're looking at you playfully,

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.870
that's the universal human
exchange of, I want to play.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.070
Do you want to play?

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.810
There's another play expression

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.700
that is considered the
most extreme of the come on

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.030
let's play express and postures.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.900
And this is one that's
seen in a lot of primates

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.800
and indeed in some humans as well.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.910
And that's the eyes wide open

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.730
and believe it or not tongue out,

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:24.540
it's the, that kind of silly thing.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.248
That's I don't think that
I've ever done that before.

00:42:26.248 --> 00:42:28.459
Just that kind of thing

00:42:28.459 --> 00:42:32.750
is basically what primate
species of all kinds.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.671
And indeed we are old
world primates as well,

00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:37.350
do when they want to say,

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.450
I'm definitely here to play

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.940
and that's why I'm here.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.930
Okay it's it has this kind
of silly look or connotation.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.770
But if you watch chimpanzees
or you look at Bonobos,

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.910
or even in the so-called
new world monkeys,

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.900
which tend to be the smaller monkeys,

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.380
old world monkeys tend to
be the ones that in general,

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.720
see the world as we do,

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.750
they have what we call trichromacy.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.850
They're the ones that often
can look very human-like.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.511
The new world monkeys
tend to be the little ones

00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:04.680
in general I'll give
you a little trick here.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.030
Little tool based on primatology.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.010
If you see a monkey and it's
making very slow movements,

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.170
or you see an ape of any kinds,
making very slow movements,

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.800
very likely to be an old world primate.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.500
If you see a monkey

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.530
and it's, it can very quick movements

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.720
like it's doing this kind of thing,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.340
like it's like a could
be a squirrel monkey

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.400
could be a marmoset,

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.040
likely to be a new world monkey.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.950
And they don't see the world
that the same way we do,

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.250
they see the world more like a dog.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.300
They don't really see reds.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.650
They see reds as orange et cetera.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.080
Okay that's not a hard and fast rule.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.810
And I'm sure the primatologists
are going to come after me

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:38.670
with whatever primatologists
come after you

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.240
with monkey biscuits
or something like that.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.500
But in general, it's a good rule.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.961
If you're at the zoo and
you see a slow moving monkey

00:43:43.961 --> 00:43:47.160
with slow deliberate gestures
kind of moves its eyes

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.740
makes eye contact every once in a while,

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.090
those tend to be the old world primates,

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:51.410
those kind of jittery ones

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.100
that look like they're really
nervous wrapping their tail

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.810
and kind of hiding there
in a little bundle.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.310
Those tend to be the
new world monkeys, okay.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.570
Again, not a black and
white type division,

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.563
but that'll get you most of the way.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.350
So the whole purpose of
these partial postures

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.020
or the tongue out thing

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.420
is to limit power in deliberate ways

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.270
to really take bodily expressions

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:17.468
that could be portrayed or could be

00:44:17.468 --> 00:44:20.010
interpreted as aggressive

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.370
or as threatening or as wanting to mate,

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.800
or as willing wanting to do
anything for that matter.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.230
And to limit the power with
which they are expressed

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.330
in very deliberate way.

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.430
So that's the putting the hair down,

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.490
despite getting into a fighting stance.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:35.550
That's saying let's fight,

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.210
but I'm not really here to fight fight.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.570
It's low stakes fighting.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.650
Like if I pin you,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.730
then I'll let you go.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.850
Or if you pin me, then
you ought let me go.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.090
And so immediately you can start to see

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.060
how play starts to call into action,

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.520
social dynamics in which both parties

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.020
have to make some sort of agreement

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.340
about how high the stakes are.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.700
Now, the failures to do this
are also very informative

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.810
in how we develop in social groups.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.240
And this also can inform why some people

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.370
really play well with others
and other people don't.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.240
And some people seem to
get along well with groups

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.073
and can handle other people.

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:11.344
And some people are very rigid.

00:45:11.344 --> 00:45:14.300
In fact, I have an anecdote
about this when I was a kid,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.240
we used to play this game.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.220
It's not a game I suggest,

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.780
but we used to do what were
called "Dirt Clod Wars."

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.990
So a friend of mine,

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.358
his parents were generally
not home in the afternoon.

00:45:22.358 --> 00:45:25.700
So we must have been somewhere
around 10 or 11 years old.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.730
And we would set up these
two big dirt mounds.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.740
We would shovel them to big
dirt mounds on two sides

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.573
of the yard.

00:45:30.573 --> 00:45:32.670
And then we would just take dirt clods

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.410
and we throw them at one
another and just have

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.243
dirt clod wars.

00:45:35.243 --> 00:45:36.840
Again, not suggesting this

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.780
I'm not responsible for what happens

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.690
if you do,

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:40.940
but there were rules

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.827
and the rules were, for instance,

00:45:42.827 --> 00:45:45.640
you couldn't pack rocks
into the dirt clods

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.160
and you could run across to the other side

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.500
and you could jump on
the other person's mound

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.690
and you could throw dirt clods in there.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:54.840
I guess, as the stuff that
we thought was entertaining.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.480
But if someone got hit in the head,

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.750
generally there was an unspoken rule

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:00.770
that you kind of stop

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.350
and see whether or not they were damaged

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:03.500
or not before you'd continue,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.920
you couldn't continue pelting them.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.280
And of course, people broke this rule.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.310
In fact I remember one kid

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:08.240
I'm not going to name him

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.720
because actually he's grown

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.928
into a very actually prominent
and functional adult,

00:46:12.928 --> 00:46:15.150
but he got hit once in the head.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.070
And then I think someone
had thrown a dirt clod

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.938
shortly thereafter,

00:46:17.938 --> 00:46:21.070
and all of a sudden he
just went into a rage,

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.970
picking up rocks and sticks
and attacking another kid.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.630
And so clearly that was a case in which

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.030
the rules of the game
were now being violated,

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.700
but it served a very important purpose.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.533
There was, you know,

00:46:31.533 --> 00:46:33.000
the typical thing that the,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.400
there were some tears I think,

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.000
as I recall from one kid or the other,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.470
there was like snot coming out of the nose

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:39.630
and turning bright red, a kid went home.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.463
It was a mess.

00:46:40.463 --> 00:46:41.920
The parents had to say something,

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.150
or maybe there was a phone call.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.110
I don't quite recall how it got resolved.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.470
But the idea is that

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.920
there's an agreed upon set of rules

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.400
about how high the stakes are

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.650
and what we're all going to do.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:52.790
And this is separate from sport

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.550
where there are clearly defined rules

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.370
about what's out of bounds.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.203
What's in-bounds.

00:46:57.203 --> 00:46:58.910
What sorts of behaviors
will get you a yellow card

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.970
or a red card for instance
on the soccer field,

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.050
all animals including humans

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.910
are doing this low stakes
contingency testing

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.420
and all animals including
humans you'll find,

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.986
start to up the stakes.

00:47:09.986 --> 00:47:12.700
And inevitably in group play,

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.350
one member of the group
will kind of break rules.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.370
You see this also in puppies.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.710
So for instance, puppies
will bite one another

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.730
with those sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:23.040
I remember when Costello had those teeth,

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.960
those things were so darn sharp

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.750
and puppies will yelp

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.980
when one of their littermates bites them,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.700
that Yelp actually serves a very important

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.830
inhibitory function.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.900
This is well defined

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.630
to tell the other one that's too tough,

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.250
and this is how animals learn soft bite.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.083
Okay.

00:47:39.083 --> 00:47:41.360
If they don't get that feedback
from other littermates,

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.450
they never actually learn.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.610
What's too hard and what's soft.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:46.670
And so humans do this as well.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.280
Now you can look at your adult,

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.113
counterparts,

00:47:49.113 --> 00:47:50.964
and indeed we should probably
look at ourselves and ask,

00:47:50.964 --> 00:47:53.600
you know did we learn
proper play contingency

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.433
when we were younger?

00:47:54.433 --> 00:47:55.880
Do we tend to take things too seriously?

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.620
Do we tend to overreact aggressively

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.310
when other people are clearly engaging in,

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:04.240
you know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.290
or things of that sort.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.030
So each of you will have a
different experience of this,

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:11.270
but the point is that play
serves many functions,

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:12.440
it's not just about the self.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.770
It's also about interactions
between multiple people.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:15.990
It's about rule testing

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.160
and low stakes contingency

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.340
rule breaking also
serves an important role

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.130
as is with the example
of the "Dirt Clod War"

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.490
puppies biting other puppies et cetera.

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:26.200
And last but not least,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.100
there are different forms of play

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.980
that help us establish who
we will become as adults.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.460
One of the more powerful of these

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:38.460
is role play when children
and sometimes adults

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.360
will take on different
roles that are distinct

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.550
from their natural world roles

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:46.650
in order to for instance,
establish hierarchies.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:47.920
So someone's going to be the leader

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.160
and someone's going to be the follower.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.100
Someone will be dominant.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.540
Someone will be submissive.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.000
Someone will work alone.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.680
Other people will work in a group.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.390
These kinds of role playing

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.190
are again ways in which
the prefrontal cortex

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.860
has to expand the number of operations

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.720
in neuroscience we call these algorithms

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.530
that it has to run in
order to make predictions.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.100
You have to take in a lot of information

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.360
about your environment all the time

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.550
and make predictions.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:14.480
But if you are suddenly
cast into a new role,

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.030
well then you definitely have to

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:19.220
make even more predictions
from a different standpoint.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.440
So these are very powerful
for teaching the brain,

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.610
how to function.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:24.340
I had a sister growing
up, I still have a sister,

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.270
fortunately,

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.640
and she and her friends
largely played with dolls

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.650
and doll houses in the room next door.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.340
And they take on different roles.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.860
In fact, some kids,

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.100
if they play alone

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.570
will start to take on the role of leader

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.960
by taking on an imaginary or
creating an imaginary friend.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.050
And, you know, my apologies to my sibling,

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.360
but for a long time,

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.280
she had an imaginary friend

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.649
eventually that imaginary
friend disappeared.

00:49:48.649 --> 00:49:51.150
I don't know the science
around imaginary friends

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.030
and what it makes them disappear or not

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:54.590
at what stage of development,

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.340
but imaginary friends are pretty common.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.286
And that's just another
way of being able to,

00:49:58.286 --> 00:50:00.290
you know boss somebody around,

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:01.210
if that's your thing,

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.600
or to do engage in cooperative play.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.260
So we can look at this
stage of development,

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.170
we call childhood

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.920
and we can look at each stage
of it and we can say, wow,

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.820
there are all these
different dimensions of play

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.050
that really are about testing out

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.440
how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable,

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.340
how we react good or bad,

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.830
how we react with stress or with glee

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:24.930
when others behave in certain ways.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.190
And so what I'm hoping is coming through

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.070
is that play is not just about having fun.

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.290
Play is about testing.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:33.520
It's about experimenting

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.070
and it's about expanding
your brain's capacity.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.440
And that's through early in development,

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.946
and it's through throughout the lifespan.

00:50:39.946 --> 00:50:40.779
So at this point in the discussion,

00:50:40.779 --> 00:50:41.827
I want to take a step back,

00:50:41.827 --> 00:50:44.810
look at the biology and
neurochemistry of play

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:46.210
just a little bit.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.760
And that really define
what is effective play.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.546
If the goal of play is to
explore different contingencies

00:50:52.546 --> 00:50:54.296
in low stakes environments

00:50:54.296 --> 00:50:57.870
and to expand the function
of our prefrontal cortex

00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:59.690
so that we can see new possibilities

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.800
and new ways of being become
more flexible, more creative,

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.205
more effective outside
of the games of play

00:51:06.205 --> 00:51:08.890
or the arenas of play, I should say.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.370
Well then we should be asking,

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:12.640
how do I know if I'm playing?

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.878
How do I know if I'm playing correctly?

00:51:14.878 --> 00:51:16.837
Turns out there's an answer to that.

00:51:16.837 --> 00:51:19.470
Earlier I referred to this brain area,

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:23.120
the periaqueductal gray
that releases opioids,

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.090
endogenous opioids into
our brain and body,

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.410
and tends to relax us a bit.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.410
It actually is what leads to
these things like soft eyes

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:35.315
and head tilts and
puppies making, you know,

00:51:35.315 --> 00:51:37.470
puppy postures and things of that sort,

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:41.290
and how that opens up the
number of different functions

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:44.440
or algorithms that the
prefrontal cortex can run,

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.910
but there's another piece of the puzzle,

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:50.290
which is for something to
genuinely be play and playful,

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:54.660
and for it to have this
effect of expanding our brain

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.610
and engaging neuroplasticity
of really changing our brain

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:00.610
so that we can see and engaging
more possible behaviors

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.150
and thoughts et cetera.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:05.917
We also have to have low
amounts of adrenaline,

00:52:05.917 --> 00:52:08.949
so called epinephrine
in our brain in body.

00:52:08.949 --> 00:52:12.730
Now the background science
for this is quite extensive,

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.210
but for those of you that
are interested in papers

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:16.170
and manuscripts,

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:18.510
perhaps the best one is a review published

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.860
in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.500
by the very Jaak Panksepp

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.810
although he has a co-author,

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:25.390
which is Stephen Siviy,

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:27.610
S I V I Y

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.460
I'll provide a link to this
in the caption show notes.

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.047
And the title of this paper is;

00:52:32.047 --> 00:52:34.300
"In Search of the
Neurobiological Substrates for

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.200
Social Playfulness in Mammalian Brains."

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.070
And it's a quite extensive review,

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:40.300
but it basically boils down

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.500
to some key findings

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:47.500
whereby, any sorts of drugs
or behaviors or scenarios

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:51.670
that increase levels
of adrenaline too much,

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:53.870
will tend to inhibit play

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:57.230
and drugs and scenarios
and I'm not suggesting

00:52:58.233 --> 00:52:59.066
recreational drugs here,

00:52:59.066 --> 00:53:00.000
but these were experiments that were done

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.690
in the laboratory setting

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.160
that increase the endogenous opioid output

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.210
will tend to increase playfulness.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.920
And so really the state of mind

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.580
that one needs to adopt when playing is,

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.260
first of all you have to
engage in the play it,

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.450
whatever it happens to be
with some degree of focus

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:20.640
and seriousness

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.370
and focus and seriousness in
the neurobiological context

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:24.808
generally means epinephrine

00:53:24.808 --> 00:53:28.410
being able to focus is largely reliant on

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.210
things like adrenaline epinephrine,

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:32.110
but also the presence of dopamine,

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.320
which is a molecule that
generates motivation

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.820
and focus in concert with epinephrine,

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:40.260
but also that these endogenous
opioids be liberated.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.830
And it's really the low
stakes feature of play

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.720
that allows those endogenous
opioids to be liberated.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.560
What do I mean by that?

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.270
Well, if you are very, very
concerned about the outcome,

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:52.286
like you've put a lot of money
on the table in a given game,

00:53:52.286 --> 00:53:55.856
or you're a football
player in the Super Bowl,

00:53:55.856 --> 00:53:57.870
or you're playing a game for which,

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.626
you know, defeating the other person

00:53:59.626 --> 00:54:03.300
or your team winning is
absolutely crucial to you.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.550
Well then that's not
really going to who engage

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.926
the play circuitry.

00:54:06.926 --> 00:54:09.350
On the contrary,

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:11.600
if you are engaging in
those same behaviors

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.870
or any other behavior in a way

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.140
that you're simply there to explore,

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.330
but you don't have high levels
of adrenaline in your system,

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.332
you're not stressed about
the potential outcome.

00:54:19.332 --> 00:54:21.676
Well, then that constitutes play.

00:54:21.676 --> 00:54:24.550
Now that's somewhat
obvious on the one hand

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.300
that you take seriously
what you take seriously,

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.590
and you can be more playful about things

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.250
that you don't take so seriously,

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:32.630
but what is absolutely not obvious

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.800
is that the state of playfulness

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.946
is actually what allows
you to perform best

00:54:38.946 --> 00:54:41.130
because the state of playfulness

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.260
offers you the opportunity to engage

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.052
in novel types of
behaviors and interactions

00:54:45.052 --> 00:54:48.300
that you would not
otherwise be able to access

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.330
if you are so focused
on the outcome. Okay.

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.940
So a state of playfulness
is absolutely critical,

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.560
not just during play,

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.300
but during competitive
scenarios of any kind.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.920
I actually started to cultivate
a practice related to this.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.230
When I was in college,

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:06.030
I had this kind of general practice

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:07.466
of when I wanted to learn something.

00:55:07.466 --> 00:55:11.380
I would tell myself that
it was the most important

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.450
information in the world

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.590
and that I was very very interested in it.

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:15.930
I would kind of lie to myself

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.610
and say oh, I'm super interested in,

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:18.690
I won't name the topics,

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.990
but super interested in this
or super interested in that.

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:24.070
And I could sort of delude
myself into being hyper focused

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:24.959
on whatever it is

00:55:24.959 --> 00:55:26.740
that I was learning

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.595
in ways that surprised me.

00:55:28.595 --> 00:55:30.210
However,

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.280
when we are hyper focused on something

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.990
and we are rigidly
attached to the outcome,

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:38.450
we can't engage in flexible thinking.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.370
So it's a great tool to be
hyper-focused on something

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.110
and take it very, very seriously

00:55:44.665 --> 00:55:45.950
when we're simply trying to learn things

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:47.040
by kind of rote memory,

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.220
learn things and regurgitate,

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.627
learn and regurgitate of the sort that,

00:55:49.627 --> 00:55:52.345
you know, I'm frankly a
lot of schooling involves.

00:55:52.345 --> 00:55:55.450
But if we are trying to
get better at something,

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:57.102
we sort of hit a wall
in athletic performance

00:55:57.102 --> 00:55:58.960
or in cognitive performance,

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.280
where we're not creative enough,

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.360
where we're finding

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.770
let's just use a sports example

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.660
that, you know we only have
a certain number of moves

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.820
that we can deploy

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.410
or certain number of swings of the racket

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:09.600
that we can deploy.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.320
The way to actually expand your practice

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.858
is to engage in this kind
of low stakes thinking,

00:56:14.858 --> 00:56:18.230
the idea that, well, I'm just
going to kind of play and tinker.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.730
I'm going to explore in a way

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.670
that it doesn't really matter
if the ball goes back over

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:22.503
the net,

00:56:22.503 --> 00:56:23.970
doesn't really matter if
the ball goes in the hole

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.940
and it's counterintuitive
because you think,

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.290
no, the thing that we need
to do is drill and drill

00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:29.123
and drill and drill.

00:56:29.123 --> 00:56:30.143
And indeed there's a place for that.

00:56:30.143 --> 00:56:34.780
But this mode of play with modest levels

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.230
of endogenous opioids being
released in our system,

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:39.750
plus low levels of adrenaline, right?

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:41.939
Epinephrine low levels of
epinephrine and adrenaline

00:56:41.939 --> 00:56:45.520
are possible only when
the stakes are low enough

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.210
that we're not stressed.

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:50.200
Well that combination really
allows the prefrontal cortex

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.190
to explore different possibilities

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:55.980
in ways that can truly expand
our capabilities over time.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.470
Now, this has been seen again and again,

00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:59.119
also in the business sector,

00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:02.330
some of the more challenging,

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:04.840
or I should say compare additive
companies to get jobs at

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.630
are very interested in hiring people

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.040
that as children were so called tinkerers,

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.090
and actually NASA was
first famous for this,

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:15.200
that many of the people
that achieved great success

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.467
in engineering at NASA,

00:57:16.467 --> 00:57:20.000
when they looked back into
their childhood histories,

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.570
those people tended to be tinkerers.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.380
They were people that would
kind of play with things

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.850
in way that wasn't about
rigidly following a recipe

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.150
or an instruction manual.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.088
Great cooks discover new forms of food.

00:57:31.088 --> 00:57:34.046
Indeed created entire genres of food

00:57:34.046 --> 00:57:36.600
by way of being tinkerers.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.287
Okay, musicians do this.

00:57:38.287 --> 00:57:40.850
I grew up playing various sports,

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:43.270
but skateboarding was one that
I was particularly involved

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:44.270
in for a long time.

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:45.960
One of the greatest
skateboarders of all time

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.120
is some of you may recognize his name

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.680
as the Great Rodney Mullen.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.170
And Rodney was kind of
famous for evolving the sport

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.530
and continuing to evolve the sport in ways

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:56.600
that no one could predict

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.550
using skateboards and all sorts of ways

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.290
that no one had thought of previously.

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:01.500
And of course there
are other skateboarders

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.640
that did that as well,

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.239
but he's particularly well known for that.

00:58:04.239 --> 00:58:06.820
And his process is his own.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:07.967
I can't speak to it too much,

00:58:07.967 --> 00:58:10.740
but he was also known
as a kind of a tinker

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.590
as somebody who would spend a lot of time,

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:13.990
just kind of flipping the board

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.670
and just flipping it into the air

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:17.250
and watching the ways in which it flipped

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.920
and kind of studying
the physics of it really

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.840
and expanding on his
existing understanding

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.800
of what could happen on a skateboard

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.210
by way of just playing.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.990
Now, he took it very seriously,

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:30.120
but it's this kind of razor's edge

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.770
between taking something very seriously,

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:34.210
but also tinkering and
playing and exploring

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.030
and just seeing what
happens and kind of like,

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.716
well, let's just see what
happens if we did this,

00:58:37.716 --> 00:58:40.790
that mindset is extremely powerful

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:43.390
to export from this
thing that we call play

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.780
into what we could call
more serious endeavor

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.840
of one's occupation or sport,

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.140
whether or not it's behind a desk

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.140
or whether or not it's
running around on a field

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.730
really for or engineering, any endeavor.

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.810
And so the whole purpose
of this episode on play

00:58:57.810 --> 00:58:59.460
is yes on the one hand

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:03.550
to illustrate the incredible
evolutionary utility of play

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:05.390
for setting up the self

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:06.870
and relation of the self to others,

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:08.810
indeed for setting up cultures entirely,

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:10.890
cuz' cultures will watch sport together

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.640
or they'll celebrate their team winning.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.480
I mean, World Cup,

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.960
I've never been a big soccer fan,

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.140
even though my dad is
Argentine, but it's incredible.

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.500
I mean the entire world kind of lights up

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.670
and gets engaged around
whether or not their team,

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.520
their country is going
to win the Olympics also

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.830
being another example,

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.680
but play and sport are not quite the same

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.000
as I've pointed out before.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.040
And for all of us who
are thinking about tools

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.640
and things that we can
extract from science

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.360
to enrich our lives,

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.660
I would say for those of
you that are already playing

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:38.990
on a regular basis

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.960
in one form or another

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.040
terrific start to expand
other forms of play

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.230
in particular forms of play

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:47.100
that involve new groups of individuals.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.930
So if you're somebody that typically plays

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:50.050
one-on-one with somebody,

00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:52.060
try to expand into playing as teams.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.278
If you're somebody who only plays alone,

00:59:54.278 --> 00:59:57.890
then try to expand into playing in perhaps

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.280
one-on-one first and in groups,

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.050
this is the way that your brain learns

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.320
and evolves and changes and gets better.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.480
And I raised this because

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.530
another one of the top 10 questions I get

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.460
is how can I keep my brain young?

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.020
How can I continue to learn?

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.640
How can I get better in school

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.780
and sport in life and
relationships, et cetera,

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.668
emotionally, cognitively,

01:00:16.668 --> 01:00:18.350
and on and on and on.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.510
And yes,

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.010
there are supplements that
can support neuroplasticity.

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.020
Yes, there are brain games and apps

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.830
that can support neuroplasticity.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:29.468
But if you really want to engage
neuroplasticity at any age,

01:00:29.468 --> 01:00:31.900
what you need to do is
return to the same sorts

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.610
of practices and tools

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:36.390
that your nervous system naturally used

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:37.330
throughout development.

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:39.890
And it evolved over hundreds
of thousands of years

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.205
to trigger this thing that
we call neuroplasticity.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.290
And the reason this is
so important is because

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:46.850
it starts to move us away from
what some people call hacks.

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:49.710
I define hacks as using one
thing for a different purpose

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.650
to kind of get a shortcut.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.610
I don't really like the term, frankly,

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:57.220
and I don't like it
because it's not grounded

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.708
in any biological mechanism.

01:00:58.708 --> 01:01:00.300
But when we look at play,

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.260
we can say, play is the portal to plastic.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.870
Play at every stage of life

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.700
is the way in which we learned the rules

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.380
for that stage of life.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.300
And play is the way in
which we were able to test

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.760
how we might function in
the real world context.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.600
So play is powerful.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.580
And we could even say that play
is the most powerful portal

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.510
to plasticity.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:22.987
The reason for that is that

01:01:22.987 --> 01:01:27.987
yes, this high opioid, low
epinephrine or adrenaline state

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:30.728
is what opens up play.

01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:33.940
But then inside of the arena of play,

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.420
when the prefrontal cortex is running

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:39.010
all these different possibilities
in this low stakes way.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.579
But with some degree of focus,

01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:44.000
there are a number of other
chemicals that are deployed.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.110
Things like Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:47.890
and other growth factors that actually

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:50.690
trigger the rewiring of brain circuits

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:52.750
that allow for it to expand.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.560
And indeed that's what is neuroplasticity.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.030
If you're interested in those chemicals

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:01.140
and kind of arena of things that happen

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.120
when one engages in neuroplasticity,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.070
there's a vast literature out there.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.230
But one of the more popular books

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:08.160
that I think is quite good

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.340
is from my friend and
colleague, John Ratey,

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.300
who's a psychiatrist at
Harvard Medical School.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.910
That's R A T E Y.

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.270
He wrote the book "Spark"

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.050
a few years back,

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.540
and I think it's still very relevant.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.140
And John talks about

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.946
the important role that play

01:02:22.946 --> 01:02:25.700
exerts in the neuroplasticity process

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.370
and points to a number
of different protocols

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:28.620
that one can engage in.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.020
He also points to the
importance of navigating

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.853
new environments

01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:33.730
to not just go on the
same hike every week,

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:34.670
or take the same walk,

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.870
but actually get into
new novel environments.

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.180
So you're starting to sense a theme here.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.088
There's novelty,

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.020
exploring contingencies,

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.910
keeping the stakes relatively low,

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.170
et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.790
But these really are the gates

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:48.600
to this holy grail that
we call neuroplasticity.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.410
Neuroplasticity as I've talked
about in the podcast before

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:52.680
is a two step process.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.400
It involves focusing very intensely

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.900
or at least focusing
somewhat on whatever it is

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.040
that one is trying to learn,

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.640
and then engaging in deep rest,

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.980
ideally deep sleep in
the following nights.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.900
And I've also talked about
the benefits of things

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.450
like naps and Yoga Nidra so-called NSDR,

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.880
Non Sleep Deep Rest

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.580
for enhancing or accelerating plasticity.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:16.950
You can check out the episodes
on Focus at hubermanlab.com

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.290
or the episodes on How to Learn Faster.

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.210
The detail all of those.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:22.730
We had a newsletter that lists out

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:26.210
all the tools for neuroplasticity
enhancing neuroplasticity,

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.240
all that is available.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.710
Zero cost to you at
hubermalab.com, et cetera.

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:33.170
You can just download that information,

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:36.560
but John's book that
newsletter those episodes.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.270
They really point to this two step process

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.158
where it's focus and then rest

01:03:39.158 --> 01:03:41.490
focus and then rest

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:44.230
and play is its own unique form

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.990
of focus and then rest, focus and rest.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.030
It's not the same as learning
something for sake of school

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:52.670
or critically trying to
learn a motor behavior

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:53.920
for sake of sport.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.560
It's really about expanding
the number of things

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.460
that you could learn down the line.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.350
Okay, so said once again.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.920
So I just want to make
sure it's abundantly clear

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.030
play is about establishing
a broader framework

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:08.990
within which you can learn new things.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:11.360
It's not about learning
some specific thing.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.960
It's not about the game
you happen to be playing.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.640
It's not about the dollhouse
that the kids are playing with

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.950
so that they can become
amazing dollhouse players

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:20.210
when they grow up. Right.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:22.292
The dirt Clod war that
I referred to earlier

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.040
for better or for worse

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.252
was not about becoming
the best dirt clod thrower

01:04:26.252 --> 01:04:28.780
or winning the trophy for dirt clods

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.613
in the neighborhood.

01:04:29.613 --> 01:04:30.610
Although we actually had a trophy

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:31.822
for the best dirt clod team.

01:04:31.822 --> 01:04:34.481
Alas, it was not my team that year.

01:04:34.481 --> 01:04:37.730
But the point is that
you're learning rules

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:41.120
and establishing a broader
foundation of practices

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.830
that then can learn more
things within that context.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.340
Thus far I've tried to convince you

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.700
through a combination of data
and anecdote and explanation

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.770
that adopting a stance of playfulness

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:54.410
and indeed engaging in play

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:56.070
on a somewhat regular basis

01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:57.170
could be beneficial to you

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.675
regardless of circumstances or goals.

01:04:59.675 --> 01:05:02.210
If I haven't done that already,

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:03.220
what I'm about to tell you,

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.720
hopefully will push you over the line.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.550
It turns out that when you
look across the kingdom

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:11.270
of all animals,

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.410
what you find is that animals

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.640
that engage in playful behaviors

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.050
for the longest period of time

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:22.040
are also the animals that
have the greatest degree

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.652
of neuroplasticity,

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:25.840
the brain and nervous system's ability

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.823
to change in response to experience,

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.810
put differently,

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:32.810
animals that only play
for a very small fraction

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:34.380
of their entire life

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.850
have very rigid brains that
don't learn new things,

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.280
whereas animals that
play for a long period

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.480
throughout their life

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.920
have very plastic brains.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.990
And there's even some
evidence that's at this point,

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.970
largely anecdotal,

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.200
but there's some data starting to emerge

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.550
that adults that maintain a playful stance

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.100
that engage in things again

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.100
that are low stakes contingency exploring

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.990
important enough that people focus

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.810
and that people pay attention
to what they're doing,

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:08.550
but that they are not, you know,

01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:09.970
filled with adrenaline, you know,

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:12.710
freaked out about the
outcome being A or B,

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:14.300
they're not super, super competitive,

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.700
maybe just a little bit competitive

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.470
or not competitive at all.

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:20.840
That allows for more ongoing plasticity.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.280
And one of the people that comes to mind

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.850
in thinking about this is
of course the Physicist,

01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:28.850
and I should say the Great
Physicist, Richard Feynman,

01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:30.822
Nobel Prize Winner Professor at Caltech

01:06:30.822 --> 01:06:33.430
was involved in the Manhattan Project,

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:38.190
but was also known for being
a lifelong tinker, right?

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:40.870
He also is a mischievous tinker.

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:43.877
If you read any of the books
about Feynman or by Feynman

01:06:43.877 --> 01:06:44.710
"Surely You're Joking."

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:47.100
Mr. Feynman, or "What Do You
Care What Other People Think?"

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.340
these are wonderful short stories,

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.800
mostly about Feynman,

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.982
doing things like

01:06:50.982 --> 01:06:54.940
picking all the locks at
the Los Alamos Laboratory

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.570
and putting all the top secret documents

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:57.910
out on the floor of the office

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.220
so that when people
came men in the morning,

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.183
they were all out there.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:03.170
Obviously they weren't
released to the general public.

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:05.110
He didn't want to threaten
national security,

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.950
but playing pranks like that.

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:08.620
And actually Caltech,

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.850
I don't know if this is still the case,

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:11.200
but Caltech where he was employed

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.100
was always known for doing very

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.860
technologically challenging pranks.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.340
They're not known for their
athletic pros at Caltech,

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.510
sorry, Caltech,

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.721
but they were known for example,

01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:26.770
disrupting the scoreboard at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:27.603
for instance,

01:07:27.603 --> 01:07:28.450
and things of that sort

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:31.240
through technological
feats, at least at the time

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.600
required a lot of playfulness

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.260
and technological pros.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.890
So if you look in science
or you look in art,

01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.300
or you look in medicine
or you in any domain,

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.310
what you find is the people
that continue to evolve

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:44.414
new practices

01:07:44.414 --> 01:07:46.212
tend to be people that were tinkerers.

01:07:46.212 --> 01:07:48.720
People that are very creative,

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.240
tend to be people that are unafraid

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.110
of exploring things in
a, this low stakes way.

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.350
They're not so rigidly
attached to the outcome

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:58.500
that they have to do everything
perfectly all the time.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.170
Now they might cloak
these playful behaviors

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:02.700
so that their final works

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.100
always look perfect or
always look incredible,

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.000
but they have this kind of
playful nature about them.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.710
I would venture even say that the,

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.940
the street artist Banksy, for instance,

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.080
obviously an incredible
artist puts a ton of thought

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.732
and preparation into their work,

01:08:15.732 --> 01:08:19.920
but there's a kind of playfulness
to the whole thing too,

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.370
of using two dimensional paintings

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:24.300
in concert with three
dimensional city dwellings

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.133
in ways that,

01:08:25.133 --> 01:08:26.960
you know I think that most
people hadn't previously,

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.820
there were other people
like Christo and, you know,

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.410
artists of that sort that did that.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.850
But I think Banksy is kind of recognized

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.600
as the modern, the modern rendition

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.010
of that kind of playfulness
using cities in ways

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:39.190
that most people don't use cities

01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:42.530
using art in ways that
most people don't use art,

01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:43.760
for instance.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.040
So to go back to the example of Feynman.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.880
Feynman was somebody who learned to paint

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.723
and draw quite well into his sixties.

01:08:50.723 --> 01:08:53.260
He was somewhat famous or infamous,

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.300
I should say for Bongo Drumming
on the roof of Caltech.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.950
I say infamous because

01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.490
he was known also for doing that naked.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.580
Something that certainly not in concert

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.740
with the ethical standards and behaviors

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.990
of universities today.

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:10.240
But Feynman had this
playful spirit as a child.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.900
He had that playful spirit as a teenager,

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.430
and he had that playful
spirit as an adult.

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.850
And that's one of the
whole hallmarks of Feynman

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:20.040
was that he wasn't just a rigid physicist

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.300
who could explain things
clearly to the general public.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.900
He always carried through
this playful spirit

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.300
and in some of his writings,

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.210
he pointed to the fact
that that playful spirit

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:31.120
was something that he worked very hard

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.360
to continue to cultivate in himself

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.340
because it was the way
in which he could see

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.550
the world differently

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:39.900
and to indeed make great discoveries

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.960
in the field of physics,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.280
but also to kind of
evolve his relationship

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.230
to life more generally.

01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:45.324
And so he comes to mind

01:09:45.324 --> 01:09:48.275
as a prominent example
of somebody who did this.

01:09:48.275 --> 01:09:50.876
And if I could achieve
anything with this episode,

01:09:50.876 --> 01:09:53.210
besides teaching you something
about the biology of play,

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:56.254
it would be to teach you
about the utility of play.

01:09:56.254 --> 01:09:57.370
Again, I'm,

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:00.000
don't consider myself a
particularly playful person

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:00.900
by nature,

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.110
but I've tried over the years to adopt

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:06.580
this stance of exploring
things that are, you know,

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.270
very focused on contingencies
of different kinds,

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:10.770
but keep the stakes low enough

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:12.310
that I can have some fun doing them.

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:15.000
And I like to think that
it's benefited me somewhat.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.430
Now, I'd like to drill
a little bit further

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:18.450
into this thing that we
called neuroplasticity.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:21.990
Again neuroplasticity is the
brain and nervous system's

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.380
ability to change in
response to experience.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.440
And I should just say that
throughout the entire lifespan,

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.500
the nervous system can change very quickly

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.940
in response to negative experiences.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.820
We can almost all engage in
what's called one trial learning

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:37.240
where if something really
terrible or traumatic happens

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.073
to us,

01:10:38.073 --> 01:10:40.920
our nervous system will
rewire almost immediately,

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.510
at least within a few days,

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.210
such that we tend to want
to avoid the experience

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:47.600
that led to that trauma.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.460
Now the whole business of
why people return to things

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.640
that are traumatic to them

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.510
is a whole other issue.

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:55.630
There are books about
things like trauma bonding.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:58.420
There's the so-called
repetition compulsion

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.490
from psychoanalysis

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.660
that people go back into trauma to retest

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.220
and gain new opportunities
to overcome the trauma,

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.053
et cetera, et cetera.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:07.000
But in general, what I'm
referring to here is,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:07.833
you know,

01:11:07.833 --> 01:11:09.190
you have a bad experience
at the swimming pool

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:10.023
when you're a kid

01:11:10.023 --> 01:11:11.057
where someone holds your
head underwater too long,

01:11:11.057 --> 01:11:13.040
and then you just don't want
to get back in the water.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.101
That's one trial learning of sorts,

01:11:15.101 --> 01:11:17.354
that of course can be overcomed

01:11:17.354 --> 01:11:19.560
through proper exposure therapy

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.680
or someone that you
trust taking you there,

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.720
or any number of behaviors

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.220
that allow you to overcome that,

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.890
be that particular scenario
and experience something new

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:29.940
in that same context.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.170
But across the lifespan,

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:34.640
the learn earning of new
things, new contingencies,

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.152
new possibilities

01:11:36.152 --> 01:11:37.970
occurs very differently

01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:40.490
from about age zero when we're born

01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:43.030
until about age 25 and thereafter.

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:44.850
So from about, about,

01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.672
I want to emphasize
approximately age 25 onward

01:11:47.672 --> 01:11:50.720
neuroplasticity occurs through the process

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.170
that is exactly as I
described before, focus, rest,

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:56.810
focus, rest, we focus very intensely.

01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:57.840
We can't do the thing.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.010
We can't do the new movement.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:00.220
We can't do the golf swing.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.514
We can't learn the math.

01:12:01.514 --> 01:12:04.750
We try, we try, we try, we
try, we sleep a few nights.

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:05.973
And then all of a sudden
we can do it, right,

01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:08.600
because the rewiring actually
occurs during deep rest

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.520
or naps,

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.970
but mostly during deep sleep.

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:15.320
From birth till about out age 25 however,

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.670
we can learn things, new things,

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:18.963
and new contingencies,

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.250
not just negative things

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.293
and traumatic things

01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:25.510
through somewhat passive
exposure to those things, right.

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:27.510
I will never forget the first time

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:30.940
that we went on a family
trip to Washington DC.

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.160
And we went to the Smithsonian.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.070
I got to see the, the old fighter planes.

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.903
And I think,

01:12:34.903 --> 01:12:36.520
I think the Kitty Hawk

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.430
or the first one of the
first planes was there.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.730
Anyway, I obviously my
recollection isn't terrific.

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.540
My hippocampus is, is
flailing on that one,

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.810
but I'll never forget the trip.

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:46.010
And I'll never forget who went.

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:48.061
And I think I was probably
eight or nine years old.

01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:50.570
It's embedded somewhere in my memory.

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:53.060
And so just through passive experience

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.931
and my focusing on the
things that excited me

01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:56.550
about that trip,

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.260
I have a recollection of that experience.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.410
I didn't have to deliberately focus.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.980
I didn't, wasn't telling myself focused,

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.590
you're going to need to
remember this trip someday

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:05.100
and you're going to be
podcasting about this,

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.950
you know, in 39 years, or whenever

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.620
again, I forget exactly how old I was.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.610
But the key feature here is that

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.910
the developing brain is able

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:17.820
to learn through passive experience

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.553
because the neurons, the nerve
cells in the developing brain

01:13:21.553 --> 01:13:25.780
are much more over-connected

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.770
than they will be later in life.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.010
The way to think about this is sort of,

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.220
if you use Google maps,

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.470
as I do too often I think

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.830
when I drive,

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.540
there are a number of roads and pathways

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.440
that would get you from
point A to point B.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.540
We could imagine those as neural circuits,

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.503
or we could imagine neural
circuits as those roads.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:48.160
Early in development,
the nerve connections

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.780
are much more extensive.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.050
It it's like having a Google maps

01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:53.990
that where everything is
connected to everything

01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:55.270
through tiny little cross streets.

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:57.580
And the whole thing is
just a complete mess.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.580
But then by taking particular routes

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.980
of behavior of thought of emotion,

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.250
certain routes become well established.

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.274
And the other routes that are not taken

01:14:08.274 --> 01:14:10.290
simply disappear.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:12.710
Now in the biological
context in the brain,

01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:14.800
we call that process pruning.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.410
And the simple way to envision
this is early in development.

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:20.410
You have many, many more
neurons than you will have

01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:21.460
as an adult.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.811
Those neurons are
extensively interconnected,

01:14:23.811 --> 01:14:27.500
and approximately 40% of
those interconnections

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.060
will disappear by the
time you're 25 years old,

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.240
they are gone.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.900
They are actively
removed through processes

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.550
that involve things like
glial cells that come in

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:39.130
and literally sneak their little processes

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:41.320
in between neurons at the synapse,

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.090
which are the points of
contact and communication

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.030
between neurons and push those apart,

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:47.330
even eat neurons, right?

01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:50.250
There's some incredible
work from for instance,

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:52.420
Beth Stevens' Lab at
Harvard Medical School,

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.720
showing that glial cells
go in and eat synapses

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.380
that are not functional for
that particular circuit.

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.850
Now, what this tells us is
that much of our learning

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:07.210
during development is the
removal of incorrect connections,

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:09.880
but it also involves the
strengthening of connections

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.670
that are going to serve certain
emotions, certain functions,

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:16.070
motor functions, cognitive
functions, et cetera.

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:19.380
The process of play

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.640
is largely a process of engaging pruning

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.950
of neural connections

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:28.020
and strengthening of the
remaining connections.

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.550
I'm sure that many of
you have heard the term

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:31.282
fire together wire together.

01:15:31.282 --> 01:15:35.460
That phrase is often
incorrectly attributed

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.790
to the great Donald Hebb,
who indeed was great.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:40.100
Did incredible work a
psychologist from Canada

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.810
who established a lot of the
basic cellar learning rules

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:44.380
for learning and memory,

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:48.210
but it was the also great Dr. Carla Shatz,

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.770
who is now at Stanford

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:52.640
and was at Berkeley and Harvard as well,

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.910
but who is at Stanford Medical School

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:57.210
who coined this term fire
together wire together.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:59.020
Indeed that's what happens

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.531
when children play

01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:02.780
when adolescents play

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.670
and when young adults play,

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.308
whether or not it's social play

01:16:06.308 --> 01:16:07.940
or play with an object,

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.840
whether or not it's a
sport or a play of any kind

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.120
imaginary play imaginary friend play,

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.500
there is a strengthening of
certain neural connections

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.270
and a pruning away of up to 40%,

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:21.098
perhaps even more of connections

01:16:21.098 --> 01:16:26.098
that are not necessary for
certain types of behaviors,

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.200
emotions, and thoughts.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.630
And what this means is

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:32.360
that it is through the process of play,

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.750
that we become who we are as adults.

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:35.860
And as I mentioned earlier,

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.921
it is through the process of play

01:16:37.921 --> 01:16:41.640
that we are able to adjust
who we are as adults.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.071
Now, there are bounds on this process,

01:16:44.071 --> 01:16:47.470
as far as I know there's
never been a reported case

01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:50.120
of an individual who had a hyperplastic

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:55.120
or I should say a brain that
was as plastic in adulthood

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.550
as it was in childhood.

01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:59.850
But what this tells us is that

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:03.560
what we do in the process
of play as children

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.040
is really how we set up the rules

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.150
for how we behave as adults
in almost all domains,

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:09.490
which is really incredible.

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:11.260
And of course the reassuring thing is that

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.570
playing as an adult

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:15.090
will allow you to expand
on those neural circuits.

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:17.000
You can literally grow new connections.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:17.880
Some of you may be saying,

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.158
does it create new neurons

01:17:19.158 --> 01:17:21.400
for better or for worse?

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.920
It does not seem that
many new neurons are added

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.310
to your brain in adulthood.

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:28.970
There are some papers
that report a few neurons

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:31.570
in certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas,

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:32.403
but by and large,

01:17:32.403 --> 01:17:34.100
most of the rewiring of neural connections

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.020
is the removal of certain connections.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.680
This process we're calling Pruning

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.500
and the strengthening of
the remaining connections

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.340
that make those kind of Google maps roads.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.860
And the analogy I laid out before

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.970
thicker and more robust think about as

01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:47.180
taking little trails

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.430
and turning them into roads,
then paving those roads.

01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:52.000
Then turning those roads into highways,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.720
then putting up more
lanes on those highways

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.320
and eliminating all the small
little back-country roads

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.680
that one could take.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.513
And again,

01:17:59.513 --> 01:18:01.190
this is an analogy for what is happening

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:03.020
at the level of neuro circuitry.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:03.853
Now,

01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:08.230
one of the key findings that
has emerged from the literature

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:13.230
is children that have
been subjected to trauma

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.566
or immense amounts of stress of any kind,

01:18:16.566 --> 01:18:19.710
have a harder time both engaging in play,

01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:22.620
but also a harder time
accessing neuroplasticity later

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:23.720
in life.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.280
The good news is this is
not a permanent effect.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.276
And we'll talk about some
of the ways to overcome that

01:18:28.276 --> 01:18:29.580
in a moment,

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.100
but this should make sense to you

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.240
because earlier we talked about

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.140
how a high level of adrenaline

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.820
epinephrine in the brain and body

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.030
actually inhibits blocks the circuits

01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:45.400
in the brain and body that
generate play behavior.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.233
And when I say that,

01:18:46.233 --> 01:18:47.930
I mean that in a very concrete way,

01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:50.000
that epinephrine and adrenaline

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.690
can actually suppress
the sorts of circuitry

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:54.920
that can lead to things like soft eyes

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.870
or tongue out, or the head tilt,

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.490
or what we called partial postures

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:02.202
of being able to engage in,

01:19:02.202 --> 01:19:04.510
you know, a rough and tumble play,

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:06.890
but not take that to the
point of outright aggression

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:10.230
and damaging the other
person or them damaging you.

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:11.920
So when I say that,

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.430
you know, trauma and stress
can inhibit neuroplasticity

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:17.271
by way of inhibiting play

01:19:17.271 --> 01:19:19.580
at a deeper neuro biological level.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.800
What I'm really saying is

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.550
that the high levels of adrenaline

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:25.060
that are generated from
trauma and stress actually

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.680
shut down the circuits

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.630
that allow a child or a young adult

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.920
to enter the game of play

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.600
or in the game of play

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.410
in the same way that
a child or young adult

01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:37.740
who didn't have high levels of adrenaline

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.040
in their system could possibly engage in.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:41.873
Now,

01:19:41.873 --> 01:19:44.790
the good news is that many of
the existing trauma therapies

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:45.623
that are out there now,

01:19:45.623 --> 01:19:46.990
including things like EMDR

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.590
Exposure Therapy, Cognitive
Behavioral therapy,

01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:50.610
and on and on,

01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:53.850
including some of the therapies

01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:55.220
that are more neurochemical,

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.473
things like ketamine, or
are more engineering based,

01:19:58.473 --> 01:20:02.150
things like Transcranial magnetic
stimulation for instance,

01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:05.580
many of those are paired
with forms of talk therapy

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.420
that are really about the
same thing that play is about,

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.292
which is exploring
different contingencies.

01:20:10.292 --> 01:20:13.520
It's about exploring different types

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.590
of emotional experiences

01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:18.160
as they relate to the
same sort of scenario

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.400
that created the trauma.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.940
And we did an entire
episode on fear and trauma,

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.770
and I recommend you
check out that episode.

01:20:23.770 --> 01:20:25.920
It's easy to find again
at hubermanlab.com,

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.110
it's on YouTube, Apples,
Spotify, et cetera, et cetera,

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:29.010
very easy to find.

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.082
And there I talk all
about trauma treatments

01:20:31.082 --> 01:20:33.290
and the various kinds of trauma treatments

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:34.123
that are out there,

01:20:34.123 --> 01:20:38.000
their efficacy in different
scenarios and traumas and so on.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.050
But the point I'd like to make now is that

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:42.760
the reason why children who
experience a lot of trauma

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.882
and stress have limited
plasticity later on

01:20:45.882 --> 01:20:48.960
is because the neurochemical substrates

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.420
that are created from trauma and stress,

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.253
because after all

01:20:52.253 --> 01:20:54.920
stress is epinephrine and
epinephrine is stress.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.670
Those are inseparable

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:59.420
and the way in which it
more or less shuts down

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.170
or at least inhibits suppresses

01:21:02.342 --> 01:21:04.485
those play circuits.

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:05.719
And again the reassuring thing

01:21:05.719 --> 01:21:07.460
is that by engaging in play as adults,

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.460
we can reactivate some of those circuits

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.180
and reopen the plasticity.

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:14.720
In fact one very prominent
trauma treatment now,

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.250
especially for people
that have been subjected

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:18.679
to very severe traumas,

01:21:18.679 --> 01:21:20.410
in the ongoing sense,

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:23.250
meaning traumas that went
on for many, many years

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:26.040
is to get them to engage in play

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.570
in things like dance

01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:29.840
in basically getting them to engage

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.860
their bodily movements

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.650
in ways that they would otherwise

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:34.520
not feel comfortable to engage in.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.680
And I find this area so interesting

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.520
because on the face of it, you could say,

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.470
oh, that's kind of, you know,

01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:40.950
is that really biomedical treatment?

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:42.320
You know, you're taking
people who traumatized

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.450
and having them dance.

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:45.480
I mean, it seems kind of
silly on the one hand,

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.168
depending on your, you know,

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:50.980
your particular orientation.

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.320
But on the other hand,

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.230
it's actually quite
profound and quite grounded

01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:59.440
in the mechanisms by which
the brain circuits change.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.050
So again,

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.370
back to this original principle,

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:05.690
which is that play, isn't
just one portal to plasticity

01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:08.860
play is the fundamental
portal to plasticity

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.220
and that play and dance

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.140
and exploration of novel movements,

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.496
exploration of novel athletic movements

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.430
are the route

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:19.280
by which we access new ways of thinking

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.597
new contingencies.

01:22:20.597 --> 01:22:24.200
And I find it wonderful
that the trauma release

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.120
and the psychiatric and
psychology community

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.970
are exploring things like play and dance

01:22:30.970 --> 01:22:34.300
and other forms of
reopening these circuits

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.776
because indeed we would all love

01:22:36.776 --> 01:22:38.900
for there to be a magic pill

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.320
by which trauma could be erased

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.910
and new memories could be laid down

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:43.570
or a device that could do that.

01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:46.800
But frankly, if you ask me
or a number of my colleagues,

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.760
whether or not that's likely
to happen anytime soon

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.593
in an effective way,

01:22:49.593 --> 01:22:51.910
I think the short answer
is going to be no,

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:53.370
that there are going to be chemicals

01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:57.240
and things that can augment
and support that process,

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.010
but that there's not going
to be just a magic pill

01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:02.080
that will suddenly
reverse trauma altogether.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:04.570
That it's always going
to be a case whereby

01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:06.256
shifts in neurochemical states

01:23:06.256 --> 01:23:07.800
are going to have to be combined

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.840
with new ways of thinking
and new behaviors.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.900
And I find it wonderful in reassuring

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:14.600
that people are looking
at play and play behavior

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.670
as a not just one tiny
shard of possibility there,

01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:21.030
but that it might actually
be the main driver

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:23.400
and a highly productive lever

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.010
by which to rewire the traumatized brain.

01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:27.709
So if you're like me,
you might be thinking,

01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:30.876
okay, I'm willing to be more playful.

01:23:30.876 --> 01:23:32.540
I'm willing to explore,

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.289
play as a portal to plasticity.

01:23:34.289 --> 01:23:37.175
And that all makes good sense,

01:23:37.175 --> 01:23:39.280
but what should I play?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.560
What should I do?

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.690
Well, we've already established
that you want to keep

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:44.660
your adrenaline low.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.670
You have to keep the stakes slow enough

01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:49.632
that you're not going to get
totally consumed by the outcome.

01:23:49.632 --> 01:23:52.380
Now, for some people who
are highly competitive,

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.670
that's going to be challenging.

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.420
And yet I don't want to make it seem

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.730
as if you can't be
competitive during play.

01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.960
There are many forms of competitive play

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.400
that because you are a competitive person,

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.230
allow you to drive great joy
from that competitive play.

01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:10.090
I have a friend who's
particularly good at horseshoes.

01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.540
I'm not particularly good at horseshoes,

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.980
but whenever we play horseshoes,

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:17.570
I can tell he's out there
to crush me on horseshoes.

01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:19.520
And it's just one of these
things where, you know,

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.460
I can tell he derives great pleasure

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.583
from crushing me at a game of horseshoes.

01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:27.016
I can't say because I
haven't actually done

01:24:27.016 --> 01:24:27.849
the microdialysis,

01:24:27.849 --> 01:24:29.440
which is a way of extracting chemistry

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.130
from the brain in real time,

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:34.420
nor have I recorded from his
brain or image it in a scanner,

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.720
whether or not he has
high levels of epinephrine

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.000
or low levels of epinephrine.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.070
During those games of horseshoes,

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:41.040
I suspect his low levels of epinephrine

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.760
and high levels of dopamine,
especially when he wins.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.730
And he has, he wins every time.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:49.350
But the win is that you can
be competitive during play,

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:52.030
provided that you were enjoying yourself.

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:53.440
Okay, you can be competitive

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.519
provided that you were enjoying yourself.

01:24:55.519 --> 01:24:58.530
There are particular forms of play

01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:01.910
that lend themselves
best to neuroplasticity.

01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:04.630
And those particular forms of play again,

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:07.120
are not designed to
necessarily just engage

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.020
the plasticity that allows
you to perform that behavior,

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.260
but rather to expand the
number of possibilities

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.550
for your brain to change
in general throughout life

01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:19.060
and the two major forms of those

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.290
for which there's good
Peer Reviewed Research

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:24.660
is to engage in novel forms of movement,

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:27.200
including different speeds of movement.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.930
So let's say for instance,
you're somebody who runs.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:30.880
I happen to like running.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.308
I try and run three times a week.

01:25:32.308 --> 01:25:35.480
And generally when I run, I run forward,

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.080
I don't run backward, although recently,

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.600
because I've become very excited

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.350
about the work of so-called
"Knees Over Toes Guy,"

01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.020
his name is Ben Parker,

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:45.750
but he goes by "Knees Over
Toes Guy" on Instagram.

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:46.583
I've never met him,

01:25:46.583 --> 01:25:49.150
but we've exchanged a few
messages back and forth.

01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:51.730
And some of his practices involve

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:55.540
walking backwards or doing
sled poles backwards.

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.000
I found these to be very beneficial

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.810
for my back and for my,

01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:00.270
you know, interior tibialis

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:01.750
and some things that have really helped

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.960
with my posture and so forth.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.570
But in general, when I run, I run forward,

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:07.330
I don't tend to run backward that much.

01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:09.130
And I might do that for
a few minutes at the end,

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:12.610
but not so much throughout the entire run.

01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:15.580
Running doesn't lend itself
to a lot of novel forms

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.860
of movement, lateral movements.

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:20.970
So for the nerds out there
movement in the Sagittal plane

01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:22.136
or angled movements,

01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:25.730
but it does appear that
things like dance or sports

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:29.150
where you end up generating
a lot of dynamic movements

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.100
where there's jumping,

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.070
where there's movement
at different angles,

01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:34.360
where there's ducking,
where there's leaping,

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.930
that basically involve a
lot of dynamic movement.

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:39.110
And aren't just strictly linear.

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:42.108
Those seem to open the
portals for plasticity.

01:26:42.108 --> 01:26:46.420
And that's because they mimic
a lot of the brain circuitry

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.520
that is associated with play.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.300
And the reason for that
is the way in which

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.460
those dynamic movements

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.350
and movements of different speeds

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:55.030
engage the vestibular system.

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.980
The balance system,

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.960
the vestibular system is in the inner ear,

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.400
relates to the cerebellum,

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.457
which translates the mini brain.

01:27:00.457 --> 01:27:02.580
You got a little mini brain
in the back of your brain.

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:05.919
It brings together visual
information in a very direct way.

01:27:05.919 --> 01:27:08.170
I talked a lot about this in the episode

01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:09.580
on how to learn faster.

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.658
So if you want to go in
depth on how vestibular

01:27:11.658 --> 01:27:14.430
and different types of motor
movements can open plasticity,

01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:16.740
I talk a little bit more, I
should say a lot more there,

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.010
but suffice to say that engaging in play

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:22.360
that has a lot of dynamic movement

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.650
or movements of different speeds,

01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:24.530
things like dance,

01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:25.363
things like sports,

01:27:25.363 --> 01:27:27.098
like soccer where you're
moving in different dimensions.

01:27:27.098 --> 01:27:29.679
That tends to be very conducive

01:27:29.679 --> 01:27:32.360
to what we would call
play related circuitry

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.610
provided you don't take it too seriously.

01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:36.230
You don't get those high
levels of epinephrine.

01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:37.748
Now for those of you that

01:27:37.748 --> 01:27:41.310
are also interested in non-physical

01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:43.640
or non-athletic forms of play

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.579
that can really expand plasticity.

01:27:45.579 --> 01:27:47.530
There's some very interesting research

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:49.290
about the game of Chess.

01:27:49.290 --> 01:27:50.820
I don't play the game of Chess.

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:51.950
I've played a few times.

01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:53.950
I confess I don't know how
to move all the pieces.

01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:55.401
So I'm not going to try
and describe that here,

01:27:55.401 --> 01:27:56.827
but I've always wanted to learn Chess.

01:27:56.827 --> 01:27:59.370
And I think after reading some
of the Peer Reviewed Research

01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:01.430
about chess and play and neuroplasticity,

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:02.920
now I understand why

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.270
there's a really nice paper

01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:07.160
published in the International
Journal of Research

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.920
in Education and Science in 2017.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.252
And the title of this paper is,

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:15.030
"Is Chess Just a Game or Is It a Mirror

01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:17.337
That Reflects a Child's Inner World?"

01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:20.110
That's a very, a very intense title

01:28:20.110 --> 01:28:21.564
for a biologist like me,

01:28:21.564 --> 01:28:24.800
but this paper is so interesting

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.140
because what it really points to is

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.570
the fact that in a single game chess,

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.871
you have at least as I
understand two players,

01:28:31.871 --> 01:28:36.871
and those two players are moving
pieces on the chess board,

01:28:37.170 --> 01:28:40.450
for which each piece can
do different things, right?

01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:42.560
Can move in different ways
under different scenarios,

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.300
but they're different
rules for different pieces.

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.610
And so each player actually has to assume

01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:49.750
multiple identities during the same game.

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:52.170
And each of those identities
has different rules

01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:53.560
and ways of interacting.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.390
So in a way we can think
of chess as one game,

01:28:56.390 --> 01:29:00.490
but actually chess is
a kind of a substrate

01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:03.820
for exploring multiple roles
for different characters.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.230
And this is quite a bit different

01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:06.710
than for instance, video games

01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:09.660
where somebody has their
favorite video game player,

01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:10.870
or they have an avatar.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:12.340
And they're always in the same role.

01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:13.650
It's also quite a bit different

01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:15.490
for when you engage in any kind of play

01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:16.570
where you are yourself,

01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:18.650
you're just being you in that game.

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:22.111
And so now I'm highly
incentivized to explore chess.

01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:25.550
You see quotes out there, for instance,

01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:29.100
things like "Chess is life
or jiu jitsu is life."

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:32.820
I always assumed that that
meant that someone's entire life

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.653
was chess

01:29:33.653 --> 01:29:36.712
or their entire life was
jiu jitsu for instance,

01:29:36.712 --> 01:29:40.950
but in reading over the research
about chess in particular,

01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:42.780
but at also certain forms of martial arts,

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.270
also certain forms of dance.

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:46.200
What one finds is that

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.530
indeed those games are life

01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:52.930
in the sense that they involve
adopting multiple roles

01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:55.690
and exploring contingencies
in a number of different ways.

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:56.880
So there are some games

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:00.480
that allow you to explore
a much vaster landscape

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.570
of movements or of mental roles

01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:05.620
or of ways of engaging
in strategic movement

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:07.340
as is the case with chess.

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.393
And so when you hear that,

01:30:08.393 --> 01:30:10.932
you know, activity blank is life.

01:30:10.932 --> 01:30:13.719
It often reflects the
passion for that activity,

01:30:13.719 --> 01:30:15.550
but I think looked at differently.

01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:18.323
It also reflects the
fact that that activity

01:30:18.323 --> 01:30:21.520
is a portal through which
you can explore life

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:24.160
through many, many different lenses.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.374
And I think that that's
especially powerful

01:30:26.374 --> 01:30:28.330
in terms of thinking about how play

01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:29.990
can be leveraged for plasticity.

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:33.010
So for those of you that are
interested in leveraging play

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:36.200
for neuroplasticity and
expanding your mind,

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.720
if you will,

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.200
I highly recommend picking an activity

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.592
that will allow you to
adopt different roles

01:30:43.592 --> 01:30:44.425
within that activity

01:30:44.425 --> 01:30:45.680
where it's not rigidly linear.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.450
This is actually a way in which

01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:51.530
I start to depart from
this modern and important,

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:53.860
but somewhat narrow idea.

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.993
That exercise is the
only route to plasticity.

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:58.400
Yes, it's true.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.313
I have Nobel Prize winning colleagues

01:31:00.313 --> 01:31:02.700
that swim for two miles a day

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.070
and have done on that for a long time.

01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.950
And they will tell you,

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:06.504
I always think more
clearly after my swimming

01:31:06.504 --> 01:31:10.580
and I certainly in my
experience after a good run

01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:13.203
or a good workout, my
mind seems to work best.

01:31:13.203 --> 01:31:15.810
Unless of course, that workout
was very, very intense.

01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:16.870
I've talked about this before.

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:19.190
If you do work out very, very hard

01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:20.370
in whether or not it's aerobic

01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:23.157
or resistance training
or sport of any kind,

01:31:23.157 --> 01:31:25.430
you brain won't function
as well afterwards,

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:27.560
mostly because of the diversion of oxygen

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.900
to tissues away from your brain,

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.880
you actually are getting
less oxygen to your brain,

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:32.713
but in general,

01:31:32.713 --> 01:31:34.330
most of us feel that if
we exercise regularly,

01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:35.825
our brain functions better.

01:31:35.825 --> 01:31:39.652
But there are activities that
extend beyond linear exercise,

01:31:39.652 --> 01:31:43.060
beyond just generating
the same sets of movements

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:43.893
over and over again,

01:31:43.893 --> 01:31:45.400
when or not it's exercise or not.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.400
And that's really what play is.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:51.600
Play is about dynamically
exploring different kinds

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.433
of movements,

01:31:52.433 --> 01:31:54.590
dynamically exploring
different kinds of thoughts,

01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:57.800
dynamically exploring
different kinds of roles

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.911
that one could adopt.

01:31:58.911 --> 01:32:02.600
And that is the way that
the brain learns new things.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.610
So I encourage you to explore chess.

01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:05.970
I intend to learn chess this year.

01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:07.370
I'm very excited to do that.

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:09.200
Now, if you already play chess

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.090
and you are an expert chess player,

01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:13.860
you actually will derive less benefit

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:16.980
in terms of this play
induced neuroplasticity

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.190
than you would, for instance,

01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:19.023
if you went out,

01:32:19.023 --> 01:32:21.040
and I don't know, played a game of soccer

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.410
or did something that was very novel

01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:23.630
for your nervous system,

01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:24.732
because in that novelty

01:32:24.732 --> 01:32:28.090
and in that exploration of new behaviors

01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:29.373
and new ways of thinking,

01:32:29.373 --> 01:32:31.553
you are opening the portal to plasticity,

01:32:31.553 --> 01:32:34.180
whereas in doing what you
already know how to do

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.803
and trying just to perform
better and better at it,

01:32:36.803 --> 01:32:38.770
you will get better at chess,

01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:40.800
but again, that's just chess.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.820
You are not expanding the realms

01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:46.000
in which you can become more plastic,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.480
that you are able to learn new things

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.450
in relationship,

01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:52.040
in life, in finance and
friendship, et cetera.

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.540
In researching this episode,

01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:56.280
one of the most interesting
areas I discovered

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.490
was this notion of personal play identity,

01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:01.930
personal play identity is a term

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:03.980
that at least to my
knowledge was coined by

01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:06.950
a Turkish researcher by the name.

01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:09.060
And forgive me, I'm going
to mispronounce this

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.540
is Gökhan Güneş

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.060
G O K H A N,

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.540
last name G U N E S.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.050
And forgive me Gökhan

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:21.430
and if we have any Turkish
speaking members of the audience,

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:25.963
please put the correction in
the comment section on YouTube,

01:33:25.963 --> 01:33:29.020
make it fanatic so I can
understand what it is.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.650
Please I'd love to
correct it and apologies,

01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:33.490
or who knows if I got it right

01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:34.712
then it was pure luck.

01:33:34.712 --> 01:33:39.163
Gökhan Güneş has coined this
term personal play identity,

01:33:39.163 --> 01:33:44.163
and the key role that
personal play identity

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.430
establishes in who we
see ourselves as being,

01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.580
and not just in the context of play.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:51.940
Personal play identity

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.510
has four well defined dimensions.

01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:55.830
And I should say that if you're interested

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:56.880
in learning more about this,

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.580
the paper that I found
particularly informative

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:04.200
is published in Current Psychology

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.170
and the title is "Personal play identity

01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:09.300
and the fundamental elements
in its development process."

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.452
And the author of course,

01:34:10.452 --> 01:34:12.790
is Gökhan Güneş G U N E S last name.

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:14.050
This is from 2021.

01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:15.133
So recent review.

01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:18.971
There are four components
to personal play identity,

01:34:18.971 --> 01:34:21.513
how you play,

01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:24.404
your personality,

01:34:24.404 --> 01:34:27.720
socio culture and environment.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.240
So that's the third one that's together,

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.350
socio culture environment,

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:32.880
and economics and technology.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.510
Now that sounds somewhat complex,

01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:35.970
and this paper is somewhat complex,

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.622
but basically what it says is that

01:34:37.622 --> 01:34:42.410
we bring together certain
aspects of ourselves

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:45.210
and how we react to
different place scenarios

01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:46.043
when we're younger.

01:34:46.043 --> 01:34:48.410
And we bring that forward into the world.

01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:50.720
In all context as adults.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.770
To illustrate this,

01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:53.750
I'm going to ask you a question,

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:55.260
when you were a child,

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.033
let's say 10 years old,

01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:01.370
would you have considered
yourself competitive?

01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:02.850
Would you have considered yourself

01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:04.250
somebody who's cooperative?

01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:05.083
And realize of course

01:35:05.083 --> 01:35:07.010
that those are not mutually exclusive,

01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:09.010
you could be competitive and cooperative.

01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:10.650
Would you consider yourself somebody

01:35:10.650 --> 01:35:12.620
that preferred to play alone

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:15.680
or preferred to play with
one or two close friends?

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.230
Or were you somebody that
really enjoyed playing

01:35:18.230 --> 01:35:19.471
in large groups?

01:35:19.471 --> 01:35:21.600
Here's a key one.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.150
Were you somebody that enjoyed

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:26.090
playing the leader in one moment

01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:28.360
and was equally okay

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.010
with being a follower at a later moment?

01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:33.370
Were you okay with
having your role switched

01:35:33.370 --> 01:35:35.210
midway through a game?

01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:38.570
Were you get up upset or be delighted

01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:41.200
or not care at all about
having to switch teams

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.033
during the middle of game

01:35:42.033 --> 01:35:44.390
because your team was winning right?

01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:45.610
To even things out,

01:35:45.610 --> 01:35:48.750
you can imagine how that
would play out internally.

01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:50.070
You would immediately register

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:51.430
that you must be a valuable player

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:53.120
because you're being
moved off the winning team

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.652
toward the losing team.

01:35:54.652 --> 01:35:56.070
But then again,

01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:59.210
you're now being forced
to join the losing team.

01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:00.883
How did you feel about that?

01:36:00.883 --> 01:36:03.010
Were you somebody that was comfortable

01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:04.460
with other people breaking rules

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.000
or perhaps even yourself breaking rules

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.140
or bending rules,

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.700
kind of be able to find term,

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.540
or were you somebody that

01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.080
really needed to know all the rules?

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.440
And if everyone didn't
rigidly adhere to those rules

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.593
was quite disturbed by that?

01:36:20.452 --> 01:36:22.770
The number of questions
goes on and on and on.

01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:24.370
And I will provide a link to a paper

01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:26.610
that asks a number of questions

01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:29.920
that helps you arrive at
a sort of score of sorts

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:33.620
or an index of what Güneş
and others have referred

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.670
to as personal play identity.

01:36:35.670 --> 01:36:36.710
The point is that

01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:39.510
if we look back to our early adolescence,

01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:42.530
somewhere between 10 and 14 years old,

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.200
a peak time for social development,

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.210
a peak time for play of various kinds,

01:36:48.210 --> 01:36:50.342
a peak time for motor development,

01:36:50.342 --> 01:36:54.100
a peak time of psychosocial development,

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.350
where we learn where we
fit into hierarchies.

01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:58.790
As we relate to members of the same sex

01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:00.343
of the opposite sex, et cetera,

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.770
we can start to get a portal into

01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:06.767
how and why we show up to
various activities in work

01:37:06.767 --> 01:37:09.960
and relationship, et cetera, as adults.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.500
In fact,

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:14.030
I'll venture to say that
if we go into that process

01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:15.890
for ourselves for five or 10 minutes,

01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:18.090
you start to see some remarkable parallels

01:37:18.090 --> 01:37:20.440
between the way you were at that stage

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.120
and your tendencies and
your preferences as adults.

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.870
We tend to look at our
early childhood experiences

01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:28.220
and our families,

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.470
and to some degree our friends

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:32.883
in terms of how we become who we become.

01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:36.840
I've talked about the
incredible work of Allan Schore

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.800
on previous episodes of the podcast.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.260
Allan Schore is a psychiatrist

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.140
and has done extensive work

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:46.052
on how parent child
interactions in particular baby

01:37:46.052 --> 01:37:47.250
and mother,

01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:49.480
but also baby and father

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.980
shaped the brain

01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:53.430
and the brain and
emotional system's ability

01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:55.593
to go from states of
elation and excitement,

01:37:55.593 --> 01:37:59.750
the so-called dopamine
epinephrine type circuitry

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:04.050
to the more warm soothing
types of calm interactions

01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:06.050
that in broad terms could be described

01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:09.203
as more serotonin oxytocin
and things of that sort.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.670
That work really points to the key roles

01:38:12.670 --> 01:38:14.032
that the caregiver

01:38:14.032 --> 01:38:16.490
and the child you

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.340
engaged in an early life.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.558
And that is incredible work.

01:38:19.558 --> 01:38:23.170
I do hope to host Dr.
Schore on the podcast

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:26.020
at some point in the
not too distant future,

01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:28.170
but equally important of course,

01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:30.060
are the interactions that we export

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:33.990
from that early laying down
of biological circuitry

01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:35.518
and psychological circuitry,

01:38:35.518 --> 01:38:38.360
to the way we play by ourselves

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.262
and the way we play with others

01:38:40.262 --> 01:38:42.831
in small numbers or in great numbers.

01:38:42.831 --> 01:38:45.730
And of course it would be the case

01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:48.600
that how we played as a 10 or 12 year old

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.090
would impact how we
behave as a 16 year old

01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:53.270
and as a 20 year old and as a 30 year old

01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:55.181
and so on and so on.

01:38:55.181 --> 01:38:58.260
One of my favorite things
about developmental biology

01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.518
and developmental psychology

01:38:59.518 --> 01:39:01.123
is that it is grounded in the fact

01:39:01.123 --> 01:39:04.410
that we don't just have a
childhood and an adulthood.

01:39:04.410 --> 01:39:07.110
There isn't just our child
self and our adult self.

01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:09.130
And even though there
are transitions around

01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:11.300
the mechanisms that
underline neuroplasticity

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.373
at approximately age 25,

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.129
it is simply the case that development

01:39:17.129 --> 01:39:19.030
is our entire lifespan,

01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:22.590
that our lifespan is one
long developmental arc.

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:25.880
How long depends on our
genetics, our lifestyle

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.730
accidents, injury and disease of course,

01:39:28.730 --> 01:39:31.600
but it is one long developmental arc.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.330
And so it shouldn't surprise us at all

01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:36.140
that how we learn to play as
a 10 year old or 12 year old

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:39.050
would impact how we play
and interact with people

01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:41.130
as a teenager and a young adult

01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:42.872
and on and on and on.

01:39:42.872 --> 01:39:46.840
And that play is the
place in which we explore

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.090
in which we learn

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:49.720
play is the substrate

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.870
by which our nervous system changes us

01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:55.580
from this hyper-connected
batch of neurons,

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.670
where everything is
connected to everything,

01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:58.940
more or less

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:02.600
to a brain and nervous system whereby

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.330
certain circuits work
with immense proficiency

01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:07.820
and others are less accessible to us.

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.653
But again,

01:40:08.653 --> 01:40:11.160
the wonderful thing about
the human nervous system

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.500
is that because it is plastic

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.630
for the entire lifespan

01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:19.330
and because these two
elements of focus and rest

01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:21.990
can be deployed again
and again, and again,

01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:23.990
just because neural circuits didn't form

01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:27.000
does not mean that they
can't form later in life.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.030
And today we've been
focusing on how play itself,

01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:33.380
the same substrate that
we use during development

01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.960
to become who we are,

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.170
is the portal by which

01:40:36.170 --> 01:40:37.540
we can change who we are

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:38.550
for the better.

01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:39.730
So I hope I've convinced you

01:40:39.730 --> 01:40:41.990
that play is an extremely important

01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:44.760
fundamental homeostatically regulated

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.400
aspect of our nervous system,

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.100
which is just a mouthful
of nerd speak to say,

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.580
play can change your brain for the better.

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:55.270
And that is true for every stage of life.

01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:57.090
The recommendation that I make,

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:59.750
and certainly the one that
I'm going to direct it myself

01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:00.950
as well

01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:04.340
is to try and engage in at least one hour

01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.650
of pure play per week.

01:41:06.650 --> 01:41:08.518
Now I came to that recommendation

01:41:08.518 --> 01:41:11.200
because of the literature that says,

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.734
well, you need to engage
something pretty repetitively.

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.610
It should be novel.

01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:16.810
So this wouldn't be something

01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:19.440
that you are exceptionally
good at already.

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.170
If you insist on doing something

01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:23.120
that you're already exceptionally good at,

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.890
then you want to really do some free form,

01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:27.600
low stakes tinkering.

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.500
So make it safe,

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.800
but make it free form.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.810
So really explore things with that.

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:34.520
Some people call this beginner's mind.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.090
Although I find that a little abstract,

01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:37.470
I like the notion of beginner's mind,

01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:38.303
but sort of like,

01:41:38.303 --> 01:41:39.700
how do you know if you're
in beginner's mind?

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.010
I think beginner's mind
is sort of the expectation

01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:43.548
that you're not going to do it well yet,

01:41:43.548 --> 01:41:47.140
but play extends beyond beginner's mind.

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:48.510
Play is really about

01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:50.650
not even worrying if you're
going to get good at it

01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:52.170
or really proficient at it.

01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:54.740
It's really about exploring contingencies

01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:56.270
with truly low stakes.

01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:57.990
That's what will allow you to access

01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:00.050
these neurochemical combinations

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:01.870
of elevated endogenous opioids,

01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:03.200
low epinephrine, et cetera,

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.998
that will open up neuroplasticity.

01:42:04.998 --> 01:42:07.400
For those of you that need
a little more guidance

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.130
on how to play.

01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:10.110
There's a book out there

01:42:10.110 --> 01:42:12.590
actually learned about this
from Tim Ferriss' blog,

01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:15.850
it's called "Play It Away: A
Workaholic's Cure for Anxiety."

01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:17.170
So that's more focused on anxiety.

01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:19.080
The author is Charlie Hoehn,

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:22.470
last name H O E H N

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:24.327
will provide a link for it in
the show notes and caption,

01:42:24.327 --> 01:42:27.670
"Play It Away: A Workaholic's
Cure for Anxiety."

01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:30.960
But books and other resources aside,

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.850
I think one hour of play per week

01:42:32.850 --> 01:42:35.000
is a reasonable amount of time

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.800
to engage in dedicated play behavior.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.790
For the purpose of opening
up these neural circuits

01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:42.179
for plasticity,

01:42:42.179 --> 01:42:43.570
the key feature of course,

01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:47.230
is to not have immense proficiency
in that given activity,

01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:49.090
or at least not the way you perform it.

01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.738
And if you do gain
proficiency in that activity,

01:42:51.738 --> 01:42:53.640
well, then it becomes something else

01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.649
it's no longer about
play it's performance.

01:42:55.649 --> 01:42:57.550
So in that case,

01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:00.740
you would then want to
adopt a new play behavior.

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.350
You'll notice that I largely avoided

01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:05.070
using the word fun
throughout this episode.

01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:06.920
Fun is a somewhat abstract term

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.650
and like many emotions and
many verbal descriptions

01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.500
of experience.

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.930
It falls short in the context of

01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:17.930
a neurobiologic goal
discussion about play.

01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:19.700
If you have fun, terrific.

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.790
Some people might find,

01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:23.780
however that engaging in play
is kind of uncomfortable.

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.910
Well there, your goal then
should be to lower your level

01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:26.940
of discomfort

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.000
by focusing less on the outcomes

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.538
and just simply engaging
in the behavior because,

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:34.080
well, I'm telling you
that it's good for you,

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.530
but hopefully you will tell yourself

01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:36.363
that it's good for you

01:43:36.363 --> 01:43:38.513
and that you will experience
that it's good for you.

01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:41.740
The literature certainly points to that.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:44.570
And the literature certainly
points to the fact that

01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:46.800
play is the way that we are built.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.670
We are built to play.

01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:51.820
We have brain circuits from back to front

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.590
and within our body that are there

01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:55.310
for play and they don't disappear.

01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:57.220
They do not get pruned away

01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.240
as we go from development to adulthood.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.090
So if ever you needed a
neurobiological explanation

01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:04.890
for why play is important
throughout the lifespan,

01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:05.910
it's that.

01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:08.740
It's that biology does
not waste resources.

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.300
It's a extremely efficient.

01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:14.070
And were the circuits for
play not to be important

01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.903
in adulthood.

01:44:14.903 --> 01:44:17.070
They would've been pruned
away, but I guarantee you,

01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:19.770
they are there in your brain
and nervous system now,

01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:20.760
they will be there tomorrow

01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:22.350
and they will be there going forward.

01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:24.380
So my suggestion is that you use them.

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.970
One hour per week.

01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:28.059

the sponsors mentioned

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.150

that's the best way to
support this podcast.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:02.250

If you're not already following
us on Twitter and Instagram,

01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:09.920
we are hubermanlab on Twitter

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.720
and also hubermanlab on Instagram,

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:13.810
on Instagram,

01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:16.780
I do short posts that
are related to topics

01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:19.630
covered on the podcast, but
also some additional topics.

01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:21.880
So these would include science based tools

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.410
for things like focus for sleep,

01:45:23.410 --> 01:45:25.890
for learning and many
other topics as well.

01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:28.070
In previous episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:29.978
we often refer to supplements.

01:45:29.978 --> 01:45:33.560
Now supplements aren't necessary
or correct for everybody,

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.130
but many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

01:45:36.130 --> 01:45:39.080
for things like sleep and focus and so on.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.140
We've partnered with
Thorne that's T H O R N E

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:44.940
because Thorn supplements are
of the very highest quality

01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.600
in terms of the ingredients they use.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.361
And the specificity of the
amounts of the ingredients

01:45:49.361 --> 01:45:51.070
that are listed on the bottle

01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:53.410
are actually what is in those bottle,

01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:56.260
which is not the case for many
supplement brands out there.

01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.710
If you're interested in
seeing the supplements

01:45:57.710 --> 01:46:02.040
that I take, you can go
to thorne.com/u/huberman

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:07.040
So that's thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.710
And those supplements you
can purchase at 20% off.

01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:13.090
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site,

01:46:13.090 --> 01:46:14.950
through that URL portal,

01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:17.640
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.630
that Thorne makes.

01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:19.490
Thank you once again,

01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:21.160
for joining me for this discussion

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.730
about the incredible
biology and psychology

01:46:23.730 --> 01:46:26.670
and power of this thing that we call play

01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:28.900
and last but certainly not least

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.659
thank you for your interest in science.

01:46:30.659 --> 01:46:33.242
