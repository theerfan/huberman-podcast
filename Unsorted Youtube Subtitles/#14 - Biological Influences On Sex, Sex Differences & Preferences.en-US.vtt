- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.350
to The Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.383
for everyday life.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.840
- I'm Andrew Huberman

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.910
and I'm a professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.010
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.430
This podcast is separate from

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.740
my teaching and research
roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.880
It is however part of
my desire and effort,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.150
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.030
about science and science related tools.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.240
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.330
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.010
Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.650
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.450
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.130
to help you better understand your body

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.300
and help you reach your health goals.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.920
I'm a big believer in
blood tests and DNA tests

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.330
for the simple reason

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.510
that many of the factors
that are important for

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.900
your short-term and long-term
health and overall wellbeing

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.930
can only be analyzed
from blood and DNA tests.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.730
Things like metabolic
factors and hormone levels,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.960
really can only be assessed
accurately from blood and DNA.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.590
The thing I like about Inside Tracker is

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.380
you don't just get back
levels of different hormones

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.730
and metabolic factors and so forth,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.960
you also get directives.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.270
It has a dashboard that's very easy to use

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.470
that tells you based on your data,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.120
what sorts of foods you might want to eat

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.640
more of or less of.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.810
What forms of exercise

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.710
you might want to do more of or less of.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.720
It's really a wonderful way to assess

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.030
how your behaviors and lifestyle choices

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.100
are interacting with what's going on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.170
deep within your biology.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.720
Inside Tracker makes all of
that super easy to understand.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.010
It's also really easy to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.180
get the blood tests and DNA tests taken.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.490
You can go to a local location or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.260
they can send somebody to
your home if you prefer that.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.410

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.950
Today's episode is also
brought to you by Helix Sleep.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.180
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.700
that are designed to
meet your sleep needs,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.850
in order to optimize your sleep.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.870
I've done several episodes of this podcast

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.890
and there's a ton of information out there

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.850
pointing to the fact that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.140
getting really deep
restful sleep each night

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.680
is vital for mental and physical health.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.107
And the mattress that you sleep on

00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:25.500
and the pillow that you
use is very important

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.340
for getting optimal sleep.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.730
Helix Sleep has a brief two
minute quiz that you can take.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.840
It asks you questions like,
"Do you sleep on your side,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.710
or your back or your stomach
or maybe you don't know?

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.300
Do you tend to run hot
or cold as you sleep

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.010
or maybe you don't know?"

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.330
That two minute quiz matches you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.020
to a mattress and pillow

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.300
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.430
I took this quiz,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.460
I matched to the mattress
they call "The Dusk," D-U-S-K.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.160
And I've been sleeping
on "The Dusk" mattress

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.040
for many months now

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.530
and I've been sleeping better
than I ever have before.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.740
It's really wonderful

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.340
to have a really good night's
sleep on a consistent basis.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.940
It's a total game changer.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.810
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.990
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.570
Take their two minutes sleep quiz

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.920
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.900
And you'll get up to $200 off

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.610
any of their mattress
orders and two free pillows.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.780
So that's helixsleep.com/huberman.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.260
Take the two minutes sleep quiz

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.830
they'll match you to a mattress.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.090
And if you order one of their mattresses,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.920
you'll get up to $200 off

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.600
any of their mattresses
and two free pillows.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.840
They have a 10 year warranty

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.490
and you get to try out the mattress

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.300
for 100 nights risk-free

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.133
and if you don't like it

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:32.710
they'll pick it up and take it away.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.570
If you love it, then you keep it.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.180
And I think there's a very good chance

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.013
that you're going to love it,

00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:38.350
I certainly loved mine.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.360
And today's episode

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.950
is also brought to you by Athletic Greens.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.820
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.470
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.940
I started using Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.730
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.160
I started using Athletic
Greens because I found it

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.650
rather confusing to figure out

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.407
what vitamins and minerals to take.

00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:00.870
And in Athletic Greens,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.240
I get all the vitamins and minerals

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.110
I need to cover my bases.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.640
As well probiotics are really important.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.710
Probiotics have been shown
now in numerous studies

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.060
to be important for the gut microbiome,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.050
which impacts the gut brain axis,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.090
as well as various
aspects of bodily health.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.510
So in Athletic Greens

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.880
I get vitamins, minerals and probiotics.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.870
I also really like the way it tastes.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.150
It's a greens drink,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.440
so you mix it with some water.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.540
You could mix it with something else

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.410
like juice if you like.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.390
I mix mine with water and lemon juice

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.420
and I drink it once or twice a day.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.670
If you want to try Athletic
Greens you can go to

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.080
athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.270
And if you do that,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.120
you'll claim their special offer,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.750
which is to get a years
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.290
There's now also a wealth of data

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.330
showing that Vitamin D3 is important

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.490
for various aspects of
brain and body health.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.780
So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.520
for Athletic Greens and a
years supply of Vitamin D3 K2.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.210
You'll also get five free travel packets.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.810
The travel packets are just
a really convenient way

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.520
to take Athletic Greens
when you're on the road,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.370
in the car or on a plane
or just moving around.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.060
You just empty one of the packets

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.760
into a water bottle or a glass

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.060
and mix it up really quickly.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.880
It saves any kind of mess
or anything of that sort.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.130
So once again athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.770
to get Vitamin D3 K2.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.800
That's a year supply and
the five free travel packs.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.680
It's a new month,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.480
which means it's a new topic

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.010
here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.170
For the next four or so episodes,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.060
we're going to be talking all about

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.420
hormone affects on the brain and body.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.090
So that's a huge number
of different topics.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.080
We're going to talk about sex.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.300
We're going to talk about reproduction.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.940
We're going to talk about
puberty a little bit more.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.040
We talked about that
in a previous episode.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.700
We're going to talk about menopause.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.550
We're going to talk about birth control.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.880
We are going to talk about

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.540
aggression, competition, winning, losing.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.960
Basically, we're going to
cover as much about hormones

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.010
as we possibly can in this month

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.200
and in doing so

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.180
we are going to go deep
into tools and protocols.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.450
We are also going to talk about a lot of

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.800
tools that relate to things

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.530
that you might not want to do in order to

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.870
optimize hormone health,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.760
regardless of stage of life
or your goals et cetera.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.160
So it's sure to be a month
rich with discussion,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.790
rich with tools and you're
going to learn a lot of

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.330
neuroscience and endocrinology.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.770
There's actually a field
of neuro-endocrinology.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.560
It's actually where I
started my graduate work.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.010
I did a masters in it.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.960
Which has only to say
that I love the topic.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.590
I have a lot of friends
that work on this topic,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.760
many of whom I've consulted
for these episodes.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.440
And I'm really excited to
share the information with you.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.607
Before we dive into today's episode,

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:45.670
"All About Emotions and Sex."

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.290
I want to just to have a few announcements

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.750
that are designed to point
you to some useful resources.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.870
Last episode, "Talking
About The Science of

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.680
Emotions and Relationships."

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.830
I mentioned the Mood Meter app.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.813
The Mood Meter App was developed by

00:06:59.813 --> 00:07:02.500
people out at Yale University who study

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.460
the biology and psychology of emotions.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.130
It's a really wonderful app.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.735
However, many of you quickly told me

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:12.950
that the Mood Meter App
isn't available in your area.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.120
You went to the link we posted

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.150
and it just was saying not
available in your area.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.970
The situation was actually
a lot worse than that.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.290
The situation was that,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.850
when we recorded the episode

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.110
the Mood Meter App was working.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.320
I know 'cause I downloaded a
fresh copy of it to my phone.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.360
And then in the ensuing weekend,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.270
they took the Mood Meter
App down for some repairs.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.159
The Mood Meter app is now up.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.650
It is available.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.177
I want to be really clear.

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:37.810
It's not an app I'm affiliated with.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.030
I'm just mentioning it to you.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.863
They don't know me.

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:41.540
I know them, but they don't know me.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.910
So we don't have any kind
of business relationship.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.270
They do charge 99 cents for the app.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.800
I think the free version has disappeared

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.220
in the last year or so.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.400
So that's Mood Meter app.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.090
We'll provide the link again

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.670
and the link should be working.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.460
Hopefully they won't take it down again,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.770
in between this announcement

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.640
and the release of this episode.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.140
Also just want to take
a step back for a moment

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.530
and talk a little bit about the logic

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.300
of how to make the most of the information

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.410
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.440
I tend to throw out a lot of information

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.690
about a given topic.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.460
Many of you have pointed out however,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.730
that I don't cover certain things.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.120
And once again I'll just say

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.470
the goal is always to be accurate,

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.160
but there's no way I can be exhaustive.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.530
There's no way I can cover everything

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.730
for a particular topic.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.640
The good news is we have time.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.470
My goal, at least in the first year

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.180
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.520
is to give you a basis,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.300
a foundation in these different topics

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.300
of neuro-plasticity, focus,
sleep, hormones et cetera.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.560
And of course, to provide
tools along the way.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.880
We are going to host guests,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.970
I've actually started recording

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.660
with some of these guests already.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.340
And even those episodes will include

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.960
a little what we call primer.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.345
A little description of

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:54.260
the basics of a given topic

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.850
so that you can get more
information from those topics.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.050
My goal really is to
educate you in these topics,

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.840
give you a foundation in these topics

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.560
and allow you to start exploring them

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.290
here in the episodes
with our future guests,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.410
but also in other podcasts and books

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.230
and other sources of information.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.477
So for those of you that are saying,

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:13.666
"It's too much information."

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:16.910
I just encourage you
to remind yourself that

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.730
you have a pause button
you can return to it.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.970
Everything's timestamped.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.803
For those of you that feel,

00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:23.230
it's not enough information
I'm not covering enough.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.480
Just know that this is just the beginning.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.480
We didn't intend to do
this for a very long time

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.170
and we will be thorough over time.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.750
So thanks for your patience

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.270
and please be patient with yourselves.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.500
There's no reason why you have to digest

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.634
all the information in one swoop.

00:09:37.634 --> 00:09:40.070
The other thing is that
I've been told both that

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.350
I speak too fast and speak too slow.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.470
So there's a wonderful solution to this.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.980
If I speak too fast or too slow

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.200
you can adjust the speed in YouTube.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.500
If you're listening in a different format,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.960
I think you also can adjust
the speed of playback.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.130
So that's something that

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.440
wouldn't be possible in the classroom,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.950
but you may find useful.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.010
And then last but not least,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.050
I want to point people again to this NSDR,

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.740
non-sleep deep rest protocol,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.200
that the folks over at Madefor

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.180
have put out as a free resource.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.220
It does, as many of you pointed out,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.620
bear resemblance to things like

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.540
yoga nidra and other forms of meditation.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.540
But what we've done is we've stripped out

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.090
intentions or any kind of
the verbiage related to

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.570
what some people might perceive as

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.181
kind of related to the yoga community or

00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:29.870
specific to kind of new
age-y type techniques.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.410
Not because we don't like yoga nidra.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.490
In fact, I've done yoga nidra
daily for almost the last

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.700
goodness, eight years of my life.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.000
I love yoga nidra,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.640
but sometimes the complicated language

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.830
can be a separator and
can discourage people

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.490
from taking on these protocols
that are extremely useful.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.670
So NSDR is intentionally generic.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.450
It's designed to bring you into a state of

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.590
deep relaxation through a combination of

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.190
breathing and body scan.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.840
There's the you too script over at Madefor

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.850
which is linked in the caption.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.370
And many people find that they prefer that

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.180
to scripts like yoga nidra.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.920
Scripts where they're doing intentions

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.310
and they're hearing a lot of

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.240
kind of unusual language
around the process.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.980
This is just very basic and

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.813
I hope you'll enjoy it.

00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:17.110
And if you prefer the more
typical yoga nidra scripts

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.100
then go with those.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.260
There are many of them available

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.370
on the internet and elsewhere.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.950
And last but not least I
want to point out that,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.900
all our episodes now are subtitled

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.860
both in English and in Spanish.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.070
So for those of you that prefer

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.660
to digest this information in Spanish,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.340
that's now available to
you in the subtitles.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.650
Today we're going to talk about

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.460
The Science of Sex.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.560
In particular, sexual differentiation.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.530
Now that's a complicated topic because

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.850
sex is both a adjective,
a noun and a verb,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.990
depending on the context.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.410
Today we're going to talk about

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.540
the hormonal effects

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.850
and the neural effects

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.360
of particular events that
happen during development

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.760
and how those guide
adolescent and adult behavior,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.730
including sexual preference.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.680
It's an area that's
fascinating and for which,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.930
there are actually very
solid textbook findings.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.910
So textbook findings means,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.310
that there are many studies

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.530
that have been aggregated over decades.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.240
That point to what we now know to be

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.430
absolute truths in terms of

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.740
how hormones affect brain development,

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.090
how the brain impacts hormonal development

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.793
and how those interact to
control behavior for instance.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.220
We are also going to
talk about reproduction,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.540
the verb sex.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.930
And of course, sex the verb,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.620
can also be carried out
independent of reproduction.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.200
It's not always,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.420
in particular in humans,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.230
just to produce offspring.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.070
So that's going to be
covered in the next episode,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.420
but you absolutely need to understand

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.030
the information in this episode,

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.000
in order to make sense of the information

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.470
in the next episode.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.670
So, today we're going to explore hormones.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.080
What they are, how they work,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.470
what leads to masculinization
or feminization

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.200
of the brain and body?

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.170
I'll just throw out one
really interesting fact

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.760
that perhaps most of
you didn't realize that

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.990
hormones have direct effects on the body.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.450
Most people know that because there are

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.490
hormone differences and
sex differences in bodies

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.940
in terms of genitalia and body hair,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.330
distribution of body hair et cetera.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.190
But there are also effects of
hormones on the brain directly

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.110
and believe it or not
there're also effects

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.750
on the spinal cord.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.620
On the neurons and structures
within the spinal cord

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.960
that impact in a very direct way,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.670
what sorts of behaviors are possible.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.180
So it's a fascinating area,

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.640
you might notice I'm going to go

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.800
a little bit more slowly
through this topic

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.760
than I normally do.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.730
I want to be extremely
careful with my language.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.540
Some of these topics,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.980
some of you may be thinking
are extremely sensitive, right?

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.900
And of course,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.000
any discussion about sex and reproduction

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.230
is a sensitive one.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.370
But today we're just
talking about the biology.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.280
We're not getting into
the cultural constraints

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.120
or the cultural dialogue.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.430
What we're trying to do
today is really get to

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.520
the biology, the physiology,
the endocrinology

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.060
and the behavior.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.609
So let's start by talking about

00:14:12.609 --> 00:14:15.320
what hormones are just to remind you

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.070
and what they do.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.170
Hormones by definition,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.030
are a substance, a chemical that's

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.820
released in one area of the body.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.040
Typically from something we call a gland,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.500
although they can also
be released from neurons.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.910
But they're released often from glands,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.180
that travel and have
effects both on that gland

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.500
but also on other organs
and tissues in the body.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.180
And that differentiates hormones

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.930
from things like neurotransmitters,

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.210
which tend to act more locally.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.400
So that's important.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.800
A hormone is a substance secreted

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.550
at one location in the body, travels,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.670
and has impact on things
elsewhere in the body.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.070
Examples of tissues that
produce hormones would be

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.740
the thyroid, the testes,
the ovaries et cetera.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.810
And then of course there
are areas of the brain

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.940
like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.660
which are closely related to one another

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.700
and release hormones
that cause the release

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.370
of yet other hormones out in the body.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.370
So we're going to cover all this.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.400
If you don't know anything
about endocrinology,

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.760
you're still going to be able to

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.700
understand today's discussion.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.840
And we're going to start
with a discussion about,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.000
what hormones actually do,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.820
to create this thing that we call

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.290
masculinization or feminization.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.250
So let's start with development.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.530
Sperm meets egg.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.750
Everything that happens before that

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.130
is a topic of the next episode.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.600
But, sperm meets egg.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.430
This is mammalian reproduction.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.080
And that egg starts to duplicate,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.770
it starts to make more of itself.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.870
It makes more cells.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.700
And eventually some of
those cells become skin.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.250
Some of those cells become brain.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.660
Some of those cells become muscle.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.610
Some of those cells become fingers.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.713
All the stuff that makes
up the brain and body plan.

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:56.300
In addition, there are hormones

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.540
that come both from the mother

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.957
and from the developing baby,

00:16:00.957 --> 00:16:02.400
the developing fetus.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.170
That impact. whether or
not the brain will be

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.820
what they call organized
masculine or organized feminine.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.510
And as I say this,

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.210
I want you to try and discard

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.950
with the cultural connotations

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.760
or your psychological connotations,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.800
of what masculinization
and feminization are.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.160
Because we're only
centering on the biology.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.160
So typically, people have
either two X chromosomes,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.250
and the traditional language around that

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.030
is that person is female, right?

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.660
Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.940
and that person will become male.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.640
Now it's not always the case.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.350
There are cases where it's XXY,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.080
where there two X chromosomes
plus a Y chromosome.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.620
There are also cases where it's XYY.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.230
Where they're two Y chromosomes.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.560
and these have important biological

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.313
and psychological impacts.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.410
So the first thing we
need to establish is that

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.170
there is something called chromosomal sex.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.840
Whether or not they're two X chromosomes,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.680
or an X and Y chromosome,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.880
is what we call chromosomal sex.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.140
But the next stage of
separating out the sexes,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.260
is what we call gonadal sex.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.370
Typically not always, but typically

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.690
if somebody has testes for their gonads,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.080
we think of them as male.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.960
And if somebody has ovaries,
we think of them as female.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.340
Although that's not
always the case either.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.290
But let's just explore

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.040
the transition from
chromosomal sex to gonadal sex,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.840
because it's a fascinating one

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.160
that we all went through
in some form or another.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.540
So this XY that we typically think of as

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.023
promoting masculinization of the fetus.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.160
We say that because on the
Y chromosome there are genes

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.410
and those genes have particular
functions that suppress

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.290
female reproductive organs.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.420
So on the Y chromosome there's a gene,

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.450
which encodes for something called

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.700
Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.960
So there's actually a hormone

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.230
that's programmed by the Y chromosome

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.090
that inhibits the formation
of Mullerian Ducts,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.000
which are an important part of the female

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.503
reproductive apparatus.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.240
That's critical because,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.070
already we're seeing
the transition between

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.190
chromosome Y chromosome and gonad.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.782
And other genes on the Y chromosome

00:18:25.782 --> 00:18:28.440
promote the formation of testes.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.490
So there are genes like the SRY gene

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.040
and other genes that promote
the formation of testes,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.150
while they also inhibit the formation

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.410
of the Mullerian Ducts.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.010
So the transition from
chromosomal sex to gonadal sex

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.360
is a very important distinction.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.970
It's kind of a fork in the road

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.850
that happens very early in development

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.500
while fetuses are still in the embryo.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.610
Now what's interesting as well,

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.470
is that just because
there's a Y chromosome

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.530
that can suppress Mullerian Duct formation

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.760
and there are other genes
on the Y chromosome that

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.130
promote testes development.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.400
The placenta itself is an endocrine organ.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.520
I think most people don't know this

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.530
but the placenta is an
endocrine organ as well.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.250
The mother, which of course
is carrying the fetus

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.680
has an adrenal gland which
can produce testosterone.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.200
There are instances for example,

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.450
where a mother has either a tumor

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.130
or for some other reason is

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.740
secreting large levels of testosterone

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.630
while carrying a fetus that is XX.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.110
And that leads to what

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.690
we would call masculinization

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.090
of certain aspects of the fetus.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.810
Typically, that will be enlarged clitoris.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.280
There also some examples

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.180
of other phenotypes on
the body that are created

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.130
even though it's a purely
XX chromosomal baby.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.120
So we have to distinguish between

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.510
chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.560
And then there's what
we call hormonal sex.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.200
Which is the effects of
the steroid hormones,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.980
estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.840
on what we call morphological sex

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.650
or the shape of the baby and the human

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.460
and the genitalia and the jaw

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.510
and all these other things.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.820
And so it actually is quite complicated.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.390
So you know, it's a long distance from

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.020
chromosomes to gender identity

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.350
and gender identity has a lot of

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.590
social influences and roles.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.790
This is an area that
right now is very dynamic

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.990
and in the discussion
out there as you know.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.020
But just getting from chromosomal sex

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.960
to what we would call gonadal sex

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.530
and hormonal sex and morphological sex,

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.810
involves a number of steps.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.050
So today we're going to
talk about those steps.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.130
And there's some fascinating things that

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.530
do indeed relate to tools.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.910
Do indeed relate

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.420
to some important behavioral choices.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.210
Important choices about things
to avoid while pregnant.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.980
And for those of you
that are not pregnant,

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.850
things to avoid if you're thinking about

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.590
eventually having children.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.530
And that is not to drive development

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.810
in one direction or another,

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.270
but there are examples where

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.920
there are some deleterious
things in our environment

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.190
that can actually negatively impact

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.380
what we call sexual development overall,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.490
regardless of chromosomal background.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.160
So let's get started with that.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.240
Let's talk a little bit
more about what hormones do.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.850
Hormones generally have
two categories of effects.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.540
They can either be very fast
or they can be very slow.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.290
There are hormones like
cortisol and adrenaline,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.850
which act very fast.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.580
Adrenaline can increase your heart rate

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.520
very fast when secreted into the body.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.230
Cortisol can be a little bit slower,

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.160
but it also can have
some very fast effects.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.550
And then there are hormones like.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.160
Like testosterone and estrogen,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.103
which we refer to as the
sex steroid hormones.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.320
The sex steroid hormones can have

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.380
quick effects through signaling.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.030
Meaning they can attach to cells

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.020
and make those cells do different things.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.470
They can have a actually quite
quick effects on the brain.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.850
A lot of people don't know this,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.740
but there are some very fast effects of

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.759
estrogen and testosterone as
well as long-term effects.

00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:53.230
These molecules, for those
of you that are interested,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.560
are what it called lipophilic.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.270
Which just means that
they like fatty stuff,

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.180
they can actually pass
through fatty membranes.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.510
And because the outside of cells,

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.590
as well as the what's
called the nuclear envelope.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.424
Where all the DNA contents
and stuff are stuffed inside,

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:08.565
are made of lipid, of fat.

00:22:08.565 --> 00:22:12.120
These steroid hormones can
actually travel into cells

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.750
and then get into the DNA.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.930
Basically interact with the DNA of cells

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.590
in order to control gene expression.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.010
So they can change

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.500
the sorts of things that cells will become

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.440
and they can change the
way that cells function

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.650
in a long-term way.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.430
And that's actually how

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.937
the presence of these genes like SRY

00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:31.690
and Mullerian inhibiting hormone,

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.840
lead to reductions or
elimination I should say,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.460
of things like the Mullerian Ducts

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.430
and promote instead what's called in males

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.220
the Wolffian Ducts.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.590
Or promote the development of
testes rather than ovaries.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.100
So all you need to know is that

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.477
hormones have short-term
and long-term effects.

00:22:48.477 --> 00:22:50.590
And the long-term effects are actually

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.910
related to their effects on genes

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.746
and how those genes are
expressed or repressed,

00:22:55.746 --> 00:22:58.570
in order to prevent them from having

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.310
particular proteins made.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.320
So these hormones,

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.310
these steroid hormones
are exceedingly powerful.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.420
And if we're going to
have a discussion about

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.000
masculinization or feminization et cetera,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.610
you also need to think
about the counterpart.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.520
It's not just about masculinizing the body

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.060
or feminizing the body and brain,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.320
it's also about demasculinize
the brain in many cases,

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.365
as a normal biological function

00:23:21.365 --> 00:23:25.050
of typically of XX females.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.440
And de feminization,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.900
the suppression of certain
pathways that are related

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.370
to feminization of the body and brain.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.550
But there are some really
fascinating twists in this story.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.800
So I've just thrown a lot
of biology at you, but

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.139
this is where it all starts
to get incredibly surprising.

00:23:43.139 --> 00:23:47.200
You would think that it's
straightforward, right?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.310
You have a Y chromosome

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.430
you suppress the female
reproductive pathway

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.700
like the Mullerian Ducts.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.600
You promote the development of testes

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.480
and then testes make testosterone.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.377
And then it organizes the brain male

00:24:02.377 --> 00:24:04.240
and it wants to do male like things.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.557
And then in females you get estrogen

00:24:06.557 --> 00:24:09.030
and it wants to do female like things.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.270
And air quotes here for all of this.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.490
It turns out that isn't
how it works at all.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.500
Here's where it's interesting.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.930
We have to understand

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.680
that there are effects of these hormones,

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.690
testosterone and estrogen.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.740
on what are called primary
sexual characteristics.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.540
Which are the ones that you're born with.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.540
Secondary sexual characteristics,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.270
which are the ones that
show up in puberty.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.080
And these are happening in the brain

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.920
and body and spinal cord.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.540
And so I'm going to
disentangle all this for you

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.790
by giving you some examples.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.450
First, let's talk about the development of

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.150
primary sexual characteristics.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.280
The ones that show up at birth.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.700
And one of the more
dramatic examples of this

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.190
comes from the role of testosterone

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.310
in creating the external genitalia.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.430
Now you might think it's
just straight forward.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.050
If there's a testes, 'cause
there's a Y chromosome.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.620
You know, you've got a gene that codes for

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.680
the development of testes,
you get testosterone

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.140
and the penis grows

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.530
and the baby is born with a penis.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.580
You know, one of the
first things that happens

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.670
when the baby comes out

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.737
is they look at the genitalia,

00:25:12.737 --> 00:25:15.020
and they try and make an
assessment on whether or not

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.589
it's a quote boy or it's
a quote girl, right?

00:25:17.589 --> 00:25:20.077
That's been done for a very very long time

00:25:20.077 --> 00:25:22.133
throughout human history.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.380
It turns out that it's not
testosterone that's responsible

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.650
for the development of the penis

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.753
in a baby that has an X
chromosome and a Y chromosome.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.620
It's a different androgen.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.750
Androgen is just a category of hormones

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.990
that includes testosterone,

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:47.410
but testosterone is converted in the fetus

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.940
to something called dihydrotestosterone.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.380
And that's accomplished through

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.960
an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.920
Now dihydrotestosterone
has important effects

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.250
later in life too.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.210
We will talk about those.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.880
In fact, if you just want to know,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.170
dihydrotestosterone is what we would call

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.630
the dominant androgen in males.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.160
It's responsible for aggression.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.020
It's responsible for a
lot of muscular strength.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.480
It's involved in beard growth
and male pattern baldness.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.870
We're going to talk about all of that.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.410
But dihydrotestosterone
has powerful effects

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.380
in determining the genitalia,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.520
while the baby is still in the embryo.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.370
So this ends.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.693
There's testosterone that's made.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.130
And that testosterone gets converted

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.660
by this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.970
in a little structure called the tubercle.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.970
That tubercle will
eventually become the penis.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.710
So you say, "Okay, straight forward."

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.750
This testosterone is converted
to dihydrotestosterone.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.990
And then if there's dihydrotestosterone

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.640
it controls penis growth.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.620
And indeed that's the case.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.160
So that's a primary sexual characteristic.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.160
That baby will then grow
up and later during puberty

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.080
there will be the release of a molecule.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.600
I talked about this last
episode called Kisspeptin.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.180
K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.303
which will cause the release
of some other hormones

00:27:06.303 --> 00:27:08.050
Connatural releasing
hormone, Luteinizing hormone

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.100
will stimulate the testes
to make testosterone.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.320
So in puberty, testosterone
leads to further

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.210
growth and development of the penis,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.362
as well as the accumulation
of or growth of pubic hair,

00:27:19.362 --> 00:27:20.960
a deepening of the voice,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.320
all the secondary sexual
characteristics, okay?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.450
So dihydrotestosterone
creates what we would call

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.493
the typical masculine phenotype for

00:27:31.493 --> 00:27:36.200
primary sexual
characteristics and produces.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.970
Testosterone excuse me, produces

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.433
secondary sexual
characteristics during puberty.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.700
There's a very interesting phenomenon

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.840
that was published in The
Journal of Science in the 1970s,

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.210
for which now there's a
wealth of scientific data.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.090
And this relates to a genetic mutation,

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.960
where 5-alpha-reductase
the enzyme that converts

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.620
testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.200
It's mutated in a way into a
genome that it doesn't exist.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.440
And this actually was first identified

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.960
in the Dominican Republic.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.020
It has shown up elsewhere.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.493
It's quite rare, but where
it shows up it's robust.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.330
What happens is baby is born.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.110
Typically when a baby is born

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.650
they don't measure chromosomes.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.000
They don't look at
chromosomal sex XX or XY.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.270
That's not typically done nowadays.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.490
Baby is born.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:27.970
If you were to look at that baby,

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.120
it would look female.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.340
There would be very little
or no external penis.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.810
And so people would say, "It's a girl."

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.643
And they might, you know,

00:28:36.643 --> 00:28:38.210
have the celebration it's a girl.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.810
And I guess now they call
them "Gender Reveal Parties"

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.643
or something like that.

00:28:41.643 --> 00:28:44.480
I don't know about this, but anyway.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.730
They would reveal.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.730
The baby would reveal
its external genitalia

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.230
simply by being there and
being naked when it's born.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.670
It has nothing to do with gender,

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.840
it has to do with genitalia and sex.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.610
That baby would be born.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.800
And what was observed is that,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.950
from time to time,

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.060
that baby after being raised as a girl,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.120
perfectly happy as a girl

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.830
would around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.580
would suddenly start to sprout a penis.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.730
There's actually a name for this,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.280
it's called Guevedoces.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.090
Which the translation is
more or less, penis at 12.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.680
And as strange as this might sound,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.580
it makes sense if you understand
the underlying mutation.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.680
What happens in these
children, these Guevedoces,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.510
is that the child is born.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.510
It has testes which are not descended,

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.140
so up in the body.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.140
They're not making a lot
of testosterone early on.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.350
They weren't able to

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.740
convert testosterone
to dihydrotestosterone

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.527
because they lack this
enzyme 5-alpha-reductase.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.670
As a consequence,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.470
the primary sexual characteristic

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.750
of external male genitalia, penis,

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.520
doesn't develop.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.210
And then what happens is

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.250
the baby grows up as a
young child essentially

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.810
is treated as a girl.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.900
Generally they report being
pretty comfortable as girls,

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.350
although not always.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.750
And then testosterone
starts getting secreted

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.480
from the testes 'cause
kisspeptin in the brain

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.810
signals through gonadotropin
and luteinizing hormone

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.060
and travels down to the testes,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.170
the testes start churning out testosterone

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.580
and there's a secondary
growth of the penis.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.820
And all of a sudden there's a penis.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.670
And this leads to some
very complicated situations

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.192
in families and culturally.

00:30:30.192 --> 00:30:34.010
And actually the outcomes
in terms of whether or not

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.720
these children decide to self
identify as males or females

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.800
and how people treat them

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.600
actually varies quite a lot.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.237
There's actually been kind of an

00:30:42.237 --> 00:30:46.032
adopting of a third
category of sex and gender

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:47.745
in these Guevedoces for

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:52.210
in order to just offer
them the opportunity to

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.410
explore not just what
would be a typical kind of

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.380
girl or woman or boy or man phenotype,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.520
but something in between.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.710
Something that some people
call intersex although

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.740
intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.860
is actually a separate thing altogether.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.340
So it's fascinating and the point here

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.990
is that dihydrotestosterone
not testosterone

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.930
is responsible for this
primary growth of the penis.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.442
And that testosterone later is involved in

00:31:19.442 --> 00:31:21.460
the secondary sexual characteristics

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.970
deepening in the voice, et cetera.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.200
Now this is where the information

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.210
gets even more interesting

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.960
and applies to essentially everybody.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.790
You might think

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:37.440
that testosterone because
it masculinizes the body

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.373
in the secondary sexual
characteristic way.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.360
And because dihydrotestosterone
another androgen,

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.840
masculinizes the primary
sexual characteristics.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.450
The growth of the penis early on,

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.900
that testosterone must
masculinize the brain.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.340
And there are in fact aspects of

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.070
masculinization of the brain and body,

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.740
that are independent of genitalia.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.970
Now it might be obvious to some of you,

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.910
but some people probably
don't realize that.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.910
Yes indeed the brain has
receptors for testosterone.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.173
It also has receptors for estrogen.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.730
But the fascinating thing is that

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.120
if you look at the brains of

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.670
people that have Y chromosomes
and that have testes

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.210
and that make testosterone,

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.120
and you look at the brains of people

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.800
that don't have Y chromosomes or testes

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.393
and therefore make far less
testosterone in general,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.130
what you realize is that
the cells in the brain

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.060
that differ between what
I'll call males and females,

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.540
but between XY, and XX

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.920
have receptors for testosterone,

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.480
but the masculinization of the brain

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.760
is not accomplished by testosterone.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.593
I want to repeat this.

00:32:55.593 --> 00:32:57.400
The masculinization of the brain

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.820
is not accomplished by testosterone.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.913
It is accomplished by estrogen.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.980
Testosterone can be
converted into estrogen

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.710
by an enzyme called aromatase.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.470
This is vitally important to understand.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.590
Testosterone can be
converted into estrogen

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.560
by something called aromatase.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.910
I'll give an example of where this happens

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.090
later in life,

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.570
to just illustrate the principle

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.220
and really embed it in your mind.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.660
During puberty in boys,
XY chromosome individuals.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.760
It's not uncommon for there to be

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.600
transient or sometimes long
lasting breast bud development.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.870
Testosterone goes up during puberty,

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.280
for the reasons we talked about before.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.090
And some of that testosterone
gets converted into estrogen

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.030
by an enzyme called aromatase.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.310
Aromatase is made by
several sources in the body.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.930
One of the main sources is body fat.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.690
So it can make a lot of aromatase.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.420
Sometimes you'll even see

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.570
fairly dramatic breast development
in males during puberty.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.630
Sometimes it's transient,
sometimes it's not.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.110
The other place where you see this

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.870
is in athletes and bodybuilders

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.960
that take a lot of anabolic steroids.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.290
That take high levels of androgens.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.080
So they'll be taking testosterone

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.823
at super physiological doses.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.060
Sometimes not always.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.860
They will convert some of that
testosterone into estrogen

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.140
and they'll get what's
called gynecomastia.

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.150
Which is the development
of male breast tissue.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.510
Sometimes they'll get
it cut out surgically.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.920
Other times they'll start trying to take

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.470
estrogen blockers in order
to try and suppress it

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:31.230
or they'll try and block prolactin.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.610
It's a topic that we're going
to get into in more detail.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.030
But what's important here
is to understand that

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.110
testosterone can be converted
to estrogen by aromatase.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.600
Aromatase is not just made in body fat.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.930
There are neurons in the
brain that make aromatase

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.340
and convert testosterone into estrogen.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.340
And it is testosterone
converted into estrogen.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.213
In other words,

00:34:53.213 --> 00:34:56.333
it's estrogen that
masculinizes XY individual.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.110
That masculinizes the brain.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.590
And this has profound effects
on all sorts of things.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.840
On behavior, on outlook
in the world et cetera.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.220
But I think most people don't realize

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.130
that it's estrogen that
comes from testosterone

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.450
that masculinizes the
male brain, the XY brain.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.300
Not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.380
So I just want to mention some tools.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.587
You might be asking yourself,

00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:24.570
"How could tools possibly come up

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.010
at this stage of the conversation

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.270
where we're talking
about sexual development

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.380
and we're talking about

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.590
the differentiation of
tissues in the body."

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.260
Well, this is true both for children

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.920
and parents and adults.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.240
I want to emphasize that

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.870
there are things that are environmental

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.320
and there are things that people use

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.760
in their homes sometimes
that actually can impact

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.570
hormone levels and can impact

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:52.830
sexual development in
fairly profound ways.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.670
And I want to be very clear,

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.550
this is not me pulling from

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.690
some rare journal have never heard of it.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.930
This is pulling from textbooks.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.440
In particular, today I'm guiding
a lot of the conversation

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.580
on work that on
"Behavioral Endocrinology,"

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.273
is a book by Randy Nelson
and Lance Kriegsfeld.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.100
True experts in the field.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.170
I'm going to talk about some
of the work from Tyrone Hayes

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.270
from UC Berkeley

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.000
about environmental toxins
and their impacts on

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.860
some of these things like
testosterone and estrogen.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.770
I'm going to touch into them.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.370
I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.770
that's grounded in studies,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.610
which we will provide in the caption

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.360
or that I'll reference here.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.800
One of those that's
actually really interesting

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.780
but helps illustrate the principle

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.070
that we've been talking about is.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.180
A few years ago, there
was a lot of excitement

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.000
about Evening Primrose Oil.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.490
Evening Primrose Oil
is in a lot of products

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.810
that typically are associated

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.760
with skin beauty and skin health.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.080
And so I'm generalizing here.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.400
But typically it was mothers
or sisters that were using it.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.200
And there were actually
examples starting to crop up

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.080
of young boys getting

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.490
accelerated breast bud development

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.110
from skin contact with women were using

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.370
Evening Primrose Oil.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.328
So Evening Primrose Oil is

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:12.640
chemically a lot like estrogen

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.890
and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.610
There are a number of
things out there like this.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.880
So believe it or not
things like pine pollen

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.430
look very much like
testosterone structurally.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.800
They are more or less are testosterone.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.580
Their bioavailability in
humans isn't as clear.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.458
Evening Primrose Oil
has a lot of estrogenic

00:37:30.458 --> 00:37:31.940
elements to it.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.600
Just structurally how it's built.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.370
And so there were cases where boys were

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.320
understandably you know,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.390
being hugged by their mom

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.399
or maybe even like showering and taking.

00:37:41.399 --> 00:37:43.780
you know using the Evening
Primrose Oil solution.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.440
Those things will actually
change levels of estrogens

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.820
in boys and girls.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.920
And so this wasn't just
an issue for young boys.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.350
This is also an issue for young girls.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.740
So it's not that Evening
Primrose Oil is bad,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.090
it's just that many of
you have probably heard

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.390
about the dangers of Soy Isoflavones

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.780
and things like that.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.725
The impact of soy on estrogen levels is,

00:38:04.725 --> 00:38:07.420
there are some decent
evidence to support that.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.630
However, there's a lot of other factors

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.530
that are more severe.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.140
And one of those is this
Evening Primrose Oil.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.664
So regardless of age,

00:38:14.664 --> 00:38:16.450
let's just put it this way

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.520
because people might be
wanting to drive their

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.768
hormones more estrogenic
or more androgenic.

00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:24.390
How could I know which
what your preference is?

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.270
I don't know.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.518
But in any case,

00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:30.174
things like pre Evening
Primrose Oil can actually

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:32.277
promote estrogenic pathways in the body

00:38:32.277 --> 00:38:34.210
and some of it can go transdermal.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.720
Likewise, because testosterone
replacement therapy

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.540
is fairly widespread nowadays.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.510
And some people accomplish
that through cream.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.780
It's pretty well understood that,

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.600
if someone's taking that
they want to avoid contact

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.724
with anyone.

00:38:47.724 --> 00:38:52.134
Skin contact with anyone
that is trying to promote

00:38:52.134 --> 00:38:55.493
more estrogenic activity in their body.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.690
And especially in children.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.570
So that's one.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.280
The other is this issue
of environmental factors.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.430
Now this, you know,

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.070
again I'm just going to highlight,

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.760
when one starts talking
about environmental factors

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.260
and how they're poisoning
us or disrupting growth

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.650
or fertility rates

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.930
it can start to sound a little bit crazy.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.720
Except when you start to actually look at

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.120
some of the real data,

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.270
Data from quality research labs funded by

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.600
Federal government funded,

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.810
not from companies or other sources,

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.150
that are really aimed at understanding

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.810
what the underlying biology is.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.023
And for that I really,

00:39:29.023 --> 00:39:33.330
we should all be grateful to
Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.830
I remember way back when
I was a graduate student

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:39.810
in the late nineties,
goodness. at UC Berkeley.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.020
And I remember him, he was studying frogs.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.020
He was talking about developmental
defects in these frogs

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.960
that live in different waters around

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.058
it was California, but also elsewhere.

00:39:50.058 --> 00:39:52.340
And he identified a substance,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.690
which is present in a lot of waterways

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.610
throughout this country
and other countries.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.400
So US and beyond.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.440
Certainly not just
restricted to California,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.840
which is atrazine.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.900
This is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.580
Again, this is the stuff of textbooks.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.290
And it causes severe
testicular malformations.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.440
So again, atrazine exposure is serious.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.833
And what's interesting is
if you look at the data,

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.220
what you find is that

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.610
at sites in Western
and Midwestern sections

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.280
of the United States 10
to 92% of male frogs.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.160
These were frogs mind you,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.170
had testicular abnormalities.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.023
And the most severe
testicular malformations

00:40:32.023 --> 00:40:35.070
were in the testes
rather than in the sperm.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.980
So it's actually the organ
itself, the gonad itself.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.900
Now it's very well known now

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.420
that atrazine is in many herbicides.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.840
And so you know, whereas I would say in

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.720
the 80's and 90's the discussion around

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.350
herbicides and their negative effects

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.535
was considered kind of
like hippy-dippy stuff

00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:55.160
or the stuff you hear about at

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.780
you know, your local community markets

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.560
and these kind of new age communities.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.830
Now there's very solid data,

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.930
from Federally funded
labs at major universities

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.390
that have been peer reviewed and published

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.040
in excellent journals,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.250
showing that indeed
many of these herbicides

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.080
can have negative effects,

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.730
primarily by impacting the
ratios of these hormones

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:22.147
in either the mothers or in the testes,

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.620
altering the testes of the fathers

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.300
or direct effects on
developing young animals

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.133
and potentially humans.

00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:32.190
And so you ask, "Well, what about humans?

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.180
Frogs are wonderful,
but what about humans?"

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.338
So here are the data on what's happening

00:41:38.338 --> 00:41:41.420
and this isn't all
going to be scary stuff.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.670
We're also going to talk about

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.740
tools to ameliorate and
offset some of these effects.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.573
One would be,

00:41:46.573 --> 00:41:47.730
be cautious with Evening Primrose

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.230
as well as testosterone creams,

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.190
depending on whether or
not you want to be more

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.550
androgenic or estrogenic

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.000
depending on your needs.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.110
But across human populations,

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.750
sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.523
So in 1940, the average,

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.860
the average density of human sperm was

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.770
113 million per milliliter of semen.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:09.603
That's how it's measured.

00:42:09.603 --> 00:42:11.910
How many sperm per milliliter of semen.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.419
In 1990 this figure has dropped to 66.

00:42:15.419 --> 00:42:18.510
So it went from 113 million per milliliter

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.580
to 66 million per milliliter

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.690
in the United States and Western Europe.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.170
So this is not just a US thing.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.940
Researchers also estimated that

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.640
the volume of semen produced by men

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.720
has dropped 20% in that time,

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.372
reduced sperm count per
generation even further.

00:42:32.372 --> 00:42:35.960
So between 1981 and 1991,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.730
the ratio of normal spermatogenesis

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.900
has decreased from 56.4% to 26.9%.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.790
So there's a lot that's happening

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.550
primarily because of these herbicides

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.370
that are in widespread use
to reduce sperm counts.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.260
And these are going to
have profound effects

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.340
not just on sperm counts,

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.210
but on development,

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.810
sexual development at the level of

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.210
the gonads and the brain.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.270
Because you need testosterone to get

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:06.010
dihydrotestosterone for
primary sexual characteristics.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.870
You need estrogen that's
come from testosterone

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.050
to masculinize the brain.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.480
And of course,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.550
we're not just focusing
on sperm and testosterone.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.070
You of course also know

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.450
that many of these
herbicides are disrupting

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.780
estrogens in a similar way.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:26.080
Or are leading to hyper
estrogenic, excuse me,

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.769
states which might explain why

00:43:28.769 --> 00:43:31.100
puberty is happening so much earlier

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.470
in young girls these days.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.270
So there are a lot of
things that are happening.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.520
Now does this mean that
you have to run around

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.230
and neurotically avoid
anything that includes

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.560
things like atrazine and
should you be avoiding

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.180
all kinds of herbicides?

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.860
I don't know that's up to you.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.040
But it does seem that these
have pretty marked effects,

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.330
in both the animal studies
and in the human studies.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.460
You know, you can open up a textbook like

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.760
the endocrinology textbook

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.870
and find things like Vinclozolin.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:04.880
V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N,

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.900
which is a fungicide and
it's an anti-androgen.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.710
You give it to animals, to rats.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.170
And instead of forming a
penis, they don't form a penis.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:16.230
They basically, it's not
that they form a clitoris,

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.740
they just don't form a penis.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.990
So let's talk about
female sexual development.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.280
And as always what we'll do is,

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.690
we'll talk about the normal biology.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.010
Then we'll talk a little bit about

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.820
a kind of extraordinary
or unusual set of cases,

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.080
but we'll talk about them because

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.740
they illustrate an important principle

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.700
about how things work under
typical circumstances.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:44.530
So there is a mutation called

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.960
androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.030
And understanding how androgen
insensitivity syndrome works

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.580
can help you really
understand how hormones

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.800
impact sexual development.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.500
So here's how it works.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.413
There are individuals who are XY,

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.480
so they have a Y chromosome,

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:06.310
that are born that make testosterone.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:10.363
They have testes and they
don't have Mullerian Ducts

00:45:10.363 --> 00:45:12.510
because on the Y chromosome is this

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.400
Mullerian inhibiting hormone.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.600
However, these individuals
look completely female.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.720
And in general, they report feeling

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.040
like girls when they're young,

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.290
women when they're older.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.060
But there's something unusual

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.880
that's happening in these individuals

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.880
because they have an XY
chromosomal type and not XX.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.580
So what's happening?

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.670
Well what's happening is

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.970
the testes are making testosterone,

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.410
but the receptor for
testosterone is mutated.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.750
And therefore the testes never descend.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.140
They don't have ovaries, they have testes

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.000
but the testes are internal.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.970
And so typically these
individuals find out

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.930
that they are actually XY chromosomes.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.930
so that you know, their
chromosomal sex is male.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:00.900
If you will.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.630
And their gonadal sex is male,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.010
but the gonads, the testes
are inside the body.

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.980
They don't actually develop a scrotum.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.050
They don't make ovaries.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.220
And when they don't menstruate
around the time of puberty

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.200
that's a sign that something is different.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.990
And so they never
menstruate around puberty.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:19.340
And if they look into this deeply enough,

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.400
what you find is that
they are actually XY.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.410
They make testosterone

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.450
but their body can't make
use of the testosterone

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.920
because they don't have the receptors.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.320
And the receptors are
vitally important for some,

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.180
for most all of the secondary
sexual characteristics

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.060
that we talked about.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.930
Body hair, penis growth
during puberty et cetera.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:42.160
They live fairly happy lives as females.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.100
Although of course they
can't conceive, right?

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.978
They don't have a uterus,
they don't have ovaries.

00:46:46.978 --> 00:46:50.296
They also in general, don't produce sperm

00:46:50.296 --> 00:46:53.040
in quantities enough
that they could actually

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.070
reproduce with somebody else,

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.610
although sometimes they can.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.180
And believe it or not,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.350
and I'm not going to name names

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:02.430
but there are actually
reports of several people,

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.560
fairly prominent people throughout history

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.250
who have had this androgen
insensitivity syndrome

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.890
or people suspected they did.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.100
And the reason to not name names is that,

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.790
it gets right to the
heart of whether or not

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.230
they are male or female.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:17.610
How could you say right?

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.400
They have XY chromosomes

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.440
but gonadally they have
testes that are inside.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.800
And yet, if you looked at their bodies

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.720
if you looked at their faces,

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.710
you would say almost with certainty

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.790
that they appeared female.

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:35.283
And that naturally occurring experiment,

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.731
points to the fact that

00:47:37.731 --> 00:47:40.100
testosterone that shows up in the body

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.840
and impacts the things that
the levels of the receptor

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.780
has a profound effect on phenotype.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.980
On the external or body plan.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.740
So again, we're talking about this

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.210
in order to illustrate the principle that

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.160
in order to have its effects,

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.600
a hormone doesn't just have to be present.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.880
That hormone actually has to
be able to bind its receptor

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.970
and take action on the target cells.

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:05.120
And once again, I'll just
throw out the example of

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.090
where people are using
performance enhancing drugs.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.740
Although that's a pretty broad statement,

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.360
nowadays there's a lot of excitement about

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.800
the so-called SARMs.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.180
Who are more on the receptor side.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.527
And so we'll talk about
this in a future episode.

00:48:18.527 --> 00:48:21.070
And I just say that as a teaser because

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.030
the SARMs and what's happening right now

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.200
in augmenting sports performance,

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.710
both with testosterone directly

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.160
but also testosterone derivatives

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.900
and then also altering things at

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.820
the level of the receptor
is exceedingly interesting

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.730
and is revealing to us
the many ways in which

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.773
hormones can impact brain and body.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.570
In ways that we didn't suspect.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.030
Perhaps the simplest way to understand

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:47.150
how estrogen and testosterone impact

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:50.740
masculinization or feminization
of the brain and behavior

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.670
is from a statement.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.060
It's actually the closing
sentence of an abstract

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.500
that my colleague Neuronal Shaw

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.000
at Stanford school of medicine published.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.540
Which is that estrogen,

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:06.920
again it's estrogen that is
aromatized from testosterone

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.670
by aromatase,

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.190
sets up the masculine
repertoire of sexual,

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.630
and in animals and in humans,
territorial behaviors.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.950
So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.450
Estrogen does that.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.640
Estrogen sets up the masculine
circuitry in the brain

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.833
and testosterone is then what controls

00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:30.920
the display of those
behaviors later in life.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.060
And I find that incredibly interesting.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.560
You would think it was just testosterone

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.470
did one thing and estrogen did another,

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:38.400
but it turns out that nature is

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.380
far more interesting than that.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.180
Okay, so what are some things
that impact sexual development

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.733
early in life and later in life.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:51.360
Let's talk about cannabis.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.610
Let's talk about alcohol

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.740
and dare I say let's
talk about cell phones.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.430
Something that I never
thought I would ever do,

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.290
either in this podcast
or in the classroom.

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:04.720
But, these days there are
really interesting data.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.380
And I think you should be aware of them.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:10.450
First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.670
I realize that there are
now a lot of different

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:15.760
variance it's on this.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.570
There are a lot of different
strains of cannabis.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.010
I personally am not a pot smoker.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:23.100
It's just not for me.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.850
I'm not talking about the
moral or legal implications,

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:27.550
in some States it's decriminalized,

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.190
in other places it's really illegal

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:31.313
and other places it's basically legal.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.720
You have to check,

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.940
you know where you live
and understand the laws.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.700
That's not what this is about.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.800
What we do know however,

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.822
is that with the exception of one study

00:50:42.822 --> 00:50:46.820
there are many studies
that point to the fact

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.110
that THC and other things in cannabis

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:56.110
promote significant increases
in aromatase activity.

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.690
Now pot smokers aren't going to like this,

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:00.890
especially male pot smokers
aren't going to like this

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:02.190
but it's the reality.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.010
Remember, what you're
hearing in the background

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.760
is Costello snoring really loud?

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.910
Should we put them on screen?

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.890
He's not a cannabis smoker,
but you can imagine why.

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.370
Come here Costello.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:13.340
Come here buddy, come here.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.173
He's asleep.

00:51:14.173 --> 00:51:15.130
Come here.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:16.880
He's my [indistinct], there you go.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.870
This dog definitely
does not need cannabis.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.470
This is his state for most of the time.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:26.600
He is highly...

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.650
Oh he's asleep still.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.170
So some of you have asked to see Costello

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.510
if you're just listening on audio,

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:32.673
maybe he'll gives a

00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:34.410
[Costello grunts]
Oh, okay.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:36.320
We're going to let him get back to sleep.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.153
He's always here,

00:51:37.153 --> 00:51:39.090
some of you have asked to see him.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.943
Costello's not a pot smoker either.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:44.000
He did have a dog sitter that

00:51:44.967 --> 00:51:47.910
was a pot smoker years ago.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:50.520
It was his favorite dog sitter but,

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.020
I'm not a pot smoker.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.040
Again, no judgment.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.020
But here's the deal.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.450
That cannabis,

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:00.010
and it's not clear if it's THC itself

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.790
or other elements in the marijuana plant,

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:05.900
promote aromatase activity.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.520
Now, this has been observed anecdotally

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.030
where pot smokers have a
higher incidence of developing

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.000
something I mentioned before gynecomastia,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.960
breast bud development.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.560
Or full-blown breast development in males.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.530
There may be some women
who want to increase

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.110
their estrogenic activity.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.080
Remember females make testosterone.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.990
It comes from the adrenals, right?

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.120
They don't have testes.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.930
So it comes from the adrenals

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:34.470
and that testosterone
can also be aromatized.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:35.610
Although typically

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:38.250
most of the aromatase activity
that we're referring to

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.830
in these examples is in males.

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.990
So testosterone can increase
estrogenic activity.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:44.820
So you might say, "Oh you know, therefore

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:49.330
does testosterone reduce sexual behavior?

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:51.620
Does it create all sorts of things

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.010
that are related to low testosterone?"

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:57.130
Not necessarily, not necessarily.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:58.093
And here's why,

00:52:59.123 --> 00:53:03.640
estrogen itself in males and females

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.213
is important for things like
libido and sexual behavior.

00:53:08.213 --> 00:53:10.160
I'm going to repeat that.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.160
If estrogen is too low in males,

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.850
it can actually inhibit
libido and sexual behavior.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.780
So you don't want estrogen
too high or too low.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.690
Whether or not you're male or female.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.570
Now of course in females,

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:26.960
estrogen levels tend to
be higher than in males.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.630
I'm speaking very generally here.

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:30.470
You just think back to
the chromosomal sex.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:31.350
That's what I'm referring to

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.310
when I say male or female,

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.590
although there's nuance there of course.

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:39.950
In females, the testosterone
that comes from the adrenals

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:44.690
has a powerful effect on
libido and desire to reproduce.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:45.580
And in the next episode,

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.270
we're going to talk about how that works

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.890
and its relationship to birth control,

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.540
its relationship to menopause.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.900
We're also going to talk about how that

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.490
whole thing works in males as well.

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:59.430
But cannabis and other
aspects of the marijuana plant

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.820
can impact levels of
testosterone and estrogen

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.260
by increasing aromatase.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.830
And so people should be aware of that.

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.550
As well, there are good data.

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:10.500
I was able to find
several studies on PubMed,

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.270
pointing to the fact that

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.110
smoking marijuana during pregnancy can

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:20.290
shift the pattern of hormones
in the developing fetus,

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:24.060
such that it promotes
more estrogenic outcomes.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.350
Now earlier I said that

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.930
estrogen is what masculinized
is the male brain,

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.530
in utero that's true,

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:31.460
but the way that cannabis seems to work,

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.900
at least from the studies I
was able to identify is that

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.530
it promotes circulating
estrogen in the body

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.500
and therefore can counteract

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.222
some of the masculinizing effects of

00:54:43.222 --> 00:54:46.970
things like testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:49.710
on primary and secondary
sexual characteristics.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:51.083
So I mention this because,

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.540
you know I think nowadays marijuana use

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.010
is far more widespread

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.516
and certainly during puberty

00:54:57.516 --> 00:55:01.030
it can have profound effects
on these hormonal systems.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:03.040
And so we'll do another episode,

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.230
that goes really deep into this.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:07.580
But yes, cannabis promotes
estrogenic activity

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.960
by increasing aromatase.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.760
Almost everyone can appreciate that

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.290
drinking during pregnancy,

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:15.140
is not good for the developing fetus.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.570
Fetal alcohol syndrome
is a well-established

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.280
negative outcome of pregnancy.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.720
And it's something that

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.780
there are cognitive effects
that are really bad.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:29.070
There's actually physical
malformation, et cetera.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.740
So drinking during pregnancy, not good.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.940
Probably drinking during
puberty, not good either.

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:38.300
Because alcohol, in particular
certain things like beer

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:43.300
but other grain alcohols can
increase estrogenic activity.

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.441
Now, this isn't just about protecting

00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:51.530
young boys from estrogenic activity.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:54.870
It's also protecting girls from

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:59.870
excessive or even hypo
estrogenic effects of alcohol

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.040
in puberty.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.720
Now, many teenagers drink.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.950
College students drink

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:07.370
and it's important to point out that

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.010
puberty doesn't start on one
day and end on another day,

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.320
puberty has a beginning
a middle and an end,

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.120
but development is really
our entire lifespan.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.240
This idea that you know,

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.120
puberty you know has this open and close.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.530
That's just false.

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:23.130
Okay, so we talked about cannabis.

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:24.900
We talked about alcohol.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.910
Let's talk about cell phones.

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:29.890
First of all, I use a cell phone.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:32.270
I use it very often.

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.420
And I do not think they are evil devices.

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.960
I think that they require some discipline

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.040
in order to make sure that

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.260
it does not become a
negative force in one's life.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.270
So I personally restrict
the number of hours

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.060
that I'm on the phone and in
particular on social media.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.910
I only answer email at
particular times of day.

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:52.940
But what about the cell phone itself?

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.220
You know, when I was a junior professor.

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.020
I was a pre-tenure early professor.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.660
I taught this class on

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.730
neural circuits in health and disease.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:04.420
And one of the students asked me,

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.180
you know are cell phones
safe for the brain?

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.340
And you know, all the data

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.890
point to the fact that they were.

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:15.030
Or at least there were no
data showing that it wasn't.

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:16.820
I still don't have the
answer on that, frankly.

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.230
I don't see a lot of studies about it.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:20.480
I'm not personally aware of any evidence

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.250
in quality peer reviewed studies

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.560
showing that cell phones
are bad for the brain

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.560
or that holding the
phone to the ear is bad

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.390
or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that.

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.380
I'm just not aware of any quality studies.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.410
If you are aware of quality
studies, peer reviewed study

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:36.620
please reference them, put
them in the comment section.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.610
Send them to me, however you like.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:39.820
I'd love to see them.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.680
I'm not aware of them.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.340
However, I was very interested

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.720
in a particular study

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:50.610
that was published back in 2013 on rats.

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.240
It was basically took a cell phone

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.850
and put it under a cage of rats

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.220
and looked at basically testicular

00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:59.950
and ovarian development in rats and saw

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:03.960
minor but still statistically
significant defects

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.690
in ovarian and testicular development.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:10.113
Since then and now
returning to the literature,

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:16.060
I've seen a absolute explosion of studies.

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:18.310
Some of which are in quality journals,

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:19.950
some of which are in what I would call

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:21.603
not to blue ribbon journals.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:27.440
Identifying defects in testicular
and or ovarian development

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:32.950
by mere exposure to cell
phone emitted waves.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.033
Let's just call that,

00:58:34.033 --> 00:58:35.030
we don't know what they are.

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:37.560
And this sounds almost crazy, right?

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.187
Anytime somebody starts talking about

00:58:39.187 --> 00:58:40.020
EMS and things like that,

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.920
you kind of worry like,
is this person okay?

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.770
But look, the literature are
pointing in a direction where

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.270
chronic exposure of the gonads

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.480
to cell phones could be
creating serious issues

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.550
in terms of the health
at the cellular level

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:56.900
and then in terms of the output.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.940
So the output for the testes
would be sperm production.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.350
Swimming speed in sperm

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:04.810
is an important feature of sperm health.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:07.343
In the ovaries it would
be estrogenic output.

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:11.010
How regular the cycles are.

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.843
So in animals,

00:59:11.843 --> 00:59:14.060
the cycles are a little bit
different than in humans.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.190
They don't have a menstrual cycle.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:16.610
They have an estrous cycle,

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:18.510
which is a generally around four days.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:23.460
I think that it's to say
based on the literature,

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:28.000
that there are effects of
cell phone emitted waves

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.630
on gonadal development.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.070
The question is,

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:33.840
what is the proximity of the
cell phone to the gonads?

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.050
Now, I've taken the
literature as I observe it.

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:40.970
And that of course we'll
point you to in the captions.

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:44.850
And I don't like to have my
cell phone on and in my pocket,

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:46.943
I'm well past puberty, but nonetheless

00:59:46.943 --> 00:59:49.550
some of these effects were
seen in adult animals.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:52.540
There are effects now that have
been demonstrated in humans.

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.290
So let's just talk about
a couple of those effects.

00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:58.680
So a paper published in the
journal, "Clinical Biochemistry"

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.623
from S. Gander et al.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.520
Looked at hormone profiles
in people based on

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.450
proximity to their phone
and frequency of phone use,

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:11.510
where they stored their
phone on their body.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:15.690
Aa well as proximity
of where they lived to,

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:19.160
I guess they're called these
radio-frequency towers.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.800
So the base stations.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.740
And they were looking at

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.250
effects of radio frequency radiation RFR

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:27.800
on human hormone profiles.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.650
And they show significant
decreases in cortisol.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:33.100
You might say, "Well, that might be good."

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.750
But you need that morning cortisol bump

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.600
in order to wake up.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.450
Morning cortisol is good.

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.110
But also thyroid hormones
were significantly reduced.

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:43.010
Prolactin in young females,

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:45.770
that's definitely concerning

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.350
and testosterone levels
in males and females.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:52.590
And so, there are now quite
good data showing that

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:55.260
being close to the phone
too much of the day

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.170
and how close is an interesting question

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:00.650
or living near one of these base stations

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:04.700
apparently can have effects
on hormone profiles.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.130
And when you see a study like this

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.397
one should always ask,

01:01:08.397 --> 01:01:09.763
"Well, what are the other things

01:01:09.763 --> 01:01:12.250
that could also have effects
on these hormone profiles?"

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.010
Right? Cause you could imagine that

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:15.690
if you ran the same study

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:17.690
of people that live close to a waterway,

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.150
or close to a highway
where there's a lot of

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.040
exhaust from buses and cars,

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.400
you might see similar effects.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.950
So you have to take these sorts of studies

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.030
with a grain of salt.

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:27.280
But I think it's very interesting.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.660
And given that the last time
I looked into these data

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.110
were way back when I
was a junior professor

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.800
and there was like one or two
studies that I could find.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.740
One of the studies pointed to

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.810
increases in testosterone in rats,

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.010
where they were had
close proximity to these

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.340
radio-frequency radiation waves.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.960
And then in the other case,

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.540
it showed decreases in testosterone.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.740
So there really wasn't any
conclusion to takeaway from that.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:57.240
Now, there's pretty
impressive amount of data

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.530
pointing to the fact that

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:00.950
there are effects of
these things on hormones.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.470
I don't know what to do
with that information.

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:04.463
I'm not going to stop using my phone but,

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:09.283
in light of the work from Tyrone
Hayes and others looking at

01:02:09.283 --> 01:02:13.430
sperm counts and looking
at the decrease in

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.170
testosterone levels and
sperm counts and fertility

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.450
over the last 20, 30 years,

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:20.880
perhaps it's you know, not surprising.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.340
Although there again,

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.270
cell phones and smartphones
have really been

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:28.480
in prominent use mostly within
the last 10 or 11 years.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.170
And so it's hard to explain
all of those declines

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.800
simply on the basis of cell phone use.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.570
There's some interesting
effects of hormones

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:38.990
that actually you can observe
on the outside of people,

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.330
that tell you something about

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:43.270
not just their level of hormones,

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:45.720
but also about their underlying genetics.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.270
And these relate to beard
growth and baldness.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:49.483
And it's fascinating.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.123
The molecule, the hormone
dihydrotestosterone,

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.246
made from testosterone,

01:02:56.246 --> 01:03:00.150
is the hormone primarily
responsible for facial hair,

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:01.113
for beard growth.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.140
As well, it's the molecule,

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.680
the hormone primarily responsible for

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.360
lack of hair on the head, for hair loss.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.600
So how does that work?

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.640
Well, DHT circulates in the body

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.100
and it binds to DHT receptors in the face

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.380
to promote hair growth.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.470
But it binds to DHD receptors on the scalp

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:26.193
to promote hair loss.

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.640
Not incidentally,

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.000
the drugs that are designed
to prevent hair loss

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.560
are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.180
So remember 5-alpha-reductase
from the Guevedoces?

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.550
Well, the people that
discovered the Güevedoces,

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:44.300
went on to do a lot of research

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.160
on the underlying biochemistry

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.580
of this really interesting
molecule dihydrotestosterone.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.800
They identified 5-alpha-reductase.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.390
and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.560
are the basis of most of the

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.720
anti-hair loss treatments
that are out there.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.340
And so there's some
interesting things here.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.080
First of all, the side effect profiles

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.140
of those treatments for hair loss

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.280
are quite severe in many individuals.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.690
Remember DHT is the primary androgen

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:17.590
for libido, for strengthened
connective tissue repair,

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:19.588
for aggression.

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:22.640
Even if that aggression of
course is held in check,

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.570
but just sort of ambition and aggression

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:25.650
is related to dopamine,

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.020
but within the testosterone pathway,

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.140
less so pure testosterone,

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.910
although pure testosterone
has its effects.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:36.410
But DHT is, at least in primate
species including humans,

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:40.670
is the dominant androgen for
most of those sorts of effects.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.205
And if you look at somebody,

01:04:43.205 --> 01:04:46.100
everyone can predict whether or not

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.350
they're going to go bald
based on looking at their,

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.300
we're always taught our mother's father.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.670
So if your mother's father was bald,

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:54.050
there's a higher probability that

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:55.100
you're going to go bald.

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:59.000
The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.600
will dictate whether or not
you're going to go bald everywhere

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.250
or just in the front or the
so called crown type baldness.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.310
And the density of the
beard tells you about

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:08.970
the density of DHT receptors.

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:13.210
Now this varies by background,
by genetic background.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.290
And actually around the world nowadays,

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.550
because people travel and people

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.729
form couples and have kids with

01:05:19.729 --> 01:05:22.480
so many different people of
different mixed cultures.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.910
You're seeing this starting to disappear.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:26.120
But there are areas areas of the world

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.780
where all the men seem to

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.070
have the same pattern of baldness,

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.800
like a strip of baldness down the center,

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.100
with hair still on the
sides and and full beards.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.240
That's because these
patterns of DHT receptors

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.070
are genetically determined.

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.800
Elsewhere, testosterone
levels can still be very high,

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.600
DHT levels in the blood can be very high

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.330
and yet people will have very
light beards or no beards.

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:49.560
And that's because

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.300
they don't have a lot of
DHT receptors in the face.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.480
And in still other cultures

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.010
you'll see people with huge beard,

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:56.940
tons of beard.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.570
Their beards are growing
all the way up to their eyes

01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.820
and they have huge heads of hair.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.910
And that's because they have a lot of

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:03.890
DHT receptors on the face
and not on the scalp.

01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:06.310
So there are a lot of effects of DHT

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.410
that you can just see in male phenotypes.

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:12.310
And it's interesting that
these hair loss drugs

01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.680
that are,

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.950
or to prevent hair loss drugs,

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:19.340
are directly aimed at preventing

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.870
the conversion of testosterone
into dihydrotestosterone.

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.000
And that's why they to some
extent prevent hair loss,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.160
but also to some extent have,

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.840
a bunch of side effects that
are associated with low DHT.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.400
Along these lines there's a particular

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.830
sports supplement that a lot
of people use called Creatine.

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:40.210
Creatine, now there's a lot
of research showing that

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:43.740
Creatine can bring more
more water into the muscle.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.442
It can support strength.

01:06:45.442 --> 01:06:47.740
It does a number of other things.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.220
Might even have some
important cognitive promoting.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.220
Cognitive enhancement
effects, although mild.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.963
The studies there show
that it can be significant.

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:59.700
Some people, not all it's more anecdotal,

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.013
report that creatine promotes hair loss.

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:04.570
It differs by individual.

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:07.380
For some people that's
true, for others no.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.870
But yes it does appear,

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:10.950
based on the studies I was
able to find on PubMed,

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:15.330
that creatine does promote
5-alpha-reductase activity

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:17.470
and therefore the
conversion of testosterone

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.220
into dihydrotestosterone.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.800
And so it makes sense
that it might promote

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.020
some degree of hair loss,
as well as beard growth,

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.263
as well as the other effects of DHT.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.420
I recall in junior high
school and middle school,

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.180
going home one Summer
it was seventh grade,

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.140
coming back in the eighth grade

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.050
and a kid that I knew
that I was friends with,

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:38.420
went from being like a young kid to,

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.440
he was like a grown man,
he had a full beard.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.273
It was amazing.

01:07:41.273 --> 01:07:42.920
It was like he would
completely transformed.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.470
And in puberty as I've said before,

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:47.954
is without a doubt the most accelerated

01:07:47.954 --> 01:07:50.220
rate of development
that we will go through

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.710
at any point in our lives.

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:54.300
Even faster than infancy
just in terms of the

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.280
huge number of different cognitive changes

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.210
and physical changes.

01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:00.680
Not surprisingly that same individual

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.600
was mostly or bald by his early twenties.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.040
And that's because he must have had

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.070
just exceedingly high levels of DHT.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:09.400
I also played soccer with this kid

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.250
and he was basically like
dribbling past everybody.

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.083
It who was like a grown man,

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:13.990
playing soccer with a
bunch of little kids.

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.100
Full beard you know, bald at 20.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.970
And so the rate of
maturation, the rate of aging

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:20.980
is very interesting.

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.430
It's hard to know rate of aging.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.690
There's some genetic tests that now

01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:24.650
can allow you to do that.

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:27.610
Things like Horvath Clocks
and things of that sort.

01:08:27.610 --> 01:08:29.920
Beautiful work of David
Sinclair at Harvard and others

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.520
has pointed to this.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.520
The speed of entry and
exit from puberty might be,

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:38.440
I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.130
Might be an interesting window,

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:42.690
into how fast one is going through

01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:44.550
their aging or developmental arc.

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.070
Because development of course,

01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:48.480
doesn't just start at birth
and end after puberty.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.600
It continues your entire life.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.620
So I think it's interesting.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:57.560
You will often see that
people, boys and girls.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.220
I should say boys or girls,

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.670
will develop secondary
sexual characteristics

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:03.660
at different rates.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.340
And sometimes it's sequential.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.376
You know you might see a kid will,

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.120
she'll grow very tall

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.960
or she'll have a big growth spurt,

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.980
but then breast development
will come a little bit later.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.340
And then other features will
come a little bit later.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.010
You can also see this in boys.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.720
The person that I referred to earlier,

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.860
my friend that developed a full
beard, you know, went bald.

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.270
He was also quite muscular,
he was a great athlete.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:27.440
So he went through
puberty exceedingly fast.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.160
Other people go through it more slowly.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.750
Some people will go
through puberty at age 14,

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:35.040
but they won't start to
accumulate facial hair

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.980
until much, much later.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.050
Or their voice will
change first, very early.

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.300
And then they won't get

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.520
the other secondary sexual characteristics

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.690
until much later.

01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:48.310
And so, we don't really
know how that impacts

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:51.480
or relates to overall
trajectory or rate of aging.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.820
But it's an interesting
thing to think about

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.340
for each and every one of us.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.750
I'm going to offer you the opportunity

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.950
to do an experiment today,

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:00.230
while listening to the podcast.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:04.100
But first I want to tell you a story about

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.550
hyenas, professional baseball

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:10.980
and clitoris's the size of penises.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.440
So when I was a graduate
student at UC Berkeley,

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.760
we had a professor in our department,

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.530
phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:26.530
Steve Glickman, had a colony
of hyenas, spotted hyenas

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.570
that lived, within caged
enclosures of course,

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:33.210
in Tilden Park behind
the UC Berkeley campus.

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:34.950
The enclosures are actually still there.

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:36.990
I run past there fairly often.

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:39.060
The hyenas are no longer there.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.380
This was a Federally Funded field station.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.660
These animals were
brought over from Africa

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.530
or were bred there.

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:50.083
And the reason why they
were hyenas in Tilden Park,

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:53.530
enclosed in Tilden Park.

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:56.910
Was because hyenas exhibit
an incredible feature

01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:00.633
to their body, their hormones
and their social structure.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:05.690
Hyenas, unlike many species,

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:08.550
have a situation with
their genitalia where

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:12.490
the male penis is actually smaller

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.990
than the female clitoris.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:17.240
And I should say that
the male penis itself,

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.880
having seen a fair
number of hyena penises,

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.730
is not particularly small.

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:26.773
Which means that the hyena
clitoris's are extremely large.

01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:30.260
This was well known for some time.

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.720
It turns out that in these spotted hyenas

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:37.060
the females are dominant.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.460
So after a kill

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.280
the females will eat, then
they're young will eat.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.883
And then the male hyenas will eat.

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:46.120
As well,

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.060
when the female hyena gives birth,

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:53.120
she gives birth, not
through the vaginal canal

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.490
that we're accustomed to seeing,

01:11:56.490 --> 01:12:01.490
but through a very enlarged
clitoris's like phallus.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.710
Although it's not a
phallus, it's a clitoris.

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.710
And it literally splits open.

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:10.600
So many fetuses die during the course of

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.253
hyena development and birth.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.410
These animals have this,

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:18.070
what could only be described as

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:20.000
a very large or giant clitoris.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.310
Although for a hyena it's
not giant, it's normal.

01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:25.270
And it splits open and the
baby actually comes through.

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:29.130
The baby hyena actually
comes through the tissue

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:31.670
and it's it's a very traumatic birth.

01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:33.920
A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.890
And as I mentioned, a
lot of baby hyenas die.

01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:41.720
It was a mystery as to how
the female hyenas have this

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:44.040
we'll call it masculinization,

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.500
but it's really a androgen jet.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.580
Excuse me, androgenization
of the periphery.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.500
Of the genitalia.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.470
And it turns out, through
a lot of careful research

01:12:55.470 --> 01:13:00.040
done by Steve Glickman,
Christine Drey and others.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.740
That it's androstenedione.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.653
What is essentially a pro
hormone to testosterone?

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.570
It's androstenedione at very high levels

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:13.630
that's produced in female hyenas

01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:16.690
that creates this enlargement
of their genitalia.

01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:19.267
So if you want to read
up on androstenedione.

01:13:19.267 --> 01:13:22.050
Androstenedione is made into testosterone

01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:27.050
through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy
steroid dehydrogenase

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:32.340
it's a complicated pathway to pronounce.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.630
It's a fairly straightforward
pathway biochemically.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:39.270
You may recall during the 90's and 2000's

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:42.630
there were a lot of performance
enhancing drug scandals,

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:45.080
in particular in Major League Baseball.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.700
And it was purported,

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.700
although I don't know
that it was ever verified.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.920
But it was purported that the major

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.000
performance enhancing drug
of abuse at that time,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.060
in particular players whose
names we won't mention

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.420
but you can Google it
if you want to find out.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.560
Was androstenedione.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.530
And I actually recall long ago,

01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:05.540
when you could buy androstenedione

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.580
in the health food stores.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.130
And so it was sold over the counter.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.160
So a lot's changed since then.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.400
But it's interesting that these hyenas,

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.030
with these highly androgenized genitalia

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.310
accomplish that through

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:24.840
high levels of androstenedione
in the females.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.200
Now if that's unusual,

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.450
what might be even more unusual is that

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:32.300
a graduate student that I
was working with at the time.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.250
Alongside we didn't share research.

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:36.550
Her name was Nicola Sitka.

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:38.980
She is actually a trained behavioral,

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.390
animal behavioral expert.

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:43.810
She had trained ferrets for
that show the "BeastMaster."

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:46.710
And she had trained wolves
for television shows

01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:47.810
and was a dog trainer.

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:49.490
She had these two large dogs that,

01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:51.370
unlike my dog would actually listen to her

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.720
when she would give them commands.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.110
A remarkable scientist.

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:58.380
She was studying a species of mole

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.910
that also lived in Tilden Park.

01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:01.780
People are going to start
to wonder about Tilden Park,

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.080
what's in Tilden Park?

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.670
But this particular mole that lived there

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.100
had testes for part of the year

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.710
and had the capacity
to trans differentiate

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:13.830
its testes into ovaries

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:15.430
in order to balance out the ratio

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.300
of males and females in the population

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.470
to keep reproduction at appropriate levels

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:22.290
for that certain population.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:24.040
So some animals are actually able

01:15:25.176 --> 01:15:29.210
to adjust whether or not
they have androgenized

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:32.100
or estrogenized gonads,

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:36.900
in order to adjust the ratios of offspring

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.900
or the males and females in
therefor promote offspring.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.010
And the last little anecdote about this,

01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:45.170
which is also published in
the scientific literature,

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:47.390
which is weird but I do find interesting.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.720
Hormones are so fascinating,

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.980
they're just incredible to me is

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:54.720
going back to the marijuana plant.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.860
You know, the marijuana plant

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.783
has these estrogenic properties.

01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:01.770
And I asked a plant biologist

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.423
whether or not this was unusual.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.700
And I asked because

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.767
there's all this stuff out there about,

01:16:07.767 --> 01:16:09.350
"Oh, you know, Soy does this.

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:12.970
And these plants are highly
estrogenic, et cetera."

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:14.060
Although we should probably point out that

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.850
a lot of factory meats
are also estrogenic.

01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:18.060
So this isn't a meat versus plants thing.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.227
But this plant biologist told me,

01:16:19.227 --> 01:16:22.670
"Oh yeah, there are plants that make

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:26.040
what is essentially the
equivalent of testosterone

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.540
like pine pollen as it looks
a lot like testosterone.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.380
And there are other plants that make

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.060
what is essentially estrogen.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.320
And I said, "Well, why
would they do that?"

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.600
Well and you know plants,

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.640
at least as far as I know,

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.630
don't have a consciousness.

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:39.580
They don't have a brain.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.713
They don't have neurons even but,

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.270
his answer was fascinating.

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:49.130
He said that, one of the
reasons why some plants

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:51.120
have evolved this capacity

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.280
to increase estrogen levels

01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:57.120
in animals that smoke, not smoke it

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.710
but then animals that consume them.

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:00.570
I'm guessing that animals
aren't smoking marijuana.

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.210
Although I don't know, send me the paper

01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:04.030
if you've heard of this.

01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:06.890
Is that plants have figured out ways.

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:10.100
They've adapted ways to
push back on populations

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.100
of rodents and other species
of animals that eat them.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.490
So plants are engaged in a kind of

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:17.690
plant to animal warfare

01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:19.370
where they increase the estrogen

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:20.910
of the males in that population

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:22.210
to lower the sperm counts,

01:17:22.210 --> 01:17:25.450
to keep those populations
clamped at certain levels

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:28.350
so that those plants can
continue to flourish.

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:33.190
Even if those animals are
reproducing very robustly.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.210
And I find this just fascinating.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:37.800
And hormones therefore,

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.890
aren't just impacting tissue
growth and development

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:44.380
within the individual
and between the mother.

01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.410
Remember the placenta
is an endocrine organ,

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:47.400
and the offspring,

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.890
but plants and animals
are in this communication.

01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.420
And today we're in this communication,

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.310
I'm telling you that

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:54.510
there are certain herbicides
that humans are using

01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:56.040
for which there's very good data,

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.410
are disrupting the endocrine pathways.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.640
And so it's fascinating that

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.200
humans and other animals,

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.700
we're always in this interplay

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.930
with plants and the other
things in our environment.

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.980
And hormones and adjusting
the hormone levels

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.440
of animals and plants is one way in which

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.110
the environment kind of pushes back

01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:17.240
or pushes forward if you will,

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.780
in terms of promoting their
well-being and longevity,

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.010
as well as you trying to promote

01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:23.830
your wellbeing and longevity.

01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:25.970
If anyone wants to see
the incredible paper

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:27.940
by Steve Glickman and colleagues.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.060
It was published in the proceedings
of the national Academy.

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:33.430
First in 1987, that's Glickman et al.

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.900
That was the hypothesis that
it was androstenedione .

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.870
And then if you just Google

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:41.150
Glickman hyenas science magazine,

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.755
there's a beautiful
cover article and feature

01:18:43.755 --> 01:18:45.870
all about that important discovery,

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.280
it's a fascinating one.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.340
And I should mention also
that those discoveries,

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:53.267
both the moles and the hyenas weren't just

01:18:53.267 --> 01:18:55.680
impactful for the world of animal behavior

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.513
and endocrinology,

01:18:56.513 --> 01:18:59.490
they've also strongly
impacted understanding

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:01.670
of conditions that show up in the clinic,

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.640
which we haven't talked about today.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:06.080
Which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.160
Occasionally babies will be
born where it is unclear,

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.240
if they are boys or girls
based on the genitalia.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.940
And this has a very important
ethical and other issues.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.010
Do you raise them as a boy or a girl?

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:23.610
It's not super uncommon
for this to happen.

01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:26.830
And there have been terrible
cases where people have

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:30.410
gone against the chromosomal sex.

01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:32.840
And the person was very unhappy

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.940
with the the choice that their
parents had made for them.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.310
There were also cases where

01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:37.337
they've gone with a chromosomal sex

01:19:37.337 --> 01:19:40.140
and the person was very
happy about the outcome.

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:40.973
There've been cases where

01:19:40.973 --> 01:19:42.290
they've been treated with hormones

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:43.750
and there been cases where they have not

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.686
been treated with hormones.

01:19:45.686 --> 01:19:48.402
It's a complicated literature and

01:19:48.402 --> 01:19:52.420
it has to be sorted out on
kind of a case by case basis,

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.290
but it is something that does happen.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.000
And the studies on
androstenedione in hyenas

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.900
and in these very interesting moles,

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.860
pseudo-hermaphroditic moles
that live in Tilden Park,

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.080
have impacted not just the science

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:08.310
but the therapeutics around
those important issues.

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.550
So now last but not least,

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:13.890
I want to discuss the effects of hormones

01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:18.610
while you and I were separately in utero

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:22.313
and the effects that
that had on who we are,

01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:26.490
who we select as mates.

01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:29.010
So mate choice, sexual preference.

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:33.490
And all other aspects
of what you would call

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:35.430
sexual development.

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:38.650
Now this is something that's
gotten a lot of popular press

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:40.110
and it has to do with

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:42.990
how exposure to androgens in particular

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:45.110
while we were in utero,

01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:47.640
impacted whether or not people report

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.220
as homosexual, heterosexual,

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.770
identify as male or female.

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:54.250
I'm very familiar with this work

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:55.530
because I was a graduate student

01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:57.340
in the department that
first published this work

01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.610
and I'm an author on the paper.

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:01.650
I was not the main driver of the work,

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.570
but I was involved in the work.

01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:06.120
And I certainly know the
people that did this work.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.453
First it starts with a story.

01:21:10.730 --> 01:21:13.800
There was a researcher
who's still going now.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.490
His name is Dennis McFadden.

01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:19.100
I believe he was at UT Austin back then.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:22.220
And he was studying the auditory system.

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.730
And people would come into
his clinic and he would,

01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:25.750
or his laboratory.

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:28.600
And he would look at hearing

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.150
and he would explore different aspects

01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:31.760
of what they call the
psychophysics of hearing

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.340
and understanding hearing thresholds

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:34.850
and frequency thresholds.

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.923
And he made several observations.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.670
And those observations were that

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.300
young males tended to have

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.090
what are called auto acoustic emissions,

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:49.810
more often than young females did.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:52.210
Auto acoustic emissions,
as the name suggests,

01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:54.670
are the ears actually making sounds.

01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:56.150
Now these sounds have to be picked up

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:57.440
by a special apparatus,

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.930
because they can hear into that frequency.

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.670
But it turns out that your ears don't just

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:03.496
take sound waves and convert them into

01:22:03.496 --> 01:22:05.330
this thing we call hearing.

01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:07.530
But they also in some cases make sound.

01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:09.090
So your ears are making sounds.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.400
Strange right?

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.937
So it turns out that there's a

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:16.770
sex difference in auto acoustic emissions.

01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:20.513
It turns out also that people
that self-report as lesbians,

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.220
they also have auto acoustic emissions

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:26.510
significantly more than females

01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:29.500
that don't self-report as lesbian.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:33.560
And Dennis noticed this
and published this.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.230
And it was an important discovery because

01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:38.060
it was one of the first discoveries

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:42.090
that pointed to the fact that there are

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:46.950
sex differences in biology
that are independent of sex.

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:49.180
I mean, this is hearing and
auto acoustic emissions.

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:51.620
And just to really illustrate what that.

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.140
What the former problem was

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.797
and why this study was so important?

01:22:55.797 --> 01:22:58.140
You know, a lot of people had explored

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.543
for instance whether or not,

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:04.770
homosexuals had lower testosterone
for instance in males.

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:06.790
And actually the result
often was the opposite.

01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:10.050
That gay men or men
that self-report is gay,

01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:12.460
often had much higher testosterone.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.070
And those studies then
became controversial

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.903
because people said,

01:23:15.903 --> 01:23:19.030
"Well, sexual behavior can
relate to testosterone,"

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.863
et cetera.

01:23:19.863 --> 01:23:21.220
And so it became very controversial.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:22.720
And then there were some studies

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.210
that attempted to look at
the equivalent phenomenon in

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:28.130
people that self report as lesbian.

01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:30.290
Or self-report as heterosexual.

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:31.860
And so it became very complicated.

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:36.190
But this was an identification
of a phenomenon,

01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:37.680
auto acoustic emissions,

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.610
that was independent of
anything that had to do with

01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:41.543
sexual or even social behavior.

01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:44.983
1998 rolls around.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.950
And I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:50.930
and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove.

01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:54.145
Kind of an ironic name,
given that he worked on.

01:23:54.145 --> 01:23:56.560
He worked and still works
on sexual dimorphism

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:59.410
in the brain and in the spinal
cord and nervous system.

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:02.310
And Mark, who's a phenomenal scientist

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.780
comes running down the hall.

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.650
I'll never forget this.

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:07.125
And he said, "Give me your hands."

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:07.958
I was like, [indistinct].

01:24:07.958 --> 01:24:09.017
He's like, "Give me your hands."

01:24:09.017 --> 01:24:09.850
And he pulls out a ruler

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:10.683
and he starts measuring my fingers.

01:24:10.683 --> 01:24:11.920
And he takes down a couple of measurements

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.150
and then he goes away.

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:15.540
And I was like, "What was that?"

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:18.380
Well, I was in a course
that Mark was teaching

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:19.860
at that point.

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:24.860
And soon after, we did a
study that Mark directed

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.060
exploring the finger length ratios.

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.690
And I'll explain what those are.

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:34.050
Of males and females,

01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:38.510
and people that self-reported
as homosexual or heterosexual.

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.830
So let's just get to the basic,

01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:43.550
what we'll call sex differences first.

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:44.770
These are averages.

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:45.603
I want to point out.

01:24:45.603 --> 01:24:47.030
Anytime you get into this kind of topic,

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:49.390
people assume it's causal,
but it's not causal.

01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:51.590
These are averages that
I'm about to report.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.560
It is the case that the ratio

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.020
of what's called the D2 to D4 digits.

01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.890
So the D2 is your index finger.

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.140
So your thumb is D1.

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.390
Then D2 would be your index finger

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:03.610
that you would point with.

01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:06.320
Middle finger is D3,
which you whatever with.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:10.330
And then D4 is the so-called ring finger.

01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:11.783
Okay and D5 is the pinky.

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:15.490
It is the case that

01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:19.210
the D2 to D4 ratio is greater

01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:23.650
in self-reported females
than it is in males.

01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:24.483
What does that mean?

01:25:24.483 --> 01:25:29.483
It means that digit D4 and
D4 are more similar in length

01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.730
in females than in men males.

01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:34.800
And that effect is
particularly, excuse me,

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.470
pronounced on the right hand.

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:39.499
Although not always, okay?

01:25:39.499 --> 01:25:41.470
And it does not have
to do with handedness.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:45.850
This D2 to D4 difference has
to be measured correctly.

01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:47.657
You can't just look at
somebody who's hands and say,

01:25:47.657 --> 01:25:52.010
"Oh, their ring finger and
index finger are very similar.

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:55.680
And therefore they are female you know.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.920
Or they were exposed to very
little testosterone in utero."

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.800
You can't look at somebody and see that

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.250
their index finger is much
shorter than their ring finger

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:05.710
and say, "Oh, they must've been exposed

01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:06.780
to a lot of androgen."

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.150
You have to actually measure it

01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:09.910
and you have to measure it correctly.

01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:11.250
You have to measure it from

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.950
the base of the finger where
there's that first crease,

01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:16.211
all the way to the tip past the.

01:26:16.211 --> 01:26:17.700
You can't include the fingernails.

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:18.820
If you're growing fingernails,

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.170
it'd be logical here folks.

01:26:21.318 --> 01:26:24.970
So you can't normally see it
from the back of the hand.

01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:27.960
Although, I don't know if
this'll show up here but

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.300
if you look at the back of the hand

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.829
sometimes you can see it.

01:26:30.829 --> 01:26:32.920
You know, in my case for instance.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.000
Let me see if I can do this.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.760
So my D4 is a little
bit longer than my D2.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.360
In some people it's more pronounced

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.320
and that's on my right hand.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.153
On the other hand,

01:26:41.153 --> 01:26:42.550
the difference actually
is far less pronounced.

01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:43.840
Is it's a little bit.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.720
it's a little bit pronounced
there, but not so much okay?

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.643
So that's sort of the typical
ratio that you would see.

01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:54.763
It turns out that in mice and in humans,

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.203
the more androgen that you
were exposed to in utero,

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:02.020
the smaller the D4 D2 ratio.

01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.540
Meaning that the ring finger tends to be

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:07.490
slightly longer than the pointer finger.

01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:09.370
And in females because they're exposed to

01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:13.170
less androgen in utero typically.

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:15.360
Then those fingers tend to
be more equal in length.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.870
And these are subtle differences

01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:18.070
and these are averages.

01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:19.950
I invite you to look up the paper.

01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:21.830
This was published in Nature in 2000

01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:26.420
and it's been replicated six times.

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.820
Now, here's where it gets
even more interesting.

01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:31.580
And potentially precarious,

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.380
so we're going to step cautiously here.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.290
If you look at the finger length ratios

01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:40.690
of men that self-report as homosexual,

01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:45.630
they have either the typical
male pattern of D2 to D4 ratio

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:49.240
or a hyper masculinized D4 to D2 ratio.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.700
Now this can't be something

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.730
that's established or
modified by behavior.

01:27:53.730 --> 01:27:55.970
This has to be something that
was established in utero.

01:27:55.970 --> 01:28:00.520
And in fact, it's present at birth okay?

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.980
So it completely divorces

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:05.300
the interactions between
hormones and behavior.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.200
And that's an important theme
that we've been talking about.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.290
And we're going to talk about even more.

01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:10.430
Next episode is that
hormones impact behavior

01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:12.130
but behavior also impact hormones.

01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.900
But this is a case of hormones impacting

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.360
what really should be considered

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.830
a primary sexual characteristic.

01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:20.280
Because it doesn't show up in puberty,

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.420
it shows up before puberty.

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.940
It's actually established in utero.

01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:27.070
And in people that self-reported lesbians.

01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:28.290
And I remember going out there

01:28:28.290 --> 01:28:30.320
and collecting these data with,

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.900
with the collaborators on this work.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.660
Again, I wasn't the
main driver on the work.

01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:36.250
But I participated in
some of the analysis.

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:38.170
People that self-report as lesbians

01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:43.170
also tend to have a
smaller D2 to D4 ratio.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.420
So this is consistent with the
auto acoustic emission study

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.250
that Dennis McFadden had published.

01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:51.910
And it points to the fact that
early exposure to androgens

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:54.630
may have an impact,

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:59.580
not just on androgenization
of the body plan,

01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:04.580
but also separately on sexual preference.

01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:06.990
Now, this raises all sorts
of interesting questions

01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:09.010
about biological basis
of sexual preference.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.870
I'll tell you about another study.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:13.810
A guy named Simon LeVay who was at UCLA.

01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:16.630
Who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.

01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:18.780
If any of you remember early
episodes on "Plasticy,"

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.320
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.900
my scientific great-grandparents
won the Nobel Prize

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:26.670
for discovery of critical
periods for brain plasticity.

01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:28.620
They defined some of the
most important aspects

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.640
of how we see and brain plasticity.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.890
Simon LeVay trained with them.

01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:36.670
And then Simon went on to discover that

01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:40.660
in the brains of people
that self-report homosexual

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:42.400
there is a brain difference.

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.190
And the brain difference
is in an area called

01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.543
the Interstitial Nucleus of
the Anterior Hypothalamus.

01:29:48.387 --> 01:29:49.550
So it's the INAH.

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:54.770
And so there are published reports.

01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:56.380
That was published in Science.

01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.160
The other work I refer to
as published in Nature,

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.730
and then replicated no
fewer than six times.

01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:02.954
And the McFadden results that point to

01:30:02.954 --> 01:30:06.790
strong biological correlates

01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:11.590
of mate choice, of sexual preference.

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:14.440
And these tie directly to

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.900
things like androgenization
or estrogenization.

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:20.970
Meaning we could call it
maleness or femaleness,

01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:22.660
but that's sort of tricky territory.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.920
Because of the way that we described

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.040
the huge range in which
sex can be defined earlier.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.870
So, if you want to
measure your D2 D4 ratio

01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:31.830
you're welcome to,

01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:34.110
but you also have to understand that

01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:36.760
it's not predictive of anything, right?

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.060
It's just a window into the possible

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:41.610
androgen exposure that
you had early in life.

01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:44.730
There are plenty of men
who report themselves

01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:46.410
as heterosexual who are out there

01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:50.360
who have similar or have
D2 D4 ratios to females.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.840
And there are plenty of
females whose index fingers

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.530
are shorter than their ring fingers.

01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:55.790
And they're perfectly happy

01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:57.590
where they say they're perfectly happy.

01:30:57.590 --> 01:31:00.150
And we are inclined to believe
them being heterosexual.

01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.090
So there's variation.

01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:03.040
In fact, Mark tells a really good joke.

01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:06.030
If you want to know whether or not

01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:09.060
somebody is homosexual or heterosexual,

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.810
simply look at their hands,

01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:15.260
look at their D2 D4 ratio
and guess heterosexual.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.560
And you'll be right 96% of the time.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.140
Because 96% of the time

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.020
people report themselves
as heterosexual on average.

01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.710
Those numbers might be changing.

01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:26.291
So the joke really is a
joke on science because,

01:31:26.291 --> 01:31:30.000
that falls within the realm
of statistical significance.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.970
And yet it really
illustrates the fact that

01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:33.830
none of this is causal.

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:35.620
But it's nonetheless very interesting

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:37.870
because it means that
hormones are organizing

01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:40.540
the brain early in
development in ways that

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.380
can potentially impact

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:45.970
same or opposite sex partner
choice later in life.

01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:48.090
Now of course, there are
other things that can impact

01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:50.734
opposite sex or same-sex
partner choice later in life.

01:31:50.734 --> 01:31:54.630
The study did not look at
people who reported bisexual.

01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:57.800
There hasn't been a lot
of studies on that yet.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.440
One thing that's very interesting,

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.990
for which there are some
good scientific data

01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:04.840
but there's also some controversy is that,

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.170
it appears that the
probability of a male human

01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:11.910
self-reporting as homosexual,

01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:16.450
increases with the number of
older brothers that he has.

01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:18.240
Now, that doesn't mean if
you have an older brother

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.840
or even if you have 10 older brothers,

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.900
that you are sure to
self-report as homosexual.

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.900
But statistically it becomes
more likely that somebody will

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:31.550
with each successive older
brother that they have.

01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:33.210
And the idea that starting to emerge,

01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:36.709
in the developmental
neuroendocrinology landscape

01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:41.150
is that there's a record within the mother

01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:43.430
of how many male fetuses she's carried,

01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:46.420
because male fetuses are
secreting certain things,

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.720
dihydrotestosterone, other things,

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.880
that can feed back on to the genome.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.420
So these could be epigenomic effects

01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.740
or onto the placenta itself,

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.660
so that there's a higher probability

01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:59.530
in subsequent pregnancies

01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:02.930
that offspring will
self-report as homosexual.

01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:05.070
So it's a fascinating area of biology.

01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:06.540
And as you've noticed today,

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.220
none of this deals with

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:10.960
the current controversies around gender

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.020
and how many genders and sex, et cetera

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.420
That's a separate conversation that is

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:18.290
by definition grounded
in the kind of concepts

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:19.750
we've been talking about today

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:21.440
and needs to take place,

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.820
taking into consideration

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:26.240
all of the aspects of sex
and the effects of hormones,

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.610
both on the body, on the brain.

01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:30.030
We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord,

01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:32.160
but we will in the next episode.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.740
But we can just say on the
brain and the periphery,

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:37.230
early effects, late effects,

01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:40.180
acute effects, meaning
effects that are very fast

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.270
of levels of hormones going up or down.

01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:44.400
Something that absolutely happens during

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.380
and across the menstrual cycle.

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.297
As well as long-term effects

01:33:48.297 --> 01:33:51.750
like the effects of these
hormones on gene expression.

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:53.870
So today, as always,

01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:55.510
we weren't able to cover

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:59.670
all things related to sex and hormones

01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:02.860
and sexual differentiation or development.

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:04.170
There's no way we could.

01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:06.360
But we have covered a lot of material.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:10.390
We talked about some effects
of environmental toxins.

01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:12.950
We talked about potential
effects of cell phone radiation.

01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:15.740
Something I never thought
that I would be talking about,

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:17.410
especially not in a podcast.

01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:19.450
But for which there are
interesting emerging data.

01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:21.800
We talked about considerations about

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.610
Evening Primrose Oil and
its estrogenic effects.

01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:27.180
About Creatine and its pro DHT effects.

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.190
About cannabis, alcohol.

01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:31.810
About plants exerting warfare on animals

01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:33.210
by increasing aromatase.

01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:35.200
The conversion of
testosterone to estrogen.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.410
We talked about hyenas
with giant clitoris's.

01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:40.240
And we talked about moles that can revert

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.560
from having ovaries to testicles.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.530
And throughout this Costello
has been snoring nonstop.

01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:48.040
He missed all of it.

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.340
Although he might be
learning it in his sleep

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:51.860
for all I know.

01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:55.010
And I do understand it's
a lot of information,

01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:56.330
a lot of detail as always.

01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:57.360
I just want to remind you,

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.100
you don't have to absorb
all the information at once.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.779
Next episode, we are
going to be talking about

01:35:02.779 --> 01:35:06.894
the science of sex, the
verb, actual reproduction.

01:35:06.894 --> 01:35:07.920
We're also going to be talking about

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.730
effects of hormones on
various aspects of behavior

01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:14.170
and ways to modulate hormones,

01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:18.796
through the use of
behavior, supplementation.

01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:22.050
Also we'll touch on diet
and nutrition a bit.

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:23.110
And we're going to talk about

01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:26.180
interactions between
those things and behavior,

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:28.280
as they relate to important themes

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.960
like sex and reproduction.

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.320
Like workplace performance.

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.900
Like motivation and
drive and even anxiety.

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.560
There's a very interesting
relationship between

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:42.400
hormones and anxiety and the
desire to explore novelty.

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.690
So just to remember as we go forward that,

01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:48.790
hormones affect behavior and
behavior affects hormones.

01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:49.790
But that doesn't mean that

01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:51.050
cutting off your index finger

01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:53.170
will increase your testosterone.

01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:55.980
Many of you have asked how you
can help support the podcast.

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.740
And we thank you for the question.

01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.070
There are several ways to do that.

01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:01.130
The first one is to subscribe on YouTube.

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:03.080
If you haven't subscribed to
the YouTube channel already,

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:04.330
please do so.

01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:06.060
As well, please hit the subscribe button.

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:08.440
So you're sure not to
miss any of the episodes.

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.540
We do release episodes every Monday,

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:14.440
but we also occasionally
release short clips in between.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.120
As well, if you could subscribe

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.760
on Apple and or Spotify,

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.840
that's very helpful.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.550
And on Apple you have the opportunity

01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:22.710
to leave us up to a five star review

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.410
and to leave a comment.

01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:27.290
On YouTube, please do leave
us comments and suggestions

01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:28.610
for future episodes.

01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:30.140
We really appreciate the feedback

01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.250
and we appreciate those suggestions.

01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:35.150
Also ask us any questions
you have about the material.

01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:37.820
Those questions help
guide our office hours,

01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:39.470
this discussion about your questions

01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:40.890
that we hold from time to time,

01:36:40.890 --> 01:36:43.460
as well as inform future content.

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:45.530
Also, if you could tell
people about the podcast.

01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:48.080
Please tell your family,
your friends, your coworkers

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.490
anyone that you think might
benefit from the material.

01:36:50.490 --> 01:36:52.740
That really helps us get the word out.

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.897
As well, if you're
interested in supplements.

01:36:54.897 --> 01:36:56.600
We've partnered with Thorne.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.528
T-H-O-R-N-E.

01:36:58.528 --> 01:37:00.250
And we've partnered with Thorne because,

01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:02.440
Thorne has the highest level of stringency

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.160
with respect to the ingredients

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.850
that they put in their products.

01:37:05.850 --> 01:37:09.350
As well as the precise
amounts of those contents.

01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:10.880
You know, a lot of
supplement brands out there

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.530
claim to have X amount of some supplement,

01:37:13.530 --> 01:37:15.560
but then when people have measured

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.030
the amount in capsules and tablets,

01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:18.170
it's turned out to be very different.

01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:19.570
Thorne is very precise about this.

01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:23.190
They partnered with important
and stringent institutions

01:37:23.190 --> 01:37:25.300
like the Mayo Clinic, all
the major sports teams.

01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.330
So that's why we partnered with Thorne.

01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:29.200
If you want to try any
of Thorne's products,

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.200
if you want to see what I take

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.670
you can go to Thorne that's

01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:34.660
thorne.com/u/huberman

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.000
And if you do that you can see

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.100
any of the products that I take.

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.540
You can get 20% off any of those.

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:43.840
As well as 20% off any
of the other products

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.090
that Thorne makes.

01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:48.760
So that's thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.500
Please also check out our sponsors.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.700
Check out the sponsor links.

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:54.450
That's perhaps the best way to support us.

01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:56.100
And of course, I want to point out,

01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.190
that any of the ways that support us,

01:37:58.190 --> 01:37:59.480
whether or not they are cost-free

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.980
like subscribing and leaving comments

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.230
or whether or not you're
interested in the products

01:38:03.230 --> 01:38:05.880
that I've referred to, those all help us.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.940
And so we really appreciate it.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:09.570
So once again, I want to thank you

01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:12.190
for embarking on this
journey through neuroscience

01:38:12.190 --> 01:38:15.180
and today neuroendocrinology with me.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.883
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

01:38:17.883 --> 01:38:20.466
