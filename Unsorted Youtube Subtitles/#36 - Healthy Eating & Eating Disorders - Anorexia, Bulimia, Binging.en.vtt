00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.300
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.710
where we discuss science

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.963
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.260
- I'm Andrew Huberman.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980
And I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.210
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.550
Today, we are going to
talk all about healthy

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.280
and disordered eating.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.520
And indeed, we are going to talk

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.530
about clinical eating disorders,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.150
such as anorexia, bulimia,
and binge eating disorder,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.310
as well as some other
related eating disorders.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.410
However, before we get into this material,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.090
I want to emphasize that
today's discussion will include

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.380
what it is to have a healthy
relationship with food.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.610
We're going to talk about metabolism.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.430
We're going to talk about
how eating frequency

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.700
and what one eats influences
things like appetite

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.410
and satiety, as well as whether
or not we have a healthy,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.430
psychological relationship
to food and our body weight

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.440
and so-called body composition,
the ratio of muscle to fat,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.803
to bone, et cetera.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.080
So, as we march into this conversation,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.682
I'd like to share with
you some interesting

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:09.840
and what I believe are
important findings in the realm

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.170
of nutrition and human behavior.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.400
I know these days,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940
many people are excited about or curious

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.730
about so-called intermittent fasting,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.760
intermittent fasting
is as the name implies,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.970
simply restricting one's feeding behavior,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.390
eating to a particular
phase of the 24 hour

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.250
or so-called circadian cycle.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.260
Other forms of intermittent
fasting involve not eating

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.330
for extended periods of
time for an entire days,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.210
or some people will extend to two days

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.657
or three days typically.

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:45.620
And hopefully they will drink
water during those times,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.340
sometimes referred to as water fasting,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.230
which means that they
are ingesting fluids.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.830
And hopefully they are ingesting
electrolytes such as salt,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.040
potassium and magnesium as well,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.790
because well one can
survive for some period

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.770
of time without ingesting calories,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.880
it is extremely important
to continue to ingest plenty

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.040
of fluids and electrolytes.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.940
And the reason for that is
that the neurons of your brain

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.470
and body that control your
movements, your thoughts,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.983
clarity of thinking in general, et cetera,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.420
is critically dependent on the
presence of adequate levels

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.790
of sodium, potassium and
magnesium, the electrolytes.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.700
And that's because neurons can
only be electrically active

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.500
by way of movement of particular ions,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.370
which include things like
sodium potassium and magnesium.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.600
So, without those,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.300
you can't think, you can't
function and it actually

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.640
can be quite dangerous.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.900
So, why all the excitement
about intermittent fasting?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.170
Well, a lot of the excitement
relates to work that was done

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.730
by a former colleague of mine,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.950
down at the Salk Institute
for Biological Studies

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.520
in San Diego, named Satchin Panda,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.761
Satchin's lab identified
some very important

00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:57.110
and impactful health
benefits of restricting

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.330
one's feeding window to particular
within the 24 hour cycle,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.525
or even to having extended
fasts that go for a day

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:07.023
or two days, or maybe even three days.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.080
What they saw was an improvement

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.999
in liver enzymes and improvement
in insulin sensitivity,

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.460
which is something that is good.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.160
It means that you can utilize the calories

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.150
and the blood sugar
that you happen to have,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.010
being insulin insensitive is not good,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.313
and is actually a form of diabetes.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.080
What Satchin's lab and
subsequently other labs showed,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.640
was that restricting one's
feeding window to anywhere

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.900
from four to eight or even 12 hours

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.480
during each 24 hour cycle
was beneficial in mice.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.710
And some studies in humans have also shown

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.230
that it can be beneficial for
various health parameters.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.490
However, the excitement about
intermittent fasting seems

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.490
to be related to the foundational
truth about metabolism

00:03:56.902 --> 00:04:00.410
and weight loss and weight
maintenance and weight gain,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.070
which is that regardless of
whether or not you intermittent

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.920
fast or whether or not you
eat small meals all day long,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.710
or you eat one meal in the
evening and snack up until then,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.710
it really doesn't matter in
the sense that the calories

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.580
that you ingest from whatever source,

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.580
are going to be filtered through
the calories that you burn,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.460
by way of exercise, basal metabolic rate,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.780
which is just the calories
that you happen to burn,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.080
just being alive and
thinking and breathing

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.750
and your heart beating, et cetera.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.240
And the reason why many people
will prefer intermittent

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.280
fasting to other forms of let's
just call it what it is diet

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.050
or nutritional framework is
that many people find it easier

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.060
to not eat, then to
limit their portion size.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.940
And here I'm not talking
necessarily about eating disorders.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.930
I'm talking about the general population.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.574
So, I think that's one reason
why there's so much excitement

00:04:57.574 --> 00:04:58.490
about intermittent fasting.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.650
Now, within the context
of intermittent fasting

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.900
on a circadian timescale,
once every 24 hours,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.038
you generally find two
categories of people,

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:10.990
people who prefer to
not eat in the morning,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.070
either because they are
not hungry in the morning,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.810
or because they find it
relatively straightforward

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.130
to just drink things like
coffee or water, et cetera,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.140
and push their feeding window
out to noon or 2:00 P.M.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.740
or 3:00 P.M. and then they'll eat between,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.850
say 1:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M. or 9:00 P.M..

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.300
It depends on the individual.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.540
Other groups of people find
that they are very hungry

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.860
when they wake up in the morning,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.120
they don't feel well if
they don't eat breakfast.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.420
And so they prefer to
eat early in the day,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.700
but then they limit their
feeding window such that they cut

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.650
off their food intake or
stop ingesting any calories

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.430
of any kind, somewhere around 5:00 P.M.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.300
or 6:00 P.M., et cetera.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.050
So, the duration of the feeding window

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.830
has not been broken down
into the kind of nuanced type

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.000
of information that one would really want.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.610
At least not in human studies saying,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.030
well, a six hour feeding window

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.230
or an eight hour feeding window is ideal.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.370
It really is going to
vary based on lifestyle

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.770
and circumstances, for instance,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.760
some families really want

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.330
to eat dinner together every night.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.210
So, do you want to be
the person that's sitting

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.440
there watching everybody eat?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.450
Because you're fasting
from 5:00 P.M. onwards?

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.283
I don't know.

00:06:16.283 --> 00:06:17.690
That's an individual difference.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.620
What you can start to identify, however,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.980
is that people tend to fall
into either one category.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.520
The other people who prefer
to skip eating in the morning

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.180
or people that prefer to,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.230
or managed to skip eating in the evening.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.280
And there has been no evidence thus far,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.820
that one is better or worse,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.370
at least in terms of weight loss

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.490
or overall health parameters.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.410
Now, you can imagine that some people

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.760
might eat breakfast and dinner.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.120
And indeed I have several many colleagues

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.840
in fact who just choose to skip lunch,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.840
because they're busy during the day,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.270
they eat breakfast and dinner,
that doesn't afford the long,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.090
fast associated with sleep.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.923
What do I mean by that?

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.810
Well, if you went to sleep at 11:00 P.M.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.870
and you wake up at 6:00 A.M.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.260
by extending your fast until
1:00 P.M. in the afternoon,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.880
you get quite a long period
of no ingesting any calories.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.720
Whereas when you don't eat
during the middle of the day,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.220
you are getting a fasting period.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.390
That's probably anywhere
from four to seven hours,

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.992
but it's not linked to
the longer fasting period

00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:16.220
of not eating while you
are asleep, because most,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.140
all people and I want to emphasize most,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.220
do not eat while they are asleep.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.410
But we are going to talk
about any new disorder

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.210
that does exist, where people
actually eat in their sleep.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.332
I know it sounds pretty
wild, but indeed it,

00:07:28.332 --> 00:07:31.680
that eating disorder does exist.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.170
And it has a very interesting
underlying mechanism.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.680
So, why are we talking about this?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.870
And in particular, why are
we talking about this during

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.740
an episode that includes a discussion

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.955
about eating disorders?

00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:47.955
The reason is, nobody not the
government, no nutritionists,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.970
no individual, no matter how knowledgeable

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.340
they are about food and
nutrition and food intake,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.313
can define the best plan for
eating for any one individual.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.060
I'm going to repeat that.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.500
Nobody knows what truly healthy eating is.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.870
We only know the measurements
we can take, liver enzymes,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.120
blood lipid profiles, body
weight, athletic performance,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.140
mental performance, whether
or not you're cranky all day,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.920
whether or not you're feeling relaxed,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.430
nobody knows how to define these.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.720
And these have strong
cultural and familial

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.230
and socio-societal influence.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.960
So, if you hang out with people
that intermittent fast all

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.470
day, that will seem normal.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.490
If you spend time with
people that have never heard

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.670
of intermittent fasting,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.820
intermittent fasting is
going to seem very abnormal.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.800
Now we are going to talk
about eating disorders

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.390
that really fall into the category

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.606
of clinically diagnosable
eating disorders,

00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.848
for which there's actually
serious health hazards

00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:47.852
and even the serious risk of death,

00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:51.083
we will get to that topic.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.683
But for the time being,

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:56.700
I want to emphasize a new set of findings

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.460
that I think many people
will find interesting.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.670
And at least we'll want
to consider in light

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.350
of their current nutritional
plan or pattern of eating,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.880
whether or not you're
intermittent fasting or not.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.670
And I want to cue up
an important framework

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.610
for the rest of the
conversation on healthy

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.070
and disordered eating,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.070
which includes an understanding
of thinking, decision-making

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.730
and what we call homeostatic processes,

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.680
meaning regulation of things
that are going on in our brain

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:26.642
and body and reward mechanisms.

00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:28.140
So, I'm going to return
to that in a moment,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.680
but first I want to share
with you these new findings

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.621
that were just published in
the Journal Cell Reports,

00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:35.050
a Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.960
This was a study that was
performed both in mice

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.543
and it included a crossover
study with a human population.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.630
The human population was women,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.470
but it relates to a previous
study that was also carried

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.650
out in men.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.850
I'm going to simplify this study.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.440
We will provide a link to the
full study so you can explore

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.360
it in more detail.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.190
And if you're really
excited about the results,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.160
I would encourage you to
explore some of the references

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.543
within that paper as well.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.800
What was the study?

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.800
The study looked at giving
mice or humans, two meals.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.250
And explored whether or not
putting those meals early

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.410
in the day or late in the day,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.620
had an impact on muscle hypertrophy,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.440
muscle growth and overall
protein synthesis of muscle.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.850
So, when we eat, the amino
acids from various foods

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.390
are broken down and synthesized

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.640
into different types of tissues.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.120
They can be utilized for energy,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.720
burned up for moving about
and thinking et cetera,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.370
or it can be synthesize.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.010
Those amino acids can be
synthesized into skeletal muscle.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.490
The sorts of skeletal
muscles that allow you

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.772
to move your limbs.

00:10:40.772 --> 00:10:45.772
This study explored how protein intake,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.540
which included what are called
branch chain amino acids,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.260
and amino acids, like leucine,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.400
which are important for
muscle protein synthesis.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.920
Explored whether or not emphasizing

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.870
or skewing the protein
intake toward early day

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.920
or late day was better in
terms of muscle hypertrophy.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.970
And they also looked at
some parameters of strength,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.870
like grip strength.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.940
Now mice are nocturnal.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.820
So, before you say wait,
mice are nocturnal,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.860
how did they look during the day?

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.693
And it's completely,

00:11:16.693 --> 00:11:18.380
it doesn't apply because it's in mice.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.290
Of course they knew that.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.330
And they looked during
the mice's active phase

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.880
of their circadian cycle,
which corresponds to our day.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.170
And in humans, they looked
at whether or not eating

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.460
most of one's protein early in the day,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.450
was better than if the protein intake

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.220
and the sprint chain amino acids

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.200
were placed later in the day.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.260
And yes, they had the mice
do resistance training.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.890
They did that by emphasizing
overload to one limb

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.000
of the mouse.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.570
And that actually generates hypertrophy.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.980
It's a form of resistance
training in mice.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.520
So, they don't have them weight training.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.030
They weren't doing curls
and dips and squats

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.000
and things of that sort.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.350
They were moving their own body weight,

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.700
but they skewed that
distribution of body weight

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.959
by restricting a limb and
forcing them to use one limb

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:05.570
that did indeed grow in response to that.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.510
And then in humans,

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.470
there was an exploration of grip strength.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.290
And then with resistance
training that was also carried

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.840
out through a peripheral study.

00:12:14.282 --> 00:12:16.970
Basically the takeaway from
this study was that mice

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.970
and humans can utilize amino
acids that are ingested early

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.980
in the day,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.600
better than they can utilize
amino acids ingested later

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.070
in the day in particular
toward muscle hypertrophy

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.400
and growth or maintenance of muscle,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.220
which for those of you
that aren't interested

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.970
in much muscle hypertrophy
that aren't trying

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.060
to grow your muscles.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.100
I've talked before in the
episode on building strength

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.620
and hypertrophy, that maintaining muscle,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.870
regardless of one's athletic prowess,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.612
regardless of one's age
is extremely important

00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:53.280
because loss of skeletal muscle

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.460
is one of the major causes of injury.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.293
As we age.

00:12:56.293 --> 00:12:57.126
It's one of the major causes,

00:12:57.126 --> 00:13:01.900
believe it or not, of cognitive
and metabolic deficits

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.733
as we age.

00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:04.830
So, maintaining muscle is important.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.401
Building muscle might be
important to some of you,

00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:10.350
but what they found was ingesting
protein early in the day.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.233
And these amino acids early in the day,

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:15.730
led to more muscle hypertrophy
than if the majority

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.510
of amino acids and proteins
were ingested late in the day.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.814
So, this translates to
intermittent fasting,

00:13:20.814 --> 00:13:23.910
such that if you are interested
in muscle hypertrophy,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.100
you might, and I want to emphasize,

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.040
might consider making sure
that you're getting sufficient

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.620
protein intake early in the day.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.120
What sources of protein you use,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.410
is going to be highly individual.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.710
Some of you are meat eaters.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.140
Some of you don't eat red meat.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.678
Some of you eat chicken and fish and eggs.

00:13:38.678 --> 00:13:40.950
Some of you don't, some of you are vegans.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.450
It has been shown that the
amino acid leucine is vital

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.030
for the cell growth process,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.410
including muscle growth,
because of its relationship

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.010
to the so-called mTOR pathway,

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.320
mammalian target of rapamycin.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.390
We can talk about that more if
you like in a future episode,

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.130
this means that if you're
somebody who wants to maintain

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.473
or increase the amount of
muscle mass that you have,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.940
ingesting a high protein
meal early in the day ought

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.940
to be beneficial for that.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.980
Does it mean that you
should not eat protein

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.000
in the afternoon and evening?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.833
No.

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:15.660
I think a lot of people might've
misinterpreted this study

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.173
and I don't want that to happen.

00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:19.930
This is only pointing out the fact

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.330
that ingesting sufficient
quality amino acids,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.780
including leucine, early in
the day can be beneficial

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.930
for maintenance and
growth of muscle tissue.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.050
It does not say that you
should avoid protein later

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.030
in the day.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.540
Now for you intermittent
fasters, this could be relevant.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.373
I, for instance,

00:14:39.373 --> 00:14:42.650
with somebody who for a very
long time skipped breakfast,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.050
my first meal of the day would
be in the early afternoon,

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.890
mostly protein and salad,
in my case, animal protein.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.810
'Cause that's in alignment with my values.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.600
Then in the evening I would eat pasta,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.480
vegetables, et cetera.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.410
I might have some protein,

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.400
some small piece of fish or
chicken or something like that,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.700
but I didn't really emphasize that.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.240
On the basis of these results.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.600
I am experimenting with.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.200
I want to emphasize experimenting with,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.780
I haven't completely
tossed out my old protocol,

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.740
but I'm experimenting with
eating proteins early in the day

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.060
and eating lunch.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.650
And then dinner might be
light supper of some sort,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.550
but not so much protein
later in the evening.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.240
Again, if you want to eat six meals a day,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.300
you want to eat round the clock.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.170
I'm not going to stop you.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.450
I'm not telling anybody what to do.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.283
As I mentioned earlier,

00:15:26.283 --> 00:15:29.370
nobody knows exactly how to
eat for one's particular goals.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.830
But this study was really interesting,

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.610
because it really did
show that we can utilize

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.750
the proteins that are
ingested early in the day,

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.600
better than we can utilize
the proteins that are ingested

00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:40.478
later in the day.

00:15:40.478 --> 00:15:42.900
And of course there will be
factors that can shift that.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.560
For instance, if you work out very hard

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.430
with resistance training later in the day,

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.295
resistance training is known
to increase protein synthesis.

00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:52.660
So, it stands to reason
that ingesting amino acids

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.292
after that training would be beneficial.

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:56.120
However, in this study,

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.890
it did not seem to matter when
the resistance training fell

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.533
within the 24 hour schedule.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.460
The morning ingestion
or early day ingestion

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.450
of amino acids seemed to be beneficial.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.283
How early?

00:16:07.283 --> 00:16:10.845
Between the hours of about 5:00 A.M.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.614
and 10:00 A.M. for humans.

00:16:12.614 --> 00:16:15.386
Now just a bit of mechanism
to explain why this happens.

00:16:15.386 --> 00:16:18.642
So, why would it be that
ingesting protein early in the day

00:16:18.642 --> 00:16:21.150
would lead to more synthesis of muscle

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.277
than ingesting protein later in the day?

00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:25.810
And the reason it turns out is related

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.970
to the circadian clock mechanism

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.584
that is present in all cells,
including muscle cells.

00:16:30.584 --> 00:16:32.110
So, muscles have fibers.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.420
I think most people are aware of that,

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.110
that your muscles are not
just one big blob of tissue.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.128
A lot of these little
fibers that contract.

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:41.092
Within those fibers, however,
there are cells with nuclei.

00:16:41.092 --> 00:16:46.092
Those nuclei contained DNA.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.670
DNA is transcribed into RNA.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.403
RNA is translated into proteins.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.500
The DNA of your cells,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.840
including these muscle cells

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.920
are under strong circadian regulation.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.600
Each one has a pattern of gene
expression that is different

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.060
at different times
during the 24 hour cycle,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.010
this is an unescapable reality
of all cells in your body,

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.180
right from your hair
cells to your brain cells,

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.250
to your retinal cells,
to your toe on both feet.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.970
These cells make a gene
called, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.210
is a clock gene.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.490
And the expression of
this clock gene varies

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.430
across the 24 hour cycle,

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.640
and proteins that are downstream

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.523
of this BMAL gene influence
protein synthesis.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.700
The circadian regulation
of this BMAL gene turns

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.683
out to be vitally important

00:17:36.683 --> 00:17:40.240
for this protein synthesis mechanism.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.100
How do we know that?

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.670
Well, in this particular study,

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.190
because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.860
the gene was knocked out,
they had bunch of these mice.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.400
They were able to explore
whether or not this early day

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.820
feeding effect was present or absent

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.220
in these mice that lack the gene BMAL.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.580
And indeed it was absent.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.600
In other words,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.350
the effect of increased protein
synthesis early in the day

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.183
was eliminated in the
absence of the BMAL gene.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.790
So, what this means is that
when you wake up in the morning,

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.820
assuming you're following
a standard schedule

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.630
of being asleep at night
and awake during the day,

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.080
your muscle cells are primed
to incorporate amino acids

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.670
and synthesize muscle,

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.420
regardless of whether or
not you weight trained

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.110
the night before 8:00 P.M.,

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.300
or you don't weight train at all,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.350
or you weight train afterwards or before.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.320
I said five to 10:00 P.M.
is the sort of critical

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.760
window for this increased
protein synthesis.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.229
All this means is that if you
are interested in maintaining

00:18:36.229 --> 00:18:39.263
or enhancing muscle tissue volume,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.840
that you might want to
consider eating quality,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.330
protein and amino acids early in the day,

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.220
you could train first.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.140
You could train after,
you can not train at all.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.223
That's entirely different discussion.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.770
What is quality protein,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.690
well quality protein is
going to be a protein

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.450
that includes most of the
essential amino acids.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.833
And in particular leucine.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.770
Now, there's a lot of debate as to whether

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.210
or not you can get all
the essential amino acids

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.670
from a purely plant based diet

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.503
or whether or not you need

00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:12.410
to ingest animal-based foods or not.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.330
The term quality protein

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.345
has no strict scientific definition.

00:19:16.345 --> 00:19:20.310
Some people define quality
protein as a protein

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.890
that has a high essential
amino acid to caloric ratio.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.050
Now, what that means is,
a small piece of chicken

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.970
or steak or eggs for instance,

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.700
will have many essential amino acids

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.700
with a low caloric content
relative to say beans

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.500
or plant-based food that can also get

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.810
you essential amino acids,

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.480
but it requires more calories to access

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.120
those essential amino acids.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.480
Now that's that has many
exceptions and nuances.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.340
And I for one, and perfectly
respectful of the folks

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.670
that just want to ingest
plant-based foods in order to get

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.920
their high quality protein.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.850
I think that actually can be done.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.610
One has to be careful and
thoughtful in their choices

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.660
about how to do that.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.700
So, this really isn't about animal based

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.460
versus non-animal based foods.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.280
This is about getting quality
amino acids early in the day

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.900
from whatever foods are in
alignment with your particular

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.620
values in your particular eating plan.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.640
So, that's a lot of information,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.950
but the key takeaways are
every cell in your muscles

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.360
has a clock gene.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.905
The clock genes vary such
that protein synthesis

00:20:26.905 --> 00:20:30.460
is greater early in the day
than it is later in the day,

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.370
such that in both mice and in humans,

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.130
ingestion of quality proteins
early in the day will be more

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.700
so incorporated into muscle.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.330
Than the proteins that are
ingested late in the day.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.190
And of course there are the
caveats of if you're training

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.680
hard late in the day,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.580
if you're adjusting your hormone status

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.605
through whatever mechanism et cetera,

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:54.960
protein synthesis can also
be high later in the day.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.840
But for most people it's
going to taper off due

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.510
to this circadian BMAL
gene related mechanism.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.820
Again, we will provide a link to the study

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.170
and the other key takeaways
were that nobody knows.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.270
Nobody can tell you what
healthy feeding windows are,

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.760
what the best feeding windows are.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.260
There's absolutely no
information in that context,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.260
you talk to 10 nutritionists
or academics or trainers

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.650
or individuals about
what healthy eating is,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.940
and you are going to get
vastly different answers.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.640
And that's one of the
reasons why I believe

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.090
that the internet in
particular social media,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.830
are so filled with contradictory opinions,

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.650
but the calories in versus
calories burned formula,

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.520
is that more or less holy
foundation of all things

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.245
about nutrition, eating and weight.

00:21:42.245 --> 00:21:43.580
And as we transition
today into the discussion

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.750
about eating disorders,

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.600
I'd like you to keep this in
mind because for the treatment

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.640
of eating disorders,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.222
it doesn't matter what psychological

00:21:52.222 --> 00:21:56.610
or early trauma based effects
led to the eating disorder.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.560
If the person isn't adjusting
their feeding behavior

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.070
in a way that is going to
ameliorate the symptoms

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.910
of that disorder, which
is ultimately the goal.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.440
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.360
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.540
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.210
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.140
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.230
In keeping with that theme,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.200
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.903
Our first sponsor is Belcampo,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.490
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.260
that raises organic grass fed

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.500
and finished certified humane meats.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.547
I don't eat a lot of meat, but
I eat meat about once a day.

00:22:33.547 --> 00:22:38.547
That means a small piece of
steak or chicken, et cetera,

00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:40.950
and usually a salad.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.828
I usually do that for
breakfast or for lunch.

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:46.310
And then in the evening
I tend to follow a more

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.420
or less vegetarian diet.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.420
I tend to eat pastas and
vegetables and things of that sort.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.140
Well I don't eat a lot of meat.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.158
It's important that the meat
that I eat be a very high

00:22:56.158 --> 00:22:58.740
quality and that I am certain
that the animals were raised

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.100
and treated humanely up
until the point of slaughter.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.170
Belcampo's animals, graze on open pastures

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.650
and seasonal grasses, their
entire lives resulting

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.742
in meat that's higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.

00:23:09.742 --> 00:23:12.260
It also results in healthy happy cows.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.060
Often talk about how important
omega-3 fatty acids are.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.840
They've been shown to be
important for regulating mood,

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.240
for the microbiome,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.940
for restricting inflammation in the brain

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.370
and elsewhere in the body.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.160
Belcampo's meats are known
to be high in omega threes.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.370
And given that the meat is
grass fed and grass finished,

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.770
that combines all the
features of the nutrition

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.590
and the animal wellbeing
that I want to see

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.970
for any meat that I ingest.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.390

00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:50.630
Your first order.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.670
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.040
Headspace is a meditation app.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.350
That's backed by 25 published studies

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.350
and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.583
I've been meditating for a very long time.

00:24:04.691 --> 00:24:05.970
Although I admit I meditate on and off,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.040
meaning I'll go a few weeks or
months meditating regularly.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.010
And then I tend to stop.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.970
A few years ago, I got into
a regular meditation practice

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.320
because I started using
Headspace meditation app.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.140
The thing I really like
about their meditation app

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.360
is it has meditations
of different durations.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.510
So, sometimes I'll just
meditate for three minutes

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.343
or five minutes,

00:24:24.343 --> 00:24:27.080
or ideally I'm doing two
20 minute sessions per day,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.330
but I confess I don't always manage that,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.250
but they have a ton of
different meditations

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.220
on the Headspace app that allow you

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.090
to tailor your meditation practice

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.100
to your particular schedule.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.180
And there are now a plethora
of studies showing the benefits

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.530
of a regular meditation practice.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.670
If you want to try Headspace,

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.920
you can go to headspace.com/special offer.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.850
And if you do that,

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.660
you'll get a free one month
trial with Headspace's full

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.710
library of meditations.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.543
You get them all.

00:24:52.543 --> 00:24:54.700
That's the best deal offer
by Headspace right now.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.690
So, again, if you're interested,

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.833
go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.963
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:25:03.142 --> 00:25:05.180
Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.480
and it's one that I've
been drinking since 2012.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.006
The reason I started drinking
Athletic Greens and the reason

00:25:12.006 --> 00:25:14.508
I still take Athletic Greens
is that it really helps me

00:25:14.508 --> 00:25:16.030
cover all of my nutritional
basis with respect to vitamins

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.359
and minerals and probiotics.

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:21.450
And we now know that a
healthy gut microbiome

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.170
is supported by probiotics.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.550
And for me,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.210
Athletic Greens is the best
way to get those probiotics.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.810
I also ingest some fermented foods,

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.490
but by ingesting Athletic Greens,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.790
I'm certain to get all the things I need.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.350
And also, I just feel
better when I drink it.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.170
I genuinely feel like I have more energy

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.470
and I just feel better.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.320
And I happen to really
like the way it tastes.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.220
I mix mine with some water
and some lemon juice.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.850
And in doing that, I'm certain
to get all my nutritional

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.210
basis covered and the probiotics support

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.530
a healthy gut microbiome,

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.170
which is important for mood,

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.910
regulating inflammation and so on.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.290

And they will give you a year supply

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.920
of vitamin D3, K2,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.670
vitamin D3 and K2 have
been shown to be important

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:19.180
for blood lipid profiles for
metabolism and a whole bunch

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.420
of other metabolic and neural processes.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.070
So, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.010
to get the Athletic Greens,

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.850
the five free travel
packs and the year supply

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.823
of D3 and K2.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.570
So, let's talk about eating disorders.

00:26:32.755 --> 00:26:34.120
And as we do that, I
want to emphasize again,

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.410
that nobody can really define
what healthy eating is,

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.660
with a single protocol.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.660
However, there is some general agreement

00:26:41.554 --> 00:26:44.370
about what unhealthy and
disordered eating is.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.820
There are clear criteria
in the psychiatric

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.420
and psychological communities
to define things like anorexia

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.100
bulimia, binge eating disorder,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.830
all of which we will talk about,

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.040
but as we have that discussion,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.580
I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.950
can be both a terrific, but
also a very precarious thing.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.700
We talked about this a
little bit in the episode

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.590
about depression, there's always
a temptation as one learns

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.860
about the symptomology
of a given disorder.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.190
It doesn't really matter
what the disorder is,

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.023
to ask the question.

00:27:15.023 --> 00:27:16.260
Well, do I have that?

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.006
Does so-and-so that I know have that, ah,

00:27:18.006 --> 00:27:20.724
I see this sort of behavior
or that pattern of thinking.

00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:24.687
In that individual, it's
tempting to diagnose them

00:27:24.687 --> 00:27:27.180
and or ourselves as either having or not

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.490
having a particular disorder.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.350
However, diagnoses really need
to be carried out by people

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.380
who are trained in that particular field,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.620
and that have deep
expertise in recognizing

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.460
the symptomology, including some

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.360
of the more subtle symptomology
of eating disorders.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.723
So, if any of the symptoms
resonate with you,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.350
by way of you thinking

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.180
that you have this particular
disorder or someone that,

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.000
you know, has this disorder,
I would take that seriously,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.760
but I would take that information

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.730
to a qualified healthcare
professional that could diagnose

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.430
or rule out any of these
possible disorders.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.843
I say that not to protect us,

00:28:04.843 --> 00:28:08.380
but to protect you, because
information is valuable.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.080
And I do believe that
knowledge of knowledge

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.840
can be very valuable
in navigating any topic

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.324
and improving our thoughts and
behaviors around that topic.

00:28:15.324 --> 00:28:18.840
But one doesn't want to, or I should say,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.070
one, shouldn't start to
self-diagnose simply on the basis

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.970
of information without running
that through the filter

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.750
of a qualified professional.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.990
So, what is an eating disorder?

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.243
Well, we have to take a step back,

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:35.690
and confess to the fact that
every society, every culture,

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.700
every family, and every individual

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.350
has a different relationship to food,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.780
eating disorders, however,
have particular criteria

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.750
that allow us to define them and to think

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.220
about different modes of treatment.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.380
As it relates to the particular
symptoms and particular,

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.650
the psychological and biological symptoms

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.483
of those disorders.

00:28:56.483 --> 00:28:58.329
Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended.

00:28:58.329 --> 00:29:00.923
What are the major eating disorders?

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.660
Anorexia nervosa, most commonly
referred to as anorexia

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:11.410
is perhaps the most prevalent
and the most dangerous

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.130
of all eating disorders.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.310
In fact, anorexia is the most
dangerous psychiatric disorder

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.563
of all, even more than depression.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.650
The probability of death
for untreated anorexia

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.970
is very high, and sadly the prevalence

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.930
of anorexia is very high.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.743
So, what is anorexia
and how prevalent is it?

00:29:34.877 --> 00:29:36.140
Anorexia, if you look
it up online or you talk

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.910
to a qualified professional,
is essentially a failure

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.463
to eat enough, to
maintain a healthy weight.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.030
You can see all sorts of very
troubling symptoms of somebody

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.423
who's been anorexic for
some period of time,

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.540
a general loss of muscle mass
because they're ingesting

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.580
fewer calories than they burn.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.470
Muscle is very metabolically active.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.890
They tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.060
They will have a low heart rate.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.670
This is the body and brain's
attempt to lower energy output.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.290
They will have low blood pressure.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.950
They'll sometimes have
symptoms like fainting.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.220
They will have sometimes
even hair growth on the face,

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.850
something called lanugo,

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.010
which is essentially the body's attempt

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:22.560
to insulate the body because
of loss of body heat.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.713
When you're that thin.

00:30:25.787 --> 00:30:26.900
Loss of bone density,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.880
osteoporosis, loss of
periods in girls and women,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.880
and all sorts of disrupted
gut and immune functions.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:40.040
So, there are just tons
of terrible symptoms

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.730
of anorexia that really
placed the anorexic

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:47.730
into a very risky state,
which is why mortality

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.820
from anorexia gone
untreated is extremely high.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.700
Now, one of the
misconceptions about anorexia,

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.090
is that it stems from an
overemphasis on perfectionism,

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.310
or that because of all
the images in social media

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.750
and in advertising of
extremely thin and fit

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.760
or muscular people that
individuals are looking

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.100
at themselves and comparing
themselves to those images

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.630
and thinking that they don't match up

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:16.838
and developing anorexia,

00:31:16.838 --> 00:31:21.160
that turns out to not be the case.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.920
If you look at the prevalence
or the rates of anorexia,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.270
in the last 10 years or 20 years,

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.750
and you compare that to when
anorexia was first identified,

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.140
which was in the 1600s,
and perhaps even earlier,

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.550
what you find is that rates
of anorexia are not going up.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.240
So, this idea that the images
that we're being bombarded

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.190
with are causing anorexia
doesn't seem to be true.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.170
Now, that is not to say that the images

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.569
that we in particular young
people are being bombarded

00:31:50.569 --> 00:31:52.970
with are healthy for the
psychological state of mind.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:57.280
But classically define anorexia
has existed at essentially

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:02.170
the same prevalence for the last 100, 200,

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.680
300 and 400 years,

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.600
which is incredible and really
speaks to the likelihood

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.460
that there's a strong
biological contribution

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.120
to what we call anorexia nervosa.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.860
Anorexia nervosa is extremely common.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.790
It's anywhere from one to 2% of women.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:24.060
And the typical onset is in
adolescence close to puberty,

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.960
but it can show up later in life as well.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.180
In fact, the identification
and diagnosis of anorexia tends

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.470
to be in the early '20s.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.560
But if you look back at the
history of those individuals,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.660
there were typically signs
of anorexia that back

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.630
into their early teens.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:42.063
Or maybe even before that.

00:32:43.715 --> 00:32:45.440
Now, of course, men can
be anorexic as well,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.670
but anorexia nervosa does seem
to occur at 10 times the rate

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.610
in women and young girls,

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.100
than it does in men and young boys.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.210
So, while there does seem to be more

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:01.220
of a prevalence of anorexia
in boys and young men,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.260
these days, that's probably
due to better diagnosis

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.470
and detection than it is to some sort

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:12.070
of societal shift related
to imagery, et cetera.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.180
Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.540
and some of the images
that are present in media

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.400
and social media and how those
are impacting other forms

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.233
of eating disorders.

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:23.470
But when you look at anorexia nervosa,

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.350
this failure to maintain weight,

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.320
even to healthy levels
and often drops in weight

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.840
that are very dangerous or even deadly,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.550
that has existed for a very long time,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:37.270
and seems to be somewhat
hardwired into the biology

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.600
of individuals that suffer from it.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.640
Now, when I say hard wired,

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.130
that doesn't mean that it
can't be treated or cured,

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.333
and indeed it can.

00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:48.640
Bulimia which is defined as
binge eating or overeating.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.640
Let me explain what that is.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.160
Binge eating is consuming
vast amounts of calories

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.570
in a short period of time.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.190
Overeating can be ingesting
more calories than one needs,

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.360
but over an extended period of time,

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.050
both can exist of course, but
bulimia is also very common.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.990
It's more common in young girls

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.260
and in women that it is
in young boys and in men,

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.543
but it is present in both sexes.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.950
Bulimia and rates of
bulimia might be increasing.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.420
That's sort of an interesting finding.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.320
It's not quite clear
whether or not it's existed

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.280
in its same form for a long period of time

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.790
or within other new forms that
are evolving or showing up,

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.437
we're going to drill into bulimia

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.518
and what it actually is
and what it represents.

00:34:34.518 --> 00:34:37.670
But one thing I want to be clear about,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.290
just as the perfectionist
mindset has been associated

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.303
with anorexia, and it turns
out that's not the case.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.283
It can be, but it's not always
associated with anorexia.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.960
There was the idea that
bulimia is associated

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.550
with early trauma in childhood,
in particular sexual trauma.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.720
And while that can be the case,

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.690
there's no direct
correlation between the two.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.200
Now, obviously psychological
phenomena and trauma

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.070
can have a profound impact on the way

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.170
that the brain wires up and the way

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.480
that people approach food
and other types of behaviors.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.270
But the sort of classic
idea was that all anorexics

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.780
are perfectionists, they
want to perform well.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.900
It's all about control and autonomy.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.500
And bulimics are kind of
dysregulated and acting

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.562
out against some early sexual trauma,

00:35:24.562 --> 00:35:29.562
those stereotypes of the
psychological framework

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.220
of anorexics and
bulimics, doesn't hold up.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.700
When you look at the data, many,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.990
many meta analysis have been done.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.780
It just simply is not the case.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.200
And in both instances,
both anorexia and bulimia,

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.720
there are clear biological underpinnings,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.300
to what's driving the
under-eating or the overeating.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.310
So, we're going to talk about
the biology of under eating

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.730
and overeating and
appropriate levels of eating.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.770
And by doing that,

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.280
we will start to identify
some of the mechanisms

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.630
that serve as entry
points for the treatment

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.563
of both anorexia and bulimia.

00:36:05.287 --> 00:36:07.200
And as some of you are probably aware,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.640
anorexia and bulimia can be comorbid,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.140
they can exist with one another.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.180
There are anorexics who
will binge and then purge

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.623
in order to maintain that
unhealthily low weight.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.630
There are bulimics

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.601
who fit the psychological
criteria of anorexia.

00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:26.820
And so there's a lot of overlap

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.480
between those two categories.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.430
Now let's talk about the
categorization for a second and why

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.060
the categorization has led to now a bunch

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.170
of other eating disorders as defined

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.270
by the psychiatric community.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.910
One of the classic symptoms of anorexia

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.400
is a loss of menstrual
cycles, loss of periods.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.620
And the reason for that is when
the body is undernourished,

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:52.020
the body fat stores,
send signals to the brain

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.440
to inform that the body is undernourished,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.470
or they turn off the
signals that say, look,

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.880
there are enough body fat cells out here

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.160
to support healthy metabolism.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.073
And therefore let's shut down ovulation,

00:37:04.073 --> 00:37:07.260
literally signal sent
from the fat and muscle

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.070
to the brain and the brain,

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.370
the hypothalamus and pituitary
will send signals down

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.239
to the ovaries,

00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:16.660
or they will turn off the
signals heading to the ovaries

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.930
to deploy eggs,

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.760
to maturation of eggs in
the follicle, et cetera.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.760
So, there are instances in
which people have anorexia

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:27.770
or have bulimia,

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.640
but are still maintaining
healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.990
or at least menstrual cycles.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:36.900
And that has led to a whole
set of other categorizations

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.900
of eating disorders, like
binge eating disorder,

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.070
where there tends to
be a lot of overeating,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:45.074
but not the purging or
categorizations of anorexia,

00:37:45.074 --> 00:37:47.100
in which people are under feeding,

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.010
but they are not losing their periods.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.810
And so these have a number of
different names and acronyms.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.480
Some of them include things like, EDNOS,

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.990
EDNOS is eating disorder,
not otherwise specified.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:02.413
So, that's a sub categorization or OSFEDs.

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:06.450
So, OSFEDs is or specified
feeding or eating disorder.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.580
So, right now,

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.280
if you were to look
online or you're looking

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.240
to the psychiatric and
psychological textbooks,

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.260
what you would find is that
there's a huge constellation

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.210
of eating disorders today.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.630
We're mainly going to talk about anorexia,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.420
bulimia, binge eating
disorder and body dysmorphia.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.000
You can even find eating
disorders like pica,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.100
where people actually ingest
things like dirt or rocks

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.810
or metal because they
have a genuine appetite

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:31.643
for those things.

00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:34.630
I certainly do not recommend sampling any

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.120
of those non food items.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.620
As foods, is incredibly dangerous.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.520
People often poisoned themselves.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.090
They often can cause structural blockages

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.640
some people have died from
those sorts of things.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.010
But nonetheless, there
are aspects of our brain

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.970
and biology that when disrupted can lead

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.700
to very bizarre types of eating behavior,

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.190
sometimes pica is caused by
malnutrition, but not always.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.920
And so today we're going to focus

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.020
on the most prevalent eating disorders,

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.520
but we are going to build
up toward that understanding

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.600
by looking at what healthy
metabolism and eating

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.010
and satiety and hunger looks like.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.130
Because one, I realized that not everyone

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.700
out there has an eating disorder.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.045
And two, I want people to
understand this relationship

00:39:18.045 --> 00:39:21.970
between how they think,
the decisions they take

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.090
about what they eat

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:26.650
and how the body and the
brain at subconscious levels

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.350
are driving some of these
behaviors healthy or otherwise.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.760
Because I do think that
it can lead us to a better

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.080
understanding of what healthy
eating is for most of us,

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.040
and to increase compassion and hopefully

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.080
even increased improvement in
treatment of eating disorders

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.150
for those that are suffering from them.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.230
So, what is hunger and what is satiety?

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.130
Satiety, of course being sated

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.373
or feeling like we've had enough food.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.770
I want to remind people
of the basic mechanisms

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.680
by which the brain and body communicate.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.070
This is vitally important,
not just for this discussion,

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:04.170
but for any discussion, about
how we think, how we behave,

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.680
how we feel, the body is
communicating two types

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.720
of information to the
brain on a regular basis,

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.792
but in particular around
feeding, and those two types

00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:14.708
of information are mechanical information,

00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:18.840
and chemical information.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.400
What do I mean by mechanical information?

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.200
Well, if you take a deep breath, oh,

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.240
and you hold your breath,

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.610
what you'll find is that
you can hold your breath

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:28.040
a lot longer than if
you exhale all your air

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.790
and you hold your breath with lungs empty.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.910
And the reason is not because
when your lungs are full,

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.400
you have enough oxygen

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.810
and therefore you can hold your breath.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.300
It's because when your lungs are full,

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.230
a particular class of
neurons called baroreceptors,

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.240
send information to the brain and say,

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.400
there's pressure in the lungs.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.700
And that means that there's
probably oxygen in here.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.490
And so the trigger to breathe
is actually suppressed,

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.760
when your lungs are empty.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.230
Even if you have plenty
of oxygen in your system,

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.610
those baroreceptors send a
different signal to the brain,

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.630
which is there's no oxygen in
here and you should breathe.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.470
And so the impulse to
breathe comes earlier.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.360
Likewise, when your stomach is full,

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.750
it sends signals to your
brain that are purely based

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.740
on this mechanical fullness,

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:14.060
has nothing to do with
nutrients, that says I'm full.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.730
And therefore don't be as hungry.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.500
Don't motivate to find or ingest food.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.300
Whereas when our gut is empty,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.280
even if we have plenty of nutrients

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.300
or plenty of body fat stores,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.900
we tend to focus on food a bit more.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.680
So, volume and mechanical
influences have a profound effect

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.750
on how we think.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.650
And what consider doing or not doing,

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:37.870
likewise chemical effects.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.220
When we ingest food,

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.325
our so-called blood sugar or
blood glucose levels go up.

00:41:41.325 --> 00:41:44.500
That information is signaled to the brain

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.980
via neuronal pathways
and hormonal pathways.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.450
And in particular, there
are neurons within our gut,

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.960
that signal to areas of our
brain stem that are involved

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.180
in satiety in our sense of having enough

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.440
that there's food in our system.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.530
So, that's chemical information.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:05.530
So, how our hunger and
feeding and satiety regulated

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.833
by way of mechanical
and chemical signaling.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:09.820
You have, I have,

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.310
we all have neurons in our
hypothalamus that trigger eating

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.800
and neurons that trigger
cessation or stopping of eating.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.423
We have an accelerator on
eating and we have a break.

00:42:20.423 --> 00:42:24.550
And I covered all of this in
a lot of detail in the episode

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.720
on feeding and metabolism and hunger.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.800
So, if you want a lot more
detail, see that episode,

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.633
but right now,

00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:32.110
I'm just going to give you the top contour

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.090
of how all that works.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.140
Your hypothalamus is an
area of your forebrain,

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.970
which tells you it's in the front,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.180
but it's at the base of your
forebrain sits more or less

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.440
above the roof of your mouth.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.550
The hypothalamus contains
lots of different kinds

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.970
of neurons, including neurons
that stimulate sexual activity

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:49.495
and desire, regulate your body temperature

00:42:49.495 --> 00:42:54.495
and control appetite and
ceasing of eating and appetite.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.260
There are two types of neurons
within a particular area

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.230
of your hypothalamus
that are relevant here.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:05.760
There are the so-called
POMC neurons, okay?

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.760
Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
that tend to act as more

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.620
of a break on appetite,

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.080
by way of another hormone

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.830
called melanocytes stimulating hormone.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.230
And not so incidentally
when you're getting

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.300
a lot of sunlight and you're
viewing a lot of sunlight,

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.210
that system is ramped up.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.703
This is why appetite is
lower in the summer months

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:27.480
than it is in the winter months.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.211
This is true in animals.

00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:30.880
And this is true in humans.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.060
And you have a class of neurons
called the AgRP neurons.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.730
The AgRP neurons are the
ones that stimulate feeding,

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.680
and they create a sort of
anxiety or excitement about food,

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.530
can be positive anxiety, or
it can be negative anxiety.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.490
What do I mean by that?

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.910
Well, if you ever seen kids
heading in to get ice cream,

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.230
they're absolutely excited.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.440
You see people getting raised,
sit down and eat a big meal.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.530
They're excited to eat.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.340
Sometimes that's due to social factors,

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.660
but they have an increase
in overall levels

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.569
of autonomic arousal.

00:44:00.569 --> 00:44:02.680
And depending on the context,

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.310
they can feel excited or anxious,

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.370
but it is a ramping up of energy.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.530
These AgRP neurons are what caused that,

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.556
in fact so much so that if you eliminate

00:44:11.556 --> 00:44:14.740
or kill these neurons, which has been done

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.860
in experimental mouse
models in the laboratory,

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.810
but also there are
humans that have lesions

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:22.050
or neurotoxic effects
on these AgRP neurons.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:25.008
And what you find is that
they don't want to eat.

00:44:25.008 --> 00:44:26.500
They essentially become anorexic,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.083
meaning they don't want to ingest food.

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:31.270
They have no appetite for food whatsoever.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.440
Now that's not exactly what anorexia is,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.880
but these AgRP neurons
are like an accelerator

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.950
on wanting to eat.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.640
Whereas if you stimulate
these AgRP neurons

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.580
or in humans that have
say a small tumor near

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.950
these AgRP neurons,
they become hyperphagic.

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.090
They will eat to the point of bursting,

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.820
both animals and humans
that have elevated levels

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.700
of these AgRP neurons are anxious.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.700
They want to eat,

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.680
and they will ingest food to
the point where they override

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.800
those mechanical and
chemical signals in the body.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.210
And I know it sounds
horrible, and it is horrible.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.140
They will eat until the
point that they burst.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.320
Now, there are signals
coming back from the body

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.210
to inform the brain about presence

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.130
of different levels of nutrients.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.470
And that generally comes
from three sources.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.760
First of all, is body fat.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.080
The more body fat we have,

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.790
the more we secrete a hormone
called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N,

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.350
leptin from body fat,

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:26.741
leptin goes to the brain
and suppresses appetite.

00:45:26.741 --> 00:45:30.780
This is a body to brain signaling
mechanism that says, look,

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.630
I've had enough,

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.530
not incidentally, leptin
signaling is disrupted

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.720
in people that have bulimia and obesity

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.490
and certain forms of
binge eating disorder.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:46.050
So, that system has disrupted
they have had enough signal

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.690
or there's enough body fat
here such that you don't need

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.300
to eat more right here,
I'm sort of in the voice

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.200
of the body fat, trying to
talk to the brain, that signal,

00:45:55.483 --> 00:45:56.316
that dialogue is mixed up or messed up.

00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:58.380
In some cases it's absent entirely.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.820
So, the body fat is signaling to the brain

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.820
about how much reserve you have.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.807
It's sort of like a
savings account for energy,

00:46:04.807 --> 00:46:06.560
'cause that's what body fat is.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.193
You've got lipids in there
and through lipolysis,

00:46:08.193 --> 00:46:09.500
that can be metabolized.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.404
If you're interested in that process,

00:46:11.404 --> 00:46:13.410
both how to increase it.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.290
And just generally how it works.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:17.685
You can see the episode on
the science of fat loss.

00:46:17.685 --> 00:46:20.500
The body fat is doing something
else really interesting

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.890
that relates to anorexia,

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.830
when they're sufficient levels of body fat

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.270
and leptin circulating in the blood.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.970
And that leptin signal gets to the brain,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.520
the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.500
register that signal.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.460
And in a completely subconscious way,

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.460
trigger the deployment of eggs
in females and the production

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:44.950
of sperm in males.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.180
So, when body fat stores are very low,

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.220
the reason why periods shut
off or sperm production

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.520
is reduced or even shut off
is because there's not enough

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.700
leptin getting to the
hypothalamus and to the pituitary.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.500
And they shut off the
signals, the hormones,

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.160
things like
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.400
luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone,

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.233
all these hormones.

00:47:05.233 --> 00:47:06.120
So, you don't have to remember the names

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.260
of if you don't want to
that travel to the ovary

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.860
or to the testes and
cause the ovary and testes

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.600
to ovulate or to produce more sperm.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.453
So, the reason why anorexic
stopped having periods,

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.660
while they stopped cycling,

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.060
is because there isn't sufficient
leptin in the bloodstream.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.540
Now there have been attempts
to give leptin to anorexics

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.550
because leptin has been
sequenced and the peptide

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.670
has been synthesized.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:35.262
And so you can inject leptin into people.

00:47:35.262 --> 00:47:37.520
There are studies where they've done that,

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.130
when that happens, it
does not tend to alleviate

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.404
the anorexia, does not cause

00:47:43.404 --> 00:47:44.840
people to start eating again.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.920
And that actually makes sense
because leptin is also a way

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.350
of shutting off the hunger signals saying,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.890
it's the body fats way of saying, hey,

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:52.900
there's a lot of body fat here,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.160
or there is sufficient body fat.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.990
There doesn't even have
to be a lot, but it has,

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.990
in some cases been shown
to rescue the menstrual,

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.470
cycling in some anorexics, okay?

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.810
So, body fat is signaling to the brain.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.340
The gut is signaling to the brain.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.630
There are neurons in your gut
that are primarily responding

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.410
to meaning they fire electrical signals.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.710
When there are sufficient
fatty acids coming

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.660
from fats you ingest, amino acids coming

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.370
from proteins you ingest and sugars coming

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:21.940
from carbohydrates and sugars.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.990
Things like fructose, glucose, et cetera.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.270
Those signals are being sent
from the fat and from the gut

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.010
up to the brain.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:34.380
And therefore your body
has multiple signals

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.530
of directing you toward
eating more or eating less.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.130
So, you've got two categories of neurons.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:43.070
One that acts as an accelerator,
the AgRP neuron saying,

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.853
eat, eat, and get you excited to eat.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.540
And then you have a category of neurons.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.890
The POMC neurons that
are suppressing hunger.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.000
They're acting like a break,
and the body is informing

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.670
the brain all the time about the status

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.830
of the body and whether or
not it needs more food or not.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.440
So, you might ask why is it
that people who are overweight

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.990
and have a lot of body fat,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.740
why they would continue to eat a lot,

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.260
well past a certain
threshold of body fat that's

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.657
when you start getting

00:49:09.657 --> 00:49:10.920
into these so-called metabolic disorders,

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.010
where blood glucose
metabolism is disrupted,

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:16.050
leptin signaling is disrupted
and there are all sorts

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.760
of changes on both the
brain side and the body end

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.240
of things, such that they're hungry,

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.340
despite the fact that the body has plenty

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.260
of energy on reserve.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.880
Okay, that I think is
sufficient to explain the basics

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.990
of hunger and satiety are kind
of a biological mechanism.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.910
And the important thing again,

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.710
to remember is that they're
mechanical and chemical signals

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:40.050
that come from fullness
or absence of fullness

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:41.930
that come in the presence
of glucose in the blood

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.960
or the absence of glucose in the blood.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.400
When you haven't eaten for a long time,

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.590
glucagon levels go up, for instance,

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.540
GLP1 levels go up and those will drive you

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.041
to seek out food and want food.

00:49:53.041 --> 00:49:54.670
And then there are the signals
that are coming from body fat

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.040
and from neurons in the gut.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.800
So, there's a lot of convergence,
in a lot of pathways.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.120
I don't offer you all those
pathways to confuse you.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.380
I offer you those pathways
to clarify the extent

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.230
to which something as simple
as eating or the decision

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.580
to not eat is complicated.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.020
We've perhaps heard,

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.650
or I've certainly heard
that, oh, you know,

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:18.490
it takes about 20 minutes
for satiety to set in,

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.995
so you should eat slowly that
you won't realize that you're

00:50:19.995 --> 00:50:22.520
full until about 20 minutes.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.840
That's actually not true.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.960
I don't know where that got started,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.910
but we should probably
all chew our food better

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.280
and eat more slowly,

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.820
be more mindful of what
we're eating, et cetera.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:34.240
So, in anticipation of this episode,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.310
I consulted extensively with a colleague

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:37.143
of mine at Stanford,

00:50:37.143 --> 00:50:40.640
who sadly for us is going off
to University of Pennsylvania.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.230
So, our losses University
of Pennsylvania's win.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:46.130
His name is Dr. Casey Halpern.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.840
He's a MD, Medical
Doctor and Neurosurgeon,

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.300
and a PhD who studies
binge-eating disorder

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.980
and other types of eating
disorders and how they arise

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.840
in the brain.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.106
And he's developed some

00:50:57.106 --> 00:51:00.110
really pioneering treatments for them.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.860
We'll talk more about his
work a little bit later

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.470
in the episode, but we
got to the discussion

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:09.470
of why a body that has
sufficient energy levels

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:12.517
would desire to eat more at all.

00:51:12.517 --> 00:51:15.470
And this is not just the case
for binge eating disorder

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.780
for bulimia, but why
that would be the case.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.560
You know, this is primitive biology

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.230
that evolved over many tens.

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.270
If not hundreds of thousands
of years, you see it in mice,

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:24.350
you see it in humans,

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.380
very similar types of
pathways and effects.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.690
How is it that human
beings who have plenty

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.160
of fat on reserve and plenty of glycogen

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.760
in their liver, et cetera.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.760
In other words, plenty of
energy, why they would be hungry,

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.280
why they would eat at all.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.960
It seems like that just shouldn't happen.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.450
And he had a very important,

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.550
and I think clear and intuitive way

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.400
of framing up all this stuff around eating

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.260
and motivated behaviors
and how they can go awry,

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.610
not just in eating
disorders, but in all of us.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:01.910
Basically what he said was,
from an evolutionary standpoint,

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.680
it makes sense that we should
eat as often as we can,

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.733
as much as we can, and as fast as we can.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.550
Well, that sounds crazy.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:16.370
I've was told to eat not
too often, not too much,

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:18.820
and to eat slowly and chew my food.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.010
But as Dr. Halpern pointed out,

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.230
there are circuits in the
brain to reward eating

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.170
often eating fast and
cramming as much food

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.400
into you as possible.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.223
Because from a purely
evolutionary standpoint,

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.490
food was scarce, and
seeking food was dangerous,

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:38.990
whether or not it was from
animal sources or not.

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:42.600
And it's always been competitive,
for those of you that grew

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.130
up in families with a lot of siblings.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.490
This may resonate with you.

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:46.833
I just one sibling,

00:52:48.213 --> 00:52:49.046
we were competitive about certain things,

00:52:49.046 --> 00:52:50.450
but typically not competitive about food,

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.790
but I had friends that
had a lot of siblings.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:55.620
It was really interesting to
see how food was served up

00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:00.000
and how it was taken in those households.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.500
It was like food would hit
the table and it was just

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.750
an absolute war for
portions and who got what

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.010
and how much and who got
a slightly bigger piece

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.130
of cake, et cetera,

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:14.040
turned out to be a frequent
happening in these meals

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.640
and that these birthday parties,

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:19.291
whereas the only children
perhaps were used

00:53:19.291 --> 00:53:20.860
to having more food presented
to them without having

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.456
to compete with other
members of the species.

00:53:22.456 --> 00:53:27.430
Every animal, including
humans has a hardwired circuit

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.120
that we were born with that pays attention

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.530
to how much food is available,
how much we are getting now

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.320
and how much we are likely
to get in the future.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.520
And without going down the rabbit hole

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.520
of arcuate nucleus
biology, in two sentences,

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.000
you have a hypothalamic area
called the arcuate nucleus.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.260
It's a fascinating area.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.020
It's actually the area that houses,

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.480
these PMOC neurons and
these other types of neurons

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.673
that regulate hunger and satiety.

00:53:54.673 --> 00:53:57.120
And these neurons

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.700
in the arcuate nucleus
start getting active.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.270
When we see food and think about food,

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:05.950
they drive hunger, and they drive hunger

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:09.000
in a way that's responsive
to what the food looks like,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.500
what it smells like,

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.150
but also our prior history of
interactions with that food.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:17.340
And it takes into account social context,

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.100
whether or not we are going
to get the whole pizza

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.250
to ourselves or whether or not
there are going to be others

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:24.760
that we are going to have to compete with.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.876
So, there are a lot of signals
that this arcuate nucleus

00:54:25.876 --> 00:54:29.620
in your brain are paying attention to.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.110
So, Dr. Halpern pointed
out that you actually

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.190
have an accelerator that
increases your level of awareness

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:37.570
and anxiety and sort

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.580
of constricts your field of
view and all your senses.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.070
Anytime you interact
with food and is driving

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:46.220
a primitive reflex to ingest
as much food as you can,

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.150
as quickly as you can,

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.710
and then move on from there,

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.160
and presumably to do the same elsewhere.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.387
So, that changed the way that
I think about eating behavior

00:54:56.387 --> 00:54:58.200
and eating disorders.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.570
In fact, we could think about
eating disorders like bulimia

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:03.800
as an unmasking of that mechanism

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.570
without the so-called top-down control,

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.350
without the mechanisms that we
use to regulate our behavior.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.450
And indeed bulimia and
binge-eating disorder

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:15.780
are closely associated with impulsivity

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.830
and with impulsive
behaviors of other kinds,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.820
something that we also will discuss more.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.710
What's the pathway?

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.543
How does this work?

00:55:23.543 --> 00:55:26.630
What is Dr. Halpern and his
colleagues doing in order

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.940
to try and treat things
like binge eating disorder?

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:33.940
Well, you can frame all of behavior,

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.950
good decision making
and bad decision-making.

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:39.820
In a pretty simple box diagram model.

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.750
And I realized that many of
you are listening to this,

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:42.760
not watching this.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.140
There is no diagram to look at.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.650
I'll just explain it so
that you can conceptualize

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:47.483
it in your mind.

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.610
We have knowledge of what we
should do, in one box, okay?

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.520
We should eat that.

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.490
We shouldn't eat that.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.390
We should wait for dinner.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.540
We shouldn't wait for dinner.

00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:02.050
And then we have what we
actually do in another box, okay?

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:03.580
Now this is true for all behaviors,

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.120
we should say something or
we want to say something,

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.730
but we don't, we shouldn't say
something, but we do anyway.

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:12.730
That's the knowledge that
kind of looping in your head.

00:56:12.765 --> 00:56:13.598
I should do my homework.

00:56:13.598 --> 00:56:14.450
I should go for a run.

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:15.880
I shouldn't do this right now.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.540
I shouldn't be on social media,

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.320
all those kinds of shoulds and shouldn'ts

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.690
that are circulating your head.

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:21.523
That's one box.

00:56:21.523 --> 00:56:23.170
Then there's what you actually do.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:25.580
The behavior, whether or not
you suppress the behavior,

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:28.100
you turn off your phone and
you go read a book or you go

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.530
to sleep or whether or
not you stay up all night,

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:33.530
or you stay up for another
hour, even five minutes.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:37.120
In between those two boxes
are two intervening forces.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.970
And those intervening forces
are critically important.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:44.210
Those intervening forces
are homeostatic processes,

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:46.790
called by some processes, same thing,

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:51.740
homeostatic processes,
that regulate the balance

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.230
of different systems in
your body, hot and cold,

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:58.790
awake or asleep, dopamine and
the desire to pursue things,

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:02.290
serotonin and the desire
to just relax and chill.

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:06.820
So, homeostatic processes
and reward systems.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.367
And as we now move into
discussion about anorexia,

00:57:09.367 --> 00:57:11.660
and bulimia specifically,

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:15.348
what you'll see is that
anorexia and bulimia

00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:20.220
are not a breaking of the
mindset of what one should do

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.960
or shouldn't do.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.310
It's a disruption of these
homeostatic and reward processes,

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.867
such that decision-making
is completely disrupted.

00:57:28.867 --> 00:57:31.230
And in many cases is not available

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.110
to the anorexic or bulimic.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.261
Now, I don't want to be abstract here.

00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:38.820
What I'm saying is that the
person who starves themselves

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.080
to the point where they
might die and in some cases,

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.283
sadly do die.

00:57:42.283 --> 00:57:47.210
They can know perfectly well
that their behavior is leading

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:50.023
to bad outcomes and possibly even death.

00:57:51.506 --> 00:57:53.990
And yet they are not
able to intervene unless

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:56.800
they get particular clinical help,

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.960
because the homeostatic processes,
the signals from the body

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.540
and brain that say, you need food.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.920
Those aren't registering in the same way

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.150
that they are for other individuals.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.440
and for the bulimic or
the person that suffers

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.528
from binge eating disorder.

00:58:11.528 --> 00:58:14.930
They don't necessarily
want to eat that food.

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.380
They simply cannot help it.

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.910
It's like a reflex for them,

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:22.090
because the homeostatic processes

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.740
and the reward processes
associated with food,

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.890
are such that they can't intervene

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:30.050
between the should do X, Y, or Z,

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.340
or shouldn't do X, Y, or Z.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.100
And what their actual behavior is.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:37.190
Now, this isn't just a biological
mechanistic explanation

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.660
for what could have been
summarized in two sentences.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:40.820
What this is,

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.750
is a roadmap of where interventions

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:45.420
can really make a difference.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.390
So, as we talk about different
drug based interventions

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:51.793
or behavioral interventions
or social interventions,

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:53.870
I'd like you to think

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:58.360
about whether or not those
interventions are breaking into,

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.219
or tapping into this box of the thinking,

00:59:00.219 --> 00:59:03.660
the sort of pattern of
thinking around food,

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:04.690
whether or not it's the behavior,

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:07.330
the actual ingestion or
the restriction of food,

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:09.980
or whether or not it's tapping
into the homeostatic process,

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.780
the balance of energy systems
and kind of getting enough,

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:16.960
but not too much, or it's
tapping into the reward system.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.090
And just as a little teaser
of where we're headed,

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:24.010
what you'll find based on the
data clinical data experiments

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:27.060
done very carefully and very
well by excellent groups.

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:30.240
What you'll find is the
anorexics have a sort

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.780
of switch that's been flipped,

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.440
such that their decision-making

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.160
is actually pretty darn good.

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.150
It might even be better
than yours in terms

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:41.010
of evaluating food, nutritional content,

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:43.240
but their habits are disrupted.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.690
So, they're not even
consciously aware of the fact

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:47.010
that they're making terrible.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.430
And in some cases, very
dangerous food choices,

00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:52.830
and turns out that habits.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:56.800
And the way that we build and
break and rebuild new habits

00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.560
is one of the most effective
treatments for anorexia.

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.110
So, now let's talk about anorexia,

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:02.315
this failure to consume enough energy,

01:00:02.315 --> 01:00:06.250
such that the individuals
at risk of death,

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:09.113
and if not death, then
severe metabolic disorders,

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.743
lack of bone density, et cetera.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640
As I mentioned earlier,

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.830
anorexia and things that
almost certainly were,

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:19.710
and are anorexia have
been described as early

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:20.880
as the 1600s.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.270
And maybe even earlier,

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:24.320
there are some records from the saints,

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.213
from the 1400s of people
that refuse to ingest food.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:34.250
Another common myth is that
anorexia is only the sort

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.430
of thing that you see in rich societies.

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:40.020
These are spoiled
children with so much food

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.650
that they decide they're
only going to focus

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:43.740
on how slim they are,

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.682
how they look in bathing
suits, et cetera, not true.

01:00:46.682 --> 01:00:51.080
A careful analysis through
medical epidemiology has shown

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.620
that you find anorexia even in cultures

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.300
and societies where food is scarce.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.750
So, that really speaks
to biological mechanism.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.230
Now it's hard to unveil in
societies where food is scarce,

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:04.843
because a lot of people
are starving and hungry,

01:01:04.843 --> 01:01:09.843
but there are individuals that
choose still to avoid food

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.290
and seem to have some sort of
reward mechanism that rewards

01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:16.750
them, where makes them feel
better if they don't eat,

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.790
despite the fact that their body

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:22.040
is severely depleted of nutrients.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.840
So, that's very interesting
and points again

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.590
to some disruption in
some biological mechanism.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.650
Now, I want to make sure
that I'm emphasizing

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:32.550
that I'm not in favor of people,

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:35.010
in particular young children, adolescents,

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:36.370
and teenagers being bombarded

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:39.070
with unrealistic imagery about bodies.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.760
But the idea that that's the cause of,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.210
or is amplifying anorexia,
the data just don't seem

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:49.780
to support that, anorexia
in its classic sense,

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.650
requires that there be an endocrine,

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:54.930
meaning a hormonal disruption,

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:57.530
menstrual abnormalities,
lack of sperm production,

01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:00.760
or low testosterone in
males, in order to meet

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.550
the classification for anorexia.

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:04.600
But as I mentioned earlier,

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.320
there are now nuanced and new
classifications of anorexia

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.780
that even for individuals
that still menstruate

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:15.340
or that maintain a sperm
production anorexia,

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.710
can still be considered

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:19.270
a clinically diagnosable disorder.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:22.630
Now, typically anorexia
starts in adolescence,

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:23.640
right around puberty.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.440
Let's take a look at what puberty is.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.180
Puberty at a very broad
level is the most significant

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.980
and dramatic developmental step.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.880
Anyone goes through in their lifespan.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.080
The body changes, the
brain changes, perceptions,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.400
change, one's own self
perception, changes.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.630
And most of those changes are
driven by changes in circuitry

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:45.120
within the hypothalamus.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.010
So, neurons that are
controlling the production

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.570
of the so-called sex steroid hormones,

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:50.540
things like testosterone,

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.430
estrogen, and related
hormones, prolactin, et cetera.

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:56.403
Those are all changing
at very rapid rates.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.700
Anorexia tends to show up
around this time in a subset

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.040
of individuals who on the
face of it seem to find food,

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.820
aversive, now the purely
psychological theory

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.550
of this is that they are
fighting for autonomy.

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.850
They want control.

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:14.570
Puberty is also a time in
which children and parents

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:17.240
are in a tug of war over control.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.490
You were once a small child
being told when to go to bed

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.430
sent to your room.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.860
Now you're a child that
can talk back and say,

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.210
I don't want to, or I refuse to.

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:29.250
And that happens a lot
in various households,

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.896
as I'm sure you're familiar with.

01:03:30.896 --> 01:03:33.300
Adolescence and puberty

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:37.500
is also when girls start
menstruating typically,

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.890
or boys develop deeper voice,

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:44.470
they start producing sperm, et cetera.

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:45.800
So, there are a lot of bodily changes

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.430
that also drive perceptual
changes and perceptual changes

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:49.970
that drive bodily changes.

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:53.710
And it is a dramatic
shift for a young girl

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:56.760
or boy that doesn't nourish
themselves sufficiently.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.593
During that period,

01:03:57.593 --> 01:04:00.410
there are a number of
downstream negative effects.

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:01.610
I'll list out some of them,

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:05.330
these are just a subset of
the effects, hypogonadism.

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:07.870
That's the lack of sperm production

01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:10.100
or healthy egg production.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.390
There is amenorrhea,

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.160
which is the lack of
menstrual cycling, okay?

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.710
So, a failure to have a menstrual cycle.

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:20.130
Reduced insulin secretion,
insulin is this hormone

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:23.360
that's released in order
to help shuttle glucose

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.660
into various tissues
for energy utilization.

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.330
That's down because energy
levels are down so much.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.390
One of the symptoms that's
a little more cryptic,

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:32.490
and that has actually
interesting implications

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:36.593
for sake of the cholesterol
hypothesis is that anorexics

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.450
who ingest very little
food often have cosmically

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:44.010
high levels of cholesterol, including LDL,

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.000
low density, lipoprotein cholesterol.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.480
You say, well, how could that possibly be?

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.940
We were all told and continue to be told

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.480
from many sources that
ingestion of dietary cholesterol

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.940
is what drives high levels
of bodily cholesterol.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.030
Cholesterol is manufactured
by the liver and in anorexics

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.058
who consume very little food.

01:05:02.058 --> 01:05:06.140
They often have cosmically
high levels of cholesterol,

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.570
which is one of the kind of wrinkles

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:11.580
in the so-called dietary
cholesterol hypothesis

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.610
that all of our cholesterol
that we see on a blood panel

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.979
is due to what we eat.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:19.620
But the explanation for it
is that under conditions

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.260
where there's not sufficient cholesterol

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.400
to synthesize the sex steroid hormones,

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.010
things like testosterone and estrogen,

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:27.130
which are required in
both males and females,

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.360
those are made from
cholesterol that the body,

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.840
the liver will start
generating its own cholesterol

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.233
will often overshoot the
mark to a dramatic degree.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.870
So, the blood lipid profiles and anorexics

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.210
are often very unhealthy despite the fact

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.860
that they're eating very little food.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.040
In addition, they tend
to have elevated levels

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.600
of things like vasopressin,

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.920
which are hormones that
regulate body temperature

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.160
and salt and blood volume.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.420
They tend to have low blood pressure.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.400
They can pass out.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.750
I mentioned some of the
other symptoms earlier.

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.760
In other words, there are a huge number

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.130
of terrible things happening.

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.520
Thyroid levels are down.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.500
Heart rates are down, if
I'm painting a very bleak

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.250
picture here is indeed a bleak picture.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.300
So, we have to ask
ourselves what can be done

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.592
for the anorexic, right?

01:06:15.592 --> 01:06:19.310
Let's say it's a failure
of the AgRP neurons

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:22.000
to stimulate appetite and feeding.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.230
Let's say it's too much
anxiety around food.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:27.210
Let's say it's because of
the way that food restriction

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:29.370
was used for reward in
the household, right?

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:30.203
I'm making this up,

01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:31.840
but you can imagine a
hypothetical scenario

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.840
where let's just say the mother
of a particular individual

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.110
is very vocal about her avoidance of food.

01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.300
We've seen this before, right?

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.330
You've probably seen
somebody who loves to cook

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:43.730
and prepare food, but then sits down

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.352
and doesn't seem to eat.

01:06:45.352 --> 01:06:48.013
And they always seem to in
air quotes have eaten earlier.

01:06:49.002 --> 01:06:49.930
I ate while I cooked, I
ate while I cooked, right?

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:52.850
These people that you
never actually see eating,

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:54.700
we all know people like
this, are they anorexic?

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.050
Possibly, we don't know.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.960
A child observes that kind of behavior.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.400
Maybe that individual is
being always being told how

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.190
beautiful they look or how
wonderful or fit they look,

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.600
what incredible meals they produce.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.593
And you could imagine a purely
psychosocial set of events

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.960
that could lead a child to be anorexic.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.920
That doesn't seem to be the case,

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.620
at least not in terms of driving classic,

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:24.620
anorexia, a really extreme
deprivation of oneself from food.

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:28.810
However, there is a strong
genetic component for anorexia.

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:32.800
So, you could imagine a mild
form of anorexia in a parent

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.730
that is supported or
exacerbated by praise,

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:39.830
so that the person feels
good from the praise

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:43.580
they're getting, that they
want to be a low body weight

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.480
for whatever reason,

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.350
for aesthetic reasons or for
whatever reasons that happened

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:48.470
to appeal to them.

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:52.440
And the child has a genetic
predisposition, right?

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.330
We never think about genes in
terms of controlling behavior,

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:59.650
genes, bias, probabilities
for behavior, okay?

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:01.780
So, you can have a gene for
depression of schizophrenia,

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.290
but it's not deterministic,
in the same way

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.830
that there are genes that
determine your eye color,

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:10.320
or your skin color or
your hair color, okay?

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.060
So, there's a genetic
predisposition there.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.980
And that genetic predisposition
could exist such that if one

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.380
is rewarded enough times
for a particular behavior,

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:24.060
that behavior can start to ratchet in

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.260
to our neural circuitry,

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.130
because behavior drives neural changes,

01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:28.420
so called neuroplasticity.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.340
And you could imagine that
that child could develop

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.230
a full-blown case of anorexia.

01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:36.250
And this is why I raised at the
beginning that no one really

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:38.310
knows how to define healthy eating.

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:42.550
And so therefore we have to
rely on just identification

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:43.920
of unhealthy behaviors,

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.500
but what do we point people to in terms

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.740
of what healthy replacement
behaviors would be.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.410
So, rather than just look
at anorexics and say,

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:52.460
they're not eating enough.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.710
And there's this huge
array of terrible things

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:57.270
that they're doing to their
body, and they need to eat more.

01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:59.720
We need to rescue them from themselves.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.960
Let's look under the hood.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.460
Let's look at, what's known
about the neural circuitry

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.790
and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:07.790
of the neural circuitry is driving,

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:11.790
in order to understand what
they are truly suffering from,

01:09:11.790 --> 01:09:14.200
at the level of cause ,not just symptoms,

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.910
it's clear what they're
suffering from at the level

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:18.479
of symptoms, symptoms are how we diagnose.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:21.760
I listed off a number of those things,

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.650
but let's look under the
hood and try and identify

01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:27.523
where one could intervene in theory,

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.300
in order to try and rescue the anorexic

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.450
or help the anorexic rescue themselves.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:38.180
Because it turns out that
the answer or at least one

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.210
of the answers of how to do
that is not intuitive at all.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.510
At least to me was very surprising.

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:46.120
I would be remiss if I didn't
start with the obvious,

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.020
which is, is there a chemical defect?

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.540
Meaning is there some
disruption in one of the major

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.280
chemical systems in the brain
that makes anorexics anorexic

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.534
and therefore, can we
replace that chemical?

01:09:59.534 --> 01:10:01.350
Or can we reduce some chemical

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:04.140
and essentially eliminate anorexia?

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.683
And the answer is not
really sort of maybe no,

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:11.210
here's why, there are a
lot of different chemicals

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.310
in the brain and body,

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:16.830
but there are a category of
chemicals that are particularly

01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:19.330
important that if you've
listened to this podcast before,

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:22.460
even if you haven't are
going to come up again

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.450
and again and again,

01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:25.560
and that is the category
of chemicals in the brain

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.930
and body called the neuromodulators,

01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:30.550
neuromodulators are different
than neuro-transmitters

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:33.449
in the sense that
neuromodulators modulator

01:10:33.449 --> 01:10:35.510
or change the activity of
brain areas in neural circuits,

01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:38.810
you can think of them as
microphones that are held

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:41.290
between particular sets of
connections in the brain

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:43.010
that make those connections in the brain,

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:46.870
more likely to be active
relative to others, okay?

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:48.923
They make them louder so to speak,

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.210
there are many neuromodulators,

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:52.650
but the ones that are important for sake

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:55.390
of today's discussion
are the classic ones,

01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:56.690
dopamine, acetylcholine,

01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:59.020
or epinephrin and serotonin.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.330
Let's focus on serotonin.

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:05.330
Serotonin is a neuromodulator
that tends to increase

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.590
the activity of certain neural circuits,

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.190
including within the hypothalamus,

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:14.420
but also within the body that
trigger a sense of satiety,

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:19.010
of having enough, enough
food, enough warmth,

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:21.090
enough social connection,

01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:26.090
enough of any motivated goal
or drive or any type of thing

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.500
or behavior that one would want more of,

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.693
serotonin tends to make
those circuits quiet down.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:39.180
Now, there are many categories
of drugs that emphasize

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.050
the serotonergic circuitry,
meaning they cause the release

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:45.350
of, or the efficiency of
serotonin in the brain and body.

01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:48.933
Things like Prozac, Zoloft,
Paxil, things of that variety.

01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:54.260
Those drugs have been used
to some degree of success.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:58.480
Although not much to treat
things like anorexia nervosa.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.820
That should make sense,
because if these drugs increase

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.093
serotonin, if their general
effect is to increase serotonin,

01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:08.760
it will be to lower anxiety.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.260
That sounds like a great thing.

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.320
A lot of anorexics are
really anxious around food.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.610
We'll talk about why, lowering
anxiety you might think

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:18.670
would lead to ingestion of more food,

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:23.040
but that's not often what
happens, increasing serotonin,

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.930
by way of some drug regimen will tend

01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:30.660
to make one less hungry,
because with heightened levels

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.400
of serotonin in the blood and brain,

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.830
there isn't the desire
to go seek out the things

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:37.800
that will raise serotonin on their own.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.710
Now, some anorexics do well or benefit

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.480
from these serotonergic drugs,

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.820
these drugs that increase the
activity of these circuits

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:46.847
that leads to satiety.

01:12:46.847 --> 01:12:51.090
But if you think about
the major goal of treating

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.690
an anorexic it's to get them

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:55.630
to have more hunger, more appetite.

01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:58.530
So, now I want to focus on some
of the work that's been done

01:12:59.516 --> 01:13:01.300
around the habits and
behaviors of anorexics,

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.133
because those turned

01:13:02.133 --> 01:13:05.363
out to be ideal places for intervention.

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:09.540
The work I'm about to describe was done

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.890
by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:13.810
at Columbia University in New York.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.240
And there are other groups as well.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.910
Of course, they're
doing this type of work,

01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:20.180
but they did what I think
are really some beautiful

01:13:21.379 --> 01:13:23.210
experiments and some
beautiful explorations

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:25.040
of potential treatments for anorexics.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.469
That seemed to have a quite high degree

01:13:28.469 --> 01:13:32.320
of effectiveness when they
are applied correctly.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.260
First of all, there's a
challenge in studying anorexia

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.330
because in anorexia,

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:39.420
what you're essentially
studying is the absence

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.410
of a behavior.

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:43.320
It's very hard to study
the absence of a behavior,

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.510
as opposed to a behavior.

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:47.610
So, they did some
experiments with anorexics,

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:51.670
giving them a gallery of
pictures of different foods,

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:54.120
and allowing those anorexia patients

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.400
to arrange those foods,

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.040
according to preference
about what they would select,

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.130
about food, nutrient content
about caloric content.

01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:07.140
They essentially asked these
anorexics to evaluate food,

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:07.973
and in doing so,

01:14:07.973 --> 01:14:10.870
they were able to identify
something that's very unique

01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:15.290
to anorexics at the level
of their perception of food.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.830
What they found is the anorexics,

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.400
rather than being anxious
in the presence of food,

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.253
and that anxiety driving
and avoidance of food.

01:14:23.253 --> 01:14:27.050
What they found is that
anorexics have a hyper acuity,

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:30.340
a hyper awareness of the
fat content of foods,

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.890
almost to the point of being
sort of fat content savant.

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:36.840
Now they don't necessarily
know that they're doing this.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.910
They're not looking at an
avocado and thinking, okay,

01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:40.702
that's X number of grams of fat rather,

01:14:40.702 --> 01:14:43.933
or looking at an apple and
saying, okay, that has no fat.

01:14:43.933 --> 01:14:47.120
They start to do this
more or less reflexively.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.900
Now it's a well-known symptom of anorexia,

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:53.350
especially young anorexics
that they have kind

01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:56.140
of an obsession with
food, caloric contents,

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.040
macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.940
and carbohydrate ratios.

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.269
They know caloric numbers,

01:15:02.269 --> 01:15:04.810
but then they sort of
pass that information

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:07.970
into a memory system in
their brain that allows

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:11.380
their interactions with
food, to be very reflexive

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:16.030
in a way that they are actively
avoiding high-fat content,

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:17.820
foods, calorie rich foods,

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.860
and defaulting towards
very low calorie foods.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.030
If they have to eat.

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:26.467
Now, this might seem like
an almost trivial result

01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:27.828
on the face of it, you think, okay,

01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:29.671
they don't like to eat when they do eat.

01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:30.840
They eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh,

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.010
but it's the way in which they
are doing this subconsciously

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:37.070
that they learn this
information and then they pass

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:39.200
it off to a reflexive habit.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.960
And that's very important
because what that means

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.930
is that we need to look at
what processes in the brain,

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:45.770
what brain areas,

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:49.960
what chemicals drive
decision-making and knowledge.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.340
And we also need to look
at the areas of the brain

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.340
that drive habit formation
and habit execution,

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.447
because for any of you that have habits.

01:15:59.447 --> 01:16:01.440
And that means all of you,

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.130
the hallmark feature of a
habit is that it's reflexive.

01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:06.470
You have a mosquito bite on
your leg, you scratch it.

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.990
You didn't necessarily even think, oh,

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:09.274
I'm going to scratch that.

01:16:09.274 --> 01:16:13.120
In fact, just to take a little
bit of a moment of respites

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.800
and talk about habits in general,

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.620
there's a beautiful
study that was done out

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.000
of Caltech University,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.170
looking at the parking
lot of where people park

01:16:24.241 --> 01:16:25.810
in the morning, without
designated parking spots,

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.770
and the trajectories that they
use to walk to their offices

01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:29.603
in the morning.

01:16:29.603 --> 01:16:30.487
So, they put cameras up
on the roof of Caltech,

01:16:30.487 --> 01:16:33.310
is the kind of thing that
the nerdy kids at Caltech do.

01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.390
I think at Caltech,

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.170
if you call someone a nerdy
is I think it's a compliment.

01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:38.420
So, my apologies to the
non nerds at Caltech,

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.220
I think there's one or two
of you and for the nerdy ones

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.770
of you at Caltech, you're welcome.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.100
They videotaped the
behaviors of these faculty

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.463
and students and staff.

01:16:48.839 --> 01:16:51.040
And what they found, is that
people follow trajectories

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.730
from their car that are
remarkably stereotype.

01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:56.770
First of all, they tend to
park always in the same spot.

01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:59.010
If they can, they tend
to get out of their car.

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:00.240
Of course, 'cause they're
on the driver's side

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.070
or passenger side in the same place.

01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:04.850
They turn and pivot their
body at approximately

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:05.683
the same rate every day.

01:17:05.683 --> 01:17:06.970
They close the door,

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:08.530
they've put their bag on their shoulder

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:09.570
or across their chest,

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:12.118
or however it is that
they carry their briefcase

01:17:12.118 --> 01:17:12.973
or whatever it is.

01:17:12.973 --> 01:17:15.140
And they follow trajectories onto campus

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.770
that are so stereotyped.

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:18.610
That you'd wonder if you just trace line,

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:19.530
after line after line.

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:23.730
What you'd find is that every
day is almost exactly the same

01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:24.950
and you do this too.

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:27.990
You don't realize it because
if you're being videotaped

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:30.130
in this kind of behavior, it's
not being released to you,

01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:33.200
but your behaviors are so
stereotyped to the point

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.440
where if you were to see them
laid out in front of you,

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.100
in kind of diagrammatic
format of the lines

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:40.410
and the trajectories that you
follow throughout the day,

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:42.550
the lifting of your mug and how frequently

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:43.630
you drink each hour,

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:47.810
you would be amazed and
probably a little bit scared

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:50.553
by how much of a robot we all are.

01:17:50.553 --> 01:17:54.720
Now that robotic aspect of
our neurocircuitry is vital,

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.000
because it's what allows us
to think about other things

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.830
and do other things, and
drive other behaviors.

01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:03.080
But the work of Dr. Steinglass
and colleagues showed

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.300
that in the case of the anorexic,

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.710
those habits are exactly
the place where things start

01:18:08.710 --> 01:18:10.000
to go awry.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.740
And that drive this very
dysfunctional under-eating behavior

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.150
that sadly often leads to death

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:18.600
or certainly bad medical outcomes.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.660
And it turns out that the
brain areas associated

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.280
with habit formation and execution

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.650
are the best point of intervention.

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:28.920
So, what Dr. Steinglass
and colleagues did,

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.020
is they took anorexics and they
of course had control groups

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.210
and they put them in an FMRI scanner,

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:39.070
which are these brain scanners
that allow you to evaluate

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:42.430
which brain areas are active,
during particular tasks.

01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.280
And because when you're
in one of those scanners,

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.990
you actually, you know,

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:47.220
I've actually been in one of these things.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.030
You're biting down on a
bite bar and you're most

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:52.560
of the time and most all of
these scanners you're immobile.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.150
So, you're looking at
things on a TV screen.

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:57.000
Sometimes you can press
buttons to select choices

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.929
and so forth, but you can't
really eat within those things.

01:18:59.929 --> 01:19:04.929
What they found was that
reward based decision-making,

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.040
the drive to pursue a
particular food or the drive

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.480
to perform a particular task,

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.250
which is a lot of what
we do throughout our day,

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.790
that was controlled by a brain area called

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:19.210
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.830
Let me simplify a little bit of this,

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:23.530
but I'm going to simplify it
by giving you a little detail,

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:25.030
because it's the Huberman Lab Podcast.

01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:27.290
And I believe in mechanism,

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:29.710
mechanism is the way that
you get true understanding

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:34.100
and that you can then be
very quick and give overviews

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.250
of things, but you need the mechanism.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:41.250
So, you have reflexes and
you have neural processes

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.940
that include what are called duration path

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.770
and outcome type processes,

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:49.910
a duration path, outcome type process,

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.130
we can shorten with DPO.

01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:57.130
DPO is for all types of
goal related behaviors.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.170
So, for instance,

01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:00.750
if you want to get a
particular grade on an exam,

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:02.590
you want to learn something,
you want to complete a workout.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:05.280
You want to go to the grocery
store and pick some stuff up

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.490
and then head home.

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:08.290
You're going to think duration.

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:09.430
How long do I have, okay,

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.180
do I have 45 minutes to get to the store?

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.841
How long does it take to
get to the store path?

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.500
Which way am I going to drive there?

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.050
Which way am I going to navigate
through the grocery store,

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:19.470
outcome, was able to get
in and get the items I need

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:21.010
and get home in time, okay?

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:22.650
DPO, duration path outcome.

01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:24.167
It's a very conscious process.

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:27.470
You tend to take into account
different criteria related

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.560
to what's preventing
you from accomplishing

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.393
what you want to do

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:34.460
and what's helping you or assisting you.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.293
So, of course,

01:20:35.293 --> 01:20:36.540
as you get to the checkout
line in the grocery store,

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.180
you're going to select the
shortest line for instance.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.410
So, that's all DPO stuff.

01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:42.800
It requires decision-making
and it's reward-based,

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.570
you use these DPO type
processes in the short term

01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:50.250
to pick up groceries and pick
a line at the grocery store

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.867
and decide which trajectory to take home.

01:20:52.867 --> 01:20:56.920
And you use them for navigating
long extended processes

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.110
in life, trying to get a
degree or raise children

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:03.700
or get through a particularly
challenging year, et cetera.

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.270
So, duration path outcome,

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:09.431
and that entire process
relies on your fore brain.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.581
This prefrontal cortex,

01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:13.870
the prefrontal cortex is what allows you

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:15.530
to take information from memory,

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:18.270
combine it with information
about what's happening

01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:21.990
in the present context, and
then to direct your behavior,

01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:25.680
your speech, et cetera,
toward particular outcomes.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.280
And if all that sounds
like a mouthful, it is,

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.010
and it's very metabolically demanding,

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:33.220
decision-making is
metabolically demanding.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.123
It takes effort, okay?

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.100
Reflexes on the other hand,

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.560
don't involve the prefrontal
cortex in the same way,

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.629
habits and reflexes.

01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:45.850
Like once you know how to
walk, you get up and you walk,

01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:48.392
you don't have to think
about right foot, left foot,

01:21:48.392 --> 01:21:49.225
right foot, left foot.

01:21:49.225 --> 01:21:50.058
You just do it.

01:21:50.058 --> 01:21:51.850
That doesn't rely on prefrontal cortex.

01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.880
It's subconscious as
it's sometimes called,

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.890
but basically you don't have
to use the parts of the brain

01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:58.440
that are involved in duration path

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.410
and outcome type analysis.

01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:03.360
Okay, so, in this particular study,

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.940
they examined brain activity in anorexics

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.940
who are selecting different foods.

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:10.940
And as I mentioned earlier,

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.510
they have a hyper acuity or
awareness of which foods contain

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.460
more or less calories than other foods

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.100
and what the fat content
of particular foods is,

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.363
in particular, et cetera,

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.310
they're doing all this while in a scanner.

01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:28.340
And then they look at
what sorts of brain areas

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:31.720
are active after that task is done.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.670
And what they found
was really interesting,

01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:36.360
what they found was that the
dorsal lateral prefrontal

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:41.360
cortex not surprisingly is
involved in the decision-making

01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:44.140
and the evaluation of this food,

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.850
which foods are going to be
best to eat in this context,

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:51.290
which foods are going to
be appropriate for at least

01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:54.420
that anorexics framework
about what's okay to eat

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.349
and what's not okay to eat and how much.

01:22:56.349 --> 01:23:01.349
However, there are areas of the
brain that were active after

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:03.690
that decision-making process.

01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:06.730
And those are the brain
areas that turn out to drive

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.410
the habit of avoiding particular foods

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:11.480
and approaching other foods.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.313
And in that case,

01:23:12.313 --> 01:23:14.284
it wasn't the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.

01:23:14.284 --> 01:23:15.930
It was an area of the brain called

01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:17.676
the dorsal lateral striatum.

01:23:17.676 --> 01:23:20.970
Now the striatum is a
big area in the brain.

01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:23.090
It's involved in a lot
of different things.

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:25.113
It includes areas like
the caudate and putamen.

01:23:25.113 --> 01:23:27.810
And I just want to mention, as
I throw out all these names,

01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:29.840
you do not need to remember the names

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.850
of these different structures.

01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:31.683
They're just there,

01:23:31.683 --> 01:23:33.960
if you are interested
in that level of detail,

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.170
but basically you have a
brain area and anorexics

01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:38.230
have a brain area that's
involved in evaluating

01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:39.770
and decision-making around food.

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:42.170
And then another brain
area that's involved

01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:45.950
in the reflexive consumption
of particular foods

01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:49.013
and the reflexive
avoidance of other foods.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.370
If you remember way back at
the beginning of the episode,

01:23:54.346 --> 01:23:55.310
I feel like that was a long time ago now.

01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:58.580
When we talked about how you
have these sorts of processes

01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.413
in the brain,

01:23:59.413 --> 01:24:01.610
but there are always homeostatic

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:05.380
and reward systems influencing
this kind of thing.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:08.910
Well, in the brain of the anorexic,

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:12.760
it turns out that the reward
systems have been attached

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.040
to the execution of habits
in a way that is unhealthy

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.280
for body weight,

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.650
but at least from a purely
neural circuit perspective,

01:24:21.650 --> 01:24:25.580
the reward is now given this
chemical reward in the brain,

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:29.570
is given for avoiding particular
foods and only approaching

01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:33.430
these very low calorie, low fat foods.

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:37.320
So, there really does seem
to be a flip in the switch,

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.500
in the anorexic brain that
rewards them internally.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.940
They feel good when
they avoid certain foods

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.370
and they approach others.

01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.840
So, it's not a deprivation based model

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:51.364
where they are flagellating
themselves or masochistic

01:24:51.364 --> 01:24:55.560
or actively avoiding food in
order to punish themselves,

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.690
which is interesting because a
lot of psychological theories

01:24:57.690 --> 01:24:59.120
support that idea.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.120
Rather, once this transitions
into a set of habits,

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.460
they are actually getting
a sense of reward.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.540
They feel good, presumably
from the release

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.153
of a different neuromodulator
called dopamine,

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:16.400
by approaching foods that are
low fat, low calorie content.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.070
And so their whole brain circuitry

01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:21.070
is skewed toward avoiding
particular things.

01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:24.640
And they actually are rewarded
for that, and they feel good.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.790
They feel better than if they were eating

01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:28.933
in a healthy weight supporting way.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.440
Now the dorsolateral
striatum is a structure

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.100
that we should think about
in a little bit more depth.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.810
It's part of a set of
circuits that are involved

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:40.870
in what are called go no-go tasks.

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:42.130
And I don't want to go into this in a lot

01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:43.130
of detail right now,

01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:45.290
because it would take us too far down

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:47.448
the rabbit hole of neurocircuitry.

01:25:47.448 --> 01:25:51.910
But basically in terms of behaviors,

01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:55.390
we both have DPO type behaviors.

01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:57.800
So, decision-making,
reward based behaviors.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:02.250
And we have habits that
we learn and we acquire.

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:05.480
And then we just start to
reflexively, things like walking,

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.730
things like yawning when we're tired,

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.550
things like taking a particular route

01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:11.160
through the parking lot, right?

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.660
We learned that the first time
we go to a given parking lot

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.493
and walk into a building.

01:26:14.493 --> 01:26:15.630
But after that, we tend to follow

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:19.092
the exact same trajectory
becomes very automatized.

01:26:19.092 --> 01:26:22.270
It's just like, we just
do it without thinking.

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:27.270
Well, the go no-go
circuitry is another aspect

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:28.813
of our behavior,

01:26:28.813 --> 01:26:31.315
where we both have to
select behaviors to perform.

01:26:31.315 --> 01:26:34.830
And we have to select
behaviors to suppress.

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:39.830
And the anorexic brain
seems to reward suppression

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.290
of one set of behaviors,

01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:45.073
ingestion of high calorie
foods, and to reward focus,

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.440
or even hyper-focus and
consumption of low fat,

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.030
low calorie foods.

01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:54.280
So, this homeostatic process that we learn

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.270
about from like high school onward,

01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:58.190
that, oh, everything in
your body is designed

01:26:58.190 --> 01:26:59.720
to keep everything in balance.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.280
You stay awake for a
certain amount of time.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.190
You want to sleep, you
don't eat for a while.

01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:05.060
Then you want to eat to
maintain weight, right?

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:05.893
You eat too much.

01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:07.150
Then you want to eat less.

01:27:07.150 --> 01:27:09.300
Those systems are disrupted.

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:13.239
And so what's so beautiful about this work

01:27:13.239 --> 01:27:16.770
from the Columbia group,
is that what it says

01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:20.780
is the place to intervene
has to be the habit.

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.300
This stuff has already passed
through all the learning,

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.260
it's passed through
all the reward systems.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.270
It's clearly not being overrun
by the homeostatic processes

01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:29.103
of the body.

01:27:29.103 --> 01:27:30.118
There's very little body fat.

01:27:30.118 --> 01:27:31.640
There's no leptin,

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.970
whatever neurons in the brain
respond to leptin are starved

01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:37.400
for leptin, periods of
shutdown, sperm production,

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.080
and testosterone is lowered.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.280
Bone density is down.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.380
Clearly, this is overriding all
those homeostatic processes,

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.240
all the signals that
would say eat, eat, eat.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.650
Those don't matter in the
brain of the anorexic.

01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:53.770
In the brain of the anorexic
is just performing habits

01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:55.540
and they're being rewarded for it.

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.550
So, when you come along and say, look,

01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:59.700
you should really eat this
whole pie or this whole pizza

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.730
you'll feel better.

01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:02.188
That's how she aversive to them.

01:28:02.188 --> 01:28:04.570
So, since it appears to be a habit,

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:08.700
a reflex that's perpetuating
the anorexic phenotype.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.610
As we say, in science,

01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:12.510
it's perpetuating anorexia
in this individual

01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:15.020
and telling them about
all this terrible stuff

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.200
that's happening in their body won't work,

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.070
taking them away from all the images

01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:21.060
of thin people online, et cetera.

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.610
That's not going to work.

01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:24.040
What's going to work.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.370
What's going to work is intervening
in the neural circuitry.

01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:29.193
That's related to the habit itself.

01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:31.917
And it turns out that
there are ways to do that.

01:28:31.917 --> 01:28:33.840
So, how do you break a habit?

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.630
How do you rewire the brain circuitry

01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:37.600
that's literally causing a reflex?

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.230
And in this case causing a reflex

01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.640
that is killing the individual,

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:44.733
or at least leading to
very bad health outcomes.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.710
The way that you do that is
through a cognitive mechanism

01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:51.540
where you teach the individual,

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.820
what is leading up to the habit?

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.450
This is a little bit similar
to the way that somebody

01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:59.080
who suffers from addiction starts to put

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.333
in different constraint type behaviors,

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.340
constraint type behaviors,

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:05.560
are the sorts of things
like where the alcoholic

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.800
will call a hotel ahead
of time and say, listen,

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.800
I want the mini bar taken out of the room.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.710
I don't want a television
in the room, et cetera,

01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:14.170
constraint type behaviors.

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:17.100
Those are really ways of keeping oneself

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.710
from the temptation.

01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:20.010
But with these habits,

01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.330
they work at such a subconscious level.

01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:26.277
That what seems to work best
is a combination of teaching

01:29:26.277 --> 01:29:29.960
the individual about their internal state

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.770
and how to register their internal state.

01:29:31.770 --> 01:29:33.390
What we call interoception this ability

01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:35.490
to perceive your internal state,

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:38.050
so that they can start to learn,

01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:41.750
to associate the interactions
with different types of food,

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:44.880
with the sorts of cues that are
occurring within their body,

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.720
quickening of heart rate,

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.850
hyper acuity of focus that
we talked about earlier.

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:52.010
Once they start to be able
to notice that those things

01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:55.000
are happening, then they
can start to intervene.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.940
So, let's talk about what
those things are that lead

01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.943
into a habit,

01:29:59.929 --> 01:30:02.290
because those turn out to
be the exact points of entry

01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:06.000
for changing and eliminating
and rewiring habits,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.550
to a more healthy behaviors.

01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:11.304
And I should highlight that
this isn't just about rewiring

01:30:11.304 --> 01:30:12.340
habits for sake of the anorexic.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.080
These are also the same types
of mechanisms that one would

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.280
want to incorporate in
order to rewire any habit

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.430
of any kind.

01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:21.205
There are two main features of thinking

01:30:21.205 --> 01:30:25.363
that go into the sorts of
habits that anorexics execute.

01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:29.490
The first is something called
weak central coherence.

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:32.480
Weak central coherence is
essentially an inability

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.010
to see the forest through the trees.

01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:38.010
It's a hyper acuity and focus on details

01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:39.040
within a given environment.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:42.660
And there's actually an
interesting probe test for anorexia

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:46.470
that involves something akin
to kind of a where's Waldo type

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:50.140
of puzzle, where an image is put up.

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.210
The one that I saw was one

01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:54.110
in which there is a big
array of coffee beans.

01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:55.650
Actually, they're all brown coffee beans.

01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:59.690
And your job is to identify
where in that array

01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:01.550
of coffee beans, there's a face.

01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:03.710
And indeed there's a
face embedded in there.

01:31:03.710 --> 01:31:04.990
It looks a little bit like a coffee bean,

01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:06.600
but once you see it,
you realize it's a face,

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.060
not a coffee bean.

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:11.963
And it becomes very hard to
not notice the face after that.

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:17.270
Anorexics, are very good
at identifying the face.

01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:21.190
They find it much faster
than do non-anorexics,

01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:22.970
which is really interesting, right?

01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:25.280
They somehow are able
to hone in on details

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.000
and find those details and
fixate on those details.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.050
Now eventually, most, if not
all people find the face,

01:31:32.050 --> 01:31:35.840
but once you do what you will
find and what everyone finds

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.550
is that you can't unfine
the face, it just jumps out.

01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:40.570
So, what essentially
you've lost is the ability

01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:42.360
to see the whole picture,

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.540
because there's some
detail within that picture

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:46.230
that you're obsessed by.

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:47.480
So, this has kind of elements

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.900
of obsessive compulsive disorder,

01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:51.813
but it's not really obsessive
compulsive disorder per se.

01:31:53.278 --> 01:31:55.787
So, we call that weak central coherence.

01:31:55.787 --> 01:31:58.530
It's a hyper acuity on
one particular feature.

01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:00.240
You miss the big picture.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.240
The other is a challenge in set shifting

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.060
that once you identify something

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.410
that's of particular interest
and that's driving some sort

01:32:08.573 --> 01:32:09.870
of reward, for the anorexic

01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:12.950
that would be identifying the
high-fat foods or identifying

01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:16.220
the one food on the table that
one could eat without anyone,

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:19.670
hopefully noticing that they're
eating just the green beans

01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:21.440
and not touching any of the other food.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.680
If you ever had a meal with an anorexic.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.450
You might be familiar with this.

01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:27.120
It's kind of uncomfortable to be around.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.740
Actually they go through a
lot of elaborate procedures

01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.530
to kind of hide food too.

01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:32.790
They'll sometimes even chew food,

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.640
hold it in their mouth and
then go to the bathroom

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.410
and discard it things, very elaborate,

01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:38.147
very troubling types of
things to hear about,

01:32:38.147 --> 01:32:38.990
and to be around.

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:40.360
But you'll notice that they push food

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.440
around their plate a lot.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.830
They become masterful actually at trying

01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:46.760
to keep people's awareness
away from what they're doing,

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.330
which is to hone in on these
low fat, low calorie foods.

01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:51.830
And they can't seem to set shift.

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:54.850
They can't just relax and enjoy
the meal, because the meal

01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:58.220
for them is essentially
like this where's Waldo

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.240
or find the face in the
coffee being tasked.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.590
They're constantly monitoring
how much people are observing

01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:05.730
them and trying to navigate this.

01:33:05.730 --> 01:33:08.280
What would otherwise be a
really pleasant circumstance

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.130
for most people they're trying to navigate

01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:12.100
through this because remember for them,

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.970
the reward is in the
avoidance of certain things

01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:17.410
and the acquiring of only the foods

01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:19.160
that their brain rewards them for,

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.260
because those are the foods
that have been preselected

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.299
and are now habit.

01:33:22.299 --> 01:33:25.250
What's amazing.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:28.010
And frankly also important
are these findings

01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:31.650
that once you teach anorexics,
what's happening to them,

01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:34.702
that they're doing this,
they are able to intervene.

01:33:34.702 --> 01:33:37.240
Now they need support, right?

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.934
And another form of therapy
that seems to work well

01:33:39.934 --> 01:33:43.320
for anorexics that ideally is combined

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.010
with this habit rewiring,
is a family-based model.

01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:50.600
Family-based models are
starting to surface a lot now

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.430
in various therapy settings,

01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:55.390
therapy based models
in short are basically

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:57.890
where the entire family is made aware

01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:59.540
of the individual's challenges

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.030
with a particular eating
disorder or other disorder.

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:05.080
And in understanding some of
the biology and psychology

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.430
around it, they stopped
condemning the individual.

01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:12.010
They start to support that
individual through queuing them

01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:13.690
towards their own habits
that they observe.

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:14.960
They give them some autonomy.

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.220
They realize that none of
this changes overnight,

01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.580
but they're taught about
things like neuroplasticity

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.160
and the ability to change one's brain

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.480
in response to experience.

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.550
And so there's a whole
internal support network.

01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:27.400
Now, for people that live alone,

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.670
this isn't available to them.

01:34:28.670 --> 01:34:29.790
This isn't the kind of
thing that you share

01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.623
with your coworkers.

01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:33.520
You might involve a
close friend or a spouse,

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:36.630
but it's not the sort of thing
that people that don't live

01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:39.913
in a family context can
really benefit from.

01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:43.080
All of these things
fall under the umbrella

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.940
of cognitive behavioral therapy.

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.340
And I should mention that
cognitive behavioral therapies

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:51.030
are often done in conjunction
with pharmacologic therapies.

01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:54.100
I think that there's this idea
out there that it's either,

01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.120
or when often it's both.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.600
So, cognitive behavioral are
often combined with this habit

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.830
recognition and rewiring approach,

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:04.940
which is starting to become
more and more common.

01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:07.520
And I think the date on
it looked really good

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.830
that especially when it
individuals are taught this early

01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:16.242
in adolescence, that there are
positive outcomes over time,

01:35:16.242 --> 01:35:19.020
the relapse rate of
anorexia is quite high.

01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:21.850
It's about 50% of individuals
will relapse at some point

01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:24.400
often triggered by a
stressful life circumstance.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.570
But the combination of
cognitive behavioral therapy

01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:28.984
that includes this family model,

01:35:28.984 --> 01:35:31.870
or at least habit reformulation seems

01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:33.410
to be fairly effective.

01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:36.100
And at present might be the
most effective treatment.

01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.620
Now there are additional
treatments starting to surface,

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:40.530
and that takes us into the realm

01:35:40.530 --> 01:35:42.790
of chemical treatments for anorexia.

01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:46.710
And I just want to mention
that there are clinical trials,

01:35:46.710 --> 01:35:48.790
meaning legal clinical trials being done

01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:51.100
at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine by Matthew Johnson

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:55.530
and others, exploring how drugs like MDMA,

01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:58.930
which increases dopamine and
serotonin to very high levels

01:35:58.930 --> 01:36:02.020
or siliciden so-called magic mushrooms,

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.550
which increases serotonin
and other compounds

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:07.350
to very high levels within the confines

01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:11.340
of a professionally supported
therapeutic environment

01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.430
can help people rewire their brain,

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:16.020
such that they can get
relief from major depression

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.410
and various forms of trauma.

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:20.930
And now eating disorders
are also being explored

01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:24.990
in the context of MDMA and
siliciden clinical trials.

01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:28.700
I do want to emphasize that
those are clinical trials,

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.750
that those compounds are not yet legal.

01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:35.020
And in many cases, most
cases they are still illegal.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:37.890
I do not think that
they should be explored

01:36:37.890 --> 01:36:42.200
without a properly trained medical doctor,

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.220
that the clinical trials are
essential to complete before

01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:48.540
one explores those
compounds in particular,

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.450
because lately I get a lot of
emails about these compounds.

01:36:51.450 --> 01:36:53.980
People telling me that they've
had amazing experiences

01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:56.580
and relief from various things,
not just eating disorders,

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.240
but depression, et cetera.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.590
However, I get an equal number
of emails from people saying

01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:05.129
that they worked with
some self appointed guide.

01:37:05.129 --> 01:37:07.860
This would be outside the
clinical trials I was referring

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:12.180
to, and they are now experiencing
chronic visual, snow.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.000
They're getting genuine
visual field deficits.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.060
They are havering ticks that
they have never had before,

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:19.290
they have chronic insomnia.

01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:22.860
So, I'm not passing judgment
on any of these compounds

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:24.510
or the people that are
doing this sort of thing.

01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:26.750
I just want to see the clinical data.

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:29.140
And I do believe that we should
wait until these clinical

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:32.583
trials are done before people
start approaching the stuff.

01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:36.700
And that's because they
are serious compounds.

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.285
They can open plasticity,

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:41.599
but whether or not they work quote unquote

01:37:41.599 --> 01:37:43.730
for different types of eating disorders

01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:47.840
or depression and trauma, the
data are looking promising,

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.150
but that the clinical
trials are still not done.

01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:52.400
And I know a number of people
are going out of the U.S.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.010
and into other countries
where this stuff is being done

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:56.860
more regularly and there too.

01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:58.830
I've gotten reports back of people doing

01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:00.600
so-called ibogaine treatments.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.930
Some of you who are familiar
with eating disorders

01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:05.340
will immediately be asking,
well, what about ibogaine?

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.624
Does it work?

01:38:06.624 --> 01:38:07.457
Does it work?

01:38:07.457 --> 01:38:10.850
Well, the clinical trials in
this country are not complete.

01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:12.600
I've heard evidence direct.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.950
I've heard directly from
people who have benefited

01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:19.480
from the sorts of things, for
treatment of eating disorders.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.130
But I've also heard of people
that have developed chronic

01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:25.650
seizure disorders from
pursuing things like ibogaine

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.480
for the treatment of eating disorders.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.880
So, again, I'm not passing judgment.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.740
I would just like to see more data.

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:35.490
And it's very important
that the safety aspects

01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:36.610
of safety be in place.

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:39.328
So, this is definitely not
something to get renegade about.

01:38:39.328 --> 01:38:42.990
So, it appears that once
anorexia has established

01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:46.000
that habit breaking through self-awareness

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.340
of what the habits are,

01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.550
is going to be a primary entry point.

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:52.023
That might seem kind of trivial.

01:38:52.023 --> 01:38:53.706
You might say, well,

01:38:53.706 --> 01:38:55.100
could you have just told
us that in one sentence,

01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:58.260
but I want to return us to this model

01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:01.863
about homeostatic processes,
reward, processes, et cetera.

01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:06.250
That leads us to a place
where the short answer is no,

01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:09.160
you can't simply say break the habit.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.300
An individual needs to be informed

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.877
about where that habit comes from.

01:39:12.877 --> 01:39:15.590
And the fact that what currently seems

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:20.290
like a rewarded habit should
actually be a punished habit.

01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:22.550
Now, I don't mean by actual punishment,

01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:24.599
but what I mean is within the brain,

01:39:24.599 --> 01:39:27.042
there's been a switch
and the anorexic needs

01:39:27.042 --> 01:39:30.870
to learn that there's been a
switch such that what should

01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:34.130
be rewarding is now punished
and what should be punished.

01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:35.923
Starvation is now rewarded.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.770
The beauty of being a human
being is that knowledge

01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:44.593
of knowledge can allow you
to make better decisions.

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.553
I'll say that again,

01:39:46.553 --> 01:39:48.530
the beauty of being a human
being is that knowledge

01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:51.020
of knowledge can allow you
to make better decisions.

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:55.610
Now, of course, when we are
anxious, when we are tired,

01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:58.400
when we are intoxicated,

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.790
we have less access to that
ability to use knowledge

01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:03.760
of knowledge, to intervene.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.990
The anorexic will often do
things that are in keeping

01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:09.220
with their habits, such as overexercising.

01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.580
This is a area that anyone
who's treated anorexics

01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:15.150
or interacted with
anorexics is well aware of,

01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:17.260
that they are constantly moving.

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.590
They're constantly on the treadmill.

01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:19.680
They're constantly running.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.220
They always want to be
moving and burning calories,

01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:24.340
so that they can feel
okay about interacting

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:27.295
with food or because they
have the distorted body image.

01:40:27.295 --> 01:40:30.980
Well, does breaking a habit mean

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.360
that they should stop moving
around and exercising?

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.860
No, not necessarily.

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.830
There's some really
interesting studies that show

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:40.858
that shifting anorexics towards activities

01:40:40.858 --> 01:40:44.960
that for instance, build
muscle resistance training

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.090
and allow them to eat a bit more food

01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:51.700
without necessarily losing weight,

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.770
but rather to put more
muscle on their body

01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:56.722
can actually be beneficial.

01:40:56.722 --> 01:40:58.790
Now I'm not talking about
anorexics becoming bodybuilders,

01:40:58.790 --> 01:41:01.670
has all body dysmorphia
associated with bodybuilding,

01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:04.870
but certain forms of
exercise are just catabolic.

01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:06.540
Meaning they break down
the amount of muscle.

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.890
They reduce body weight, overall,

01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:12.030
other types of exercises
like resistance training

01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:15.380
or anabolic, they allow
muscle to be put on.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:18.260
And there are some interesting
studies, not a lot,

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:21.750
but some interesting studies
trying to encourage anorexics,

01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:23.130
not to stop exercising,

01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:27.460
but rather to stop exercising
in this neurotic catabolic way

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:28.930
of breaking oneself down,

01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:32.610
but rather getting them
shifted toward breaking habits

01:41:32.610 --> 01:41:34.870
of only approaching low
calorie, low fat foods,

01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:37.905
while also encouraging them to
embark on resistance training

01:41:37.905 --> 01:41:41.850
and to start to learn and
reward the relationship

01:41:41.850 --> 01:41:45.560
between exercise for sake
of making one's body strong,

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:48.210
including the bones, not just
the muscles, but the bones,

01:41:48.210 --> 01:41:50.640
which is important,
especially in anorexics.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.840
And then to see food as a
way to nourish that process,

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.980
to building a body that could
be of the stable weight.

01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:00.050
Hopefully there, once the
anorexic is of a healthy weight

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:01.730
that they're maintaining that weight,

01:42:01.730 --> 01:42:04.350
but that they don't have to
constantly be on this treadmill,

01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:08.040
no pun intended of balancing
whatever food intake

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.550
they have with activity.

01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:12.104
And along the lines of that.

01:42:12.104 --> 01:42:15.450
During the episode on fat
loss and metabolism as well,

01:42:15.450 --> 01:42:19.200
I talked about this neat
and non-exercise induced

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.510
thermogenesis where people
who tend to be thin,

01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:23.820
tend to bounce around a lot.

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.694
They're kind of fidgety
and that burns 1000

01:42:26.694 --> 01:42:28.877
of calories a day, anywhere
from 800 to 2000 calories a day.

01:42:28.877 --> 01:42:31.882
Now that can be beneficial for
the folks that are overweight

01:42:31.882 --> 01:42:33.960
and have a healthy mindset about food,

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.430
but are trying to lose weight.

01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:38.640
And it turns out that by, you

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.270
literally fidgeting and
bouncing around, like,

01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:41.877
this is why I'm doing this.

01:42:41.877 --> 01:42:42.710
It looks ridiculous.

01:42:42.710 --> 01:42:45.200
You actually burn a lot
of body fat and calories.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.320
That way provide you're
in a caloric deficit,

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.940
you'll burn body fat
because body fat is not just

01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:50.773
a passive tissue.

01:42:50.773 --> 01:42:52.810
It actually receives input from neurons

01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:55.040
that release noradrenaline and adrenaline.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.333
And this neat.

01:42:56.333 --> 01:42:59.240
Has been described for
several decades now.

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:00.910
And it actually is a pretty terrific way

01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:02.253
to burn off more calories.

01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:04.880
So, with the anorexic,

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.620
you actually want to encourage
them to not constantly

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:09.610
be trying to burn off calories.

01:43:09.610 --> 01:43:10.660
That can be very challenging.

01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:14.010
So, shifting them toward
activities like weight bearing

01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:16.580
activities or resistance
training that promote

01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:19.980
this more anabolic type of
relationship to activity,

01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:22.140
as opposed to catabolic can be beneficial.

01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.880
Before we move on to talking
about bulimia and some related

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:27.500
disorders, I want to talk
about an aspect of anorexia.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.850
That's very interesting,
quite troubling in fact,

01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:33.460
but that has received a lot of attention

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.110
and that's the distorted self image.

01:43:38.110 --> 01:43:40.890
Now, episode and depression,

01:43:40.890 --> 01:43:45.720
we talked about a very powerful
aspect of major depression,

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.050
which is this anti-self
confabulation that people

01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:51.450
who are depressed seem
to genuinely believe.

01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:53.280
And even confabulate about the fact

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.110
that they are performing poorly in life

01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:58.110
and that they are no good or
not, or worthless, et cetera.

01:43:58.110 --> 01:44:02.410
It's literally a lie that they
believe and their statements

01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:04.140
and their feelings and
their behaviors start

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.590
to reflect that lie.

01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:06.510
They're not conscious of it.

01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:08.410
That's why we call it a confabulation.

01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:14.890
Anorexics often will see
themselves as overweight

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:18.830
or imperfect in ways that
are of an obsession for them,

01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:19.663
they'll think, oh, you know,

01:44:19.663 --> 01:44:22.340
their arms are a little bit fat, you know,

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:24.010
or, you know, the contour,

01:44:24.010 --> 01:44:26.510
their face makes they
don't like the pictures

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:28.070
of themselves or they.

01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:30.690
What I'm describing here is
actually pretty typical behavior

01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:31.750
of a lot of people.

01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:33.490
I mean, how many people do
you know that after you take

01:44:33.490 --> 01:44:35.430
a picture of them, they
say, can I see the picture?

01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:37.610
And then they tell you that
you have to throw it away.

01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:39.430
That doesn't necessarily
mean they're anorexic

01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:41.400
or they're suffering from
some sort of disorder.

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.510
That just means that they're
a human being that cares

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.600
about how they appear in the world.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.960
We're not here to judge that
in the case of the anorexic.

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:53.110
The problem seems to be that
they have a genuine distortion

01:44:53.110 --> 01:44:57.930
of their self image so much so
that they don't actually see

01:44:57.930 --> 01:45:01.890
themselves accurately, their
visual perceptions are off.

01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:03.003
And the reason we know this,

01:45:03.003 --> 01:45:05.190
it's because of some really important

01:45:05.190 --> 01:45:08.908
and beautiful studies that
were done with my colleague,

01:45:08.908 --> 01:45:10.060
Jeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford,

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.720
he's in the department of communications,

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.810
he's actually collaborated

01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:15.190
with a Dr. Halpern that
I mentioned earlier.

01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:17.240
What's really interesting about
these studies is they give

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.876
us a window into the perceptual
defect that anorexics have.

01:45:20.876 --> 01:45:23.500
I've actually done one
of these experiments.

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.060
I'm fortunate to not be anorexic,

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:27.894
but I've done some work
with the VR lab over there.

01:45:27.894 --> 01:45:31.073
And what you get to do is
you get to adjust this avatar

01:45:31.073 --> 01:45:32.460
of yourself to the point
where you think it's,

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:34.660
as accurate as it could possibly be,

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:39.260
and anorexics, really distort this avatar.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.093
In other words,

01:45:40.093 --> 01:45:43.540
they create this serious
mismatch between their perception

01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:44.820
of themselves and the reality.

01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:49.030
So, indeed it does seem to be
the case now what's relieving,

01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:51.410
or I should say what's encouraging

01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:53.280
about some of the therapies that we talked

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.770
about before the family based model,

01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:57.296
the Connie behavioral treatments.

01:45:57.296 --> 01:45:59.630
Yes, and the drug treatments as well.

01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:03.990
But this habit intervention
model is that as one starts

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:05.720
to shift those things,

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.470
it does appear that the
perception of self seems

01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:11.079
to follow that the
perception of self seems

01:46:11.079 --> 01:46:14.370
to shift along with the change in habits.

01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:15.595
And that's a relief,

01:46:15.595 --> 01:46:17.360
or at least I find that reassuring

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.750
because changing one's
perception is actually very hard,

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:24.030
as somebody who's worked
almost his entire career

01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:26.530
on visual perception and related things.

01:46:26.530 --> 01:46:31.520
The perceptual apparatus of
the brain are not very amenable

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:34.570
to neuroplasticity, meaning
they don't change that easily.

01:46:34.570 --> 01:46:37.090
Whereas it appears that the circuitry

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:39.287
that's related to habit
formation, and decision-making

01:46:39.287 --> 01:46:42.950
and the reward, circuitry,
that stuff can be rewired.

01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:45.040
And so anorexics as they progress

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.950
out of their anorexic state into one,

01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:51.270
which they are intervening
in their reflexes,

01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:53.823
gaining better habits
around food, eating more,

01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:57.920
more accurately, assessing foods

01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.470
and environments that
they're in related to food,

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:01.640
as they change their behavior.

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.140
And they start to put on healthy weight,

01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:05.390
maybe they're also doing the
sorts of exercises that allow

01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:07.920
them to put on healthy
weight and avoiding kind

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.200
of extreme exercises of cannibalism

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.600
and breaking themselves down.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:15.350
They also managed to somehow
just as a consequence

01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:18.460
of all that rewire their
perception of self.

01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:20.620
So, it doesn't seem that
trying to tell someone,

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.290
oh my gosh, you're so thin.

01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:23.400
You really need to eat.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.920
That doesn't seem to work.

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.700
They just don't see
themselves the same way

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:28.760
that you see them.

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.590
And so I offer that as a
point of consideration,

01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:32.940
if you know someone that's anorexic,

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.010
or if you look at an
anorexic and you think,

01:47:35.010 --> 01:47:38.770
how is it that they are
still critical of the small,

01:47:38.770 --> 01:47:40.620
even nonexistent amount of body fat

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.070
on their triceps or something?

01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.950
How is that?

01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:45.370
Well, it's literally that their brain,

01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:46.760
as it relates to perceptions,

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.170
visual perceptions in particular,
they're completely off.

01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:52.130
And fortunately by changing habits,

01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:54.240
you rewire those circuits as well.

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.718
Okay, so let's talk about bulimia,

01:47:55.718 --> 01:48:00.718
which is overeating and
then purging typically

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.970
by self-induced vomiting or by ingestion

01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:07.100
of laxatives, sometimes also in concert

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:11.280
with people taking
stimulants and fat burners,

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.821
over ingestion of stimulus to
try and burn off more energy.

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:16.850
And then we'll also talk
about binge eating disorder,

01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:20.010
which has a lot of the
same features as bulimia,

01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:22.063
but typically no purging.

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:26.470
I'm not going to list off
all the clinical criteria

01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:30.450
that would allow someone
to be diagnosed as bulimic

01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:32.470
or binge eating disorder.

01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:35.520
But the general features are
that they ingest far more

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.520
calories than they need,
anywhere from 10 to 30 times,

01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:42.360
their daily caloric intake,

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.210
oftentimes within a two hour period,

01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:49.090
which is just a staggering
amount of food and nutrients

01:48:49.090 --> 01:48:50.850
in a short period of time.

01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:53.510
Oftentimes they're overriding
those mechanical signals

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:54.848
from the body that they're full.

01:48:54.848 --> 01:48:58.780
It's a really troubling
thing to think about,

01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.010
but people are literally
gorging themselves with food.

01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:05.130
This looks a lot like a laboratory animal

01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:07.292
that has these AgRP neurons stimulated,

01:49:07.292 --> 01:49:08.640
these neurons that will eat

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:11.430
until they almost burst or burst.

01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:13.880
So, you wonder is that these
AgRP neurons that are active

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.070
almost certainly yes.

01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:16.240
That they're involved.

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.680
Although I don't think that that's going

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.604
to be the major point of intervention,

01:49:20.604 --> 01:49:23.720
but we're going to talk about
other types of interventions.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.350
There are a number of clinical criteria.

01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:28.340
For instance, if somebody
has one of these binges

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.860
once a year, does that make them bulimic?

01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:34.450
Technically, no, but I certainly

01:49:34.450 --> 01:49:36.252
don't recommend people do this.

01:49:36.252 --> 01:49:38.560
If you are one of these people

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.730
who has so-called cheat days, right?

01:49:40.730 --> 01:49:43.070
Some of you may be
familiar with cheat days.

01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:44.380
I think they're a little less common now,

01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:47.650
but the idea is you eat clean for six days

01:49:47.650 --> 01:49:49.470
or five days a week or two weeks.

01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:51.320
And then you have a so-called
cheat day where you just kind

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:53.815
of go wild and eat whatever
you want and whatever volumes

01:49:53.815 --> 01:49:55.110
is that bulimia.

01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:58.380
And it has some of the contour of bulimia.

01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:00.800
If you're vomiting afterwards
or binge eating disorder,

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:01.880
if you're not,

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.760
does it constitute full blown bulimia

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.900
or binge eating disorder?

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.391
And it's pretty hard to say,

01:50:06.391 --> 01:50:07.960
the criteria that were described

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.890
to me is that if somebody
is doing this at least once

01:50:10.890 --> 01:50:13.870
a month, over a period of
anywhere from two to three months,

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:16.240
then it likely would qualify.

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:19.050
And I certainly know people
who do these cheat days

01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:21.320
and by those criteria,

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.840
they have something like
binge eating disorder.

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:24.784
But in general,

01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:28.926
one of the hallmark features
of bulimia binge eating

01:50:28.926 --> 01:50:31.920
disorder is that people are
unable to control their eating.

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:32.810
They're just simply,

01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:35.440
they're not making the
decision to have a cheat day.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.920
They're not making the
decision to overeat.

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.920
They are simply driven from
the inside without question

01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.570
by way of neurocircuitry.

01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:50.120
They are driven from the
inside to ingest far more food

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.310
than they need.

01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:54.170
And in some cases than
they would want to eat.

01:50:54.170 --> 01:50:56.500
So, it's a lot like the habit

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.700
that we described for anorexia,

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.090
it's almost like it's
turned into a reflux once

01:51:01.946 --> 01:51:03.890
they get going, all
the homeostatic signals

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:07.130
are being overridden, all
the signals from the body,

01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:10.230
the leptin, the insulin, the glucose,

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:12.280
all that stuff has cosmically sky high.

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:14.221
And yet they're just what we,

01:51:14.221 --> 01:51:18.933
the nerds call hyperphagic,
they're just eating like crazy.

01:51:20.716 --> 01:51:21.549
So, what's going on there?

01:51:21.549 --> 01:51:23.303
Well, there've been a lot of ideas,

01:51:23.303 --> 01:51:26.540
about why this arises.

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:30.530
There's the so-called
thyroid hormone hypothesis.

01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:31.810
That one's a tricky one.

01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:33.710
It turns out that cortisol

01:51:33.710 --> 01:51:37.080
and thyroid hormone
concentrations vary according

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:40.350
to when the binge purge happened.

01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:41.920
So, there were some studies that looked

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.189
at thyroid hormone levels

01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:47.110
and they found elevated
thyroid hormone levels.

01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:49.480
Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism

01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:51.940
and not just the burning of energy,

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:55.620
but the use of energy in
converting it to different tissues

01:51:55.620 --> 01:52:00.255
of the body, cartilage bone,
fat, and muscle, et cetera,

01:52:00.255 --> 01:52:02.590
did a whole episode on
thyroid and growth hormone.

01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:03.709
By the way,

01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:06.013
if you're interested in learning
more about thyroid hormone,

01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:11.220
but thyroid hormone can also
be depleted at other phases

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.760
of the binge purge cycle.

01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:16.020
Now, without listing off
all the terrible things

01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:18.240
that happen with this binge purge cycle,

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.320
there are a number of things

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.440
that are really worth pointing out.

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:23.563
One is that the vomiting itself,

01:52:23.563 --> 01:52:27.220
the use of laxatives that
can cause severe disruption

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.910
to the mucosal lining the mucus lining

01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:32.460
of the digestive tract
can severely disrupt

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.130
the gut microbiome.

01:52:34.130 --> 01:52:39.130
It can cause all sorts of even
a ulceration of the esophagus

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:41.163
and just really terrible stuff.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:45.740
There's a lot of shame
associated with bulimia,

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.060
oftentimes because people are
vomiting and it's hard to hide

01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:53.100
that vomiting behavior,
people are aware of it.

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:54.564
There's some social isolation.

01:52:54.564 --> 01:52:55.900
So, you recall from the beginning,

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:58.420
it does not appear that sexual trauma

01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:00.590
is a prerequisite for bulimia.

01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:03.290
Although sometimes it can
occur the hallmark feature

01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:06.830
of bulimia that distinguishes
it from anorexia,

01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:08.760
aside from the fact that
it's overeating as opposed

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.680
to under-eating is a lack

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.820
of what they call inhibitory control.

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.358
And that might come as no surprise.

01:53:14.358 --> 01:53:19.160
But first of all, the bulimic,

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:24.160
unlike the anorexic is hyper
impulsive and oftentimes

01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:26.670
has other types of impulse behaviors.

01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:28.600
They might have a little bit of alcohol

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.550
and then start to eat like crazy.

01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:32.060
Whereas normally they're very restrictive.

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:34.830
That's a common feature of bulimia,

01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:38.190
sometimes they over ingest
alcohol during these binges.

01:53:38.190 --> 01:53:41.980
Sometimes they are sexually
promiscuous, not always,

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:45.200
but it's a general issue with satiety

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.800
once they start eating and
with impulse control generally.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.951
And for that reason,

01:53:49.951 --> 01:53:52.410
many of the treatments
that you see for bulimia

01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:55.170
and binge eating disorder
are the sorts of treatments

01:53:55.170 --> 01:53:57.540
that don't seem to work so well,

01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:00.200
or at least most of the time for anorexia.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.150
So, the drugs that increase
the neuromodulator serotonin,

01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:06.890
for instance, fluoxetine

01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:09.620
also called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera.

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:13.890
Those things oftentimes can
be effective in bulimia.

01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:16.330
Some of the drugs that are
used to treat attention deficit

01:54:16.330 --> 01:54:18.870
hyperactivity disorder an
ADD, a topic that we're going

01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:22.330
to talk about in depth
here on the podcast soon,

01:54:22.330 --> 01:54:24.323
some of those same drugs like Adderall,

01:54:25.437 --> 01:54:29.100
Vyvanse and things of
that sort can also be used

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.670
to treat bulimia and
binge eating disorder.

01:54:31.670 --> 01:54:32.630
Why would that work?

01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:35.290
Well now you are familiar
with the prefrontal cortex.

01:54:35.290 --> 01:54:36.790
You probably know more
about prefrontal cortex

01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:40.164
than you ever wanted to,
just from this episode,

01:54:40.164 --> 01:54:44.450
prefrontal cortex is involved
in this analysis of duration

01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:45.436
path and outcome.

01:54:45.436 --> 01:54:49.970
Duration path and outcome
is how we avoid impulsivity.

01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:50.803
It's how we think.

01:54:50.803 --> 01:54:52.950
Okay, if this, then
that, if that, then this,

01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:54.870
you can imagine how for
the obsessive compulsive

01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:59.420
or for the anorexic, these are
circuits that are overactive.

01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:03.080
For the bulimic this is
the circuit that's going

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.420
to essentially be underactive
and is under conditions

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:08.660
where they think, oh, you
know, I shouldn't eat anything.

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.493
I shouldn't eat anything.

01:55:09.493 --> 01:55:12.160
And then they just tear
the refrigerator open

01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:13.550
and plow through that.

01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:16.230
And then at that point they're
plowing through the cupboards

01:55:16.230 --> 01:55:17.360
and then they're ordering food.

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.410
And then they're feeling
horrible about themselves.

01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:23.510
There do tend to be these cycles
of binge and purge followed

01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:26.020
by feelings of real shame

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.700
because they just can't
control their behavior.

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:32.327
And what is more embarrassing
than not being able to control

01:55:32.327 --> 01:55:34.660
one's behavior as an
adult or as a young adult.

01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:38.610
So, really the polar opposite
of what you see in anorexia.

01:55:38.610 --> 01:55:41.270
So, this lack of impulsivity implies

01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:43.040
a lack of prefrontal control.

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.230
What we call top-down control.

01:55:44.230 --> 01:55:45.090
Why do we call it top-down?

01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:47.010
Because the prefrontal
cortex is suppressing

01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:51.990
the activity of deeper limbic
and hypothalamic circuitry,

01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:53.620
and things of that sort.

01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:56.690
Anytime you feel like
you want to say something

01:55:56.690 --> 01:56:01.690
really offensive and you
don't, that's top-down control.

01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.150
That's your prefrontal cortex.

01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:04.630
Anytime someone says something

01:56:04.630 --> 01:56:07.160
and you like grow your teeth.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.880
'Cause you'd know you
shouldn't say anything,

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.670
gritting your teeth is
top-dow control, okay?

01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:15.080
When you explode or burst
or say the wrong thing,

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:18.150
or say the thing that you
shouldn't say or do the thing

01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:20.290
you shouldn't do, that's
lack of prefrontal control.

01:56:20.290 --> 01:56:22.690
And indeed people who have
frontotemporal dementia

01:56:22.690 --> 01:56:24.282
due to aging or head injuries,

01:56:24.282 --> 01:56:27.300
see this a lot and people play sports get

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.680
a lot frontal damage.

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.260
They become more impulsive.

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:35.630
So, bulimics have an
issue with impulsivity,

01:56:35.630 --> 01:56:39.580
and therefore drugs that
can increase serotonin.

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:42.450
And sometimes these drugs
that increase dopamine

01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:45.170
and adrenaline also called epinephrin,

01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:49.320
will increase the tone as we
call it the dopaminergic tone

01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.250
or the, it's called adrenergic,

01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:54.930
but norepinephrine
levels in the brain allow

01:56:54.930 --> 01:56:56.330
for more top-down control.

01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:58.870
And that's also why
they're used to treat ADHD

01:56:58.870 --> 01:57:00.513
and attention deficit disorder.

01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:03.600
They tend to create a hyper-focus.

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.670
They tend to push the brain into,

01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:07.230
these drugs tend to create a hyper-focus,

01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:10.100
and tend to push the brain
and general motor processing

01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.950
into one in which you think
if this, then that, if this,

01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:15.290
then that, so anticipating outcomes.

01:57:15.290 --> 01:57:20.210
And for that reason, drugs
like Wellbutrin, bupropion,

01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:21.310
which is an antidepressant,

01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:23.990
which mainly increases
the amount of dopamine

01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:26.780
and norepinephrine and less serotonin,

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.720
that can also be effective
for certain types

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:30.770
of binge-eating disorder is actually used

01:57:31.996 --> 01:57:35.090
to treat smoking, for
promoting smoking cessation

01:57:35.090 --> 01:57:39.170
and for depression, but
also for certain forms

01:57:39.170 --> 01:57:41.600
of obesity related to
binge eating disorder.

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:42.740
And the data are pretty good.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.170
And there are timed release forms

01:57:44.170 --> 01:57:45.660
of this and non-time release forms.

01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:49.490
And I think you have to consult
with a psychiatrist in order

01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:51.930
to get these prescribed because
they are prescription drugs,

01:57:51.930 --> 01:57:55.240
but it's a very different
constellation of neurochemicals

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.240
and brain areas and
approaches for bulimia.

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.580
The treatment of binge eating
disorder has been explored

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:05.300
from a new standpoint recently.

01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:07.590
And that's the work of this now,

01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:10.380
sadly, former colleague of
mine, Dr. Casey Halpern,

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.570
who's at University of Pennsylvania

01:58:13.763 --> 01:58:14.800
that I mentioned earlier,

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:17.450
they are using deep brain stimulation

01:58:17.450 --> 01:58:19.800
in order to treat binge-eating disorder.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.690
Now why deep brain stimulation?

01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:25.850
Well work from Dr.
Halpern and others while

01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:29.350
at Stanford showed that
there are particular patterns

01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:33.320
of brain activity in both
the prefrontal cortex,

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:34.960
but also in an area of the brain

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.610
called the nucleus accumbens,

01:58:36.610 --> 01:58:40.280
very important and very
relevant area of the brain

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.160
in this context,

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:45.140
and in any discussion
about motivated behaviors

01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:47.613
of any kind, feeding,
sex, drug relay behavior,

01:58:47.613 --> 01:58:50.932
people exercise compulsively,

01:58:50.932 --> 01:58:54.670
the nucleus accumbens
is in a ongoing dialogue

01:58:54.670 --> 01:58:56.599
with the prefrontal cortex
and the nucleus accumbens

01:58:56.599 --> 01:58:59.104
has no mind of its own,
but it's associated

01:58:59.104 --> 01:59:00.450
with dopamine release.

01:59:00.450 --> 01:59:03.510
It's part of this
so-called reward pathway.

01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:06.580
And what Dr. Halpern and
colleagues discovered

01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:09.210
is that there are particular
patterns of activity

01:59:09.210 --> 01:59:11.150
that ripple through the brain,

01:59:11.150 --> 01:59:13.300
through these prefrontal
networks and through

01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:16.233
this nucleus accumbens area,
those areas are connected.

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:19.010
It's called Delta oscillations,

01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:21.330
Delta, just being a particular frequency

01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:23.720
of electrical activity for your aficionado

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:25.363
as wonderful heart activity.

01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:27.975
But in any case,

01:59:27.975 --> 01:59:30.890
those Delta oscillations
in the nucleus accumbens

01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:35.090
are associated with food
reward in both mice and humans.

01:59:35.090 --> 01:59:39.550
Somehow this reverberatory
activity creates a perception

01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:42.483
in the individual that
food is hyper rewarding.

01:59:43.677 --> 01:59:46.642
And that's interesting,
and has allowed them

01:59:46.642 --> 01:59:48.850
to use a targeted deep
brain stimulation approach

01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:50.770
to treat binge-eating disorder.

01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:53.850
And this deep brain
stimulation is appearing

01:59:53.850 --> 01:59:55.400
to be an effective treatment.

01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:57.910
There's still more studies
that need to be done.

01:59:57.910 --> 02:00:01.670
Actually, if you think you
have binge-eating disorder,

02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:04.000
you can find the criteria for that.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.620
And you could contact Dr. Halpern he's.

02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:08.670
As I mentioned, he's moving
to University of Pennsylvania.

02:00:08.670 --> 02:00:11.867
They are recruiting patients
for these studies all the time.

02:00:11.867 --> 02:00:13.640
The studies are fairly invasive.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:18.400
They involve a FDA approved
approach of literally placing

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:21.733
a wire down into an
area of the brain that,

02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:26.520
and allows the individual to
stimulate a particular brain

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:30.100
area to offset some of
these activity patterns

02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:34.500
that lead to a elevated
sense of reward from food

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.780
and binge eating.

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:37.460
And the data looked really promising.

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.720
Now I realize that's a
very invasive approach.

02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:42.080
Not everybody is going to be willing

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.530
to have this wire inserted into the brain,

02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:47.120
but for people that suffer
from binge-eating disorder.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.120
This is a great and very
exciting potential treatment.

02:00:52.330 --> 02:00:54.650
Because what I didn't tell
you is that many people

02:00:54.650 --> 02:00:57.180
have binge eating disorder are obese

02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:59.840
to the point where their
health is greatly risk.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.700
Now, obesity causes all sorts
of shifts in the dialogue

02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:06.490
between the brain and body.

02:01:06.490 --> 02:01:08.960
Some of which you'll
recognize from earlier

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.587
in the discussion, for instance,

02:01:10.587 --> 02:01:13.610
leptin signaling is disrupted.

02:01:13.610 --> 02:01:16.210
So, the fat there's lots of body fat,

02:01:16.210 --> 02:01:18.570
but even though that
body fat is secreting,

02:01:18.570 --> 02:01:21.610
this hormone leptin in that
signal should shut down

02:01:21.610 --> 02:01:22.567
the desire to eat.

02:01:22.567 --> 02:01:26.680
The receptors to leptin in the
brain are totally screwed up.

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.100
And so the signal to eat is there,

02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.400
but the signal to stop
eating is not there.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.100
So, again, you have an
accelerator and a brake,

02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.177
and it's like, the accelerator
has always pushed down.

02:01:35.177 --> 02:01:37.590
Some of these brain
stimulation approaches seem

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.720
to be able to bypass some of that,

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:42.070
and of course there all
the metabolic syndromes

02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:45.750
and the problems with having
excess levels of body fat,

02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:48.660
things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes.

02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:51.921
I mean, as disturbing as is to here,

02:01:51.921 --> 02:01:53.820
there are many individuals, actually,

02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:57.600
I know some who are so obese

02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:59.750
that they start getting bodily sores.

02:01:59.750 --> 02:02:00.700
They're not just bedsores,

02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:05.060
but they have skin sores that
are very disruptive to them.

02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:06.840
They don't like having these sores.

02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:08.303
And in addition to that,

02:02:09.603 --> 02:02:10.575
they can get peripheral neuropathies

02:02:10.575 --> 02:02:12.930
because of some of these metabolic issues.

02:02:12.930 --> 02:02:16.040
They're not getting enough utilization

02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:17.880
of the nutrients in the tissue,

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:21.550
because the way that insulin
has disrupted insulin singling,

02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:23.480
and they actually have
to have certain portions

02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.590
of their limbs amputated, and
yet they continue to overeat.

02:02:26.590 --> 02:02:30.850
So, this is not an issue of
self-control that can easily

02:02:30.850 --> 02:02:32.900
be dealt with simply by
telling the person, look,

02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:34.940
you have to stop eating
or you're going to die,

02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:36.950
or you're going to have
your legs amputated.

02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:38.640
Like with anorexia,

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.850
there's a distortion in
the relationship to food,

02:02:41.850 --> 02:02:45.850
but the homeostatic and the
reward aspects are disrupted.

02:02:45.850 --> 02:02:47.110
So, unlike anorexia,

02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:50.170
where it seems to be a
habit based mechanism

02:02:50.170 --> 02:02:53.200
with bulimia and binge eating disorder,

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.100
something deep within the
neural circuitry is causing food

02:02:57.139 --> 02:03:00.150
to be hyper attractive
and the break is off.

02:03:00.150 --> 02:03:02.170
So, if you want to develop some empathy

02:03:02.170 --> 02:03:03.600
for what these people are dealing with,

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.480
consider this, it's like driving a car,

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:10.640
you get onto a grade, maybe
a 10 or 15 degree grade,

02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:13.670
and you're heading down
and you figure, well,

02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:15.300
you'll just pump the brakes a little bit,

02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:16.810
but there is no break, right?

02:03:16.810 --> 02:03:18.930
So, you start going faster
and faster and faster.

02:03:18.930 --> 02:03:20.820
And your only choice is
to use the accelerator

02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.700
just to coach through it.

02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:22.970
That's essentially what's happening

02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:24.500
to these neural circuits.

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.420
So, the work of Dr. Halpern and others,

02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:28.170
I think is really exciting.

02:03:28.170 --> 02:03:29.870
And even though it's highly invasive,

02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:33.240
I think is going to lead
to not just some relief

02:03:34.081 --> 02:03:36.407
for the patients that do get
that deep brain stimulation,

02:03:36.407 --> 02:03:38.410
but also the identification
of what sorts of receptors

02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:39.845
are present in those brain areas.

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.520
That could help.

02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:45.290
What that means is that once
we understand which brain areas

02:03:46.688 --> 02:03:49.260
are involved in disorder, and
we understand what receptors,

02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:51.430
those brain areas express,

02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:54.120
then there can start to be
additional interventions

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:56.880
by way of non invasive treatments,

02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:58.850
things like drug treatments,

02:03:58.850 --> 02:04:01.400
do behavioral interventions
work for bulimia?

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:02.365
In some cases, yes,

02:04:02.365 --> 02:04:06.173
provided that those interventions
are done early enough.

02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.360
Regardless, behavioral interventions,

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:11.070
coupled with drug based interventions

02:04:11.070 --> 02:04:13.370
are always more effective
than either one alone.

02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:17.150
Fortunately, there is a
decent size kit of drugs

02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:18.120
that can help with bulimia.

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:19.650
I mentioned some of them before things

02:04:19.650 --> 02:04:23.490
like bupropion, Welbutrin
some of the serotonergic drugs

02:04:23.490 --> 02:04:26.160
and some of the drugs
used to treat impulsivity.

02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:29.860
So, we have on the one hand anorexia,

02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:32.720
which seems to be a disruption
in habit and a coupling

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.710
of unhealthy habits in this case,

02:04:35.710 --> 02:04:39.210
food restriction to the reward pathway.

02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:40.410
And on the flip side,

02:04:40.410 --> 02:04:42.830
we have binge eating disorder and bulimia

02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:45.580
where a very unhealthy
habit of gorging oneself

02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:48.110
with food sometimes followed by purging,

02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:49.980
is not necessarily coupled to reward.

02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:52.040
They feel terrible when
they do that, right?

02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:54.000
The anorexic feels great about restricting

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:54.960
their food intake.

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:57.050
They feel like they're
winning some sort of game.

02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:59.765
The circuitry is flipped somehow that way.

02:04:59.765 --> 02:05:03.810
With bulimia they feel
horrible about the fact

02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:06.010
that they're bingeing,
there's immense shame.

02:05:06.010 --> 02:05:08.070
They can't control themselves.

02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:10.980
The reward is set up before the behavior,

02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:15.050
the reward is set up
in drawing them to food

02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:17.150
and in making food look like something

02:05:17.150 --> 02:05:21.460
that's incredibly appetizing
and there's no impulse break.

02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.140
There's no way for them to
stop that kind of behavior.

02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:26.210
So, really kind of troubling
thing to think about.

02:05:26.210 --> 02:05:27.600
In either case,

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.050
I think for those of
us that know anorexics

02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:31.423
or have observed anorexia,

02:05:31.423 --> 02:05:34.130
it's so hard to see
somebody starved themselves

02:05:34.130 --> 02:05:35.700
to near death or to death.

02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.810
What more could be disturbing?

02:05:37.810 --> 02:05:41.990
Well, equally disturbing is
somebody who has an abundance

02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:43.560
of food and is gorging themselves,

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:45.406
and then feels terrible about it.

02:05:45.406 --> 02:05:48.475
So, these are heavy topics.

02:05:48.475 --> 02:05:52.380
These are topics that
frankly no one really wants

02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:54.440
to talk about unless they
know someone who is suffering

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.980
from them, or they
themselves suffer from them.

02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:59.234
What I've tried to do today
is try and give you a window

02:05:59.234 --> 02:06:02.740
into what really underlies these things

02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:05.120
that we call eating disorders.

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:06.410
I hope I've done that at the level

02:06:06.410 --> 02:06:09.650
of biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology,

02:06:09.650 --> 02:06:11.163
and some of the psychology,

02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:14.140
as with any episode of this podcast.

02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:16.140
But especially in this
month where we're talking

02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:19.360
about mental health issues
and mental health disorders,

02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:23.250
behavioral disorders, there's
no way that I can exhaustively

02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:25.140
cover all the different
forms of treatment.

02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:26.460
You have the modely approach,

02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:29.260
you've got all these different
approaches to depression,

02:06:30.610 --> 02:06:31.630
into anorexia, et cetera.

02:06:31.630 --> 02:06:33.900
What I've tried to do
is give you a framework.

02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:34.733
And in doing that,

02:06:34.733 --> 02:06:36.700
I've tried to give you a
framework of understanding

02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:39.120
that also applies to this question.

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:42.580
That's I think equally
important and goes alongside

02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:43.820
the treatment of eating disorders

02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:46.260
is what in the world is healthy eating.

02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:48.690
What in the world is a
healthy relationship to food.

02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:50.170
I like to think that I have a
healthy relationship to food.

02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:52.220
I know the foods I like.

02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:53.260
I enjoy them.

02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:56.120
They're 10 or 15 foods in
particular that I liked very much.

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.250
I've mentioned a few of
them on the podcast before,

02:06:58.250 --> 02:07:03.250
and I was sort of amused,
surprised and perplexed as to why.

02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:07.720
For instance, I do enjoy eating
butter, not in huge amounts,

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.340
but I do like butter.

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:12.393
So, that seemed to be pretty
triggering for folks out there.

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.520
A small selection of people
decided that the ingestion

02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:17.500
of butter was a health concern.

02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:20.090
Look to me,

02:07:20.090 --> 02:07:23.100
ingesting butter in small
quantities is something

02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:23.960
that I'm comfortable with.

02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.290
And my blood lipid profiles feel good.

02:07:26.290 --> 02:07:27.750
They look good to me.

02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:29.980
For other people that
might not be the case.

02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:30.813
For some people.

02:07:30.813 --> 02:07:34.580
The idea of eating an
animal-based food is probably

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.700
so repulsive that it actually

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:39.390
can make them feel physically sick.

02:07:39.390 --> 02:07:42.410
And I think that we should
be aware that that kind

02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:43.840
of mental phenotype exists.

02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:46.710
I'm not calling it a pathology
for other people like myself,

02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:48.890
things like butter and meat feel healthy.

02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:50.020
Now, what quantities?

02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:51.930
Well, I enjoy eating very much.

02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:52.900
I'm not shy about this.

02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:55.744
I've talked about on the
podcast before, I enjoy eating.

02:07:55.744 --> 02:08:00.110
Some people have a very
complicated relationship to food.

02:08:00.110 --> 02:08:01.760
They don't think of it as nourishment.

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:02.960
They don't enjoy it socially.

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:05.570
It's a stressful thing for them based

02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:06.960
on their personal history,

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:10.760
or maybe just general anxiety around food.

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:13.970
And I hope that in sharing
this information about the fact

02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:18.280
that anytime we approach food,
these neurons in our hype,

02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:21.130
in the arcuate area of our
hypothalamus actually increase

02:08:22.050 --> 02:08:23.051
our levels of anxiety.

02:08:23.051 --> 02:08:24.930
This is related to that
point that Dr. Halpern made,

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:27.018
which was that from an
evolutionary standpoint,

02:08:27.018 --> 02:08:30.170
it is advantageous to ingest as much food

02:08:30.170 --> 02:08:32.560
as often as possible,
as quickly as possible.

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.300
We now know that to not be
healthy in this age of abundance,

02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:39.580
where calories are essentially everywhere.

02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:44.580
And yet a lot of people
feel anxious in anticipation

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:46.313
of a meal.

02:08:46.313 --> 02:08:47.380
What could be useful to them?

02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:50.270
Well, whether or not they have
an eating disorder or not.

02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:53.970
It's very clear that developing
methods to calm oneself

02:08:53.970 --> 02:08:57.140
in the presence of any anxiety
or fear inducing stimulus

02:08:57.140 --> 02:08:57.990
can be beneficial.

02:08:57.990 --> 02:09:00.850
I've talked about some of these
episodes related to stress,

02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:02.840
things like the physiological
side to inhale through

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.153
the nose and a long exhale,

02:09:04.153 --> 02:09:07.250
things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help.

02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:09.260
There are data, a lot of
studies out there showing

02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:11.510
that meditation practice
can help people deal

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:14.510
with eating related anxiety and disorders.

02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:15.640
I think as a general rule,

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:18.730
trying to avoid approaching
a meal or sitting down

02:09:18.730 --> 02:09:21.980
to eat in an anxious state
is probably a good idea,

02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:22.910
but let's be realistic.

02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:24.000
How often can we do that?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.100
I think most of us are
going to have circumstances

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:30.010
where we're rushing around
trying to just eat before we head

02:09:30.010 --> 02:09:31.210
out or get to a meal.

02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:32.473
And then we sit down and
we find ourselves eating.

02:09:32.473 --> 02:09:35.980
This is one of the first
times in human evolution

02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:40.980
where we mostly eat out of
a desire to consume food,

02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:43.140
not out of a need for food.

02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:46.540
Most everybody could
go a fairly long period

02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:49.300
of time, just ingesting
water and electrolytes.

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.840
And not that I'm
suggesting people do that,

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:52.220
but let's face it.

02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:55.220
We largely eat nowadays
because of a desire to eat,

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:56.760
not a need to eat,

02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:59.800
and yet we need to eat on
a fairly regular basis.

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:03.540
And so no topic is more complicated

02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:06.570
and nuanced than food and nutrition.

02:10:06.570 --> 02:10:08.670
And in particular, as it
relates to eating disorders.

02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:12.030
So, the major takeaways today are,

02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:13.190
we should all be asking the question,

02:10:13.190 --> 02:10:15.240
what is healthy eating for us?

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.840
How do we develop a relationship

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:20.640
to food that we can enjoy
food, hopefully both socially

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:23.900
and on our own, but
that we are not neurotic

02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:24.910
and compulsive about it.

02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:26.550
For those of you that intermittent fast,

02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:28.200
this also applies, right?

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:29.693
What, you know, God forbid,

02:10:30.886 --> 02:10:32.090
if you eat 30 minutes before
your eating window starts,

02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:32.930
what does that mean?

02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:34.890
If it means something catastrophic,

02:10:34.890 --> 02:10:36.060
do you have an eating disorder?

02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:37.448
I don't know.

02:10:37.448 --> 02:10:38.700
Maybe you have an anxiety disorder,

02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.620
that's for you to explore.

02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:44.050
If you don't manage to
eat five meals a day

02:10:44.050 --> 02:10:45.090
and that's your obsession.

02:10:45.090 --> 02:10:47.860
Well, then, you know,
the same thing applies.

02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:50.150
These are questions that
we can all ask ourselves.

02:10:50.150 --> 02:10:54.600
Today, we focus on the extremes
of food related behaviors

02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.970
that really qualify as genuine disorders.

02:10:57.970 --> 02:11:01.940
They are in the psychiatric
manuals and they are diagnosable

02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.980
and they are serious health concerns.

02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:07.460
They're not just mentally
troubling and concerning

02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:08.477
for the people suffering from them

02:11:08.477 --> 02:11:09.780
and the people around them,

02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:11.426
but they are genuine health concerns,

02:11:11.426 --> 02:11:13.100
just want to reiterate,

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:16.870
that interaction nervosa is
the most deadly psychiatric

02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:19.800
disorder by a huge margin.

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.950
And if you look
statistically at the number

02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:23.960
of people with eating
disorders and that die

02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.690
of eating disorders,

02:11:25.690 --> 02:11:27.730
it's not far off from the number of people

02:11:27.730 --> 02:11:29.536
that die from automobile accidents.

02:11:29.536 --> 02:11:31.980
I know that that sounds
like a ridiculous number,

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:33.498
but you can look this up.

02:11:33.498 --> 02:11:36.100
This is particularly true in
certain countries, why that is,

02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:40.060
we don't know, but again,
this is not a new phenomenon.

02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:44.480
This is not just related
to body image issues

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:46.144
that are created through social media.

02:11:46.144 --> 02:11:48.796
And as a final point on that,

02:11:48.796 --> 02:11:53.600
many of you are probably asking
what about plastic surgery?

02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:56.557
What about all the steps that
people are going through?

02:11:56.557 --> 02:11:59.490
Excuse me, to preen themselves
and change themselves.

02:11:59.490 --> 02:12:01.810
Are people addicted to plastic surgery?

02:12:01.810 --> 02:12:04.000
Is that a form of body dysmorphia?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:04.933
And indeed it is.

02:12:05.932 --> 02:12:08.480
And so we will do an
episode on exercise related

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:11.950
and plastic surgery
related body dysmorphia.

02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:16.530
I think there is very little
question that those types

02:12:16.530 --> 02:12:21.530
of disorders are clearly
related to what we're observing

02:12:21.550 --> 02:12:23.660
in social media and in media,

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:27.100
that this shift of, for
instance, action heroes.

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:29.200
If you look at action heroes in the '80s,

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:31.550
there were very few men
that were very large.

02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:32.383
You had your terminate,

02:12:32.383 --> 02:12:34.920
you had your stallone's
in your shorts and eggers

02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:38.230
and a few others, but the
men in movies tended to be,

02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:39.090
if they were muscular,

02:12:39.090 --> 02:12:41.700
they were far more
svelte than they are now.

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.842
There's this kind of, there's a,

02:12:43.842 --> 02:12:45.410
literally a hypertrophy of the imagery.

02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:48.520
And likewise there's been hypertrophy

02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.180
of the female body shape.

02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:51.530
As it's portrayed in the media.

02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:55.300
There are body dysmorphia that are related

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.580
to those types of things.

02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:58.900
And that relate to things
like plastic surgery,

02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:03.540
steroid abuse, diet,
drug abuse, and so on.

02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:06.480
Definitely important to
think about and consider,

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.665
and definitely deserving
of its own episode.

02:13:08.665 --> 02:13:12.110
You've learned a lot
of neuroscience today.

02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:14.790
I hope that was useful in
thinking about these disorders

02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:17.440
and in thinking about
other aspects of feeding

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.890
and motivated behaviors,

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.730
I would love for you
to take away this model

02:13:21.730 --> 02:13:22.700
that was handed off to me,

02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.500
that I think is so powerful for thinking

02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:26.550
about all sorts of
things, not just eating,

02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.300
but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:31.560
that you have one box for what you think,

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.250
one box for what you do

02:13:33.250 --> 02:13:35.370
and what is intervening between those?

02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:37.558
Why is it that you can know
better and not do better?

02:13:37.558 --> 02:13:40.730
Well it's because you also have to cope

02:13:40.730 --> 02:13:43.660
with the subconscious
homeostatic processes

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.070
and reward processes.

02:13:45.070 --> 02:13:48.550
And those oftentimes
can be disrupted in ways

02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:51.900
that we find ourselves doing
things that are not good

02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:53.290
for us or not good for other people.

02:13:53.290 --> 02:13:55.319
But fortunately, there is this great gift,

02:13:55.319 --> 02:13:58.880
which is that knowledge
of knowledge can allow you

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:01.580
to do better without question.

02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:05.550
And that knowledge of knowledge
allowing you to do better

02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:08.040
over time leads to this
incredible phenomenon

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.770
called neuroplasticity, which
essentially is translated

02:14:10.770 --> 02:14:13.030
into doing better over time.

02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:16.930
Even if difficult eventually
makes doing better reflexive.

02:14:16.930 --> 02:14:19.610

If you'd like to make a
tax deductible donation

02:15:00.418 --> 02:15:01.670
to the laboratory,

02:15:01.670 --> 02:15:03.640
to explore the sorts of things that relate

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:06.970
to neurocircuits stress,
sleep and human performance.

02:15:06.970 --> 02:15:09.370
Not today, but oftentimes on this podcast,

02:15:09.370 --> 02:15:11.550
we discuss various
compounds and supplements

02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:16.010
that people could possibly
take in order to help deal

02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:18.480
with anxiety, improve gut microbiome,

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:20.460
improve their sleep, et cetera.

02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.540
We didn't discuss those today,

02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:23.310
but for those of you
interested in those compounds,

02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:25.180
if you want to see the ones that I take,

02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:28.887
you can go to Thorne that's T-H-O-R-N-E

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:32.373
.com/the letter U/huberman.

02:15:33.546 --> 02:15:35.940
So, it's thorne.com/u/huberman.

02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:37.340
See all the supplements that I take,

02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:39.600
you get 20% off any of those supplements.

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.414
And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

02:15:42.414 --> 02:15:45.090
you can get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes

02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:46.290
we partnered with Thorne

02:15:47.422 --> 02:15:48.255
because they have the highest levels

02:15:48.255 --> 02:15:51.330
of stringency with respect to
the quality of ingredients,

02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:53.740
the precision of the amounts
of those ingredients.

02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:55.770
And while supplements are
certainly not required

02:15:55.770 --> 02:15:58.340
or necessary for anything really,

02:15:58.340 --> 02:15:59.660
you can always use behavioral tools.

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:01.300
Many people benefit
from taking supplements

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:02.200
of various kinds.

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:04.000
And we do believe that getting supplements

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.140
of the very highest quality
is going to be important

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:08.490
if that's the decision for you.

02:16:08.490 --> 02:16:10.090
And last but not least,

02:16:10.090 --> 02:16:12.510
I want to thank you for
your time and attention.

02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:14.062
And thank you for your
interest in science.
