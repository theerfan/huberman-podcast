00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.360
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.477
where we discuss science,

00:00:03.477 --> 00:00:05.953
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.630
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.390
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.580
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.840
Today, I have the pleasure of
introducing Dr. Samer Hattar

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.640
as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.700
Dr. Hattar is the Chief of the Section

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.620
on Light and Circadian Rhythms

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.590
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.530
in Bethesda, Maryland.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.140
Dr. Hattar has many important
discoveries to his name.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.930
He was one of a handful
of groups that discovered

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.490
the light sensing neurons in the eye

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.193
that set the circadian clock.

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:44.660
This is a fundamental discovery
made in the early 2000s

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.170
that has led to an enormous
number of additional discoveries

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.170
on how light regulates our
sleep, our immune system,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.470
our mood, mental health,
metabolism, feeding,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.410
and many other important processes.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.210
If ever there was somebody who understands

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.720
how all of these processes interact

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.640
and can inform best practices
for our daily behaviors,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.180
it's Dr. Hattar.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.340
During our discussion today,
Dr. Hattar answers questions

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.920
that are absolutely
essential for us to know

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.890
about our health and wellbeing.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.320
For instance, how to
align our sleep schedule

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.960
with our activity
schedule, such as exercise,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.750
and how to align light,
activity and exercise

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.730
with our feeding rhythms.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.090
He presents a new model
of how light, activity,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.300
and feeding rhythms converge
to support optimal health.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.250
And when those are not aligned correctly,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.010
how our mental and
physical health can suffer.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.270
It's a discussion that is rich
with scientific mechanism,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.300
made clearly, of course, so
everybody can understand,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.730
as well as specific
protocols to deal with shifts

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.310
in day length, shifts in activity,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.770
and in order to optimize
sleep, metabolism,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.650
and wellbeing of various kinds.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.280
I learned so much from
Samer as I always do.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.660
He is an absolute wealth of
knowledge on all things related

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.340
to light and circadian rhythms,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.360
physiology, and neuroscience.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.770
I don't think you'll find anyone else

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.080
as knowledgeable about
these topics as Samer.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.930
And so, I'm delighted that he
joined us here on the podcast

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.500
to share this information.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.940
Before we begin I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.760
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.780
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.347
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.040
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.020
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.150
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.130
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.160
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.480
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.210
I've spent my career
working on the science

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.220
of the visual system and I can tell you

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.560
that one of the things
that our visual system

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.730
has to contend with is
adjusting so that when we go

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.300
from a very bright area
to a dim or shadowed area,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.330
we can still see things clearly.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.570
ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were designed

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.360
with the science of the
visual system in mind.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.130
And so they make those
transitions seamless.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.370
You always see things
with crystal clarity.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.780
Another great thing about these glasses

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.930
is that they're very lightweight,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.200
so you don't even really remember
that they're on your face.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.890
And they won't slip off if you get sweaty.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.780
The glasses were designed
initially for running

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.100
and for cycling and for active wear,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.870
but they work great for
that and they work great,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.170
and they also happen
to look great for work,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.810
if you go out to dinner,
for social settings,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.000
so they can really be worn in
essentially any circumstances.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.490
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.440
you can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A.com

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.673
your first order.

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:36.860
That's ROKA.com, enter the
code "Huberman" at checkout.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.904
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:42.340
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.910
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.660
to help you better understand your body

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.700
and help you reach your health goals.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.710
I've long been a believer
in getting blood work done

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.070
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.270
that impact our immediate
and long-term health

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.740
can only be detected in
a quality blood test.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.830
The problem with a lot of
blood tests out there, however,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.740
is you get numbers back, but
you don't know what to do

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.570
about those numbers specifically.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.890
ROKA has solved that problem
at a number of levels.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.530
First of all, they make getting
the blood tests very easy.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.380
They'll come to your house if you like,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.000
or you can go to a local clinic.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.100
Second of all, once you
get your numbers back,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.220
there's a very easy to use
dashboard where you can identify

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.410
obviously what the numbers are,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.850
but also the various
things that you can do

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.730
to bring those numbers into
the ranges that you want;

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.590
through either behavioral
practices like exercise,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.490
through nutritional practices
or supplementation, et cetera.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.260
So they made the whole thing
very easy start to finish,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.670
in a way that allows you to
best direct your health goals.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.090
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.930

just use the code "Huberman" at checkout.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.810
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Magic Spoon.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.530
Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.410
keto-friendly cereal.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.230
I am not ketogenic,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.610
meaning I don't follow
a purely ketogenic diet.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.830
I tend to fast in the
early part of the day,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.600
I tend to eat kind of low carbish

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.100
through the middle of the day.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.830
And then in the evening
I eat carbohydrates.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.420
That's what works best for me,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.330
and allows me to feel alert all day long,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.850
and to sleep really well at night.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.940
Magic Spoon is a terrific snack for me

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.730
because it tastes terrific;
it's got some sweetness,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.510
but it doesn't take me out of
that state that I want to be in

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.050
during the day where I'm
sort of ketoish, I would say.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.640
I'm not actually in ketosis,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.860
but I'm following more
or less a low carb diet

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.700
during the day, which keeps me alert.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.930
So either fasting or low carb,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.100
and Magic Spoon is consistent with that.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.810
And then as I mentioned
before in the evening,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.900
I do eat carbohydrates.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.370
Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.070
13 to 14 grams of protein,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.890
and only four net grams of
carbohydrates in each serving.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.700
So I think it qualifies as
low carbish or low carb.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.110
In addition, it only has
140 calories per serving.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.390
It's also just delicious.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.680
They have flavors like cocoa, fruity,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.200
peanut butter, frosted.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.640
I particularly liked the frosted one

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.750
because it tastes like donuts,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.200
and I particularly like donuts.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.960
Although I try not to eat
them too often if ever.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.480
If you want to try Magic Spoon,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.400
you can go to MagicSpoon.com/Huberman

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.560
to grab a variety pack.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.170
You can use the promo code
"Huberman" at checkout,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.080
and you'll get $5 off your order.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.270
Again, that's MagicSpoon.com/Huberman,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.000
and use the code "Huberman" to get $5 off.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.690
And now, my conversation
with Dr. Samer Hattar.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.280
Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.473
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, we go way back.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.790
So, you are best known
in scientific circles

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.790
for your work on how light
impacts mood, learning, feeding,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.090
hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.423
So, just to kick the ball out
onto the field, so to speak,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.640
how does light impact the way we feel?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.780
So, when I get up in the morning,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.790
I have the opportunity
to interact with light

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.250
in certain ways or to avoid
light in certain ways.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.150
I have the opportunity
to interact with sunlight

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.040
or with artificial light.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.610
Maybe you could just wade us
into what the relationship is

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.670
between light and these things

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.120
like mood and hunger, et cetera.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.250
- Sure.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.060
So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.130
of light for vision.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.300
So, when you wake up in a beautiful area,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.290
beautiful ocean, light is essential;

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.160
the sunrise, the sunset, blue
sky, beautiful mountains.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.180
So, that's your conscious
perception of light,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.750
but light has a completely
different aspect

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.410
that is independent of conscious vision

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.400
or image forming functions.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.420
And that's how it regulates many important

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.710
functions in your body.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.980
I think the best that is
well studied and well known

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.020
is your circadian clock.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.710
And the word circadian
comes from the word circa,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.250
which is approximate and diem is day.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.620
So, it's an approximate day.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.560
Why is it an approximate day?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.150
Because if I put you or
any other human being

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.960
who have a normal circadian
clock in a constant conditions

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.940
with no information about
feeding time, about sleep time,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.130
about what time it is outside,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.920
you still have a daily rhythm,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.860
but it's not exactly 24 hours.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.050
So it will shift out of the solar day

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.880
because it's not exactly 24 hours,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.380
and hence the name circadian.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.440
- So, just to ask a quick
question about that.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.760
When you say you have
this about 24 hour rhythm,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.833
how does that rhythm show up
in the tissues of our body?

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:22.935
- Great question.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:26.220
So, it shows up at every
level that we know we studied;

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.460
it shows up at the level of the cell.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.310
It shows up at the level of the tissue,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.130
and it shows up at your behavior.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.350
The most obvious for you
is your sleep-wake cycle.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.680
You sleep and you're awake and
sleep at the 24 hour rhythms.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.330
And if you measure the
sleep-wake cycle of humans

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.560
who are maintaining constant conditions,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.040
you will see that the period
length of the sleep rhythm

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.640
on average is more than 24 hours.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.860
In humans it's 24.2 hours.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.240
So you'll be drifting .2 hours every day

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.550
out of the solar day if
you don't get the sunlight.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.420
So the sunlight adjusts
that approximate day

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.060
to an exact day, so now
your behavior is adjusted

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.040
to the light-dark
environment or the solar day.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.640
- Okay, so if I understand correctly,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.390
if I were to go into a cave-

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.300
- Yeah.
- Or I would to be

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.060
in constant light.
- Yeah.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.940
- And I didn't close my eyes-
- Yeah.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.080
- In constant light,
that I would still sleep

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.387
in one coherent about.
- Yes.

00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:23.530
- And I would still be
awake for more or less one

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.550
coherent about, maybe a nap.
- Yes.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:30.550
- But the total duration
of my day, so to speak,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.390
would be a little bit
longer than 24 hours?

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.940
- Perfect.
- But if I'm in a condition

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.657
like most people are where the sun goes up

00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:41.310
and the sun goes down, and
I have some understanding

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.287
of that sunrise and sunset, then-

00:09:43.287 --> 00:09:44.180
- You don't have the understanding,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.620
you don't have to have
conscious understanding.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.247
You have the detection.
- Right.

00:09:48.247 --> 00:09:51.700
- So, circadian photoentrainment
is the word we use,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.300
entraining the circadian clock
to the photic environment

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.960
is completely subconscious.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.140
You're not aware of it.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.820
It's not like vision or image forming,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.900
where you actually know
what you're looking at.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.430
So, it's all hypothalamic.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.580
It's part of the brain that
is not consciously driven.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.780
So, you actually do not
know when it happens

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.750
or when it doesn't happen.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.180
And that's what we'll
get into when I tell you

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.750
why light affects your mood
and why sometimes people

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.210
don't know how to deal with light

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.280
to improve their mood, for example.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.370
- Okay, so this is a subconscious vision.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.373
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.680
Before you tell us about
how light impacts mood,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.540
I'm curious, what is the
relevance of adjusting this clock

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.070
from a little bit longer
than 24 hours to 24 hours?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.490
I mean, it seems like a small difference,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.040
24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.470
Like what's the relevance?

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.430
I mean, why should we care
about that short difference?

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.440
- So, let's do the math.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.590
If you shift out .2 hours a day,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.560
in five days you're shifting out one hour.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.180
So you're literally one hour off

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.530
in your social behavior in five days.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.590
In 10 days, you're two hours off.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.620
And if you're an organism
that is living in the wild,

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.140
shifting out of the
right phase of the cycle,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.950
you could either miss food
or you could become food.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.070
So it's really essential for survival.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.630
I think it's one of the
strongest aspect of survival

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.710
for animals to have the anticipation

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.490
and the adjustment to the solar cycle.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.970
- And for humans as well.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.080
When you say animals, I'm
assuming that applies to us?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.800
- Absolutely, yeah.
- I see.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.453
So even though it's just a
short bit longer than 24,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.350
if that accumulates over days,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.920
then you could find yourself
very much out of phase

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.466
with the rest of your species essentially.

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.440
- Yeah, so let's say it's .2 hours.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.850
So, in five days it's one hour.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.440
In 25 days it could be five or six hours.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.300
You could be in New
York and you're feeling

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.200
as if you traveled from
New York to London.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.380
So, you would be having
jet lag in New York,

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.790
even though you didn't
do a jet lag travel.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.680
So it's very important for the adjustment.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.950
And if we have time,
maybe we could talk about

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.990
why this is important for seasonality,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.660
because also it allows
animals to anticipate

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.310
the change in season.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.350
And the more you're high
in the north or the south,

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.250
the more that these weather
changes occur very harshly,

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.130
and you have to be ready for them.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.110
And that happens in us as well.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.910
- All right, well, we will
definitely get into seasonality.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.590
Okay, so we've got this
subconscious vision

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.653
that aligns us with the turn of the earth.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.440
How does that work?

00:12:26.744 --> 00:12:31.090
What is the machinery that
allows that to happen?

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.930
And how does that machinery work?

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.020
- Yeah, so, we knew that
in mammals, including us,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.580
we are mammals, humans,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.550
that the eyes are required
for this function.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.340
So, if humans are born without eyes,

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.270
or the optic nerves are damaged,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.840
humans are not able to
adjust to the solar cycle.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.100
So we know that the eyes are required.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.840
And since we thought we
knew about the eyes a lot

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.697
before 2000, we thought that-

00:12:55.697 --> 00:12:57.560
- You say before the year 2000?

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.050
- Before the year 2000, yes.
- Mm hm, yep.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.700
- We thought it's these
photoreceptors in your retina

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.690
that allow you to see.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.650
So, in the human retinas,

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.160
there are two types of photoreceptors;

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.400
they are called rods and
cones because of their shapes.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.390
And these rods and cones
simply take the photon energy,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.080
which light is made of,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.670
and they change it in a
way to an electrical signal

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.400
that allow us to build the
image of the environment

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.550
in our cortices.
- Subconsciously?

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.980
- Consciously in this situation
cause it's vision, right?

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.260
It's image forming vision,
it's a visual cortex,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.470
and associative cortices,
which allow you to build

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.340
conscious perception of the environment.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.430
However, people have found,
including me with the work

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.520
of David Berson and Ignacio Provencio,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.560
that there is a subset of ganglion cells.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.800
The ganglion cells are the
cells that leave the retina,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.760
their axon leave the retina
and project to the brain.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.700
So these were thought to only
relay rod and cone information

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.080
from the light environment to the brain.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.520
We found that a small subset
of these ganglion cells

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.270
are themselves photoreceptors
that were completely

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.020
missed in the retina.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.100
And these are the photoreceptors

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.170
that relay light
environment subconsciously

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.020
to the areas in the
brain that have and house

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.100
the circadian clock or
the circadian pacemaker,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.550
which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.840
to the central brain clock
that allows them to entrain

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.203
to the 24 hour light-dark cycle.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.283
- Incredible.

00:14:28.283 --> 00:14:31.560
So, as I recall 'cause I was a
graduate student at the time,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.460
in the year 2000, there
was this landmark discovery

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.000
made by you, Ignacio Provencio,
David Berson, and others,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.350
that these cells exists
that can communicate

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.210
day and night information to the brain.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.560
- Yeah.
- In this very small

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.460
subset of cells.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.240
Since then, I've heard, but
maybe you can confirm or refute

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.950
that this system that connects the eyes

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.230
to the rest of the brain
is actually the most

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.340
ancient form of vision.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.070
That this is probably the
form of vision that some early

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.110
version of human beings had
before they had pattern vision,

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.690
before they could see colors and shapes

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.450
and motion and all that.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.390
And that the same cells
that perform this role

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.870
are actually similar to insect eyes.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.990
I think I heard David Berson
say once that we actually

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.880
have a little bit of
the fly eye in our eye.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.310
What's he talking about?
- Yeah.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.500
So, it's really interesting actually,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.110
because these same ipRCGs we
discovered they contribute

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.560
a little bit to image formation.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.010
And now, work from Tiffany
Schmidt specifically have proven

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.300
that they do contribute to
image forming functions.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.720
But they contribute to very limited

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.010
aspect of image formation.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.260
So, it fits your hypothesis that these

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.840
are an ancient photoreceptors.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.690
The other thing that
adds to that hypothesis

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.950
is that they are expressed
in cells that don't have

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.140
any modification that make
them look like photoreceptors.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.340
So, the photoreceptors
that I told you about

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.830
that are important for
vision, image formation,

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.134
they have very specialized
structures that allow them

00:16:03.134 --> 00:16:05.820
to pack these structures
with photopigments;

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.080
these are the photo-detecting proteins,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.160
so they could detect a
high sensitivity of photons

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.310
that pass through them.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.060
These new photoreceptors don't have

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.410
these specialized structures.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.450
So they just really need a
lot of light at the time,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.100
we thought they need a lot
of light to be activated.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.090
So that's why we think they are ancient.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.223
And that's why we think they
adjust to ancient functions

00:16:33.223 --> 00:16:35.750
that are as important as regulating

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.320
your body circadian clock
to the solar environment,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.210
to solar day or to the light-dark cycle.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.300
- So, you mentioned ipRCGs,
intrinsically photosensitive.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.080
So these are cells that
connect the eye of the brain

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.410
that behave like photoreceptors.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.320
- Right.
- Essentially.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.730
And then you mentioned melanopsin,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.590
which is the actual pigment
that converts the light

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.000
into the electrical signal-
- Yeah.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.570
- More or less.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.800
And my understanding is that
melanopsin was identified first

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.180
in frog melanophores.
- Yes.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.120
- So does that mean that
we have like little pieces

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.050
of frog skin in our eyes?

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.980
- So, honestly, David Berson
say you have a fly in your eye

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.500
because it sounds better.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.813
The more accurate I think is that you have

00:17:14.813 --> 00:17:16.070
a frog skin in your eye.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:20.000
It's not as catchy, but really,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.260
the name melanopsin is
from melanocyte opsin,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.410
so it's melanopsin because it was found

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.730
in the frog melanocytes.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.320
You know the frogs can change
their color depending on light

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.730
and melanopsin drives this response.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.980
So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.810
these opsins in frogs,

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.290
luckily he was smart enough
to see if they are expressed

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.740
in the frog eye.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.290
They were expressed in the
frog eye and it what appears

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.500
to be retinal ganglion
cells, which I told you,

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.490
the one that connects
the eye to the brain.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.340
He had the insight to go and see

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.600
if they are expressed in the monkey eye.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.140
And he found that they are
also expressed in what appears

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.770
to be retinal ganglion cells,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.480
and really that what
opened the field wide open.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.920
Then David Berson did
the seminal experiment

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.470
where he went to the brain
where the central oscillator,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.850
the oscillator that drives
circadian rhythm in the brain

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.840
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.810
that has been known for many
years to receive retinal input.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.340
And he labeled the cells
that project there.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.320
And then he found that even
if you destroy rods and cones,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.570
you could get light
responses from these cells.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.000
So you could imagine he
nearly fainted when he saw

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.740
that these cells can respond independent,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.730
completely in the absence
of rod and cone input.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.790
- Yeah, I'll never forget reading

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.860
those papers in 2000, 2001.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.063
I was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio,

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:41.590
Iggy, we call him Iggy,

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.100
showed this image of this basically

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.050
what is frog melanophores

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.310
in the human eye.
- Yes.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.143
- [Andrew] And everyone was like,

00:18:48.143 --> 00:18:49.220
"oh my goodness, this is the thing."

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.730
- Yeah.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.660
- And I want to get into how light

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.420
actually can control circadian rhythms.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.253
In a moment.
- Absolutely.

00:18:55.253 --> 00:18:58.450
- But I think it's worth
mentioning now that people

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.160
who are pattern vision blind,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.000
so people who cannot see
and no conscious vision,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.650
but have eyes, many of them
still have these cells;

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.120
these melanopsin intrinsically
photosensitive cells,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.290
and can essentially match
or entrain, as we say,

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.040
onto the light-dark cycle.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.060
- In fact, they possibly have no problems

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.430
in circadian photoentrainment,

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.600
they'll have a normal sleep-wake cycle.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.620
- But they're totally blind?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.170
- But they are totally image blind.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.660
And what's really interesting is that,

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.520
and this story I heard
from Chuck Czeisler,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.860
so I'll give him credit,

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.240
that some of these people
who are image blind,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.650
usually they get dry eyes and
they give them a lot of pain.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.300
And doctors used to think,
oh, since they are image blind

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.133
and they're getting dry eye,

00:19:40.133 --> 00:19:42.110
why don't you just remove their eyes?

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.670
They're not using them anymore.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.010
And the minute they
would remove their eyes,

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.860
they start having cyclical
sleep problems indicating

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.300
that now they are not entraining
to the light-dark cycle

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.270
and are having cyclical jet
lags when their clock shifts

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.020
through the light-dark cycle.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.970
- That's really interesting.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.540
And I hear from a number of blind people

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.590
in my various aspects of my job,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.490
and a lot of them have issues with sleep.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.730
I think, in part because they
don't realize that they too

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.180
need to see light at particular
times of day or night

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.360
in order to match their schedule.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.270
- Absolutely.
- Well, I think

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.910
that's a perfect segue for
us to talk about how light

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.580
and viewing light can impact
our sleep-wake rhythms.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.440
And then we'll move into some
of the other ways in which

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.380
light can impact other
forms of bodily function.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.270
- Yeah, so I love the way you set it up

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.270
because one of the most
interesting and difficult aspect

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.520
of trying to educate
people about light effect

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.790
on subconscious vision is
that it's subconscious.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.210
So we're all aware of
what we think is intensity

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.300
because we see the room,
but if you talk to people

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.550
who know how to take
photographs and stuff like that,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.140
they know that the
intensities varies greatly.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.100
But our system, because we
have to see the same way

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.150
in very bright conditions
and very dim conditions,

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.090
we're not very good at
estimating intensity consciously.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.450
So when you try to tell
people about intensity,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.580
you really struggle because
they think they know intensity,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.710
but they really don't.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.620
- You mean light intensity?
- Light intensity.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.220
- Yeah.
- So the cones themselves

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.560
have an incredible ability to adapt

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.470
to different light conditions.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.520
So you can see at all
different conditions.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.180
Otherwise it'd be a disaster.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.990
If you don't change the
setting on your camera

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.030
and you go from inside
the room to the outside,

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.640
it becomes completely white,
you don't see anything.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.990
So if your cones don't
adapt to the environment,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.580
then you're not going to
be able to see in this room

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.980
and on the beach, right?

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.210
But the problem is your ipRCGs,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.410
the cells that we talked about,

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.580
they measure intensity pretty well.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.380
They really know what intensity is.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.250
They have a very good linear
measurement of intensity.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.900
They don't adapt as well.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.470
They don't adapt actually
that much, to be honest.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.330
So that tells you that
subconsciously the system is used

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.540
to measuring light intensity
in a natural environment,

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.860
because when you are now
in the natural environment,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.120
you don't have industrialized lighting,

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.530
then your system is functioning very well.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.140
But now when we change these environments,

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.660
we could really mess up ourselves.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.440
So you have to teach people
how to understand intensity.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.910
And that's something that you
have to explain to people.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.960
And I think I love to do it myself.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.240
I do it in what is called
the lowest amount of light

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.500
required to allow you to see comfortably.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.450
So you have to do this
as an fun experiment.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.750
- Okay, so explain to me how this goes.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.580
And maybe we could break up the day

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.880
into three or four parts.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.750
So let's say assuming
that most people wake up

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.620
in the morning-
- Mm hm.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.550
- As opposed to night
shift workers, et cetera,

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.877
we could talk about later.
- Right.

00:22:49.877 --> 00:22:51.500
- But they wake up in the morning,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.751
so let's divide the day into quarters.

00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:57.050
What is the proper way
to interact with light

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.300
in the first part of the day?

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.880
- So, I honestly think the
easiest thing is waking up,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.520
get as much light as you can.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.500
- To your eyes?
- Yeah, it's really nice.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.840
Your system is prime.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.920
If you're entrained,
it's prime to get light,

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.680
the sun should be out.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.060
Most animals in the wild,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.320
they actually seem to track the sun.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.760
The sun has a huge
influence on life on earth.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.900
It's actually life on
earth is because of sun.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.070
So, that's easy.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.143
In the morning when you
wake up, you need light.

00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:27.020
Just get the light.
- Okay, so what is

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.633
the behavioral practice
that you recommend?

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.340
Let's say somebody is in a condition where

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.287
there's a lot of cloud cover.
- Yeah.

00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:35.650
- Is it important to get outside?

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.820
- So, I have to tell you,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.430
the cloudiest day is going
to be much more brighter

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.263
than your room.

00:23:40.263 --> 00:23:42.410
You could ask any photographer.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.500
A cloudy day, unless it's
really dark, dark clouds,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.850
usually cloudy days have
much more light outside

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:49.870
than inside the room,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.780
even when you have good
lighting inside the room.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.999
So I think in the outside is
usually even when it's cloudy,

00:23:56.999 --> 00:23:59.750
you're going to get to enough
intensity to help you adjust

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.800
your cycle to the day-night cycle.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.910
- So, how long do you...

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.060
These are general rules of thumb,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.553
but how long do you
recommend people go outside?

00:24:06.553 --> 00:24:09.970
- So, if you do it daily,
you possibly need very few.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.060
If you do it daily,
because remember this thing

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.547
is going to happen on a daily matter.

00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:15.430
So, let's say 15 minutes.
- So, the clock is tracking

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.810
it on a regular basis?
- Absolutely.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.620
It's photon counting, it's tracking.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.710
I would say 15 minutes.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.660
If you don't do it daily,
you may want to increase it.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.740
And we'll talk about when you
travel, what you could do,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.020
but yeah, 15 minutes should be fine.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.870
You do it more, it doesn't hurt.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.410
- And through a window,

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.210
my understanding is that through a window,

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.470
it dramatically decreases
the amount of light energy

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.280
coming in.
- It depends on how thick

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.230
the windows are and how dark they are.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.580
So, but it's also nice to go outside

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.490
and to feel the seasons.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.090
- Sunglasses off?

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.580
- I don't use sunglasses.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.100
- Yeah, but you have your
Jordanian photopigment.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.230
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.
- You know, so, yeah.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.380
Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.240
- No, but I personally,
if I'm in the shade

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.240
or if it's not incredibly bright,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.567
I try to, especially in the morning,

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.630
but I'm also an early person.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.813
So we have to differentiate between early-

00:25:04.813 --> 00:25:06.270
- What time do you wake up?

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.553
- I wake up at 4:30 in the morning.

00:25:07.553 --> 00:25:10.220
- But the sun isn't out yet.
- It's not out yet, so it's-

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.053
- So, what do you do?

00:25:11.053 --> 00:25:12.160
You turn on artificial lights?

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.210
- I usually don't turn on artificial light

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.560
because I know the sun is
going to come up eventually,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.000
but that's why I don't like the change

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.123
in the timing that they do.

00:25:21.123 --> 00:25:23.790
- Wait, but what do you do
between 4:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.?

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.530
- I mean, I look at my computer,

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.363
and my phone.
- Oh, I see.

00:25:26.363 --> 00:25:28.005
- So possibly I get enough light,

00:25:28.005 --> 00:25:32.030
but in reality, I mean as
long as you let your body

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.860
get the morning sunlight,
which I think is really,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.690
to me and there is no evidence of this,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.900
but to me, if you look
at all animals, plants,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.660
this morning sunlight
seems to be very important.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.430
And we don't have experiments to show it,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.290
but I have a gut feeling that it

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.710
has a huge impact on humans.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.440
- Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab
at the Stanford Sleep Lab

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.160
has shown that these early
morning light flashes

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.680
can adjust the total amount of sleep-

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.290
- Absolutely.
- That one will get.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.462
It makes it easier to get into sleep.

00:26:01.462 --> 00:26:03.570
- Absolutely, absolutely.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:08.270
And Ken Wright also did this
beautiful camping experiments

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.421
that showed that-
- Maybe you could describe

00:26:10.421 --> 00:26:11.254
those 'cause those are
beautiful experiments.

00:26:11.254 --> 00:26:13.210
- Oh, yeah, they are
beautiful experiments.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.480
He took these college
students that had a late onset

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.680
of sleep and late waking time,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.210
and then he said, let's go
camping and just don't use

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.150
any artificial light and
you could go to sleep

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.810
as late or as early as you want,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.330
and wake up as late or as early.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.040
And he found a huge shift
in their sleep pattern

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.450
just by exposing them
to the light-dark cycle.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.700
I mean, so-
- And it has lasted.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.396
- And it lasted, yeah.
- Even after they came back.

00:26:39.396 --> 00:26:40.900
- Exactly.
- Those two days of camping

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.420
reset the circadian clock?
- Seven days, but it lasted.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.990
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.800
Yeah, it's really incredible.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.450
- Okay, so get bright light
of some sort early in the day,

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.690
ideally sunlight, even on a
cloudy day, it's going to be-

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.740
- Absolutely.
- Brighter than indoor light.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.640
- So that's easy.
- Okay, so then-

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.570
- And the other thing that
I would like to mention

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.420
to people, if you think
it's very dim outside,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.610
let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.350
So remember intensity
is only one component.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.390
Duration is also
important because remember

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.010
that the circadian system is
not like the image system.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.370
In the image system you
have to change every second

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.020
because you're looking
at different objects.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.843
You have to change your perception.

00:27:18.843 --> 00:27:22.170
But for the circadian system
it's trying to figure out

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.970
where am I in the day-night cycle?

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.040
So the more you give them the information,

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.030
the better you are.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.067
So, if it's very bright,
you don't need a lot

00:27:30.067 --> 00:27:33.710
because it's clearly going
to make you fire like crazy.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.990
But if it's not bright, stay
longer, stay for one hour.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.750
You know, have your coffee
outside or something like that.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.833
It's just going to help.

00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:43.090
- I think you said something
extremely important,

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.470
which is that this circadian
system is trying to figure out

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.670
when you are in time.
- Exactly.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:49.707
- Not where you are in space.

00:27:49.707 --> 00:27:50.887
- Sorry, I said, where you are in time.

00:27:50.887 --> 00:27:52.580
- Yeah.
- I mean when you are.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.730
- Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.426
I just meant that I think
fundamentally that's

00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:58.910
the incredible thing about this system.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.010
- Absolutely.
- That you have this clock,

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.840
this 24 hour clock in your brain,

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.590
but it needs to be
synchronized to the outside.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:09.810
So could we go a little deeper
into this circadian setting

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.370
behavior and come up with
some general rules of thumb?

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.867
So, let's say it's a very bright day.

00:28:14.867 --> 00:28:17.310
- Mm hm, mm hm.
- Extremely bright.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.563
No clouds, the sun's out.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.747
You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.

00:28:22.747 --> 00:28:25.080
- And I'll tell you if you're sensitive,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.760
you don't even have to go in the sun.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.160
You could be in the shade.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.290
There's going to be so many
photons out there in the shade.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.330
It's going to be perfect.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.400
You don't even have to see the sun.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.960
You don't have to have the sun.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.360
You know, it's great for vitamin D,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.320
that's a different story.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.210
You could do this for your
skin and protect your skin.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.820
That's not my area of expertise,

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.770
but for that effect on
the circadian system,

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.720
as long as you're outside in
the shade and it's sunny day,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.600
10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.070
- Okay and then let's say
it's kind of overcast.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.360
You know, it's not particularly bright

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.920
or there's solid cloud cover,
but obviously the sun is out,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.310
but it's not as bright.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.200
How long do you think it
would take to set the clock?

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.340
- 10 to 15 should be sufficient.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.520
Stay for half an hour.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.790
Stay for 45 minutes.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.530
If it's very darker out, stay for longer.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.400
- Okay and if for some reason,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.580
one finds themselves very far north,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.600
and it's very, very dense a cloud cover.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.010
How long and at what point
should somebody consider

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.210
using an artificial light
source to mimic the sunlight?

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.570
- Yeah, honestly, this
is where we don't have

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.880
a lot of information still,
because this is where

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.230
we're going to discuss
this maybe in more detail,

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.060
that if you put humans
in artificial conditions,

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.590
the circadian system is
very sensitive to light,

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.860
but in reality, in the real environment,

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.620
light also is affecting other
aspects that are independent

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.300
of the setting of the circadian pacemaker.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.800
- Okay.
- And these which we call

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.960
the direct effect of light
on mood, for example.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.160
So, that is very hard to figure out

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.760
what intensity you need to use.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.937
And we haven't done enough experiments

00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:07.883
'cause this system has been
discovered just recently.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.710
But I would say if you use
bright light in the morning,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.700
and I mean, it's hard
for me to give numbers.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.073
It can get complicated.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.510
But yeah, I mean, honestly,
if you're that far north

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.370
and you're in the winter
and you make sure you don't,

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.610
use these light boxes.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.810
I would suggest that
personally, but that's it.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.750
- I use, it's actually not
designed for circadian setting,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.990
but I have a 930 lux
light pad that I bought

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.410
and I bought it, they're
very affordable compared

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.520
to the dawn simulating lights.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.353
- Yeah, you don't need them.

00:30:41.353 --> 00:30:43.340
- Which are quite expensive, frankly.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.790
- Yeah.
- And I put it there.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.050
And so, just basically, when
I wake up in the morning,

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.850
I use that until the sun comes out,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.230
and then I make sure once
the sun is out, I go outside.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.330
But I keep that thing on all day.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.130
And I don't know if that's good or bad.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.963
Is a good or bad?

00:30:55.963 --> 00:30:59.400
- I, honestly, I don't think
being exposed to bright light

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.730
in the day is going to
ever be bad because really

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.800
if you're outside in the day...

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.110
Unless, you know, the worst
that's going to happen

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.700
if the temperature is very high,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.400
your body's going to say don't
dehydrate and go to sleep.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.000
So you could tell actually
sometimes when it's very hot,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.860
the more you get exposed to bright light,

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.800
the sleepier you feel in the afternoon,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.837
which is counter-intuitive.
- Mm hm.

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:23.370
And that's to protect us, you
think, against dehydration?

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.070
- I think if you think
about the human evolution

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.380
from near the equator in between noon

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.590
and a certain time in the afternoon,

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.640
it would have been very
hard for you to maintain

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.670
physiological homeostatic function,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.740
being active at this very
high temperature time.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.090
So I think napping was a way,

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.120
that's why I think it has a
major function which is still...

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.810
Napping was a way to somehow take you away

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.230
from that dangerous zone.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.080
And maybe that's why people
in the north they say,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.150
in the winter we can't
wake up in the morning

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:55.730
'cause they don't have this long light.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.320
So, they sleep more at night.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.400
But in the summer they say,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.360
we feel like we can't go to sleep.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.950
We have to put all these dark curtains.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.950
So, I think, venturing that
much up north has been...

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.280
Came up with a problem
because evolution was used to

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.910
a certain light environment
that was completely

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.370
changed with a human.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.363
With other animals, I think
that lived there longer,

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.750
they have come up with
very interesting adaptation

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.180
of actually measuring
even very small changes

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.360
in the light intensities that still occur.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.310
And so, even if you're near the poles,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.940
even though it's always light,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.110
but there is a change
in the light intensity

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.210
across the day-night cycle.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.060
So, your system, if it's linear,

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.870
and remember I told you that
ipRCGs are incredibly linear,

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.529
can still measure, oh, this is
lower light than higher light

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:49.780
if the organism has
the ability to do that.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.230
- I see, yeah, it's interesting.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:54.560
I've spent so much time learning from you

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.620
fortunately about these cells,

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.090
and yet I never really
appreciated until now

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:03.190
how on the one hand they are
tracking the amount of light

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.470
to understand when we are in time

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.860
relative to the 24 hour cycle,

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.210
but also that you keep mentioning this

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.900
linear measurement of intensity;

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.900
that they really are trying to figure out

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.307
when we are in time by measuring
the intensity of light.

00:33:16.307 --> 00:33:19.000
And of course the sun is
the most intense source

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.050
of light available to us.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.220
So, okay, so I think we've nailed down

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.970
that first part of the day.
- Exactly.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.630
- Basically it's get 10 to 30 minutes

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.050
depending on how bright it is,

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.220
and try and do that as often
as possible to give the system

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.283
a regular source-
- Daily is the best.

00:33:33.283 --> 00:33:36.130
This system is really about,

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.490
and you'll see that even for
the effect on depression,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.610
it's about multiple days it is.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.610
So you don't have to worry
if you missed it one day,

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.170
stay longer if you want.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.170
But if you're in a hurry and
you want to do other stuff,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.360
that's a great recommendation.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.020
- Mm hm, so you might want to
compensate with some extra time

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.770
if you missed a day or two.
- Absolutely.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.920
- And this is why I've
heard you say before,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.970
it's entirely possible to
get severely jet lagged

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.770
without traveling.
- Absolutely.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.040
- Simply by staying in,
being on your phone too much,

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.937
not getting the sunlight.
- Absolutely.

00:34:03.937 --> 00:34:06.100
And you saw this during the pandemic.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.730
A lot of people mentioned that their

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.863
sleep-wake cycles suffered a lot.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.790
Because if you're not going
out and if you're staying

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.420
at home and you don't have big windows

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.770
and you're waking late, waking up late,

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.560
and then you're using very
bright light too late at night,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.210
your body is going to shift.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.380
And now, your day is going
to start instead of like

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.620
really when the sun comes up,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.990
let's say at six o'clock in the morning,

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:32.120
so your day is going to start
at 11 o'clock in the morning.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.700
That's what your body's going to think

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.820
is the beginning of the day.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.410
So, then you're not
going to be able to sleep

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.740
at 10 o'clock at night,

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.113
because now that's really for your body,

00:34:43.113 --> 00:34:45.390
it's completely different timing.

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:48.060
And you could see this
happen during the pandemic

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.810
at a very high scale.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.720
People get delayed in their
sleep-wake cycle a lot.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.833
- And there is this idea of chronotypes,

00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:59.150
that we all each intrinsically
have a best rhythm

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.093
of either being a morning person.

00:35:01.093 --> 00:35:01.926
- Absolutely.
- You called yourself

00:35:01.926 --> 00:35:03.780
an early person, or a night owl,

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.910
or more of a kind of
standard to bed around 10:30,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.081
up around 7:00 type thing.

00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:11.300
And I think there are now good data,

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.870
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.090
from the National Institutes
of Mental Health and elsewhere

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:19.160
showing that the more we deviate
from that intrinsic rhythm,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.260
the more mental health issues

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.150
and physical health
issues start to crop up.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.950
- So, there is great data on this,

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.160
and there is a couple of
things that complicate this.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.530
The first is the people
who usually are late,

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.084
they tell you that the
society doesn't accommodate.

00:35:33.084 --> 00:35:34.940
- By late, what do you mean?

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.100
People that wake up late
and go to sleep late?

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.146
- Go to sleep late and wake up late.

00:35:38.146 --> 00:35:41.010
They have an overwhelmingly higher level

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.510
of depression and failures.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.690
I mean, clearly, I mean,

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.437
the reason the people say
sleep early, wake up early,

00:35:48.437 --> 00:35:51.570
you're better because
human notice that people

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.310
who go to sleep early and wake up early,

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.460
they do better in life.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.360
They notice that.
- They just perform better?

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.900
- They perform, but the question is,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.450
is that intrinsic to the
system or is that society

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:05.090
because society start things
usually early or late?

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.040
That's a hard question to ask-

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.940
- We discriminate against late risers.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.640
- In a way, we discriminate, right?

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.633
But the other explanation
is Ken Wright's experiment.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.130
These late riser, if they were
truly chronotypically late,

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.730
why would they shift so easily
when you put them in the...

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.930
If you were really chronotypically late,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.190
and there is a phase relation between

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.830
the light-dark environment
and your circadian clock,

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.600
then doing this camping
experiment should not have caused

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.600
much changes because it's not
that light is going to affect you

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.570
in a certain way, it's that
this is the relationship

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.820
that your body decided that I'm
a late sleeper, late waking.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.140
So, I'm honestly, I'm
still unable to figure out

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.030
how much of this late
waking up is controlled

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.820
by the light environment
and how much is intrinsic.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.850
I'm sure there are differences,

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.580
but are they as big as we
see in the environment?

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.890
Because you have people that
go off to sleep a 7:00 p.m.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.130
and wake up at 1:00 a.m..

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.210
These are clearly advanced phase-

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.020
- So people that go to sleep at 7:00 p.m.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.400
and wake up at 1:00 a.m.?
- Yeah.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.070
- And feel good doing that?

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.760
- I'm not so sure they feel good,

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.800
but a lot of the time you talk to people,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.060
they say they are high achievers,

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.360
but they suffer because
they go to 7:00 p.m.,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.723
wake up advanced phase sleep syndrome.

00:37:23.732 --> 00:37:27.390
They call it a syndrome,
but then you have people

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.937
who would not be able
to sleep till 5:00 a.m.,

00:37:29.937 --> 00:37:33.600
and not be able to wake
up till 3:00 p.m., right?

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.920
And I'm not so sure that
the circadian system

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.150
is that variable in the human population.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.760
I mean, clearly there are
maybe some genetic factors

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.870
that make a small percentage
of like everything

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.460
with the bell shape.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.150
But I think most of the time,

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.140
the light environment may play a role.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.500
And once, as we've talked about,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.840
this as a long-term effect of light.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.420
Once you get into a rhythm,
and I don't mean it as a pun,

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.440
in reality, once you get into a rhythm,

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.780
it's hard to break out of that
rhythm because if you start

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.840
sleeping late and waking up late,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.800
you're not getting the morning sunlight.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.940
- Right.
- And so,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.650
you're just going to be late.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.980
And if you're like me waking up early,

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.907
you're getting the morning sunlight.

00:38:12.907 --> 00:38:14.657
You're getting what Zeitzer said...

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:17.880
I said his last name wrong.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.060
The one in Stanford who did the-

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.570
- Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah.
- Zeitzer, yeah.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.556
- [Andrew] He actually worked for-

00:38:25.556 --> 00:38:26.389
- Zeitzer, yeah.
- Zeitzer.

00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:27.550
So, Zeitzer and Czeisler.
- Yeah, it's confusing.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.470
- Yeah, there are a lot of
zz's and i's in their names.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.930
- Yeah.
- Both phenomenal scientists.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.600
- Yeah.
- What it seems to me

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.320
is the case is that the
only way to really know

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.360
if you're meant to be an
early bird as they call it,

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.530
an early person or a late person,

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.270
or somewhere in between is
to get morning sunlight,

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.260
and figure out whether or not
that makes you feel better.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.063
- And to understand,

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.727
to be educated about how
to measure intensity.

00:38:54.727 --> 00:38:57.210
"How to measure" I put in quotation

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.770
'cause you either get a measuring device,

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.729
but you cannot depend on your
eye to measure intensity.

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:04.562
- Okay, so how do we do that?

00:39:04.562 --> 00:39:06.367
'Cause you keep coming back to this.

00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:08.186
So, that tells me that it's important.

00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:09.260
- It's very important.
- So, obviously,

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.860
so there are apps, free
apps like Light Meter,

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.610
where you can walk around
and hold the button down

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.030
and see how many lux
are in the environment.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.090
- These are complicated
because you have to point them

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.260
to specific regions.
- Right.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:25.130
So, how do people start to
develop an intuitive sense

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:27.320
of the measurement of intensity?

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.940
- Yeah, I think at one
point I posted on Instagram,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.570
how I keep my nighttime at home.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.960
And I found out that my
night vision is very strong.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.670
So I found out that I,
especially in the winter,

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.230
I only need candle lights.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.327
So I literally use these tea lights,

00:39:43.327 --> 00:39:45.860
and I put like 15 or 20 of them-

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.810
- How romantic.
- And it's so nice.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.743
I could see it clearly doesn't
affect my circadian system.

00:39:50.743 --> 00:39:53.346
- You and your cats-
- And my wife.

00:39:53.346 --> 00:39:55.860
- And your wife of course.
- It's just great, right?

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.310
But I don't expect people to have

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.420
the same night vision as me.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.050
So, I mean, I tell
people, do the experiment.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.270
So if you put three or
four lights in your room,

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.680
switch two, sit for 15 minutes.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.230
- Switch two off?
- Switch two off.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.770
Let's say you're using five.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.630
And see, after 15 minutes,

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.400
you will not recognize you
switched these two off.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.830
My gut feeling is that
most people would need

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:24.040
at least 10 times less light
than they use at night to see.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.530
The problem people use it

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.210
because most of the time they didn't

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:28.320
see the morning sunlight.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.100
They are actually hungry for
light without their knowledge.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.060
So they come switch all these lights on,

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.760
but at the wrong time.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.220
Because they woke up late.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.854
- Okay, now I understand.

00:40:37.854 --> 00:40:41.510
So, this morning light
viewing goes way beyond-

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.000
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- Setting your clock.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.350
It's also a way to
determine how little light

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.262
you need later in the day.
- Exactly.

00:40:48.262 --> 00:40:50.170
- And we're going to talk
about this in a moment,

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.250
but how little light
you get later in the day

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.260
is a very strong
determinant of things like

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.120
when you will wake up,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.410
whether or not you wake up
feeling refreshed, et cetera.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.290
Let's move-
- And that's why,

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.440
- Yeah?
- I'm going to break it

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.050
on your show, Andrew, that
I'm going to tell you,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.470
I think there is
something else that people

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.580
do need to think about, which
is the tripartite model.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.370
That this model incorporate
three components

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:16.200
we should talk about in
details that allows us humans

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.410
and all animals to incorporate
the circadian clock,

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:24.090
and its relation to light,
the homeostatic drive,

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.200
and the direct effect of the environment,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.210
which includes stress,
light, all kinds of stuff.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.360
They have to be incorporated together.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.087
If you think, that's
what I think right now,

00:41:33.087 --> 00:41:37.848
if you think of one alone, you
will always miss something.

00:41:37.848 --> 00:41:40.000
And when you think of them as a whole,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.520
things really become clear.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.060
It's actually quite amazing.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.580
- Okay, well, we will
definitely want to hear

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.730
about your tripartite
theory and go into detail

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.670
about those homeostatic mechanisms.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:54.020
I want to make sure that for
people who are thinking now,

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.910
I'm sure about light
and how it impacts them.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.980
So the morning light viewing behavior,

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.342
I like to think we've tacked down clearly.

00:42:01.342 --> 00:42:02.210
- Absolutely.
- And thank you for that

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.960
because there's so much
information out there

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.060
and I've tried to relay that information.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.320
Of course, you're my primary source

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.740
for all things circadian,
as well as Jamie and others,

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.060
of course, and Matt Walker.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.980
But I think you've made
that very, very clear.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.710
Now, let's say I've gotten
my morning sunlight.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.543
Okay, great.

00:42:20.543 --> 00:42:21.650
Maybe my bright artificial light,

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.890
and throughout the day you
said to get a lot of light.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:25.050
So, I'm working at my desk.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:27.900
Maybe I'll go out during
the day a few times,

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.550
but I'm working at my
computer, I'm doing things.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.130
Is there anything about light viewing

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:35.560
in the middle of the day that
people should keep in mind?

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.690
Or can they just sort of freestyle it

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.580
depending on what they're doing?

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.990
Most people are not in a
dark room throughout the day-

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.380
- Yeah, so my gut feeling,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.570
if you've got your morning sunlight,

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:49.740
you walk from your car
slowly or you walk to work,

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.440
you didn't wear sunglasses when the lights

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.040
were still dim in the morning,
that you could freestyle it.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.470
That even if you don't get a lot of light,

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.500
there is a way to just...

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.730
In the day, you don't
have to just worry about

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.860
getting a lot of bright light,

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.870
but personally, I like to do that.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.720
So I go out at lunch and have
my lunch outside as well.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.610
This reminds the body that
here it is even brighter now.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.670
But the evidence is
that you could literally

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.430
help your circadian clock by
giving lights at dawn and dusk.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.890
But again, if you think
of the tripartite model,

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.120
this may be important
for the circadian clock,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.940
but is it important for your mood?

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.310
So that's where I think you
need, or the homeostatic drive.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.680
So that's where you
need to think about it.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.820
So, for the clock, for
entraining your clock,

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.850
you literally can entrain it
only by the dawn sunlight.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.910
You actually don't need dawn and dusk.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:42.840
People usually forget that.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.870
- Yeah and I appreciate
that you're distinguishing

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.283
between circadian effects
and other effects of lights.

00:43:47.283 --> 00:43:48.840
- Yes.
- You're being very precise,

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.630
which is appreciated.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.680
Until we hear about this tripartite model,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.350
which we will cover, for
the sake of the discussion,

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.640
let's treat the light viewing behavior

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.300
as what are the benefits or
drawbacks of viewing light

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.440
for all biological purposes,
not just circadian settings?

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.840
So, in the morning, it's
clearly going to set the clock.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.860
And then, during the day,
if I understand correctly,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.890
the idea is to get as much
bright light as you can,

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.560
because you're feeding,
it sounds like a sort of

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.740
light hunger.
- Exactly.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.270
- I see.
- I love this way to put it.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:24.260
I think there is a weird light hunger

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.710
considering that we're not
photosynthetic organisms.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.880
There is a weird light hungers in animals

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.170
that they need measure.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.130
And I think that relates to the season

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.220
because the whole
reproduction cycle of animals

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.740
is going to depend on the availability

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.650
of food in the environment.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:45.290
And if you don't know when
the season is going to happen,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.040
they don't have calendars,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.730
it's going to be very hard to survive.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.100
So I think that's why we
have this light hunger.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.710
That's a major hypothesis.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.860
It's not been tested.
- Interesting.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.120
So, then afternoon and
evening start to approach.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.800
So, I've had this weird experience.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.040
Maybe you can psychologically
or biologically

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.260
diagnosed me now, Samer.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.840
So, where if I go into a
movie in the afternoon,

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.340
like a matinee.
- Uh huh.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.530
- And I come out and it's dark,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.180
I notice a significant drop in my mood

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.840
and my ability to go to sleep.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.410
Whereas if I get some view
of the light in the evening,

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.940
it doesn't have to be the sunset,
although sunsets are nice,

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.810
but I get some light
pulse in the afternoon

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.220
that I have no trouble
whatsoever falling asleep.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.530
- And this happens on a
single time to watch them?

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:35.480
- Yeah, more or less.
- Wow, that's interesting.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.300
- And then you mentioned
the camping experiment

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.440
where when they went camping,

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.988
they're seeing the sunrise and the sunset.

00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:41.170
- [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:44.930
- So what should people
do in the afternoon

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.220
slash evening time in terms of
their light viewing behavior?

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.270
- I mean, the best thing to do is to let

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.150
the natural light creep
into darkness, right?

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.730
That would be the best,

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.110
but clearly that would be inefficient.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.790
You want to go home, you want to read,

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.430
you want to talk to your kids,
you want to talk to your family.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.040
So, I think it's nice to extend the day.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.180
I don't think that's wrong.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.270
If you somehow can block that light

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.140
from affecting your circadian clock.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.440
- So, should people use blue
blockers in the evening?

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.060
- I personally do not like any blockers

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.010
that take a single wavelength of light.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.270
Because again, if you think
of a holistic approach,

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.230
yes, the blue blocker
is going to prevent you

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:29.610
from affecting your
circadian clock very much.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.760
But then your vision is
going to be distorted

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.260
because we always see in full spectrum,

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.900
the sun has this
beautiful spectrum, right?

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.323
And then when you start
seeing without the blue,

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.780
things look yellow and it
can get really weird, right?

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.420
I mean, so I personally,

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.460
I've tried the blue blocker
and I couldn't even wear them.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:53.040
I thought they were just
really horrendous to be honest.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.990
- Well, along the lines of blue blockers,

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.410
I think a lot of people
mistakenly wear them all day long.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.819
- Oh my God, that would be very bad.

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:01.505
- A lot of people do that.
- That would be very bad.

00:47:01.505 --> 00:47:02.338
- A lot of people do that.

00:47:02.338 --> 00:47:04.100
They think that blue light is bad.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.260
I think that the-
- No, no, no.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.970
- The concept of blue light being bad

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.430
led to a lot of product development.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.890
And a lot of people are
just assuming that viewing

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.630
blue light is what was
giving them headaches.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.870
When in fact it might've just been

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.000
looking at screens at
close distance all day.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.213
- So, here's the problem, right?

00:47:19.213 --> 00:47:22.120
I mean, the blue light
got the bad reputation

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.150
because people who gave a pure blue light

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:27.050
showed that it 'caused
a huge retinal damage.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:30.460
But again, if you're using
blue light in its pure form,

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.650
it has a lot of energy because
it's shorter wavelength,

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.440
but we're talking about
full spectrum light.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.000
There are ways now where you could change

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.130
the spectrum of the
light and keep it white

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:46.310
between day and night and
change the content of the color

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:47.630
without you noticing.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.810
So you don't even have
to affect your vision.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.530
- So how would you go about doing that?

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.906
- So, you just lower the
level of the blue light.

00:47:53.906 --> 00:47:54.980
You don't have to eliminate it.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.320
- So just dim the lights?

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.260
- Dim the blue, then increase the yellow,

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.900
but keep all the colors
in a certain white.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.890
So, you know, you could have
different warmness of white.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.290
And people know how to do this.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.690
Physicist know how to do this.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.630
People who work with
light know how to do this.

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.320
- Well, maybe somebody
in the wellness slash,

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.880
I don't like the word, but biohacking,

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.287
or optical community will do this.

00:48:18.287 --> 00:48:20.853
I think it's really important,
I see so many people

00:48:20.853 --> 00:48:22.400
wearing blue blockers.
- They have meetings now.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.080
I don't know why they block-

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.230
- Well, I think they're just uninformed.

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.170
I think, frankly-
- Yeah and to be honest,

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.003
it's easy, right?

00:48:28.003 --> 00:48:31.305
It's easier to explain
to somebody if ipRCGs

00:48:31.305 --> 00:48:34.100
respond mostly to blue,
remove blue, you'll be fine.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:34.933
- Right, right.
- Right?

00:48:34.933 --> 00:48:37.420
But that's not as simple as
that because they also receive

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.380
rod and cone input.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.050
So you want to actually...

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.920
And we could go into details,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.340
that's boring for your listeners,

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.250
but it also affect the adaptation

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.170
properties of the whole retina.

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.640
So you don't want to
do something so drastic

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.850
that you take just one
color of the spectrum.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.530
It just seems very counter
intuitive to me, to be honest.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.640
- You've told me before as well,

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.420
that just because these
intrinsically photosensitive

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:07.230
circadian setting ganglion cells
respond best to blue light,

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.210
if the light is bright enough
because they also get input

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.410
from other components of the eye,

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.660
it doesn't matter if you block the blues.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.550
- Yeah.
- If you're looking

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:16.560
at bright light at night,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.010
you're going to disrupt
your circadian cycle.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.523
- Absolutely and that's
why I didn't want to

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.930
go into the boring details,

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:24.050
but themselves, the
photoreceptors have a wide range

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:25.370
of responsiveness.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.400
So they are more sensitive to blue light,

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.350
but that doesn't mean they
don't respond to green light

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.250
or to shorter than blue light.

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.350
They respond to very, very wide spectrum

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:37.050
with different sensitivity.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:40.690
So unless you understand the
system just removing 480,

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.520
I don't think it's going to do-
- 480 nanometers, yeah.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.520
So, your home is a cave at
night basically with some-

00:49:48.691 --> 00:49:50.660
- It's a nice cave.
- It's nice cave.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.720
- Yeah.
- With candles.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.712
- That's right.
- Right and you and your cats-

00:49:53.712 --> 00:49:56.200
- And I watch TV and dim it.
- And your lovely wife.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.080
- Yeah.
- Who I know, who's also

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.093
a phenomenal scientist in her own right.

00:49:58.093 --> 00:50:00.092
- Thank you, yeah, she is.

00:50:00.092 --> 00:50:01.890
- She is.

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.480
But you do keep your home quite dim

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.160
to dark at night?
- Yeah.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.110
In fact, I did go to meetings
with some of my friends

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.320
who work on this and they
really struggled with me.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.950
They said we could have
broken our legs living

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.010
in the same light environment that you do.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.490
So I am an extreme, but
I measured it for myself.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.940
And I asked, Rejji, my
wife, if she's okay with it.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.270
She also liked the dimness.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:27.180
Both of us can see well in dim conditions.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.403
And that helps us a lot,

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.780
but I think you have to
measure it for yourself.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.010
You really have to...

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.500
It's a very simple experiment.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.050
Just try to dim the
light as much as you can.

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:41.570
I call it the minimum amount of light

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.290
you require to see comfortably.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.030
- And that's how you want your environment

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.200
ideally at night?
- At night.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.000
This is what I think is the game changer.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.440
If you reach to a level
where it's just barely,

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.630
you're literally on the
cusp of seeing uncomfortably

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.830
versus seeing very comfortably,

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.370
you are going to be very much better than

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.310
I don't like to make it completely dark.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.550
I think complete darkness induce anxiety

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:08.810
in humans, to be honest.

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.193
So I don't like complete darkness.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.530
- Kids don't like complete darkness.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:14.793
They like a nightlight.
- Even animal,

00:51:14.793 --> 00:51:17.600
even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.070
I mean, we have studies in
animals that are nocturnal,

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.700
that if you put them in complete
darkness for several weeks,

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:28.290
they have severe anxiety
and depression like effect.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:33.290
So keep the light dim, use
red light that is very dim,

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:36.810
if you want to keep the room for sleeping.

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:40.310
Red light that is very
dim has very small effect

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.260
on the circadian clock.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.020
And below 10 lux of red light,

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.450
literally doesn't affect sleep at all.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.103
So there are ways to do it.

00:51:49.103 --> 00:51:51.270
It's just we need to educate the public.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:55.610
And I feel like you literally
need a whole lecture

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.307
to just explain to the
people how to deal with light

00:51:58.307 --> 00:52:01.120
because it's not as
simple as people think.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.310
- Well, that's what we're doing here.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:03.250
- Yeah.
- We're stepping through it

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:06.375
piece by piece and the
reason we're doing that

00:52:06.375 --> 00:52:08.180
is because it's not as simple as saying,

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.370
just block blue light or get
a lot of light during the day,

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.287
and minimal at night.
- I mean, just to put it

00:52:11.287 --> 00:52:14.350
in perspective and tell that we only have

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.260
three different cones in our retina

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:20.070
that respond to three different colors.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.160
We call them red cones for simplicity,

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.310
green cones and blue cones.

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.130
Yet we have only three of these,

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:30.670
but we could see massive
palette of colors.

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.340
So that tells you something.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.820
If the system was just
simply about a single color

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.950
and us just removing 480
or just blue is sufficient,

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.460
then we should only see
in red, yellow, and blue.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:45.160
We shouldn't see all these
different hues of color,

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.420
but because the system is not that,

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.750
we see all these different colors.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.990
And that's why it's
important to remind people

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:55.540
that the white light is made
of many different colors.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.990
It's actually like the rainbow.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.680
That's why you see the rainbow,
it's made of many colors.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.640
White light is never truly white.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.860
It's made of lot of different colors.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.440
- It's like the Pink Floyd album cover.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.714
- Exactly.
- With the light coming

00:53:06.714 --> 00:53:07.683
through the prism.
- Exactly, exactly.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.000
- So, dim at night, maybe
dim red light ideally,

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.833
or candle light.

00:53:13.833 --> 00:53:16.987
Find that minimum required light level.

00:53:16.987 --> 00:53:19.400
- Test it, just make sure
when you lower the lights,

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.730
sit for at least 10 to 15
minutes, let your system adapt.

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.670
Because if you had a bright
light and you switch it off,

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.700
surely you're going to
suffer because your system

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.910
didn't adapt yet; it was
used to very bright light.

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.910
So you want to engage your rods,

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:36.770
which take a long time to dark adapt.

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:39.640
So that's why I tell you,
just wait a little bit.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.380
Don't just switch it off and
now I don't see, put it on.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.740
Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes,

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.580
ideally 15 minutes and
then see how you see.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.930
And then once you do that,
you will notice that actually,

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.713
yeah, I could see quite well
even with much less light.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.450
- What do you do regarding screens?

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.520
- Yeah, that's the hardest thing.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.330
Again, I mean, there
are beautiful programs

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:08.740
that change the whole intensity
and color of the screen.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.070
These could help dim your screen at night

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:12.020
to the lowest part.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.480
I mean, yes, you won't see it

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.570
when you wake up in the morning,

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.830
but then you can increase that intensity.

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:18.230
So, try to decrease.

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.310
I mean, just what we were talking about.

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:25.170
Think of light intensity,
duration, color, and time of day.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:28.750
You really have to keep these
four things together, right?

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.240
- We've roomed together
at a couple meetings

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.660
from time to time, no longer,

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:36.780
because one of us not to be
named has a severe snoring issue

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.259
that made the other one pseudo-homicidal.

00:54:39.259 --> 00:54:41.300
[Samer laughing]

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.823
You can guess who that was.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:47.460
But I've seen you check your phone

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.400
after dark once or twice.
- Mm hm.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.170
- And you did it by sort
of pointing your phone

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.557
away from you, right?
- Exactly, yep, absolutely.

00:54:55.557 --> 00:54:58.164
- And actually I'm sort of half joking,

00:54:58.164 --> 00:54:59.500
and you dim it quite a bit.
- Yeah, dim it quite a lot.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.470
- I'm sort of half joking,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.730
but it actually makes
sense that if you shine

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:03.790
a flashlight in your eye,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:04.623
it's much brighter than
if you shine a flashlight-

00:55:04.623 --> 00:55:06.470
- Light only go in direct line,

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:08.160
so if you'd just look on the side,

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.860
most of the light is going to go this way,

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.650
and you're only seeing this way.

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:13.820
- Okay, so, and as
silly as that might seem

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.460
to people listening, I mean what it means

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.770
is that getting bright
light in your eyes at night

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:21.540
is something that you
really want to avoid.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.010
But there is the reality that-

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.697
- And even when I check
sometimes if I have something,

00:55:26.697 --> 00:55:29.300
and I check it so fast
and switch it off so fast.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.540
So I'm also aware of duration-
- Not my messages.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.780
- I'm also aware of the duration, right?

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.240
So duration, intensity,
color, and time of day.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.180
Ideally I should not
check iPhones an iPads.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.410
I don't use iPad at
night because it's hard

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.480
to lower it enough 'cause it's a huge.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.520
But even my iPhone, I try
not to use it at night.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.490
And like once it becomes 8:30 or 9:00,

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:54.980
I don't look at it at all.
- Unless it's World Cup

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.566
or Euro Cup, in which case
Samer's on 24 hours, everybody.

00:55:57.566 --> 00:56:00.473
- Right, that's only every four years.

00:56:00.473 --> 00:56:02.230
- He's a big soccer fan.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:06.383
All right, this has been
incredibly, no pun, illuminating.

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.450
Let's talk about the
relationship between light

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.600
and some of these other non-circadian

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.890
or pseudo-circadian effects.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:19.180
And we will try and link those.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:23.380
But you had a what I
consider absolutely landmark

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.940
beautiful paper published
in "Nature" a few years ago,

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.940
showing that if you disrupt
the exposure to light

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:35.000
or the timing of the exposure to light

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.150
that there are dramatic
effects on the stress system

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:40.050
and on the learning and memory system.

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.080
Maybe we could talk about each of those

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.980
separately or together.

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.070
What are the effects on stress
and the effects on learning

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:50.990
when light viewing behavior

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:53.350
and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted?

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:57.591
- Yeah, so just to remind
you, you know that,

00:56:57.591 --> 00:57:00.480
but to remind your
listeners that I was trained

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.740
as a circadian biologist.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:06.480
So I really was indoctrinated
into thinking that light

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.670
has to affect the clock,

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:10.170
which then caused all
these different effects.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:11.910
So, that's what I believe.

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:12.760
That's my dogma.

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.700
That's what have made me really happy.

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:19.000
And then Tara LeGates and
Cara Altimus joined the lab

00:57:19.935 --> 00:57:21.417
and we started discussing a lot of data.

00:57:21.417 --> 00:57:24.200
And we said, what if there
is a direct effect of light

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.240
that we're missing, independent
of the circadian clock?

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.990
So this is not an easy
question to us to answer,

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.080
because as we've been talking all along,

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.680
light affects the circadian clock.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.337
So how could you give light
at different times of the day

00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:39.300
and not mess up the circadian clock?

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.040
Luckily, we came up with such a way,

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.950
and that's why it was important
to do these experiments

00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:46.450
the way we did them.

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:48.920
And we proved that this light-dark cycle

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.790
does not disrupt the clock,

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:52.460
there is still a circadian rhythm,

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.900
and does not cause sleep deprivation.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.820
And yet, surprisingly, if you give light

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.160
at the wrong time of the day,

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.760
even without disrupting
the circadian clock

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.010
or without causing sleep deprivation,

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.620
as you mentioned you get
the huge mood changes

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:12.740
in the organisms and you
get learning deficit.

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:17.030
So, this really, and at
the time people have really

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.863
hit us hard.

00:58:17.863 --> 00:58:21.140
I mean, it was really
hard to publish this work

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.730
and you could, yeah.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:23.990
- Well, it came out in "Nature."

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:26.870
- Yeah.
- So in the end you prevailed,

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.370
but I want to make sure that I understand.

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.980
So, you're saying that yes,

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.220
there are effects of light
on the circadian rhythm.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.053
- Absolutely.
- Sleep meaning

00:58:34.053 --> 00:58:36.110
sleep and wakefulness.
- Yes.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:37.420
- And their timing.

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.850
However, there are direct
effects of light on mood

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.893
that can be dissociated from the effects

00:58:42.893 --> 00:58:44.850
on sleep and waking.
- Absolutely.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:47.170
- So if I interpret that correctly,

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:52.170
that could mean that when we
view light and how much light,

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:56.810
could make us feel happier or
less happy or even depressed,

00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.563
stressed, learning, et cetera.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.010
- Bingo.
- Even if we're sleeping

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.920
and waking up at the appropriate time?

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.753
- Bingo.

00:59:04.753 --> 00:59:06.740
I mean, eventually because we're talking

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.060
about the whole system,

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.410
eventually when you start
having the other problems,

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.900
you also develop sleep problems,

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.200
but you're absolutely right.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.307
And in fact, now, research
from Diego Fernandez

00:59:17.307 --> 00:59:21.570
in the lab have found that
now we know that they actually

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.130
require different brain regions.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.200
So we don't only have a theory,

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.940
we don't only have a light environment

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.240
that showed they can be dissociated,

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.320
we know that they use completely
different brain regions.

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.590
So, the SCN that I told you about earlier,

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:36.700
the place where the central pacemaker is,

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.410
the one that receives
direct input from the retina

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:43.090
through the ipRCGs to
adjust your circadian clock

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:46.040
is not the area that
receives the light input

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.070
for mood regulation.

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:49.030
It's a completely different brain region.

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.190
- What's the brain region called?

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:51.050
- So the brain region,

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:54.080
we called it the perihabenular nucleus.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.870
I'm not so sure how good or bad the name,

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:58.020
but it doesn't matter, it's that PHb.

00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.210
And what's really amazing,

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.290
this region also receives direct input

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:04.530
from the ipRCGs, but projects
to areas in the brain

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.270
that are known to regulate mood,

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.590
including the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex,

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.210
which has been studied for many years

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:16.010
to be impacted in the human depression.

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.860
So just by this amazing serendipity

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.860
to find that a region that is
so deep in the advanced brain,

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.070
like the prefrontal cortex
is your executive brain,

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:32.060
one of the most elaborated in humans,

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.240
to see that they receive inputs from

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.260
these ancient photoreceptor
was stunning to us,

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.410
and told us how much we didn't understand

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:43.120
the importance of light
on a human behavior.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.660
- So, how does that finding
inform daily protocols

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.980
for you or for other people?

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.103
I realize you can't leap
always from one paper-

01:00:51.103 --> 01:00:53.710
- Absolutely, yes.
- To daily protocol.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:57.140
But if light indeed does
control prefrontal cortex,

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:01.283
executive function,
learning, stress and mood,

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:05.180
and let's say I'm waking up
each morning and I'm sleeping.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.390
What should I do different?

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.920
- That's why we came up
with the tripartite model

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.160
because yes, we could think
about just adjusting the clock

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.890
with lights in and being
dark throughout the day.

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:16.410
But that may not be important

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.940
for your whole physiological function.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.690
So, now, if we include these
other effects of light,

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:24.670
that's why I prefer to still
get a lot of light in the day.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:26.930
I don't want to be in
very dim light condition

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.040
throughout the day.
- I see.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.690
- So, even though it
doesn't affect your clock,

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:32.130
as you beautifully said, Andrew,

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:34.760
it may affect your mood
and learning and memory.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.610
It may affect your alertness level,

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.550
which is going to allow
you to learn better.

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.160
It may affect your homeostatic drive,

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.490
maybe your homeostatic
factor would go higher

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:45.270
so you could sleep earlier.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:48.530
So it's important to think
of light as stimulating

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.840
all these brain regions,

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.340
which means it's producing more activity,

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.330
which in reality this is how people think

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:57.180
of the homeostatic drive,
that the more active you are,

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.730
the more the homeostatic
drive is built up,

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:01.520
the better you sleep.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.600
So that's why we came up
with the tripartite model

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.550
because as a circadian biologist,

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:08.820
I only thought of light
through the circadian clock

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.250
affecting behavior.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.860
As a sleep biologist, they
only thought of the homeostatic

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.810
drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:18.600
And for people who study light
for vision and other form,

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.010
they thought only of
the environmental input.

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.870
But now if you put them all together,

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:24.710
you get with this tripartite model

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:26.660
where it's really mind boggling.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.320
And it makes so much sense.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.630
The organism doesn't want to
depend on a single component,

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:34.700
but if you could incorporate
these three together,

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.090
you could have a beautiful
system that is well adapted.

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.350
So let me tell you the
sleep-wake cycle, right?

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.810
So we know that there
is a homeostatic drive

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:43.643
to affect sleep.

01:02:43.643 --> 01:02:45.890
You've had beautiful talks about that.

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.510
- Which is basically
the longer you're awake,

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:48.527
the more you want to be asleep.

01:02:48.527 --> 01:02:50.320
- So, that's your homeostatic drive.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.890
We've talked about the
circadian influence of sleep

01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:54.970
and the fact that light-dark cycle

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:58.070
affect the circadian system,
which eventually affects sleep.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.290
So these two components
are well understood.

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:03.180
Now the third factor is your direct light

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.770
or environmental input.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:07.290
How much stress, how much
light you get from there

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.660
also can highly impact sleep.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:13.320
So even if you have a good
circadian and homeostatic drive,

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.800
if you're getting light at
the wrong time of the day,

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.090
or if you're being stressed
and thinking a lot,

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.830
then your sleep is going to suffer.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.660
So you have to think of the three together

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.070
to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle.

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:26.410
- I see.
- And that's why

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:28.120
we came up with the tripartite model.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.700
The same thing happens with feeding.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.750
I could beautifully put it to people.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.290
Your hunger, your energy level is measured

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.150
by the arcuate nucleus.

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.300
Your daily intake of food is again,

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.120
dependent on the SCN and light-dark input.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.970
We found that if food is not available,

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:48.530
there is yet a third input that
is not depending on the SCN,

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:49.820
not depend on the arcuate,

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.860
depending on a completely
different brain regions.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.020
So the animal can actually start looking

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.560
or the human can start looking
for food when it's scarce,

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.560
even at time when they are
not supposed to be active.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.210
So, that's how the organism think,

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:07.400
they have to evaluate multiple
inputs for them to decide

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.270
what is the best physiological outcome

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:11.350
at that moment, at that season?

01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:12.980
- I see.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.730
So, I want to get into
arcuate and feeding,

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:17.420
but just to make sure
we can keep our hands

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.550
around this tripartite model.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.680
So, if I understand correctly,

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.040
we've got the circadian influence,

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.370
then you've also got the drive to sleep.

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:27.110
- Right.
- Actually, one of the ways

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:30.290
that I think that can be best
understood is if somebody

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.100
ever pulls an all-nighter,

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.400
they get tired around
11:00 or 12:00 or so,

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.530
and then very tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m.,

01:04:38.530 --> 01:04:41.113
but then even if you stay
up sometime right around

01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:42.870
7:00 or 8:00 a.m., your
normal wake up time,

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:44.210
you start to feel alert again.

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.520
- Exactly.
- And that's because

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.000
the sleep drive is extremely strong,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.840
but there's a circadian rhythm that drives

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.080
wakefulness in the morning.
- Exactly.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.780
- Okay, so that's two are the components.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.760
- [Samer] Right.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.330
- Before we get into
the feeding component,

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:56.570
I want to talk about these direct effects

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:58.060
of light on mood.
- Mm hm.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.913
- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.600
And this perihabenular thing.
- Sure.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.630
- So, let's just for the
moment set aside the tri part

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.650
of the tripartite model and just focus on

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:12.060
what are the direct
effects of light on mood?

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.400
And the way that I interpret
what you've said so far

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.630
is that the protocol
that emerges from this

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:19.470
if one trying to optimize their mood is,

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:22.830
yes, see light, view light I
should say, early in the day,

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:24.610
in order to set your circadian clock.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.580
Maybe also in the evening as well.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.710
And of course, avoid light at night,

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:30.510
get it as dim as possible.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:35.510
However, you said, it's
also a good idea to get

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:38.920
as much bright light during
the day as you safely can,

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.520
in order to improve
your mood independently

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.047
of regulating your sleep-wake cycle.

01:05:43.047 --> 01:05:44.410
- And that's the hypothesis.

01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.170
Here's the problem where
it's not going to be

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:49.220
as satisfying as the
circadian is that as you know,

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:52.110
this brain region has been
discovered very recently.

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:54.020
- Habenula?
- The perihabenular region.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.390
- Well, we've known about it a long time,

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.320
but nobody knew what it did.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.637
- So, we knew about the habenula,

01:05:57.637 --> 01:05:59.760
but that's why the name is confusing.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.777
It's actually not the habenula itself.

01:06:01.777 --> 01:06:03.460
It's the perihabenular.
- Oh, near the habenula.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.320
- It's near the habenula.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.230
- Why don't you just call
it the Samer Hattar nucleus?

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.063
- I should have.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.550
I don't know why I haven't done that.

01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:10.510
- Maybe 'cause if you
do that, it's not okay.

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:14.510
Okay, so for here ever after
the perihabenular nucleus,

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:16.223
we should probably call it the Hattar-

01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:17.056
- The Hattar-Fernandez.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.800
- How about
Hattar-Fernandez-Berson nucleus.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.840
- Yeah, that should-
- Okay, this is like nerdy

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.240
science attribution stuff,
but I'm just going to call it

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.740
the Hattar nucleus.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.083
Wikipedia, line it up.

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:29.380
Okay, so this structure is taking light,

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.350
and independent of sleep
rhythms and circadian rhythms,

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:34.180
it's driving changes in mood.
- Something.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.060
- How does it do that?

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:35.893
Is this through the dopamine system?

01:06:35.893 --> 01:06:38.980
The serotonin system?
- We still recently,

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.164
we haven't identified
this region very well.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.760
We don't know what light does to it.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.740
We don't know how it interacts.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.660
So this is an area that
is ripe for discoveries

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.680
and we're working on this right now.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.810
But that's why I said,
it's not satisfying.

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:54.060
This is like the function of sleep.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.230
Why do we sleep?

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.090
We know sleep is very important to us,

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:59.410
but we still don't have
a satisfying function

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.970
of why do we sleep, right?

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:02.754
- I see but the why questions-
- We have hypothesis.

01:07:02.754 --> 01:07:05.190
- The why questions, I
think it's our good friend

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:06.620
and colleague at University of Washington,

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.170
Russ Van Gelder, who always says,

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:11.170
when somebody asks why, that
the best answer is just to say,

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:12.950
I wasn't consulted at the design phase.

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:14.310
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right, none of us

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.520
really know why.
- No, but the point is

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.680
maybe I shouldn't have said why,

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.190
what is the function of sleep?

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:20.943
It's still very hard to know.

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:27.253
What is the reason organisms
have to go offline for so long?

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:29.880
You know, people assume it's for repair,

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.367
assume it's for learning and memory,

01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:32.730
assume all kind of stuff,

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:37.250
but there is really no
clear function for sleeping.

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:40.059
There is no clear function for sleeping.

01:07:40.059 --> 01:07:42.360
I mean, if you talk to
people, there are hypotheses.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.491
- I mean, all we know is
that if you don't sleep-

01:07:44.491 --> 01:07:45.324
- Exactly.
- Or your sleep

01:07:45.324 --> 01:07:46.777
is very fractured, you get messed up.

01:07:46.777 --> 01:07:48.490
- And you could die even, right?

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:51.760
I mean, it's really
bad if you don't sleep,

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.433
but we don't know what is the function?

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.290
What is that sleep have done to organisms

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:00.810
that couldn't have done with rest?

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:03.050
What if you just could
rest without sleeping?

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.200
Just sit down and rest.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.240
- Well, my lab is trying to
figure out whether or not

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.060
these non-sleep deep rest protocols

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.103
can compensate for sleep.

01:08:10.103 --> 01:08:11.160
- That would be interesting.
- I mean, obviously sleep

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.690
is better, but many people are not getting

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:14.630
the sleep that they need.

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:16.493
- Right.
- But, okay.

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:19.040
So, and if people are
sensing that Samer and I

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.060
are about to start talking
over each other and arguing,

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.150
that's always the goal

01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:23.530
when we talk, right?
- That's right.

01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:25.540
- Unlike other scientists I interact with,

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.720
when Samer and I get together,

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.930
it's considered a successful conversation

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:30.240
if we get into a big fight,

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.740
and then go for a big meal-
- That's right.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.280
- Where I pick the restaurant.
[Samer chuckling]

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.143
Okay, so let's talk about
food and eating and appetite.

01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:44.130
You had yet another, yes, I
greatly admire your success

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.210
in this way, yet another
incredible discovery

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:52.890
showing that there are
direct effects of light

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:55.280
on appetite and feeding behavior.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.460
Okay, maybe you could just summarize

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.570
those results for people.

01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:00.650
- Honestly, that paper is
the one that allowed us

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:02.170
to come with the tripartite model,

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:04.900
because we were thinking
completely wrong about it.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:08.700
We wanted, this experiment,
it'd be fun for your audience

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.930
to hear why we started this experiment.

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:14.070
Remember that when we
discovered the ipRCGs,

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:16.230
we figured if they are the only relay

01:09:17.376 --> 01:09:19.300
to entrain the circadian clock,

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.770
then you could kill them
and have an animal opposite

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:25.300
to the one that we spoke or
a human opposite to the one

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.430
that we spoke about earlier.

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:29.410
Where instead of having no pattern vision

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.570
and have circadian photoentrainment,

01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:34.000
we could produce an animal
that have pattern vision,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.761
but no circadian photoentrainment.

01:09:35.761 --> 01:09:37.580
- Hm, so circadian blind.

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.800
- Circadian blind, but pattern sighted.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.880
And we succeeded in that.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.540
The problem when you have these animals,

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.880
which I've told you many times already

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.710
is that they don't adjust
to the day-night cycle.

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:53.330
So doing experiments on them
become very complicated.

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.830
- What is their behavior like
if you don't have these cells?

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:57.180
Are they awake and then
asleep, awake and then asleep?

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.830
- They just drift like the
humans we've talked about.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:01.351
- They think they're in Las Vegas

01:10:01.351 --> 01:10:03.010
with no clocks or watch-
- They drift, exactly.

01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:04.450
- They stay up later every
night and go to sleep-

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.390
- They can either, depend on their clock.

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:08.610
If their clock is shorter,
they come in earlier.

01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:10.130
If their clock is longer,
they come in later.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:11.170
- So they're really messed up?

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:12.960
- They really don't adjust to it.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.120
If they were in the wild,

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.010
they'll be eliminated in a second, right?

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:18.020
There is no way they'll survive.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.900
So, me and Diego started
talking and we're like,

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.650
what if we use non-light
in training agent?

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:26.860
And what is the strongest
non-light in training agent?

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.020
Food.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.650
So we thought that the
light defective animals

01:10:32.650 --> 01:10:34.870
will have more sensitivity
to food entrainment

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:36.440
because as you know more than me,

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.880
this is an area that you've
worked really well on,

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.020
for vision, if you're image blind,

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.880
your hearing and somatosensory
get improved, right?

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.610
The lack of vision improves
your hearing and sensation.

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:52.110
But we found actually
that if you don't have

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:57.110
the light to system, actually
the food ability to entrain

01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:59.830
the animal goes completely to the ground.

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.740
Completely opposite to what we predicted.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:07.280
- So light viewing and feeding
behavior are interacting

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.667
in ways that support one another.

01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:10.990
- And that's why we came
with the tripartite model.

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:14.280
We figured it's different than
sensation of the environment.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.650
When you sense with vision,
vision and hearing interact,

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:20.140
but your vision is a real full modality.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.400
You want to see.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.150
That's what vision wants to do.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:24.120
You want to hear.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.610
That's what hearing wants to do.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:26.480
You want to sense.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.270
That's what sensing want to do.

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:32.340
But for the circadian system, light, food,

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.810
all these entraining agent,

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:38.290
they somehow have to interact
to keep a coherent system.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.180
You don't just assume if you remove light,

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.420
this one is going to be stronger.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.700
No, they need to know each others.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.390
The light informs when the
animal is going to eat.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:48.690
- Well, what I like about
this so much is that

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.640
in the world outside of science,

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.550
in which I don't really exist
in, but that I see a lot of,

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:58.710
this kind of wellness and stuff with

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:00.883
all this mind-body integration stuff.

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:05.100
It's interesting because
people view the body

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.610
more as a system, right?

01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:08.420
A system of organs that interact,

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:11.337
as opposed to the way
that standard science

01:12:11.337 --> 01:12:13.170
and medical profession is like,

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:15.770
you work on the liver or
you're ear, nose and throat,

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:18.150
or heart and lung, or brain or-

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.100
- Wow, that's a great
way of thinking about it.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.100
- But the biology is integrated.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:26.000
- Yeah.
- And so, for somebody who's

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.360
interested in effecting
their eating behavior,

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.660
something that you are familiar with,

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.010
and that we will talk more about

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:34.610
your experiences of in a moment,

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.330
how should they use
light in order to adjust

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.450
their eating behavior?
- Right.

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:44.210
So, now that I've told you
about all these interaction

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:47.810
between the different inputs
to the circadian clock,

01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:49.780
just you think about it as an engineer,

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.330
what would be the best thing?

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:55.270
The best thing is to know
when your food times happen

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.370
in the day, when should you get light,

01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:02.060
and when is your circadian
clock in your system, right?

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.520
So, if you eat at very
specific times of the day,

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.690
that's another signal that is
telling your body, your clock,

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:10.610
you're in a certain time of the day.

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.330
So if you're having lunch at
the correct time every day,

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:14.640
and you're getting bright light,

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.080
now you have two systems that
are informing your clock,

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.560
your clock is going to be better.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.030
- So regular mealtimes?

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:24.190
- Regular mealtimes that
fit your circadian clock.

01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:28.380
So, and in fact, if you do
that, when I started doing this,

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.110
and it helped me lose weight,

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:33.020
is that I'm exposing
myself to the right amount

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.920
of light-dark cycle, I'm
eating at regular time.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.030
It is amazing.

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:39.620
You would be not hungry,
let's say you eat at noon,

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:42.693
you will not feel any hunger at 11:45.

01:13:42.693 --> 01:13:45.210
And then all of a sudden the hunger jumps.

01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.080
This is clearly not an energy issue

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.490
because it could not be that drastic.

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:54.170
- No, the desire to eat is
mainly driven by these cues,

01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:59.170
these hormone cues that are
very exquisitely timed to-

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.860
- Exactly.
- Sleep-wake cycle,

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.800
but also to light.
- Exactly.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.540
And you know, in the wild,

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.430
you could imagine why energy level

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.077
through the arcuate nucleus-

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:10.130
- You should explain to
people what the arcuate is

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:11.950
'cause I don't think we've
done that adequately.

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:14.310
The arcuate nucleus is an
area of the hypothalamus

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.700
that drives hunger and feeding behavior.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.220
And what we're talking
about is the fact that

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:23.120
it's taking cues from
your viewing of light,

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.270
believe it or not, is
impacting your level of hunger.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:31.270
And this is a non-trivial way
in which your timing of hunger

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:34.520
and amount of hunger is regulated by when

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.790
and how much light you view.

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.820
So, let me ask you a couple of practical-

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.771
- But can I just, this is
really, before you asked me-

01:14:40.771 --> 01:14:42.340
- Sure.
- Sorry, Andrew.

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.363
We said we are going to fight, but to me,

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.970
the interesting thing to think about it,

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:48.960
in the wild when you didn't
have the availability

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.350
of food that we have,
the arcuate plays a huge

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:55.820
important role because
if you weren't successful

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.610
in getting food, then the
arcuate is going to tell you,

01:14:58.610 --> 01:15:01.160
look, you have to take
risks and go get food

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.240
because your energy level is very low.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.430
And that's great, there's tons
of great research about that.

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.360
But I think what's missing
is the fact in humans,

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.470
we're not getting to a situation...

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:14.070
Most of us, we're not
getting to a situation

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.420
where we have low energy levels.

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.557
Most of the time actually
we eat not because

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:21.440
we are really have low energy,

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.010
but because we want to eat.

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:26.360
So I think that's why
I feel that the timing

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.990
is very important for us because we always

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.540
have enough energy level for us to eat.

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.880
- Well, I mean, I enjoy
eating so much that I'll eat

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.440
just for the sensation of chewing.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.273
- True, true.
- I mean,

01:15:36.273 --> 01:15:38.310
I enjoy the taste too.
- True, absolutely.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:39.820
- And I enjoy the social aspects

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:40.970
when those are a part of it.
- Absolutely.

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:43.830
- But I literally enjoyed
the physical act of chewing.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.730
- [Samer] Absolutely, absolutely.

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:47.533
Uh huh.
- Which explains a lot.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:54.300
Okay, so how regular are
you or do you recommend

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.270
people be about mealtimes?

01:15:56.270 --> 01:16:01.060
Because what I'm hearing is
that light viewing behavior

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:01.980
is pretty straightforward.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.920
Get a lot of light in the
morning and throughout the day,

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.430
minimize it in the evening and
at night, generally speaking,

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.150
for sake of mood and circadian rhythm.

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:13.594
But for sake of regulating
timing and quality

01:16:13.594 --> 01:16:15.800
I should also say of food intake,

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.420
because people clearly make
better choices about food intake

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.740
when they are anticipating a meal

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.700
and they aren't constantly hungry.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.130
And so, the ability to regulate
hunger for particular phases

01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:29.160
of the circadian cycle is
quite valuable for all people.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.350
Not just people trying to
lose weight, but all people.

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:34.850
Are we talking about down to the minute?

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:35.683
- Absolutely not.

01:16:35.683 --> 01:16:38.710
- All right, so 12:00
noon is my normal lunch,

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:41.420
let's say plus or minus?

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.930
- Half an hour.
- Okay.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.100
So eat around between 11:30 and 12:30.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.287
- If that's the time.

01:16:47.287 --> 01:16:49.640
And it depends if you
also do multiple meals.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.890
Remember three meals, that's
a decision that somebody

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:54.360
came up with, I don't know why.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.440
- And nowadays, fewer people
are doing that I think.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.953
- Yeah.
- Given our friend,

01:16:57.953 --> 01:16:59.450
Satchin Panda's work.
- Right.

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:01.270
I mean, so you could have two meals,

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:06.160
you could have very multiple
meals that are distributed

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.970
across your active time.

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:12.530
I agree with Satchin Panda's
work that try to avoid eating

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:14.890
when your system is
supposed to be relaxing,

01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:18.640
when you're supposed to
be at non-active times.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.630
So, limit your eating to the
active time of your cycle.

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.910
And that seemed to be, and Joe Takashi

01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:28.210
is doing some beautiful stuff on this,

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.140
that seems to be incredibly important

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:33.340
for aspect of the circadian.

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.690
- And for health.
- And for health.

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:37.550
- Yeah, we're referring
to Satchin Panda's work,

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:39.870
he wrote a beautiful book
called "The Circadian Code."

01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:43.480
Maybe Samer, with some luck
you'll write a book as well.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.110
Meaning the world will be
lucky to have that book,

01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:49.610
but Satchin's data really
strongly point to the fact

01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:54.610
that liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors,

01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:58.620
and endocrine factors of
various systems and organs

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.270
all seem to benefit from having
a period of each 24 hour day

01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:03.660
in which we are not eating anything

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.858
and then eating at very regular mealtimes.

01:18:04.858 --> 01:18:06.840
- [Samer] Absolutely.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.600
- Let's talk about eating and mealtimes

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.340
and let's move a little bit away

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.180
from the science for the moment,

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.520
although we will return to it,

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.710
and talk a little bit
more about your experience

01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:18.520
with eating and mealtimes.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.470
So, you're looking in good shape lately.

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:22.410
- Thank you.
- I know you've been

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:23.770
putting work into it.
- Yeah.

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:25.950
- We talk a lot and you've been exercising

01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:30.530
and you've been eating
well, meaning quality food.

01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:31.580
You just came back from Jordan

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.253
where I'm assuming the food is amazing.

01:18:33.253 --> 01:18:35.490
- Yes, the food is amazing and honestly,

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:37.790
usually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan,

01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:40.040
but this time I didn't gain any weight,

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.380
which was really nice, so.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:46.380
- Yeah, when I met you, you
were probably about 100 pounds

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:49.860
heavier than you are now.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.357
- Yeah, 275 pounds.

01:18:51.357 --> 01:18:53.010
I'm 219 now.

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:54.981
It's crazy, yeah.
- You had a lot of vigor then,

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:56.720
and you have a lot of vigor now,

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.550
but I know that you undertook
a very specific protocol

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:03.770
in order to lose the weight,

01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:05.550
based on your understanding
of the circadian system-

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:06.980
- Yes!
- And of light,

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:09.190
and appetite and mood.

01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:10.950
Maybe you could just tell
us a little bit about

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:12.310
what that schedule looks like.

01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:14.380
And we realize that this
is not a prescriptive

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.730
for everybody, but you
found what worked for you.

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:18.370
- Yeah.
- To maybe just describe

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:19.460
those changes.
- I mean, honestly,

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.580
I followed my circadian cycle, right?

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.020
Of what we've talked about, right?

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.970
So I dimmed the light at night,
I slept at regular hours,

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:31.050
I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.660
when I'm really active
and I'm really hungry.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.760
And at night when I avoid dinner,

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.400
because my circadian system
really shuts off at 3:00.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.900
I'm an early person.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.430
Like you could give me anything
I would eat before 3:00,

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:44.780
after 3:00, nothing appeals to me anymore.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.140
My system is shut off.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.270
- Well, what time are you going to sleep?

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.103
And what time are you waking up?

01:19:48.103 --> 01:19:50.340
- Oh, so in my case, I
should have put this up.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.400
I mean, I go to sleep
literally at 9:00 p.m..

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.610
I mean, I literally five
minutes after 9:00 p.m.,

01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:58.400
I'm completely out.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.040
And I wake up between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m..

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.630
So if I extend it, I go to 6:00 a.m.,

01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:04.690
but very rarely.

01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:06.650
It depends on how tired I was.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:10.630
- And that, as I recall, was
an important set of changes

01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:11.690
for you to be able to-
- Absolutely.

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:12.543
- Regulate your food intake.

01:20:12.543 --> 01:20:16.410
- Absolutely because then I'm
having very big breakfast,

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:19.460
and again for different
people it's different,

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:22.880
I have a big breakfast
at 7:00 a.m. maximum.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.890
So I have a big breakfast,
coffee, and all this stuff.

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:29.050
Then I have some simple
snack around 10:00.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.060
Then I have regularly lunch at noon,

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.250
or between noon to 1:00.

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.297
Then I have another snack at 3:00.

01:20:34.297 --> 01:20:36.240
And the hardest time to regulate the food

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.073
is between 12:00 and 3:00.

01:20:37.073 --> 01:20:39.323
This is when I really
feel hungry all the time.

01:20:39.323 --> 01:20:40.870
- This is your equivalent of kind of

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:41.920
late evening for most people.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.759
- Yes!
- So for me,

01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:44.620
it would probably be
between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m..

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.400
- Exactly, exactly.
- Got it.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.020
- And then at night I'm
completely not hungry,

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.400
but usually as you said,

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.660
the beauty or the enjoyment of food,

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:56.130
like when my wife cooks some
really beautiful Indian food,

01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:58.190
I eat, but I'm not hungry.

01:20:58.190 --> 01:21:01.160
And I notice if I eat with
that, I usually gain weight.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.440
But if I regulate that at
night, I also lose weight.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.220
So there is a combination of
all these things that help you

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:12.370
adjust the input of
food, the input of light,

01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:14.923
the input of the clock,
and the drive to hunger.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.490
- Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that.

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.520
And I want to emphasize that some people

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.170
are not hungry early in the day.

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:22.761
They might be late shifted people.

01:21:22.761 --> 01:21:23.594
- Exactly.
- In which case,

01:21:23.594 --> 01:21:25.024
eating later in the day
will work well for them.

01:21:25.024 --> 01:21:26.630
- It will work well as
long as they don't eat

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:27.463
early in the morning.

01:21:27.463 --> 01:21:29.900
That's just, you have to
work with your schedule,

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.460
with your active schedule.

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.293
- Yeah, you and I have been talking

01:21:32.293 --> 01:21:33.780
about this offline for years.

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.710
I'm glad we're finally having
this discussion publicly now.

01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:38.270
What we're talking about really is finding

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:39.770
your ideal sleep schedule.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.380
- Exactly, exactly.
- And finding your ideal

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:43.790
eating schedule.
- Exactly.

01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:46.532
- And understanding how
those two things interact.

01:21:46.532 --> 01:21:48.070
- And do you know the
nice thing, as you said,

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.740
finding them out is going to help you

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.430
to understand how they interact

01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:53.030
because we know from the tripartite model

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:55.860
that they are all interconnected.

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.590
And for each person they're going to be

01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:59.630
interconnected differently.

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:02.010
So, for each person you would...

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:05.370
You know, for me, if I exercise at night,

01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:06.953
I'm going to mess up my whole system.

01:22:06.953 --> 01:22:08.960
- When do you exercise?
- Morning.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.480
Morning works great for me.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.840
I mean, it's amazing.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.570
Morning exercise for me works great.

01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:17.280
If I tried one time,
because it was easier for me

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.270
to exercise at night before I leave,

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:21.117
when the traffic is there from the night.

01:22:21.117 --> 01:22:24.700
And I think that messed me up
because I couldn't sleep well

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:26.060
and I couldn't wake up well.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.890
And that led to more changes in my food.

01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:30.910
I gained weight again
actually, believe it or not,

01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:32.640
even though I was exercising.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.930
So I think this really makes
me think that you have to think

01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:41.370
of the tripartite model to
see what is the best times

01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:43.590
and what is the best interrelation between

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:45.940
the different component,
as you beautifully said,

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.380
between your mealtimes,
your light exposure,

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.810
and your sleep that works for you.

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:51.643
- Well, thanks for that.

01:22:51.643 --> 01:22:53.130
Usually Samer's insulting me.

01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:54.610
Today, he's complimenting me.

01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:57.120
I'm going to compliment
him right back by saying,

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.500
this is the first time that
I've ever really understood

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.490
how yes, light can control sleep.

01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:06.263
Yes, it control mood.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.100
Yes, it can impact feeding,

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.750
but that it's really about
doing the self exploration

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:14.620
to align those in the way that works best.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.560
And what I'm hearing,
tell me if I'm wrong,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.370
but what I'm hearing is
that once you understand

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.980
what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle,

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:25.530
then you should exercise
during the period of time

01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:27.680
in which you feel most alert.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.730
And if it works for your schedule,

01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:33.190
ideally you would also eat
during the time in which

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:35.767
you feel most alert and then stop eating

01:23:35.767 --> 01:23:38.270
and stop light viewing behavior
as you head towards sleep.

01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:39.103
- Right.

01:23:39.103 --> 01:23:42.300
So, the only thing I would say
that complicates all of this,

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.120
and that's what makes me
sad, is your light exposure.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.180
- Mine personally?
- Sorry.

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.950
- No, I'm just kidding.

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.900
- The people's light exposure, right?

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.630
This is what complicates it
because you're not going to be able

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:56.490
to figure all this out if
you're shifting yourself

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:57.740
out of your comfort zone.

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.510
- By viewing-
- By viewing light

01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:01.240
at the wrong time of the day.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:06.240
So, let's say if you were under
an ideal natural conditions,

01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:09.260
you're a person who would
sleep later than me.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.970
Let's say we'll sleep at midnight
and wake up at 8:00 a.m..

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.010
Let's say you don't
eat anything till noon,

01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:17.860
and as you said, you
eat late in the evening.

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.610
Then this would be perfect for you,

01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:22.470
but now see what happens
if now you include

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:23.320
the light component.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.810
Now, if you push your sleep
from midnight to 4:00 a.m.,

01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:30.700
now you're waking up in the
morning and you're actually

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:31.890
really not the morning...

01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:35.050
You're working, I'm sorry, at
noon instead of eight o'clock,

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:37.470
and the time where you're
not supposed to be hungry,

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:39.740
now you're going to start
eating directly at noon

01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.720
or something like that, or even delay it.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.990
And now you're shifting your whole cycle.

01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:46.500
And you don't know if this
interaction between your sleep,

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.290
feeding and the light-dark environment

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:50.600
are still going to be maintained or not.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.510
And that's the problem that people have.

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:56.690
- So, as I'm hearing this what
I'm realizing is most of us,

01:24:56.690 --> 01:25:00.830
probably me included, are
messing up at least one, two,

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:02.460
or three of these components.
- Exactly, exactly.

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:06.980
- But that the probe, the way
to figure out what's right

01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:10.330
for oneself is to start
manipulating light exposure.

01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:12.610
- Right and I'm going to be honest,

01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:15.160
I'm biased 'cause I believe that light

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.970
is the strongest time giver.

01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:19.610
And a lot of people disagree.

01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:21.090
Some people think feeding is.

01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:23.410
- I always thought that light
was the primary zeitgeber,

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:25.020
the primary light-
- Yeah, but a lot of people

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:25.853
think it's food.

01:25:25.853 --> 01:25:28.670
A lot of people even sometimes
mentioned social interaction.

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:30.010
- Have they read the literature?

01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:31.127
- I agree with you.

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:32.470
I totally agree with you.

01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:33.850
- I mean, my understanding is that light

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.537
is the most powerful driver-
- Absolutely.

01:25:35.537 --> 01:25:36.480
- Of the things we're talking about.

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.700
- That's why I think we
need to regulate this first

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.470
and everything else fits.

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:43.400
And you know, the nice thing
is that your sleep-wake cycle

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.870
and exercise tell you really bluntly

01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:47.273
if you're doing it right or not.

01:25:47.273 --> 01:25:48.810
- Tell me more about that.
- I'll tell you more.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.170
When I shifted my exercise, honestly,

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:54.320
things fell apart like never before.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.743
- When you moved from
exercising early in the day

01:25:56.743 --> 01:25:57.576
to late in the day?
- In the morn, yeah.

01:25:57.576 --> 01:25:59.520
It completely fell apart for me.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.520
I didn't enjoy exercise at night.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.320
My pain tolerance for
exercise wasn't as good.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.530
I'm talking with N equals
one and I'm aware of this.

01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:10.500
I've never tested this
empirically, but at least to me,

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.390
it really messed up everything.

01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:14.550
I started having problem
because my body temperature

01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:17.010
would go up and that will affect my sleep.

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:19.500
I possibly was running in
the gym with a lot of lights.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.100
So maybe the light was
a component, but for me,

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.417
exercising in the morning,
it's so much better for me.

01:26:26.417 --> 01:26:27.950
But a lot of people can't even

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.790
think of exercising in the morning.

01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:32.000
So it depends on when you feel comfortable

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.220
in your sleep-wake
cycle and your exercise.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.910
I think that tells you if your system

01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:38.510
is in synchrony with one another.

01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:40.150
- That's really interesting.

01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:42.563
We're good friends, our
friend, Pat Dossett,

01:26:42.563 --> 01:26:43.890
that we both know.
- Mm hm, oh, absolutely.

01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:45.760
- He did nine years in the Seal Teams.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.630
And he's one of these people he says,

01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:50.030
he's happy to go for a
run or a swim anytime

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:52.600
between 4:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m..

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.210
And he'll train in the afternoon too

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:57.420
'cause he's a Seal Team guy and
they'll do whatever anytime,

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.860
that's part of the phenotype,

01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.363
but he feels best doing that, right?

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.104
I like to exercise mid-morning.

01:27:04.104 --> 01:27:05.880
- Interesting.
- And I'm happy to skip eating

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.282
until 12 or 1:00.
- Great.

01:27:08.282 --> 01:27:10.265
- And I like to go to
sleep around 11:30, 12:00,

01:27:10.265 --> 01:27:12.100
'cause I'm a normal human
being rather than you

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:14.130
who goes to bed at 9:00 p.m.
- What about Pat actually?

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:15.320
I've never asked him what time.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.153
- Pat?

01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:18.710
So, Pat's ideal to sleep
time, I've asked him this,

01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:21.155
would be around 8:30 or 9:00 except now-

01:27:21.155 --> 01:27:24.650
- Oh, so I'm like Pat!
- Yes, but he has two

01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:27.650
young children, two
years old and a newborn.

01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:29.287
And so, the cycle is disrupted, right?

01:27:29.287 --> 01:27:31.600
- Yeah, but that's known, right?

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.460
I mean the effect of childbearing.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:34.880
- Right.
- And I think that we could

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.974
talk about this, that's more complicated-

01:27:36.974 --> 01:27:39.130
- Right.
- But that's pretty much.

01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:41.570
- Yeah, I mean, I think we
need to come up with a new name

01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:43.660
for chronotype because-
- I agree, I agree.

01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:47.060
- Chronotype implies that it's
just about sleep and wake;

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.880
being an early bird or a night owl.

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.250
And what we're also talking
about is how exercise

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:52.887
and eating match onto those.

01:27:52.887 --> 01:27:56.040
- The the phase relation between them.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.630
- Right.
- And the phases between

01:27:57.630 --> 01:27:59.440
different components, as you said.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.180
- 'Cause they interact.
- Because they interact.

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.550
- Right.
- And they don't have

01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:03.530
to be in the same phase.

01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:05.570
Like let's say my light and food

01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:07.010
could be very close to each other.

01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:09.350
Your light and food could
be different, right?

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:11.870
The phases don't have to
be, they can be plastic.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:14.258
So you have to find this for yourself.

01:28:14.258 --> 01:28:17.050
You maybe you're a person
who eats late at night,

01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:18.950
exercises late at night,

01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:21.510
or you may be a person who
exercise early, eat later.

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:25.220
So, as long as the phase is good,

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.360
that's what you have to find out.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.900
- Okay and if I understand correctly,

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.350
when you're talking
about phase relationship,

01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:34.140
it means you want to lump
exercise, feeding and light for-

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:36.400
- And sleep.
- And sleep in a way

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.610
that as a coherent and total system

01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:41.170
makes you feel really good.

01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:43.270
- Temporally in a great order.

01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:45.290
- Uh uh.
- Absolutely.

01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:47.540
- And I think that-
- And I could tell you to me

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:52.480
is literally getting exposed
to sun clearly in the morning,

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.980
clearly at noon, I go out,

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:57.430
I keep my windows in the
office completely open,

01:28:57.430 --> 01:29:00.560
eating mostly in the early
time of the day and exercising.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.410
And literally at the end part of the day,

01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:07.630
I'm not really in a more
thoughtful vegetative state.

01:29:07.630 --> 01:29:11.230
Like I really can't like after
5:00, I tell my students,

01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:13.120
if you want to tell me
anything complicated,

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.360
you're wasting your time.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.350
My brain just doesn't function.

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.910
So even though I only sleep at night,

01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:21.140
but I'm really starting
to shut off, ramp down.

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:24.430
Really I mean, I could send email,

01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:27.650
talk about brainless stuff, but my power,

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:32.290
my energy to do powerful stuff
really drop tremendously.

01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:34.340
So all my students who know me very well,

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.980
they put the meetings with
me early in the morning

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.630
'cause they know this is when I'm...

01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:41.640
So, everything for me and
for me, it's very tight.

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.090
So it could be different for...

01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:44.373
It's very clustered in the morning.

01:29:44.373 --> 01:29:46.000
It's all tied together.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.370
And literally the remaining part

01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:50.431
seems to be just a vegetative state.

01:29:50.431 --> 01:29:51.440
- Mm hm.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.700
Yeah, you and my bulldog, Costello,

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.350
who unfortunately passed away recently.

01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:57.477
- Oh no.
- Yeah.

01:29:57.477 --> 01:29:59.010
- I did not, that's so sad.
- Yeah, Samer and Costello

01:29:59.010 --> 01:29:59.843
were good friends.

01:29:59.843 --> 01:30:01.570
Yeah, sorry to break it to you here.

01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:04.460
Yeah, he had a good long
life and he went easy,

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:07.300
but he had a circadian clock
that basically would just sleep

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.770
around 24 hours a day,

01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:12.883
minimal activity interspersed
every third day or so.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.810
You do have this morning vigor.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:18.460
- Yes.
- And I think other people

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:19.890
are going to have more
of an afternoon vigor.

01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:22.623
Do you think that this can
change across the lifespan?

01:30:23.856 --> 01:30:28.190
The rumor is that teenagers
naturally want to sleep in later

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:29.440
and stay up later.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.840
Do you think that's social rhythm?

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.500
Or do you think that
that's actually biological?

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.890
- Yeah, that's a tough question.

01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:37.430
I mean, it could be both.

01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:41.340
One thing that worries me is
that it seems that if anything,

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:44.912
with age this morning rigor gets stronger.

01:30:44.912 --> 01:30:46.180
- You mean, you want people to become more

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.013
of morning people.
- More of morning people.

01:30:47.013 --> 01:30:47.846
- Well, why does that worry you?

01:30:47.846 --> 01:30:49.000
I think that's good.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.760
- Because for me, I'm
already very shifted morning.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.740
I don't want to be one of these 7:00 p.m.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:56.000
to 1:00 a.m. sleepers at some point.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.640
- On the other hand,
it's also kind of nice

01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.120
because it's quiet and
you can get work done.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.350
- Yeah, but honestly from 4:30 till 7:30

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:05.770
when my wife wake up, it can be very long.

01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:08.723
Yes, you achieved a lot,
but it's quiet outside.

01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:12.950
So, I don't want to be at 1:00
a.m., let's put it this way.

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:15.606
- You can tell Samer is
more social than I am.

01:31:15.606 --> 01:31:17.057
- That's right, that is true.

01:31:17.057 --> 01:31:18.570
- But we should touch on that actually.

01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:22.080
So, your wife, she follows
a different schedule.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.850
- Yeah.
- So, the social rhythm-

01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:26.890
- I'm honestly...
- Is important I think.

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:27.860
What should we do?

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:31.320
How should we conceptualize
and how should we adjust

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.153
ourselves according to the social rhythm?

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:35.360
- And I honestly love this hypothesis

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.320
that people came up with and
Pat's kids reminded me of.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.870
Because kids are really going to
disrupt your sleep-wake cycle,

01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:46.640
it seems like there is
a chrono attraction.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.980
That's usually people
who attract each others

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.850
have actually different
sleep-wake schedule.

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:54.190
And the idea being is
that this allows them

01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:57.190
to take care of their kids
throughout the day-night cycle.

01:31:57.190 --> 01:31:58.750
- And have a peaceful marriage.

01:31:58.750 --> 01:32:01.240
- And have a peaceful
marriage in a way, right?

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.390
So, I mean, we didn't
have kids, me and Rejji.

01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:06.550
So maybe this is, but it
seems like evolutionary

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:09.980
it makes sense that if you
want to protect your kids,

01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.080
you don't want everybody
to be morning vigor,

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.680
and then the kids don't have.

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.720
So you want it distributed across.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.860
I mean, it makes sense.
- It's a reasonable argument.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:19.180
- Yeah.
- I've heard that one

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.370
of the reasons that people
think that the clock

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.680
is not exactly 24 hours,

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:28.450
but it's 24 hours plus or
minus 20 minutes or so,

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:33.450
is because we believe that we
evolved in clans or groups,

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.090
villages, whatever, that
were about 100 to 200 people.

01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:40.270
And in order to have protection around

01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:41.810
the early morning hours-
- Interesting, same idea.

01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:43.930
- When we're vulnerable to predation

01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:45.490
and in the late night hours,

01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:48.170
that you would want some
individuals of our species

01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:50.070
to be naturally more like night owls

01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:51.300
and some more like early people.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:55.960
So your theory of parenting
is similar in that way.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.620
- Right.
- The social rhythm

01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.200
is a powerful rhythm though.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.490
Meaning if I go out and I'm tired,

01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:04.010
let's say I'm tired at like 9:30.

01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:05.203
I don't want to go out, like I'm to need-

01:33:05.203 --> 01:33:06.643
- So can I just say something about that?

01:33:06.643 --> 01:33:11.410
I think the social rhythm is
powerful at the obvious levels.

01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:13.270
Like it affects your sleep,

01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:15.900
it affects how much you wake up or eat,

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.610
but I'm not so sure it's
as powerful as people think

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:19.790
on the clock.

01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:21.810
Now, eventually it will mess up the clock

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.760
because now if you're doing
a lot of social at night,

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.030
getting enough light, eating
at the wrong time of the day,

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:29.800
eventually you're going to have an effect,

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.880
but I don't think just the
social interactions themselves

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.320
have been shown to affect
your clock very strongly

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.630
for some reason.
- Yeah, that's good to know.

01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:40.600
Well, for people hearing this,

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.250
they're probably getting the impression

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.370
like I'm the night owl,
and then Samer is the one

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.910
that's in bed at 9:00 and
then wakes up at 4:00.

01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:51.340
But having attended many
meetings with Samer,

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.530
I can tell you that he's the party animal.

01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:55.143
So let's talk about that.

01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:58.700
I mean, let's talk about the
fact that you're the partier,

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:01.860
who's up until 2:00 dancing
at these various meetings,

01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:02.923
which I've seen.
- Yep.

01:34:02.923 --> 01:34:05.650
- He's actually a good dancer I'm told,

01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:10.650
but what should we do when
we do stay up very late,

01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:12.960
for whatever reason;
could be because we had

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.690
to take a midnight trip to the hospital,

01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:15.670
an unfortunate reason,

01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:18.400
or it could be because you're
in the presence of people

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.350
that you don't see very
often and you go out

01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:24.410
for a really nice night out on
the town and you get to sleep

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.233
around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning.

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:29.160
How should one get back on schedule?

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.360
Do you force yourself to
then get up and view light

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.470
at the normal time that you
would get up and view light?

01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:35.050
Or do you allow yourself to sleep in?

01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:36.003
What what's the optimal protocol?

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.810
- I would allow myself to sleep in,

01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:40.020
and remember this is a long-term effect.

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.794
This is something that you
live with for a long period.

01:34:42.794 --> 01:34:45.210
And remember I told you
about the experiments

01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:46.310
we did with the mood,

01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:48.950
these required two weeks
of that light schedule

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:50.570
to cause mood disturbances.

01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:52.790
So these don't happen
just in a single day.

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:55.110
- So this is the way you
justify staying out late

01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:57.400
every once in a while.
- Well, in the meetings

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.233
you've seen me in,

01:34:58.233 --> 01:35:00.650
I've done this for five
or six days continuously,

01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:03.450
but what you didn't see that
when I came back to my home,

01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:05.970
it took me two weeks
as if I did a jet lag.

01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:08.280
So I really do suffer for two weeks

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.180
after doing a six crazy
night of staying up at night,

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.060
drinking at the wrong time of the day.

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.950
So it's not that I'm
completely okay with it.

01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:18.570
When I go back, everything goes back.

01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:21.370
It takes me actually
literally two weeks to recover

01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:23.230
from the circadian rhythm meeting

01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:25.880
that you've seen me
partying at some point.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.473
- Which is kind of ironic
that the circadian rhythm-

01:35:27.473 --> 01:35:29.190
- I know.
- Meaning people are totally

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.600
disrupting their circadian cycle,

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.720
but scientists are human beings too.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.720
- Right, so I think if you do
it at very little occasions,

01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:40.990
I think you should not worry too much

01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.850
that this will have lasting impact.

01:35:42.850 --> 01:35:45.980
And the good news is that if
you readjust your schedule,

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.210
you could come back to it.

01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:50.330
The problem is when you
maintain this wrong schedule

01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:53.160
for a prolonged time
and it becomes chronic,

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.280
prolonged periods of time,

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.990
that's when you have the problems

01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:58.170
and the accumulation of the problems.

01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:00.360
So when you have sleeping problem,

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.760
you produce metabolic problem.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.020
When you have metabolic problems,

01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:04.850
you produce lack of exercise.

01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:08.380
And you could see how things
can spiral out very quickly.

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.060
And then it would be
hard to come back to it.

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.940
- Well, certainly sleep disruption is both

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.190
a symptom of and-
- Yes.

01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:17.620
- A cause of almost all-
- Absolutely.

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.720
- Mental health disorders.
- Absolutely.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.070
- And certainly the metabolic syndromes

01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:25.120
that people are talking about
nowadays and all of this,

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.070
it all funnels back to light.

01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:30.080
This is what's so remarkable.
- Eventually, yeah.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.750
- And so we have these devices,

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:35.210
and I use my phone and I use my computer.

01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:38.500
But do you think that the
mere dimming of the screen

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.523
or not interacting with screens,

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.790
say 90 minutes or two
hours before bedtime,

01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:47.640
according to what we're saying today,

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.590
this should have a profound effect

01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:52.220
on all these factors.
- And it does.

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.870
And I really believe it does.

01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:58.870
And, again, I think as
Pat did these inventions

01:36:59.490 --> 01:37:02.220
where you get a pouch where
you put your phone in a pouch.

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:06.180
- Mm hm, so, what Samer's
referring to is our friend, Pat,

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.963
this former Seal Team member,

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:11.300
who's also very impressive
person in the landscape

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.780
of business and family, et cetera.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:17.780
A real superhuman by any
regard has this habit of taking

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.970
his phone and putting
it into a sealed pouch

01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:21.868
in the evening.
- Yeah.

01:37:21.868 --> 01:37:22.701
- So it's basically walled off-

01:37:22.701 --> 01:37:24.971
- And in his program he sends you actually

01:37:24.971 --> 01:37:27.450
these sealed pouches.

01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:31.340
And so that I think is a
great idea because not only

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.440
it will take away the light from you,

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.250
but it also take away the distraction

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:39.890
because you want to repair and
recover, and sleep does that.

01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:42.310
And if you have your phone
dinging all the time,

01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:45.070
or the light flashing from it,

01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:46.647
you're just not getting enough sleep

01:37:46.647 --> 01:37:49.163
and you're causing
yourself major problems.

01:37:50.975 --> 01:37:53.200
- I never asked you
this, but I realized now

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.200
that I should have long
ago, but I'll ask you now.

01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:02.410
Why and how did you get
into all this stuff?

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:05.140
- Yeah, I mean, honestly, first of all,

01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:09.160
I wanted to study genetics and I knew

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.870
I wanted to do PhD in genetics.

01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:14.530
But I only got accepted in
one university at the time.

01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:16.860
And I joined the Learning and Memory Lab.

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.700
And I liked learning and
memory at the beginning,

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:21.300
I worked on the snails
on Aplysia californica,

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.220
and started looking at
learning and memory.

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:26.740
But then the same lab was
looking at these daily variation.

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.430
I was really struck.

01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:31.050
Like you never think about
it outside of science.

01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:34.540
It's really struck me that organisms

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:37.380
can measure day biologically.

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.210
That was very shocking to me.

01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:42.660
And I just really got
attracted and I wanted to see

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:44.540
why does this happen?

01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.400
What is the effect of
different times of day?

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.730
And I just stuck with it.

01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:50.140
It just, it was mind blowing for me

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:52.010
who was in medical school,

01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:54.390
that I've never heard about it before.

01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:56.200
You know, it's really amazing medicine,

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.960
I think still now we are very good

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.170
at looking at stuff spatially,

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:04.650
but we're very bad at
looking at temporal aspects.

01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:08.300
So we always like to see
images, static images,

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.133
spatial information.

01:39:09.133 --> 01:39:11.044
- Right, take an x-ray,
measure a temperature-

01:39:11.044 --> 01:39:12.840
- Yeah, exactly.
- Measure a blood pressure.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.870
- But we don't think of temporal.

01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:17.450
And you talk to John Hogenesch right now,

01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:20.525
and he's telling you the
importance of chronomedicine

01:39:20.525 --> 01:39:22.000
or chromo pharma...

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.070
Whatever the word is.

01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:27.680
And it really just getting the drugs

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.160
at the right time of the
day is going to be essential

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.500
for our health.

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.950
- Do you think that's going to
come from using better trackers,

01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:37.340
like Oura rings, WHOOP
straps, these kinds of things?

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.400
- I love the trackers,

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.840
but I think there's even
more exciting discoveries.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.910
Now you could take a single blood sample

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.610
and measure many biological components

01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:48.150
and figure where you are
in the circadian clock.

01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:50.640
Something that was very hard to do before.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.490
So if you have a marker to know
where you are in the clock,

01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:56.780
you could actually understand
more the effect of everything;

01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.810
exercise, feeding, light input.

01:39:58.810 --> 01:40:00.010
- What is the marker?

01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:03.490
- So there are some papers
from what's her name?

01:40:03.490 --> 01:40:07.010
Phyllis Zee and from Achim Kramer

01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:08.900
where they measure multiple RNAs

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:11.900
that are known to tell you
what phase of the clock is,

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:16.700
or multiple proteins or
biological reactions.

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.230
And depending on a combination of factors,

01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:20.170
not a single factor,

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:23.400
you could tell where you
are in the circadian clock.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.920
So they could instead of
just measuring temperature

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.900
or melatonin, just one measurement.

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.480
And melatonin specifically, is
also complicated by the fact

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.280
that melatonin is affected by light.

01:40:34.157 --> 01:40:36.580
And temperature, your
temperature and sleep can be

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.314
easily dissociable, right?

01:40:38.314 --> 01:40:39.617
When you travel up those
different timezone,

01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:43.330
you sleep at different times
in the temperature cycle.

01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:46.690
So having multiple components
measured will give you

01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:49.820
a better determination
of your circadian phase,

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.250
and understanding your
circadian phase in humans

01:40:53.250 --> 01:40:56.050
will telling you what is the
effect of giving certain drugs

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:57.740
at certain times of the circadian phase.

01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.320
So, in the future, this
is going to be studied

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.630
at a much higher level when
you can determine the phase

01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:05.483
in relation to all the other stuff.

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:12.060
- It's striking to me that in
all animals, besides humans,

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.320
if they deviate too much
from the appropriate exposure

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.900
to light and light-dark cycle,

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:20.500
they essentially don't mate and/or die

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.360
and/or get killed off.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.460
But in humans, we are able
to override that at least

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:30.330
to some extent, but the ways
in which we suffer appear to be

01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:33.990
things like obesity, metabolic syndromes,

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:35.980
reproductive syndromes that are accompany

01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:38.400
the other syndromes, you
know, endocrine syndromes,

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.260
and mood and depressive disorders.

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:45.660
Is there any effort at the
level of the nationally

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:47.650
or laboratories that you're aware of

01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:49.920
to try and use light in order

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.440
to improve mood and mental health?

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.540
- I mean, honestly, this is my mantra.

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:57.220
This is the thing that I think people,

01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.727
because I say, don't take
a pill, take a photon.

01:42:00.727 --> 01:42:02.390
And not, I mean, you take pills.

01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:03.223
That's important.

01:42:03.223 --> 01:42:06.930
I'm just making it that
really we have an opportunity

01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:10.460
right now with the incredible
advances of LED lights,

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:15.460
of changing spectrum of light,
of regulating intensities.

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.050
And just for simple changes,

01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:22.940
you could really improve
sleep-wake cycle, productivity,

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:25.570
and still you could actually get more done

01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:27.540
because as we've talked about,

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:29.570
when you have all these messed up,

01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:32.910
now you have to sleep more,
but your sleep is fragmented.

01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:34.100
It's not very good.

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.253
- And you can't focus
when you do sit down-

01:42:35.253 --> 01:42:37.522
- And you can't focus or
you don't have alertness

01:42:37.522 --> 01:42:39.340
when you need the alertness.

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:44.000
So having all these could allow
you to do even more actually

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.353
at the end than less.

01:42:45.353 --> 01:42:47.970
And that's the exciting part it.

01:42:47.970 --> 01:42:50.450
- One of the questions I
get asked most often about

01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:51.730
is about ADHD.

01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:54.170
I think there's a lot of self-prescribed

01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:56.250
as well as clinically prescribed ADHD.

01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:58.900
People are having a tremendously
difficult time focusing

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.580
and not just because they're sleepy,

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:02.300
they just can't seem to
anchor their attention.

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.200
And there could be
multiple reasons for this,

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.850
but there are now several
clinical trials ongoing

01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:10.270
using light to try and anchor
people's attention and mood

01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:12.000
and wellbeing for sake of focus.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.540
And I think that while I love this saying

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.690
that you mentioned, "Take
a photon, not a pill."

01:43:17.690 --> 01:43:21.510
And with due respect to
the need for pharmacology

01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:22.743
for some certain people,

01:43:22.743 --> 01:43:26.080
I think most people just
haven't really dialed in

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.150
their relationship to light
in a way that allows them

01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:29.743
to rule out whether or
not they need medication.

01:43:29.743 --> 01:43:31.340
- Absolutely, absolutely.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.670
That's the best way to put it.

01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:33.853
I can't add to that.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.620
- Let's talk about jet lag.
- Mm hm.

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:40.930
- But not in the context of,
okay, if somebody's traveling

01:43:40.930 --> 01:43:43.270
from Europe to Japan
or from the east coast,

01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:45.140
because that varies tremendously, right?

01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:47.020
I mean, there's as many
different variations

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:50.147
on travel as there are
individuals out there with roles-

01:43:50.147 --> 01:43:52.460
- Right.
- And jobs, et cetera.

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:55.120
But rather, let's talk
about what are the two

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.720
or three things that people can do

01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.440
to adjust their schedule quickly?

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.347
Yesterday, I called you and said,

01:44:01.347 --> 01:44:04.080
"Look, I know somebody
who's traveling six hours.

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.490
I won't even mention in which direction,

01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:08.160
'cause I don't want people
to anchor to that example.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.160
And you described some very
simple tools of viewing light

01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:15.810
a little bit earlier than normal

01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:18.630
and getting on the local
food schedule, et cetera,

01:44:18.630 --> 01:44:20.802
that would allow them
to shift more quickly.

01:44:20.802 --> 01:44:21.635
- Exactly.
- And the reason I want to

01:44:21.635 --> 01:44:23.810
have this conversation is
yes, for the travelers,

01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:25.840
and for the shift workers,

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.200
but mostly because of the
fact that you've proven

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:33.660
again and again that people are disrupted

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:36.407
in their circadian behavior at home.

01:44:36.407 --> 01:44:39.040
So, aside from what we've
already talked about,

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.400
how can one adjust
quickly to a new schedule?

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.120
Like let's say, fall classes are starting,

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.790
you start a new job or you have a baby

01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:48.590
or a puppy or whatever,
what is the best way

01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:50.220
to shift the clock quickly?

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.620
- So, it's very simple as
we've talked yesterday.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:56.860
So imagine you're in the outside
with no industrial light.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.100
If your body thinks
you're in early evening

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:04.970
and you see a bright light,
what does this tell you?

01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:07.640
Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.200
It's still early afternoon
or late afternoon.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.930
So I have to delay my clock
to go back to late afternoon.

01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:18.170
So if you get light early in the evening,

01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:20.100
it delays your clock.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.490
So what does that-
- Meaning that makes you

01:45:21.490 --> 01:45:22.900
want to go to sleep later?

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.101
- Yes, it delays your clock.

01:45:24.101 --> 01:45:27.790
So, you're in New York, right?

01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:29.780
People in Italy have an advanced clock

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:33.060
because they are six hours ahead of us.

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:36.517
So if you're in New York
and you get light early

01:45:36.517 --> 01:45:39.470
in the evening, you delay
even further from Italy.

01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:42.100
So now you're delaying away from Italy.

01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:43.610
Now the same thing happens.

01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:45.730
Let's say, you thought dawn came up

01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:47.740
and you thought it's already dawn,

01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.830
but it was let's say three
o'clock in the morning

01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:50.860
or four o'clock in the morning.

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.737
And then you get to
bright light and you say,

01:45:52.737 --> 01:45:53.840
"Oh, wait a minute.

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.840
Dawn is not the up yet."

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.430
So I should advance my clock.

01:45:57.430 --> 01:46:01.460
Or I'm at night, but I'm
getting bright lights,

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:04.670
so I should run because
dawn is already up.

01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:09.270
So then later in the
night, later in your night,

01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:11.950
and actually it just
happens that in humans

01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:14.850
you get a temperature
nadir later in the night,

01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:16.560
low temperature in your body.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.060
After that, lights start
advancing your clock.

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.570
So if you want to go to Italy,

01:46:21.570 --> 01:46:23.470
instead of getting light
early in the evening,

01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:26.730
you want to get light
after the temperature low.

01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:30.060
So you could advance your clock
even before you go to Italy,

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.890
and you're catching up to the
Italians just by using light.

01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:34.420
It's as simple as that.
- Great.

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:36.730
- So you could do it for every region.

01:46:36.730 --> 01:46:40.010
You could calculate how much
they are advanced of you.

01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:42.947
You could know how much these
light shifts happen per day,

01:46:42.947 --> 01:46:45.950
and you can calculate what you need to do,

01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:49.900
very simple math, to adjust
either in direction of delaying

01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.810
if you're going from
New York to California,

01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:53.420
you want to delay your clock

01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:56.350
or advancing if you're going
from New York to Italy.

01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:58.610
- So, in order to make that a visual

01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:00.250
and because a lot of people
are listening to this,

01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:01.850
not looking at it on video,

01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:06.850
we will put a zero cost
downloadable figure of this

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:10.300
on the HubermanLab.com website
related to this episode.

01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:14.440
But I think I can summarize
it in language as well.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.530
If I understand correctly,

01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:19.120
what you're saying is if
your typical wake up time

01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.010
is say, 7:00 a.m., then your
low point in temperature

01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:25.890
probably occurs somewhere
around 5:00 a.m..

01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:27.670
- Yeah.
- And if you view light

01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:30.480
right around then it's
going to essentially

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.760
advance your clock.
- Yeah.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.660
Because then your body thinks,
oh, it's seven o'clock,

01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:37.040
so advanced your clock
by one to two hours.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:40.800
- But if I were to view
light, say at 3:00 a.m.,

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.720
then it would probably delay my clock?

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.930
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:47:43.930 --> 01:47:47.220
Yeah, so, and then let's say
I land in a new schedule.

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.390
I want to adjust to a new schedule.

01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:50.050
Let's say I didn't manage to do anything

01:47:50.050 --> 01:47:51.490
with my light viewing before I went.

01:47:51.490 --> 01:47:53.530
And I didn't anticipate the trip.

01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:56.240
Suddenly I'm on a new schedule, okay?

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.800
I was told that one of the
ways to help shift the clock

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.100
and to avoid gastrointestinal issues

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:04.510
is to eat on the local schedule.

01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:07.110
- Mm hm.
- To start basically behaving

01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:08.270
like a local.
- Mm hm.

01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:10.740
- Even though your
circadian clock will take

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:11.607
a little bit of time to catch up.

01:48:11.607 --> 01:48:12.850
- Right, absolutely.

01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:15.410
But you have to remember the light, right?

01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:17.990
So, now that we explained it very simply,

01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:20.850
let's take a very simple example, right?

01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:23.880
New York to Italy,
that's a simple example.

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.830
New York time, Italy time,
six hour difference, right?

01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:29.650
So let's say you fly
from New York at night.

01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:31.900
You reach Italy at eight
o'clock in the morning.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:35.510
What is the time in your
New York time although you-

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:36.343
- Six hours back.
- Six hours back.

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:38.540
- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- It's 2:00 a.m..

01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.830
So when you land Italy,

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:42.180
you want to avoid light like the plague.

01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.220
Yeah, you could eat,

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:44.417
but you really don't
want to get the light.

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:46.320
- Right, 'cause otherwise
it's going to delay you.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.310
- It's going to delay you, it's
going to send you to California

01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:49.680
instead of sending you to Italy.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.600
- Right, and so this is such a key point.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.970
If anyone's confused about this,

01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:54.310
we will put some diagrams up.

01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:57.770
But what Samer is saying is so crucial.

01:48:57.770 --> 01:49:00.150
Just because getting
bright light in your eyes

01:49:00.150 --> 01:49:02.460
early in the day is really
beneficial when you're at home,

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.970
when you travel to a new time zone,

01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:08.963
you have to take into account
what your body thinks.

01:49:10.253 --> 01:49:12.290
Excuse me, you have to
take into account where

01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:13.510
your body thinks you are.
- Exactly.

01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:15.590
- And so if you're looking
at the Italian sunrise,

01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:17.910
having just flown from New York to Italy

01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:20.050
and you didn't prepare
for that trip by waking up

01:49:20.050 --> 01:49:21.640
a little bit earlier in anticipation-

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.780
- Multiple days, yeah.
- And you view light

01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:27.590
at 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. Italian time,

01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:29.400
beautiful Italian sunrise,

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.090
you are going to delay your clock.

01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:33.940
You're going to basically throw
yourself back to California,

01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.240
but you are in Italy.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:37.280
You're going to throw your
biology back to California

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:40.050
and you are going to be up in
the middle of the Italian night.

01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:42.430
And you're going to be miserable-
- Miserable.

01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:44.150
- I'll tell a brief anecdote

01:49:44.150 --> 01:49:46.770
'cause I called Samer in desperation.

01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:49.060
A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi,

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:52.010
NYU Abu Dhabi to give a
seminar, 12 hours out of phase.

01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:53.090
It's a 12 hour flip.

01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:55.170
And I thought I could just muscle it.

01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:56.910
I thought I'll get up, just view sunlight

01:49:56.910 --> 01:50:00.900
when the sun comes up and I fell apart

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:02.080
mentally and physically.

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.310
And Samer came to my rescue.

01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:06.070
I called him, I said, "I
don't know what to do."

01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:11.070
And he said, "Go to the
gym at the local dawn,

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:17.580
workout, eat and then view
sunlight starting the next day."

01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:19.920
And that basically got me on the schedule.

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.210
So I used food and
exercise to adjust myself

01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:24.080
because my light viewing activity

01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.560
was just completely out of whack.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.130
- Yeah, I mean, and we
talked about other details,

01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:31.070
so you have to calculate it,
but you're absolutely right.

01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:35.550
I mean, it's very
important to avoid getting

01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:37.410
the wrong light information
when you're trying

01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:40.108
to adjust your body because
otherwise it shifts you

01:50:40.108 --> 01:50:43.230
to the other cycle, absolutely right.

01:50:43.230 --> 01:50:47.450
- Well, you are one of these
people that has such vigor.

01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:49.670
It's one of these things
where having known you

01:50:49.670 --> 01:50:52.760
all these years, you have a
tremendous capacity for work

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.020
and for soccer, and for
arguing, respectful arguing.

01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.900
And sometimes, you know-
- It's getting worse with age.

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.840
- Yeah, well, we could
talk about that offline,

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:05.440
but I think a lot of your
vigor and a lot of your ability

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:08.710
to work hard and focus and
really do so many things

01:51:08.710 --> 01:51:11.240
at an impressive level is
because you think about

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.190
these issues and you think about

01:51:13.190 --> 01:51:15.610
when you're going to be optimal for focus,

01:51:15.610 --> 01:51:18.306
when you're going to be
optimal for exercise,

01:51:18.306 --> 01:51:20.167
and the when is the key.
- Right.

01:51:20.167 --> 01:51:22.490
- And I think a lot of
people live in the landscape

01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:25.180
of feeling like there's
something broken inside them

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.580
because they can't focus-
- It's subconscious.

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:27.930
- Or they get too-
- It's subconscious, right?

01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:30.020
Remember it's all subconscious.

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.160
These effects and, Andrew,
you're absolutely right.

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.220
Now, honestly, joking aside about age,

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:37.990
I really agree with you that
I think part of the reason

01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:40.030
I'm continuing to be able to do this,

01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:42.150
that I really think about it.

01:51:42.150 --> 01:51:45.830
And I make sure that I
keep everything aligned.

01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:47.660
And that actually helps me a lot.

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.930
Like I don't suffer in sleep.

01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:51.170
I don't suffer in waking up.

01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:53.600
I never use a timer to wake up.

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.200
I mean, people say, aren't you scared?

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:58.150
Like you have to give a
lecture at 8:00 or 7:30.

01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:59.500
Honestly, I was like, there is no way

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:01.110
I'm going to go beyond that.

01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.530
It just, even if I try,

01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:05.700
I can't sleep beyond 6:00
a.m. in my regular times,

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.430
it's just, it's not going to happen.

01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:10.750
By 4:30 my eyes are wide
awake and I'm in bed.

01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:14.583
It's just system is so aligned, it works.

01:52:15.810 --> 01:52:18.360
- A lot of times people will
say, how come I go to sleep,

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.600
I fall asleep fine, but then
I wake up at 3:00 or 4:00

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.770
in the morning and can't fall back asleep.

01:52:22.770 --> 01:52:24.780
Is it possible that those
people were supposed

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.360
to go to bed at 8:00 p.m.?

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.230
- It's possible.

01:52:27.230 --> 01:52:28.800
I mean, it is possible.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.580
It is also possible that
sometimes people will wake up

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:32.750
and go back to sleep.

01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:35.520
But yeah, I mean, it is possible.

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.570
Or it's possible that their
clock is completely misaligned,

01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:41.540
that they are getting
maybe a nap time at night

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.373
when they are supposed...

01:52:42.373 --> 01:52:44.450
And then they possibly
feel so sleepy in the day.

01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:46.920
So, all these are possible combination.

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.630
- Well, that's an interesting
idea I hadn't considered.

01:52:48.630 --> 01:52:50.740
So, that what they think is their sleep,

01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:53.550
their body is so out of whack
with the light-dark cycle,

01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:55.410
that it's actually a nap.
- A nap.

01:52:55.410 --> 01:52:57.120
Or the weaker part of the sleep.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.840
I mean, you see this when you traveled

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.250
to different time zone before you adjust.

01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:03.950
You go to sleep really well,

01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:06.380
but two hours later, you're fully up.

01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:07.380
Two hours.

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:09.890
If you were so tired and
this is your regular sleep,

01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:13.310
there's no way you're going
to wake up in two hours.

01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:16.380
So, then you feel very
sleepy later in the day

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:17.213
or something like that.

01:53:17.213 --> 01:53:20.150
So it depends of how your whole system

01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:21.600
is aligned to the environment.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.273
- That's a very interesting idea.

01:53:24.525 --> 01:53:26.920
I think that's going to
resonate with a lot of people.

01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:30.610
I wake up every morning
around 3:00 or 4:00,

01:53:30.610 --> 01:53:32.490
I generally use the bathroom

01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:34.770
and then I fall back asleep very deeply.

01:53:34.770 --> 01:53:37.400
It doesn't seem to disrupt
my daytime wakefulness.

01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:40.390
And I think a lot of people
obsess over that waking up

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:41.223
and worry there's something wrong.

01:53:41.223 --> 01:53:42.700
- Absolutely.
- Provided they can go back

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:43.543
to sleep it's okay.
- Exactly.

01:53:43.543 --> 01:53:46.070
If you can go use the
bathroom, go back to sleep,

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:48.170
that should not be a problem.

01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:50.063
Maybe with some people, when
they go to use the bathroom,

01:53:50.063 --> 01:53:51.520
they use very bright light and then

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.730
they get an alerting signal.

01:53:53.730 --> 01:53:57.920
So, maybe it could be as simple
as that, that affects you.

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.450
Maybe when you wake up,
you put tons of light

01:54:00.450 --> 01:54:02.490
or you start reading your iPad.

01:54:02.490 --> 01:54:05.270
So there's all these combination
that we still don't know

01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:08.080
about that could be affecting
their sleep-wake rhythms

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.410
and their sleep maintenance.

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:13.480
- Do you take melatonin?

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.720
- I don't need it to be honest.

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.930
In my case, there is no reason to use it

01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:20.880
because I could guarantee you
that by maybe eight o'clock,

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.140
my melatonin has already started to go up.

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:25.640
And by the time I sleep,
my melatonin is very high

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.150
because I don't use a lot
of lights after sunset.

01:54:29.150 --> 01:54:30.267
- And light inhibits melatonin release.

01:54:30.267 --> 01:54:33.510
- And light really blocks melatonin level.

01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:37.450
- You hear this myth that
the pineal gland calcifies

01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:38.283
as we get older.

01:54:38.283 --> 01:54:39.283
Do you know anything about that?

01:54:39.283 --> 01:54:42.460
- I mean, I've heard about
that, but I don't know...

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:44.340
I mean, there is not very clear evidence

01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.480
that it affects the sleep.

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.310
I don't know much about it, to be honest.

01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:49.130
- Yeah, the evidence that
I've seen is that yes,

01:54:49.130 --> 01:54:51.260
there's some calcification
around the pineal,

01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:53.833
just because of where
it sits in the brain.

01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:57.187
It's close to some bony structures.

01:54:57.187 --> 01:54:58.800
- I see.
- But I don't think

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.710
there's any evidence that
it has negative effects.

01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:03.230
- I mean, if you still have,

01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:05.460
you could measure melatonin
and that should tell you

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.600
if it has any, it's such
an easy thing to do.

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.130
- Yeah, I think this is more
of a internet wellness thing

01:55:11.130 --> 01:55:14.103
that got outside the cage.
- That's possible.

01:55:14.103 --> 01:55:15.480
I think you're absolutely right.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:18.080
- Yeah, it sounds terrible, calcification

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.790
of the thing, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:22.423
Like the heart thing, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:26.103
Let's talk about seasonality a little bit.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:31.283
I learned, and I don't
know if this is still true,

01:55:32.210 --> 01:55:37.210
but that most suicides occur
in April, in the spring.

01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:38.827
I think there's a poem that says,

01:55:38.827 --> 01:55:40.510
"April is the cruelest month,"

01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:42.253
I think as the poem begins.

01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:47.260
Are there data that
suicides are more frequent

01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:48.650
at particular times of year?

01:55:48.650 --> 01:55:50.880
And if so, is the spring
that time of year?

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.380
- Yeah, a lot of people talk about this.

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:57.080
And one of the hypothesis
is that the winter month

01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:59.630
that are very bad for mood,

01:55:59.630 --> 01:56:02.040
make people not wanting to do anything.

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.600
And they get into such
deep level of depression

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.140
that when the sun comes up,

01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:10.000
they get actually the energy
to act on their depression,

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.503
which sounds really terrible.

01:56:11.503 --> 01:56:12.770
And it's just terrible.
- Sounds just terrible.

01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:14.760
It's terrible.
- So that's the idea

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.040
that the lack of light
throughout the winter

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.110
caused them to go into such depression

01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:21.720
that they don't feel like doing anything.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.090
Then when the light comes
in with rigor in the spring,

01:56:25.090 --> 01:56:28.250
it gives them that after all
the depression they suffered,

01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:33.250
it gives them that push to take
that sad, final act I guess.

01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.330
- What other seasonal effects have been

01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:37.490
demonstrated in humans?

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:40.500
- Yeah, I mean, I think in
humans, it's not very clear

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.540
because we don't think about seasonality,

01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:45.273
but if you start thinking about us,

01:56:45.273 --> 01:56:48.050
I think we go through
major seasonal changes.

01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.883
I really do.

01:56:48.883 --> 01:56:51.760
I think our eating pattern
changed across the year.

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:54.610
I could tell you that
me thinking about this,

01:56:54.610 --> 01:56:58.520
there is a clear changes that
happens to me across the year.

01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:00.880
But for animals, this is really essential

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:05.370
because for animals they have
to time their mating behavior

01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:09.390
was when they deliver their
progeny in the most abundant

01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:12.030
amount of food and artificial light

01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:13.990
is causing major disruption.

01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:16.630
Because if you change
the way these animals

01:57:16.630 --> 01:57:19.020
are receiving the light information,

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:22.120
they either start mating
much earlier or much later

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.640
and their numbers dwindle.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:27.040
And they get into the
dangers of really completely

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.030
getting eliminated or extinct.

01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:31.050
- Well, human birth rates
are definitely going down.

01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:32.950
- Right, in some-
- I mean, in the US

01:57:33.942 --> 01:57:35.462
in particular, yeah.
- In some areas, not others.

01:57:35.462 --> 01:57:36.513
- Not others, right.

01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:41.420
But are there other effects
of seasonality on humans

01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.870
that we are aware of?

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:46.098
- Honestly, you could see it perfectly,

01:57:46.098 --> 01:57:48.418
I think, in Scandinavia,

01:57:48.418 --> 01:57:51.320
I mean, you could talk
to people who live in-

01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:53.050
- Sure, they get seasonal depression.

01:57:53.050 --> 01:57:54.660
- Well, seasonal depression is one,

01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:57.020
but actually when you start
asking them questions,

01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:00.630
they tell you like in the winter
they barely could wake up.

01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:03.550
They barely have the energy,
before even depression.

01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:05.960
Even people who don't
get seasonal depression,

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:08.100
they will tell you our
energy level is lower.

01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:11.300
Our ability to go to work is not the same.

01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:14.990
And in the summer, most people
actually sleep very little.

01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:19.250
They tell you, we really
can feel like we're manic,

01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:22.680
we have all this energy
and not in a negative way,

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.720
in a funny way, right?

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:27.080
I mean, but if we want to sleep,
we have to put this curtain.

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.180
And I think in these situations,

01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:32.600
you could really appreciate
the seasonality of humans.

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.620
I think we kind of
destroyed our seasonality

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:39.820
because we don't get exposed
to that much natural light.

01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:43.300
We have all this artificial
light, but I think honestly,

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.410
one of the thing that is going to happen

01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:48.890
if they follow your
recommendations about giving light

01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:50.660
at the same time, giving
food, giving exercise-

01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:52.843
- Wait, let's be clear, those
are your recommendations.

01:58:52.843 --> 01:58:54.880
- Well, I mean-
- No, I mean just

01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.100
in fair attribution.

01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:58.540
- What I'm saying is that
this is going to cause them

01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:01.710
to also experience some
changes across the season,

01:59:01.710 --> 01:59:04.950
because now they're going
to see the sun differently.

01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:08.150
If you're going to go out in
the morning in the summer,

01:59:08.150 --> 01:59:09.530
you're going to get a much brighter...

01:59:09.530 --> 01:59:11.240
That's why I don't like
the change in time.

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.710
I know people think, oh,
because you're biased,

01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:16.080
'cause I think-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.095
Sorry, the change in time,

01:59:17.095 --> 01:59:18.420
are you talking about daylight savings?

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:19.253
- Daylight savings.

01:59:19.253 --> 01:59:21.790
It's such a bad idea because it disrupts

01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:24.200
that rhythm that you're having.

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:27.090
'Cause I think your body,
if you keep that rhythm,

01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:28.860
you will see the whole seasonality.

01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:32.023
And I look at it from a different
aspect than other people.

01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:35.350
And people say I'm biased
because I'm a morning person,

01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:39.030
and it may be true, but
there are situation-

01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:41.080
- Secret conspiracy about morning people.

01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.340
- Yeah, but if you think about it, Andrew,

01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:46.870
there is a situation
where you're getting light

01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:48.530
perfectly well and then all of a sudden

01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:50.690
they delayed by one hour because...

01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:53.070
And then even though it's the summer,

01:59:53.070 --> 01:59:55.967
your body now, if you're
still not adjusting think,

01:59:55.967 --> 01:59:57.340
"Oh wait, what happened?

01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:58.550
What kind of happened?"

01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:59.780
- Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up

01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:03.950
because I always thought
what's the big deal, one hour?

02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:05.120
Right, one hour shift.

02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.770
Spring forward, fall back.
- It's so hard to adjust

02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:08.020
to one hour actually.

02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:11.690
- But this goes back to the
beginning of our discussion.

02:00:11.690 --> 02:00:13.750
It's not just one hour.
- Right.

02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:16.376
- Because it's one hour
across that one day.

02:00:16.376 --> 02:00:17.390
- Right.
- But there's this cumulative

02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:20.660
effect on the clock and
these three elements

02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:22.387
of your tripartite model.
- Yeah, exactly.

02:00:22.387 --> 02:00:24.820
- Right, the homeostatic,
sleep and the light,

02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:26.270
direct effects on mood.
- Exactly and when

02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:29.650
it's so close, it's
sometimes hard to figure out

02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:32.290
how to adjust it perfectly because

02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:34.160
we're already sleep
deprived in our society.

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.887
And then you shift it by...

02:00:36.887 --> 02:00:40.750
So it just, it all accumulates
and it has no benefit.

02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:42.860
- Well, you work at a major
government organization,

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:44.006
National Institute of Mental Health.

02:00:44.006 --> 02:00:45.677
- Yeah.
- Why don't we campaign for-

02:00:45.677 --> 02:00:47.620
- Honestly, I have no idea.

02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.453
I mean, it makes no sense.

02:00:48.453 --> 02:00:50.110
- No, I'm saying why don't we go campaign?

02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:50.943
- Yeah, I would love to.

02:00:50.943 --> 02:00:54.470
I mean, it makes no sense
to have the summer light

02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:56.440
goes up at 9:00 p.m.,

02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.597
the light goes down where I
live in Baltimore at 9:00 p.m.

02:00:59.597 --> 02:01:01.360
And then all of a sudden,

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:04.890
when you really want to see
the light longer in the day,

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.267
you now shift the other way.

02:01:06.267 --> 02:01:08.117
And now it goes all of
a sudden at 6:00 p.m..

02:01:08.117 --> 02:01:10.410
Why do you do these drastic changes?

02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:14.070
Let it blend across the
whole season, you know?

02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:18.030
Yes, later, earlier at night,
but it's at least consistent.

02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:20.170
It goes in a very consistent manner.

02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:22.130
I just don't understand why they do this.

02:01:22.130 --> 02:01:23.400
It makes no sense.

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:25.900
- Well, I think that the reason they do it

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:27.820
is because they don't
understand the biology.

02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:29.630
- Exactly, absolutely.
- Because one hour seems

02:01:29.630 --> 02:01:31.120
trivial unless you understand-
- It's not.

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:34.530
- That the repercussions
of that one hour shift,

02:01:34.530 --> 02:01:37.810
because what's also clear now
based on what you're saying,

02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:41.040
is that that one hour shift
taking you out of alignment

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:42.700
with the natural light-dark cycle

02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.860
in exactly the wrong direction.

02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:47.350
- It's pushing people to get even later.

02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:48.300
- Yeah.
- In the summer,

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:51.040
when light is going to
push you later anyway.

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:52.200
It doesn't make sense.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.450
You put it beautifully, I just
rambled and this is really-

02:01:55.450 --> 02:01:56.413
- No, no, you made it clear.

02:01:56.413 --> 02:02:00.310
- I mean, it's like
literally it it made people

02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:03.780
who are having problem having
an advanced sleep rhythm

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:05.260
because they are delayed,

02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:08.160
now you give them this hour to
make them even more delayed.

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:10.880
You push them even later
in the day-night cycle.

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:13.303
It just doesn't make sense at all.

02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:17.010
- I think 2022 should be the year that we

02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:17.843
abolish daylight savings.
- Oh, man.

02:02:17.843 --> 02:02:20.603
That would be the day for me honestly.

02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:24.100
- Well, also, if it has a positive effect

02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:28.970
on what is essentially an
epidemic of mental health issues

02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:31.900
and other issues related
to improper interactions

02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:36.900
with light, that I think
is a well worthwhile cause,

02:02:37.230 --> 02:02:38.940
and we can explore it.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:41.805
- [Andrew] So for once we're
going to fight with another group.

02:02:41.805 --> 02:02:42.638
- Common, I would do to do that.

02:02:42.638 --> 02:02:44.297
- [Andrew] A common battle as
opposed to with one another.

02:02:44.297 --> 02:02:45.853
- I mean, the circadian people honestly,

02:02:45.853 --> 02:02:48.370
to give them credit, have
been trying for years

02:02:48.370 --> 02:02:50.020
to abolish daylight saving.

02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.450
- Yeah, the problem is they
all go to sleep at 9:00 p.m.

02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:54.410
and wake up at 4:00 a.m.,
so we never see them.

02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:55.750
- That's right, that's right.

02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:59.240
- No, the circadian community
has done an amazing job

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:02.880
of figuring out what we need.
- Right.

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.360
- And then the challenge of course,

02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:07.140
is making sure that
people get what they need.

02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:08.150
- Right.
- And making sure

02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:11.670
that at a societal level,
we're not vaulting ourselves

02:03:11.670 --> 02:03:13.070
into the wrong direction.
- And the biggest problem

02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:18.070
is that the late waking
people, they think that really,

02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:20.710
and I'm going to try to
put it in a better way now,

02:03:20.710 --> 02:03:22.730
they think, oh, because
you're a morning person,

02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.130
you want to see the sun early.

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:27.330
So you want me to suffer it dropping late,

02:03:27.330 --> 02:03:29.060
but that's not the case.

02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.800
Because what happens is
when they shift it back

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.670
after the daylight saving,

02:03:34.670 --> 02:03:36.820
now they're going to make
you suffer really badly

02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:39.460
because now it's going to be earlier.

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:41.295
- Right, in the fall.
- In the fall when there

02:03:41.295 --> 02:03:42.177
is not enough light.
- Yeah, that's right.

02:03:42.177 --> 02:03:43.830
- And they keep it the same way.

02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:47.310
So to try to convince them
that actually this at the end

02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:50.150
causes more trouble
when you need the light

02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:52.890
for your late schedule in the fall,

02:03:52.890 --> 02:03:54.490
when they shift it back.

02:03:54.490 --> 02:03:57.020
Then they say, keep it
daylight saving all the time.

02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.700
And that has been proven
that it's very bad.

02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:04.030
Like people have done studies
that literally two areas

02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:07.540
close to each others and
areas that were the whole year

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.560
on daylight saving has much more problems

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.610
even in cancer rates and depression.

02:04:12.610 --> 02:04:14.130
So you don't want to do that.

02:04:14.130 --> 02:04:16.870
So that's what trying to convince people

02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:20.270
that you need to prevent that switch,

02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:22.850
and you don't need daylight saving at all.

02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:25.100
That's where the problem happens.

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.220
- Interesting.

02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:28.330
I had not thought about that, but yes,

02:04:28.330 --> 02:04:32.530
you late risers that in the
fall, when it's the fall back,

02:04:32.530 --> 02:04:33.880
as they say, spring forward, fall back,

02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:35.280
you dial back the clock,

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.440
it's really compounding the problem

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.570
that already exists.
- Exactly.

02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:40.940
And it's really nice if you think,

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:43.120
if you keep it consistent in the spring,

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:47.950
you get the equinox and then
the day starts going up,

02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:49.470
and then even in the
summer it start going down,

02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:52.460
and then the fall you get the
other equinox and go back.

02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:54.660
So it's very symmetrical, right?

02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:57.930
It goes into short day,
longer, long, long, long, long,

02:04:57.930 --> 02:04:59.470
and then short day again.

02:04:59.470 --> 02:05:02.400
But now you're getting
these bumps in both sides

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.170
of the spring and fall.

02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:05.210
Why would you do that?

02:05:05.210 --> 02:05:07.490
Something that is beautifully symmetrical,

02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:10.060
beautifully smooth, you're
putting bumps into it.

02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:13.110
- Well, and not just
beautiful because it's there,

02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:14.900
but it evolved.

02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:15.964
I mean, essentially this is the system-

02:05:15.964 --> 02:05:17.688
- It's natural.
- We evolved in for hundreds

02:05:17.688 --> 02:05:18.521
of thousands of years.
- This is the seasonality.

02:05:18.521 --> 02:05:21.330
The most even apart
from the exact equator,

02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:23.703
every part of the earth has seasonality.

02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:27.870
- I want to briefly touch
on something which is

02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:29.760
individual and genetic variation

02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.890
in the sensitivity to light.
- Yeah.

02:05:31.890 --> 02:05:35.490
- So not chronotype, but first of all,

02:05:35.490 --> 02:05:37.580
a very basic question.

02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:42.250
Do people with light
eyes, light colored eyes,

02:05:42.250 --> 02:05:44.230
are they more sensitive
to light than people

02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:46.050
with darker pigmented eyes?

02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:48.690
- I mean, honestly, it makes
sense they will be more

02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:51.360
because if you think of my dark pupil,

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:52.810
it's blocking more light.

02:05:52.810 --> 02:05:55.750
So, if you have light pupil,

02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:58.030
yes, for vision, it may
not be very obvious,

02:05:58.030 --> 02:06:00.460
but for something that is
measuring the amount of light,

02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:02.430
you're getting more light than me.

02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:06.380
So you would probably need
less light to be effective

02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:08.630
as somebody who's darker.

02:06:08.630 --> 02:06:11.710
And that maybe could explain
why sometimes lighter people

02:06:11.710 --> 02:06:14.080
say, I don't want to go
into very bright conditions

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:17.360
because it's really bright.
- Yeah, I can't even

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:19.830
be at a cafe with one of
these reflective tables,

02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:20.850
like a metal table.
- Right.

02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:22.681
- Unless I have very dark sunglasses on.

02:06:22.681 --> 02:06:23.514
- Exactly.
- It's so bright

02:06:23.514 --> 02:06:24.712
it's painful for me.
- Right, right.

02:06:24.712 --> 02:06:25.870
- Whereas some people like
you, we've sat outside

02:06:25.870 --> 02:06:28.240
and had meals and you're like fine.

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.457
I assumed it was kind of
Jordanian toughness versus-

02:06:30.457 --> 02:06:33.230
- No, no, no, it's really
the pupil blocks more light.

02:06:33.230 --> 02:06:37.050
So I think it is possible that
it's as simple as the pupil

02:06:37.050 --> 02:06:39.093
blocking more light can have sensitivity,

02:06:39.093 --> 02:06:41.520
but your question is also goes deeper.

02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:44.570
Are there more sensitivity differences?

02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:47.930
And my understanding would be
I would think that it may be,

02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:50.590
depends on how effective your cells

02:06:50.590 --> 02:06:55.053
are in responding to light,
how healthy your ipRCGs are.

02:06:56.130 --> 02:06:58.210
But there's not many studies to show that.

02:06:58.210 --> 02:07:00.450
What is really clear that is happening

02:07:00.450 --> 02:07:03.540
is that patients with bipolar,

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:06.070
they seem to have different
sensitivities to light.

02:07:06.070 --> 02:07:07.970
So it seems that at least people

02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:12.420
who have psychological changes,

02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:16.057
they may have differences to
the sensitivity of light, so.

02:07:17.290 --> 02:07:20.050
- Are those differences
in a particular direction?

02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:21.870
- I don't remember the exact data.

02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:24.063
- We can look it up, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:27.470
- And people have heard
me say this at nauseum

02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:29.280
to the point where they
actually roll their eyes,

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:32.230
but that these are the
only two pieces of brain,

02:07:32.230 --> 02:07:33.360
I'm pointing to my eyes, folks,

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.040
that are outside the cranial vault.

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.350
- Absolutely.
- They are two pieces of brain

02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:39.180
that it basically inform
the brain about whether

02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:40.970
or not to be alert or asleep.
- Absolutely.

02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:43.120
- But you can imagine that
those two little pieces of brain

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:46.753
that we call eyes would
have genetic variations.

02:07:46.753 --> 02:07:47.586
- Right.
- Of course eye color

02:07:47.586 --> 02:07:49.170
is genetically determined,

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:53.750
that there would be
genetic variations based on

02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:56.860
whether or not your ancestry
evolved near the equator

02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.643
or further from the equator, right?

02:07:58.643 --> 02:08:01.202
I mean, you see more
blue eyes in Scandinavia,

02:08:01.202 --> 02:08:02.035
than you do at the equator.
- Absolutely, I mean,

02:08:02.035 --> 02:08:06.050
it's the lack of light that
said you need less inhibition

02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:07.660
because there's not enough light, right?

02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:10.003
So that's the idea of the changing color.

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.720
So, yeah, I totally agree with you.

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:16.880
I mean, I think this is an
area that will be studied later

02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:19.610
and will be empirically determined.

02:08:19.610 --> 02:08:22.200
The problem we have in
this field right now,

02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:24.410
which I think is the biggest problem,

02:08:24.410 --> 02:08:27.770
is we don't have a way
to measure the ipRCGs

02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:29.240
sensitivities in humans.

02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:32.100
So we still like, it's easy to measure

02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:35.090
your rod cone function if
you go to an optometrist,

02:08:35.090 --> 02:08:37.010
they measure all the details, right?

02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:38.730
Contrast detection.
- You look at the chart,

02:08:38.730 --> 02:08:39.760
you get out the Snellen Chart.
- Yeah, exactly.

02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:41.430
- You look at the letters of the DMV.

02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:42.290
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:44.610
- But for the non subconscious,

02:08:44.610 --> 02:08:48.880
we still don't have a good
measuring systems to figure out

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:50.650
what is Andrew's sensitivity?

02:08:50.650 --> 02:08:52.050
What is Samer's sensitivity?

02:08:52.050 --> 02:08:53.480
What is this person's sensitivity?

02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:56.610
And I think we're starting to
work on something like that

02:08:56.610 --> 02:08:58.440
to hopefully develop these techniques.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.300
But till we develop them,

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.470
it's going to be very hard to figure out

02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:04.180
if there is a sensitivity difference?

02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:05.310
How do they relate?

02:09:05.310 --> 02:09:08.060
And on men and woman?

02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:09.400
Dark and light?

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.280
And all that, normal versus
psychologically affect,

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.530
and stuff like that.

02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:16.150
- Fascinating.

02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.980
And every time you talk, I learn so much.

02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:24.624
It's in the best way, the
best sense of the term,

02:09:24.624 --> 02:09:27.470
it's a waterfall of knowledge.

02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:28.820
As a final question,

02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:32.530
I have a question about
sensitivity of a whole other kind,

02:09:32.530 --> 02:09:36.550
and that's the sensitivity to spicy food.

02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:39.010
Now, the reason I'm asking this question,

02:09:39.010 --> 02:09:42.620
what seemingly out of the blue
is that I made the mistake

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:45.340
once of having Samer cook for me.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.460
And I said, "Not too spicy."

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:50.670
And he said, "Okay, not too spicy."

02:09:50.670 --> 02:09:52.600
He actually said, "Okay, not too spicy."

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:55.740
And it almost killed me.

02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:57.980
Like it was like two or three days.

02:09:57.980 --> 02:10:01.970
So you know a lot about biology
outside the visual system,

02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:02.900
light, et cetera.

02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:04.263
You've been around a while.

02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:09.750
Are there known genetic
or inherited of any kind

02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:12.270
sensitivities to spicy food?

02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:14.240
To things like red peppers and capsaicin?

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:18.070
Because what you call mild, my friend,

02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:20.480
almost put me into the hospital.

02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.050
- I think this is similar
to you swimming in the ocean

02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:24.380
and I need to go develop
the pain tolerance to do it.

02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:26.660
- Okay, true, true, I
like cold water swims

02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:27.750
and Samer's not a fan.
- Yeah.

02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:29.314
- But that's going to change.

02:10:29.314 --> 02:10:31.514
It's adaptable.
- These are adaptable.

02:10:31.514 --> 02:10:32.740
- That's going to change.
- That's my belief.

02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.780
Before I met Rejji, I was like you.

02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:37.510
And once I started eating
a lot of spicy food,

02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:40.610
I lost touch of how spicy my food is.

02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:43.260
So I nearly killed you, Andrew,
and I apologize for that.

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:44.093
- I forgive you.

02:10:44.093 --> 02:10:45.500
So, basically what you're
saying is that marriage

02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:48.260
toughened you up?
- Toughened me up, exactly.

02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:49.220
- [Andrew] Maybe that's the solution.

02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:51.420
- That's what you need, yeah.

02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:55.290
- Samer, this has been an amazing march

02:10:55.290 --> 02:10:57.300
through the importance of light,

02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:59.560
not just for regulating
sleep and wakefulness,

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:03.600
but also for food timing,
the interactions with mood,

02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:05.610
the interactions with exercise.

02:11:05.610 --> 02:11:09.070
I'm certain that people are
going to start thinking about

02:11:09.070 --> 02:11:11.280
how to change their
relationship with light

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:14.740
as a way to anchor
everything that they do.

02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.150
And that's important to their health.

02:11:16.150 --> 02:11:18.310
And I just on behalf of all of them,

02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:20.830
and just directly from me as your friend

02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:24.100
and as a colleague for many
years now, I just want to say,

02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:26.210
thank you for the
incredible work you're doing

02:11:26.210 --> 02:11:27.630
and for sharing it with us.

02:11:27.630 --> 02:11:28.463
- Thank you so much.

02:11:28.463 --> 02:11:31.710
And I actually now thinking
about all of this, and you said,

02:11:31.710 --> 02:11:32.660
I should write a book.

02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:35.670
I should write a book and call
it "The Tripartite Model."

02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:38.360
I think that would put all
these components together,

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:41.440
it would be very interesting
to do at some point.

02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:43.360
- You should write a book.

02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.117
They'll probably try and
change the title to like,

02:11:45.117 --> 02:11:47.633
"Food, Mood and You," or something.

02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:51.240
But you can put in little
print The Tripartite Model

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.260
or whatever, but regardless
of what it's called,

02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:57.060
you absolutely should write a book.

02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:00.480
And so if you'd like
Samer to write a book,

02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:01.820
or if you'd like to learn more about him,

02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:03.810
let's talk a little bit about
where people can find you.

02:12:03.810 --> 02:12:05.260
Your laboratory is at
the National Institutes

02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:06.400
of Mental Health.

02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.000
He is Head of the Chronobiology Unit,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.030
all these things as
I've mentioned earlier,

02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:13.510
but you are active on
Twitter and Instagram.

02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:15.090
- Right.
- So, what is your

02:12:15.090 --> 02:12:17.043
Twitter handle?
- It's @SamerHattar.

02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:21.820
- And we will provide a link
for that in the show notes.

02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:23.726
- Yes, the Twitter @SamerHattar,

02:12:23.726 --> 02:12:25.340
and I think the same for Instagram.

02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:27.620
Yeah, actually.
- And Samer has been

02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:30.440
coaxed onto Instagram, so he
does post from time to time,

02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:34.183
mostly pictures of food
that is incredibly spicy,

02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:37.890
but also information about chronobiology.

02:12:37.890 --> 02:12:39.780
He comes on for an
Instagram Live every once

02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:41.010
in a while with me.

02:12:41.010 --> 02:12:44.223
So, definitely give him a
follow there and on Twitter.

02:12:44.223 --> 02:12:49.054
And I'm sure that he'll be
happy to answer questions

02:12:49.054 --> 02:12:53.760
and entertain any and all
discussions about chronobiology.

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:54.820
- Absolutely, yeah.

02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.290
And light, yeah.

02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:58.360
- Great, thank you, Samer.

02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.920
- Awesome, thank you, Andrew.

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:02.230
- Thank you for joining
me for my conversation

02:13:02.230 --> 02:13:03.760
with Dr. Samer Hattar.

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:08.060

Both those places I teach neuroscience

02:14:14.380 --> 02:14:16.500
and offer information
that's not always covered

02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:18.220
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:20.360
And last, but certainly not least,

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:22.176
thank you for your interest in science.
