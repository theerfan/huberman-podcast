00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.721
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.554
where we discuss science

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:05.973
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.180
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.260
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.850
Today I have the pleasure of
introducing Dr. Anna Lembke.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.300
Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist
and the chief of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.650
the Addiction Medicine
Dual Diagnosis Clinic

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.300
at Stanford University School of Medicine.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.670
She's a psychiatrist who treats patients

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.620
struggling with addiction.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.260
She has successfully treated
patients dealing with

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.960
drug addiction, alcohol addiction,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.660
and behavioral addictions,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.040
such as gambling and sex addiction,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.410
as well as other types of addiction.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.760
In fact, during our discussion,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.590
I learned that there are
a huge range of behaviors

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.020
and substances to which
people can become addicted to,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.960
and that there is a common
biological underpinning

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.780
of all those addictions.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380
I also learned that there is a common path

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.090
to the treatment and recovery

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.230
from essentially all addictions.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.350
Dr. Lembke explained that to me

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.640
and explained how to think
about and conceptualize

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.050
our own addictions,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.130
as well as the addictions of other people

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.300
who are struggling to get
treatment, move through treatment,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.360
and stay sober from their addictions.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.720
In addition to treating patients,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.060
Dr. Lembke is an author
and was featured in

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.020
the 2020 Netflix documentary,
"The Social Dilemma".

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.590
I'm excited to tell you that
she has a new book coming out

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.340
called "Dopamine Nation,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.800
Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence".

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.890
The book comes out August 24th

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.200
and is an absolutely
fascinating read into addiction

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.040
and ways to treat various
types of addiction.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.110
I've read the book cover to cover,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.650
and all I'll tell you is that
at the very first chapter

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.640
and throughout, you are going
to be absolutely blown away.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.290
The stories about her patients
are extremely engaging.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.120
It brings forward the
real struggle of addiction

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.930
and the incredible, I think
it's fair to say heroic battles,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.410
that people fight in order
to get through addictions

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.820
of various kinds.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.730
And all of that is woven through
with story, with science,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.640
in ways that make it very
accessible to anyone,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.670
whether or not you have a
science background or not.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.550
I can't recommend it highly enough.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.383
So again, the book is

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:15.850
"Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance
in the Age of Indulgence",

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.270
it comes out August
24th of this year, 2021.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.030
And you can pre-order that
book by going to Amazon.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.780
We will provide a link to
that in the show caption.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.890
Before we begin,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.160
I just want to mention that
this podcast is separate

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.610
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.770
It is however part of my desire and effort

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.530
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.340
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.430
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.320
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.410
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.380
ROKA make sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.100
that are of the absolute utmost quality.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.650
Founded by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.770
everything about the
sunglasses and eye glasses

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.710
that ROKA makes was designed
with performance in mind.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.670
First of all, they're very lightweight.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.570
You don't even really notice
that they're on your face.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.670
Second of all, even if you get
sweaty, they don't slip off.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.600
In fact, they were
designed to be worn at work

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.470
or around the house, but also
if you're running or biking.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.940
So you can move seamlessly
between different activities

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.900
without having to change your
sunglasses or eyeglasses.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.920
In addition, the lenses are designed

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520
with the science of the
visual system in mind.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.720
I've spent my career working on

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.020
the science of the visual system,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.220
and I can tell you that it's
not trivial to build a lens

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.300
that allows you to see
with perfect clarity,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.750
whether or not you're in bright sunshine

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.210
and then move into shadows.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.330
But the ROKA glasses allow you to do that.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.600
You always see things
with absolute clarity.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.760
Another terrific thing about
ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.940
is the aesthetic.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.724
A lot of so-called performance
sunglasses and eyeglasses,

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:45.330
they're not really built
with the best aesthetic

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.640
and they kind of make
people look like cyborgs.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.440
With ROKA, they have a
lot of different styles

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.660
to choose from, but all
those styles are the sort

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.820
that you could wear out
to dinner or to work,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.440
or when engaging in physical activity.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.920
If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses you can go to ROKA,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.790
that's R-O-K-A dot com,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.820
and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.020
And if you do that, you'll
get 20% off your first order.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.006
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.830
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.450
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.990
to help you better understand your body

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.770
and reach your health goals.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.220
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.730
And I've been doing that
for a number of years,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.180
for the simple reason that
most, if not all of the factors,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.700
that impact your immediate
and long-term health,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.660
can only be analyzed in detail
with a quality blood test.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.070
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.520
you can get further insight

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.410
into what's going on beneath
the hood, so to speak.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.010
The problem with a lot of
blood and DNA tests, however,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.280
is you get numbers back,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.920
you get the levels back of various things

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.160
and you find out if certain
things are too high or too low

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.400
or right on target,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.280
but there are no directives
about how to move those numbers

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.701
in the direction that you
would want them to go.

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:53.220
With InsideTracker, they have a dashboard

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.890
that makes all of that very easy,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.595
and that dashboard takes your numbers

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:58.670
and can help direct you towards

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.900
particular lifestyle factors,
nutrition factors, exercise,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.590
supplementation, et cetera,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.730
that can help you bring
those numbers into the ranges

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.250
that are right for you.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.760
If you'd like to try
InsideTracker you can go to

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.230
insidetracker.com/huberman.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.530
And if you do that, you'll get 25% off

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.900
any of InsideTracker's plans.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.350
Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.410
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.690
Headspace is a meditation
app that's backed by

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.040
25 published peer review studies

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.780
and has over 600,000 5-star reviews.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.710
I've been meditating for a very long time.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.657
I'm 45-years-old now, almost 46,

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:37.510
and I started meditating when
I was about 15-years-old.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.350
The problem, however, is keeping
up a meditation practice.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.830
I've experienced this myself.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.140
I've had periods of time
where I'm meditating regularly

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.000
and then periods of time
where I just kind of

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320
fall off the rails and I'm
just not doing it at all.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.210
There's now tons of evidence,
evidence from neuroscience,

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.180
evidence from psychology,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.877
evidence from areas of
biology focused on stress

00:05:57.877 --> 00:06:00.290
and the immune system,
that a meditation practice,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.290
when done regularly,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.740
is extremely beneficial for
mental and physical health,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.730
and things like focus and creativity.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.010
However, you have to do
the meditation practice,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.700
and so if you're not doing it regularly,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.840
that's a serious problem.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.120
And if you are doing it regularly, great.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.840
With Headspace, I find that I can

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.990
stick to a meditation
practice very easily.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.400
In fact, that's why I started using it

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.080
and that's why I continue to use it.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.030
I try and get a meditation
practice in every day,

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.810
but sometimes that requires that it be

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.460
a brief meditation practice.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.100
With Headspace, they have a huge range

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.450
of different meditations
of different durations,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.320
and so that's really helpful
in building and maintaining

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.520
these powerful meditation practices.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.670
If you want to try Headspace

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.983
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:06:42.912 --> 00:06:43.745

you'll get a free one month trial

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.730
with Headspace's full
library of meditations.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.410
This is the best deal
offered by Headspace.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.543
go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.810
And now for my discussion
with Dr. Anna Lembke.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.760
All right, great to have you here.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.640
- Thank you for having me,
I'm excited to be here.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.510
- Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.560
I, and many listeners of this podcast,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.750
are obsessed with dopamine,
and what is dopamine,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.583
how does it work?

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:20.730
We all hear that dopamine is this molecule

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.790
associated with pleasure.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.700
I think the term dopamine hits,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.850
like I'm getting a dopamine
hit from this, from Instagram,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.620
or from likes or from
praise or from whatever,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.053
is now commonly heard.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.760
What is dopamine,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.510
and what are maybe some
things about dopamine

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.040
that most people don't know?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.860
And probably that I don't know either.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.220
- So dopamine is a neurotransmitter,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.490
and neurotransmitters are those molecules

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.780
that bridge the gap between two neurons.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.080
So they essentially allow one neuron,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.760
the pre-synaptic neuron,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.750
to communicate with the
post-synaptic neuron.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.300
Dopamine is intimately associated

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.950
with the experience of reward,
but also with movement,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.360
which I think is really interesting,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.990
because movement and
reward are linked, right?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.600
If you think about,
you know, early humans,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.700
you had to move in order
to go seek out the water

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.640
or the meat or whatever it was.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.450
And even in the most primitive organisms,

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.600
dopamine is released when food
is sensed in the environment.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.763
For example, C elegans,
a very primitive worm.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.810
So dopamine is this really powerful,

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.910
important molecule in the brain

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.410
that helps us experience pleasure.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.160
It's not the only neurotransmitter
involved in pleasure,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.631
but it's a really, really important one.

00:08:48.631 --> 00:08:51.460
And if you want to think about something

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.500
that most people don't
know about dopamine,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.790
which I think is really interesting,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.970
is that we are always releasing dopamine

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.750
at a kind of tonic baseline rate.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.280
And it's really the
deviation from that baseline,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.020
rather than like hits
of dopamine in a vacuum,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.220
that make a difference.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.230
So when we experience pleasure,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.040
our dopamine release goes above baseline,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.200
and likewise dopamine can go
below that tonic baseline,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.960
and then we experience a kind of pain.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.793
- Interesting.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:24.980
So is it fair to say that one's
baseline levels of dopamine,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.900
how frequently we are releasing dopamine,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.570
in the absence of some, I don't know,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.623
drug or food or experience,
just sitting, being,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.290
is that associated with
how happy somebody is,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.660
their kind of baseline of
happiness or level of depression?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.270
- There is evidence that shows
that people who are depressed

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.270
may indeed have lower
tonic levels of dopamine.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.880
So that's a really reasonable thought,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.710
and there is some evidence to
suggest that that may be true.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.757
The other thing that we know,

00:09:58.757 --> 00:10:03.757
and this is really kind
of what the book is about,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.760
is that if we expose ourselves chronically

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.280
to substances or behaviors

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.630
that repeatedly release
large amounts of dopamine

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.200
in our brains reward pathway,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.220
that we can change our tonic baseline

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.530
and actually lower it over time,

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.240
as our brain tries to compensate
for all of that dopamine,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.240
which is more really than we
were designed to experience.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.660
- Interesting and is,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.960
is it the case that our
baseline levels of dopamine

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.150
are set by our genetics, by our heredity?

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.507
- Well I think, you know,
if you think about sort of,

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:44.480
you know, the early stages
of development and infancy,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.950
certainly that is true.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.173
You're kind of, you know,
born with probably whatever is

00:10:49.173 --> 00:10:50.320
your baseline level.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.660
But obviously your experiences
can have a huge impact

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.660
on where your dopamine level
ultimately settles out.

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:03.110
- So if somebody's disposition is one of

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.060
constant excitement and
anticipation, or easily excited,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.410
I think about the kind of
people where you say hey,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.240
do you want to check out
this new place for tacos,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.320
and they're like "Yeah, that'd be great!"

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.720
And other people are a little
more cynical, harder to budge.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.323
Like my bulldog Costello.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.220
Very, very stable, low levels of dopamine

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.023
with big inflections in his case.

00:11:27.109 --> 00:11:31.700
Do you think that's set
in terms of our parents,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.650
and obviously nature and
nurture interact, but is that,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.123
is dopamine at the core
of our temperament?

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.990
- I don't really think we
know the answer to that,

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.360
but I will say that people
are definitely born with

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.360
different temperaments, and
those temperaments do affect

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.330
their ability to experience joy.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.930
And, you know, we've known
that for a long time,

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.430
and we describe that
in many different ways.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.790
One of the ways that we
describe that in the modern era

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.210
is to use psychiatric nomenclature.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.520
Like this person has a dysthymic
temperament, or, you know,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.523
this person has chronic
major depressive disorder.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.300
In terms of looking specifically

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.460
at who's vulnerable to addiction,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.760
that's an interesting sort of mixed bag

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.170
because when you look at the research

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.180
on risk factors for addiction,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.950
so what kind of temperament of a person

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.120
makes them more vulnerable to addiction,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.270
you see some interesting findings.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.950
First you see that people
who are more impulsive

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.460
are more vulnerable to addiction.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.060
So what is impulsivity?

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.450
That means having difficulty
putting space between

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.890
the thought or desire to do something,

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.260
and actually doing it.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.700
And people who have difficulty
putting a space there,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.900
who have a thought to do something

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.480
and just do it impulsively,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.960
are people who are more
vulnerable to addiction.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.793
- Interesting.

00:12:54.793 --> 00:12:57.060
Could I, in terms of impulsivity,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.340
is this something that relates literally

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.130
to the startle reflex?

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.700
Like I, for instance, as a lab director,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.960
I'm familiar with walking
around my lab and when I decide,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.290
deciding I'm going to talk to my people,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.500
of course when they knock on
my door it's always like wait,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.930
why am I being bothered right now?

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.020
Even though I love to talk to them.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.627
But I walk around my
lab from time to time,

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.440
and some people I notice, I'll
say, do you have a moment,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.780
and they'll slowly turn
around and say, yeah,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.293
or no, in some cases.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.170
And other people will jump
the moment I say their name.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.750
They actually have a, a kind
of a heightened startle reflex.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.350
Is that related to impulsivity,

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.630
or is what you're referring to

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.930
an attempt to withhold behavior
that's very deliberate,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.490
under very deliberate conditions?

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.240
- Yeah, so I don't think
that that startle reflex

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.630
is necessarily related to impulsivity.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.400
That can be related to anxiety.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.550
So people who are high anxiety people

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.190
will tend to have more
of a startle reflex.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.280
Impulsivity is a little bit different.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.960
And by the way, impulsivity
is not always bad, right.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.680
Impulsivity is that thing

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.610
where there's not a lot of self-editing

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.003
or worrying about future consequences.

00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:11.010
You know, you have the idea
to do something and you do it.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.020
And of course we can
imagine many scenarios

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.233
where that's absolutely wonderful.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.980
You know, there can be a sort of,

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.980
let's say intimate
interactions between people,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.660
where you wouldn't really want to be

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.110
super inhibited about it, right.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.680
You would want to be
disinhibited and impulsive.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.760
I can also like imagine like

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.060
sort of fight or flight scenarios,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.790
like battle scenarios, right,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.710
where it would really
be good to be impulsive

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.560
and just go rhino!

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.013
- Where hesitation can cost you your life?

00:14:43.013 --> 00:14:44.940
- Right, yes, that's right, that's right.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.000
But, you know,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.923
and I think this brings up a really,

00:14:49.098 --> 00:14:51.050
something that I've come to believe

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.290
after 25 years of practicing psychiatry,

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:59.290
is that what we now conceptualize
in our current ecosystem

00:14:59.554 --> 00:15:02.182
as mental illness,

00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:06.500
are actually traits that
in another ecosystem

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.630
might be very advantageous.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.610
They're just not advantageous right now,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.380
because of the world that we live in.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.070
And I think, you know,

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.230
impulsivity is potentially
one of those, right?

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.580
'Cause we live in this
world that's sort of like,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.580
you have to constantly be
thinking sort of rationally about

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.620
the consequences of X, Y, or Z.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.620
And it's such a sensory
rich environment, right,

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.130
that we're being bombarded with
all of these opportunities,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.720
these sensory opportunities.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.670
And we have to constantly check ourselves.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.760
And so impulsivity is
something that right now

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.610
can be a difficult trait,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.530
but isn't in and of itself a bad thing.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.580
- I see.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.890
And it's, I'm beginning to
realize it's a fine line

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.028
between spontaneity and impulsivity.

00:15:54.028 --> 00:15:54.861
- Yeah.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.750
- What is pleasure and how does it work,

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.470
at the biological level,
and if it feels right,

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.800
at the psychological level?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.030
And if you don't mind
painting a picture of sort of

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:15.030
the range of things that you
have observed in your clinic,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.510
or in life, that people
can become addicted to.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.470
But just to start off really simply,

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.180
what is this thing that we call pleasure?

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.990
- Well, I think it's actually
really hard to define pleasure

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.130
in any kind of succinct way,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.927
because certainly there is
the seeking out of a high,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.810
or a euphoria, or I think, you know,

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.260
the kind of experience that
almost anybody would associate

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.940
with the word pleasure.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.960
But also the seeking out

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.740
of those same substances and behaviors

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.700
is often a way to escape pain.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.393
So for example, when I talk
to people with addiction,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.960
sometimes their initial
foray into using a drug

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.980
is to get pleasure,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.640
but very often it's a way
to escape their suffering,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.450
whatever their suffering may be.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.870
And certainly as people become addicted,

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.010
even those who initially
were seeking out pleasure

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.130
are ultimately just
trying to avoid the pain

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.490
of withdrawal or the
pain of the consequences

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.720
of their drug use.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.720
So I think it's, you know, very
hard to actually, you know,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.903
define it as this unitary thing.

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:33.940
And it's certainly not
just getting a high.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.870
There are so many ways in which people

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.560
sort of want to escape,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.810
which is not the same thing
as sort of this hedonic,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.700
you know, wanting to feel pleasure.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.570
- So someone could decide that
they want to go out and dance,

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.060
or get up and dance, because
of the pleasure of dancing.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.193
I can imagine that.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.160
But, and maybe it's very
difficult for them to stay seated

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.260
when a particular song
comes on, for instance.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.650
But seeking what we would call pleasure

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.430
in order to eliminate pain,

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.360
that evokes a different
picture in my mind.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.400
That evokes a picture of
somebody that feels lost

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.523
or depressed or underwhelmed.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.440
I definitely want to get into the precise

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.100
and general description of
addiction and what that is,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.070
but in a previous conversation we had,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.690
you said something that
really rung in my mind,

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.960
which is that many people who
become addicted to things,

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.160
let's call them addicts,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.320
have this feeling that normal
life isn't interesting enough.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.100
That they are seeking a
super normal experience,

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.340
and that the day-to-day routine balance,

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.297
which is actually in
the title of your book,

00:18:44.297 --> 00:18:47.320
"Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance
in the Age of Indulgence",

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.320
that the word balance itself
can sometimes be a bit of

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.190
an adversive term for people.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.180
And I'm struck by this idea,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.700
and the reason I want to explore it is

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.400
because so much of what I see online

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.820
is about generating a lack of balance,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.740
about being tilted forward at all times,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.640
really leaning into life
hard, experiencing life,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.700
you know, living a full life.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.380
Even the commencement
speech given by Steve Jobs

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.200
on this campus was really
about finding passion, digging.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.290
You know, that's so much
in the narrative now.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.530
So maybe you could just
tell us a little bit

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.630
about your experience
with this association,

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.620
if it really exists, between
people's sense of the normalcy,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.060
or maybe even how boring life can be,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.713
and their tendency to
become addicts of some sort.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.595
- Yeah, well, I mean,

00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:49.595
I think that life for
humans has always been hard,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:55.020
but I think that now it's
harder in unprecedented ways.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.370
And I think that the way
that life is really hard now

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.140
is that it actually is really boring.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.880
And the reason that it's boring is

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.890
because all of our survival
needs are met, right?

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.640
I mean, we don't even
have to leave our homes

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.080
to meet every single physical need,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.590
you know, as long as
you're of a certain level

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.780
of financial wellbeing,
which frankly, you know,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.580
we talk so much about,
you know, the income gap,

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.410
and certainly there is this enormous gap

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.530
between rich and poor.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.320
But that gap is smaller
than it's ever been

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.950
in like the history of humans.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:35.710
Even the poorest of the
poor have more excess income

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.000
to spend on leisure goods,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.170
than they ever have
before in human history.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.760
If you look at leisure time, for example,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.770
so people without a high school education

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.920
have 42% more leisure time

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.925
than people with a college degree.

00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:56.925
So my point here is that life is hard now

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.740
in this really weird way,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.620
in that we don't really have
anything that we have to do.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.450
So we're all forced to
make stuff up, you know,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:13.450
whether it's being a
scientist or being a doctor,

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.100
or being an Olympic athlete, or, you know,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.480
climbing Mount Everest.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.830
And people really vary in
their need for friction.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.360
And some people need a
lot more than others.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.770
And if they don't have it,
they're really, really unhappy.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.810
And I do think that a lot
of the people that I see

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.650
with addiction and other
forms of mental illness

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.890
are people who need more friction.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.970
Like they're unhappy,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.010
not necessarily because
there's something wrong

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.843
with their brain,

00:21:43.843 --> 00:21:48.070
but because their brain is
not suited to this world.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.670
- And do you think they have that sense,

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.380
my brain isn't suited to this world,

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.820
or they simply feel a restlessness

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.620
and they're constantly
seeking stimulation?

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.740
- I think that's right, yeah.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.450
I think it's not really
knowing what's wrong with me,

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.360
and why am I unhappy,
how can I be happier?

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.770
And of course, as you talk about,

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.490
what's so pervasive in our narrative now

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.890
is like find your passion,
you know, find your, you know,

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.520
out of whatever it is, to save the world.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.400
And in a way that's good

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.440
because it has people out
in the world and seeking.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.410
But in a way it can also be
misleading in the sense that

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.749
I think people aren't entirely aware

00:22:31.749 --> 00:22:36.370
that the world is a hard
place, and that life is hard,

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.820
and that, you know, like we're
all kind of making it up.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.888
Do you know what I mean?

00:22:41.888 --> 00:22:42.721
- Yeah.

00:22:42.721 --> 00:22:44.900
Well there's a book by Cal Newport,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.840
I don't know if you
know Cal Newport's work,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.040
but you guys are very
symbiotic in your messages.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.763
He's a professor of computer
science at Georgetown.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.760
Yes, at Georgetown.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.130
And wrote a book some years
ago, really ahead of its time,

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.670
called "So Good They Can't Ignore You",

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:04.670
which is about not
meditating or doing much work

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.410
to try and figure out what
one's passion is by thinking,

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.683
but rather go out and acquire skills,

00:23:10.683 --> 00:23:11.516
- Right.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:14.250
- and develop a sense
of passion for something

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.305
by your experience of hard work

00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:18.225
and getting better end feedback.

00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:19.058
- Right.
- A little bit of

00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:19.891
the growth mindset,

00:23:19.891 --> 00:23:21.040
think of our colleague Carol Dweck.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.080
But he's gone on to
write books, "Deep Work",

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.590
which is all about removing
yourself from technology

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.939
and doing deep work.

00:23:28.939 --> 00:23:29.772
- Yes, right.

00:23:29.772 --> 00:23:31.300
- And he's been a big proponent of

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.475
the evils of context switching
too often throughout the day.

00:23:34.475 --> 00:23:35.308
- [Anna] Yeah.

00:23:35.308 --> 00:23:36.640
- For sake of productivity, mostly.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.850
His new book is called
"A World Without Email."

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.870
I'm beginning to realize,
as I cite off these books

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.860
and your book, "Dopamine Nation,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.020
Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence",

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.520
that maybe the reason why

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.910
you two don't know about one another

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.989
is because neither of
you are on social media.

00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:51.822
- That's it.

00:23:51.822 --> 00:23:52.763
- Right.
- That's it.

00:23:52.763 --> 00:23:54.040
- And yet you're two of
the most productive people

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.710
that I know, including productive authors.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.180
So that's a discussion unto itself.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.940
But I find this fascinating.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.940
So let's talk about the pleasure
pain balance and addiction.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.030
And I've heard you use this seesaw

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.030
or balance scale,

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.280
- Right.
- analogy before.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.290
And I think it's a wonderful
one that really, for me,

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.510
clarified what addiction is,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.593
at least at the mechanistic level.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.250
- Yeah, so to me, one of the
most significant findings

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.420
in neuroscience in the last 75 years

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.420
is that pleasure and pain are co-located,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.130
which means the same parts of the brain

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.070
that process pleasure also process pain.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.910
And they work like a balance.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.680
So when we feel pleasure,
our balance tips one way,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.730
when we feel pain, it tips
in the opposite direction.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.990
And one of the overriding
rules governing this balance

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.560
is that it wants to stay level.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.380
So it doesn't want to
remain tipped very long

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.000
to pleasure or to pain.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.470
And with any deviation from neutrality,

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.950
the brain will work very hard
to restore a level balance,

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.500
or what scientists call homeostasis.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.670
And the way the brain does that is

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.370
with any stimulus to one side,

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.330
there will be a tip in equal

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.810
and opposite amount to the other side.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.740
- It's like the principle laws of physics.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.080
- Yes, right, right.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.270
So like, I like to watch YouTube videos.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.330
When I watch YouTube videos
of "American Idol", you know,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.200
it tips to the side of pleasure.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.330
And then when I stop watching
it, I have a comedown, right,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.720
which is a tip to the
equal and opposite amount

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.640
on the other side.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.550
And that's that moment of wanting to watch

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.160
one more YouTube video, right.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.160
- Yeah, and I just want
to interject there.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.730
So this moment of
wanting to watch another,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.660
that is associated with pain, I think,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.600
is, are we always aware of that happening?

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.005
Because you just described
it in a very conscious way.

00:25:46.005 --> 00:25:46.838
- Right.

00:25:46.838 --> 00:25:49.860
- But when I indulge in something I enjoy,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.045
I'm usually thinking about just wanting

00:25:52.045 --> 00:25:52.960
- Yes, yes.
- more of that thing.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.500
I don't think about the pain,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.170
- Yes.
- I just think about more.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.003
- Right.

00:25:57.003 --> 00:25:58.610
So really excellent point

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.700
because we're mostly not aware of it.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.450
And it's also reflexive.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.640
So it's not something
that consciously happens,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.610
or that we're aware of,

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.320
unless we really begin to pay attention.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.690
And when we begin to pay attention,

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.990
we really can become very
aware of it in the moment.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.701
Again, it's like a falling away.

00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:21.190
You're on social media and, you know,

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.380
you get a good tweet of something,

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.140
and then you can't stop yourself

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.800
because there's this
awareness, a latent awareness,

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.460
that as soon as I disengage
from this behavior,

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.460
I'm going to experience
a kind of a pain, right.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.870
A falling away, a missing that feeling,

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.860
a wanting more of it.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.210
And of course, one way to combat that

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.200
is to do it more, right, and
more, and more, and more.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.900
So I think that is really what
I want people to tune into

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.820
and get an awareness around.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.790
Because once you tune into
it, you can see it a lot.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.490
And then when you begin
to see it, you have an,

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.710
if you keep the model
of the balance in mind,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.710
I think it gives people
kind of a way to imagine

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.310
what they're experiencing
on a neuro-biological level,

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.720
and understand it.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.730
And in that understanding,
get some mastery over it,

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.780
which is really what this is all about.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.120
Because ultimately we do
need to disengage, right?

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.190
We can't live in that
space all the time, right.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.300
We have other things we need to do.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.890
And there are also serious consequences

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.330
that come with trying
to repeat and continue

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.610
that experience or that feeling.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.820
- Yeah, so if I understand this correctly,

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.648
when we find something, or
when something finds us,

00:27:37.648 --> 00:27:42.648
that we enjoy, that feels
pleasureful, social media, food,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.550
sex, gambling, whatever it happens to be,

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.510
and we will explore the
full range of these,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.300
there's some dopamine release

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.400
when we engage in that behavior.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.300
And then what you're telling
me is that very quickly,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.133
- [Anna] Yes.

00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.300
- and beneath my conscious awareness,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.117
there's a tilting back of the scale

00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:05.160
where pleasure is reduced,
by way of increasing pain.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.400
- Right.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.210
- And I've heard you say before that

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.210
the pain mechanism has
some competitive advantages

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.360
over the pleasure mechanisms,

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.100
such that it doesn't just
bring the scale back to level.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.563
It actually brings pain
higher than pleasure.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.270
Could you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.433
- Yeah, yeah.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:28.480
So what happens, again,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.030
so the hallmark of any
addictive substance or behavior

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.190
is that it releases a lot of dopamine

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.410
in our brains reward pathway.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.870
Like, right, like broccoli
just doesn't release

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.420
a lot of dopamine, just doesn't, right.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.547
- I'm trying to imagine, I
was about to say, maybe you,

00:28:42.547 --> 00:28:44.913
and I stopped myself because.

00:28:44.913 --> 00:28:47.310
Broccoli's good, it can be really good,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.915
but broccoli is never amazing.

00:28:49.915 --> 00:28:50.748
- Right.

00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:51.581
Broccoli's never amazing.

00:28:51.581 --> 00:28:52.414
- We're never like,
- I mean-

00:28:52.414 --> 00:28:53.616
- this is the most amazing broccoli.

00:28:53.616 --> 00:28:55.010
- Honestly we can probably
find somebody on the planet

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.080
for whom broccoli is amazing.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.240
And of course if I'm
starving, broccoli is amazing.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.073
- Rich Roll.

00:29:00.073 --> 00:29:01.240
Rich Roll is big on plants,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.060
and he has a good relationship to plants.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.630
Rich, tell us how to
make broccoli amazing.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.015
If anyone could do it it'd be Rich.

00:29:09.015 --> 00:29:09.848
- Yeah, yeah.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.100
But what happens right
after I do something

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.600
that is really pleasurable and
releases a lot of dopamine,

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.470
is again, my brain is going
to immediately compensate

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.100
by down-regulating my
own dopamine receptors,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.860
my own dopamine transmission,
to compensate for that, okay.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.970
And that's that come
down, or the hangover,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.540
that after-effect, that moment
of wanting to do it more.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.200
Now, if I just wait for
that feeling to pass,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.150
then my dopamine will re-regulate itself

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.110
and I'll go back to whatever
my chronic baseline is.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.290
But if I don't wait, and
here's really the key,

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.210
if I keep indulging again
and again and again,

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:48.210
ultimately I have so much
on the pain side, right,

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.820
that I've essentially reset my brain

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.210
to what we call like an anhedonic,

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.050
or lacking in joy type of state,

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.430
which is a dopamine-deficit state.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.410
So that's really the way
in which pain can become

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.410
the main driver, is because
I've indulged so much

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.530
in these high reward
behaviors or substances,

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.750
that my brain has had to compensate

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.290
by way down-regulating my own dopamine,

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.440
such that even when I'm
not doing that drug,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.070
I'm in a dopamine deficit state,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.040
which is akin to a clinical depression.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.740
I have anxiety, irritability,
insomnia, dysphoria.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.500
And a lot of mental
preoccupation with using again,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.810
or getting the drug.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.690
And so that's the piece
there, there's the single use,

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:35.580
which easily passes, but it's
the chronic use that can then

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.770
reset really our dopamine thresholds,

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.730
and then nothing is enjoyable, right?

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.260
Then everything sort
of pales in comparison

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.770
to this one drug that
I want to keep doing.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.717
- And that one drug
could be a person, right?

00:30:49.717 --> 00:30:50.770
I mean, I
- Yes.

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.130
- I know people in my life

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.160
that are still talking
about this one relationship,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.000
this one person that was just so great,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.570
despite all the challenges of that thing.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.460
It's almost like they're
addicted to the narrative.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.551
- Yeah.

00:31:04.551 --> 00:31:07.890
- They were maybe, or still
are, addicted to the person.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.530
So it could be to any number
of things, video games, sex,

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.463
gambling, a person, a narrative.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.380
To me, and because of the way
you describe this mechanism,

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.973
this pleasure pain balance,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.270
that all speaks to the
kind of generalizability

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.720
of our brain circuitry.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.880
And this is something that fascinates me,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.420
and I know it fascinates you as well,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.420
which is that nature did not
evolve 20 different mechanisms

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.270
for 20 different types of addiction.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.790
Just like anxiety is a couple
of core sets of hormones

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.270
and neurotransmitters and pathways,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:46.840
and one person is triggered
by social interactions,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.300
another person is triggered by spiders.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.920
But the underlying response is identical.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.750
It sounds like with addiction as well,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.560
there may be some nuance,

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.160
but that there's sort of
a core set of processes.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.920
So it doesn't really matter if
it's gambling or video games

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.734
or sex or a narrative
about a previous lover

00:32:05.734 --> 00:32:07.393
or partner, whatever.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.250
It's the same addictive
process underneath that.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.207
Is that correct?

00:32:12.207 --> 00:32:13.377
- Yes, exactly.

00:32:13.377 --> 00:32:14.880
And that's where this whole idea

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.360
of cross-addiction comes in.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.900
So once you've been
addicted to a substance,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.920
severely addicted,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.260
that makes you more
vulnerable to addiction

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.570
to any substance.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.250
- And when you say
substance, does the same,

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.100
is what you just said
also true for behaviors?

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.130
- Yes, so, when I use the word drug

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.320
I'm talking about substances
and behaviors really.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.360
I'm talking about behaviors
like gambling, sex, you know,

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.780
- Porn.
- gaming, porn,

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.046
absolutely, shopping.

00:32:40.046 --> 00:32:40.879
- Work.

00:32:40.879 --> 00:32:41.712
- Work.

00:32:41.712 --> 00:32:43.520
- You've accused me, I'll
just, for the record,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.050
Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused
me, not accused me,

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.120
has diagnosed me outside the
clinic, in a playful way,

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.970
of being work-addicted.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.300
You're probably right.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.910
The first thoughts I have when I wake up

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.140
are typically about work.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.270
Certainly within 50
milliseconds or so of waking.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.230
And probably the last thoughts I have,

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.370
I would hope are not about work, but yeah,

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.120
I work constantly.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.500
I do other things, but I have
to actively turn that off.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.333
- Yes.

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.220
That's exactly right.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.736
And you're certainly not alone in that.

00:33:12.736 --> 00:33:13.569
And of course-

00:33:13.569 --> 00:33:14.830
- At Stanford, no, no no no.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:15.710
- And we're here in Silicon Valley, right,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.940
it's highly rewarded, right.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.773
So that kind of addiction.

00:33:17.773 --> 00:33:18.640
- It's embedded

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.510
in the culture.
- Oh yeah,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.640
absolutely.
- Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.450
And there's this other city,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.520
I think it's called New York,

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.360
where they also work a lot I hear,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.893
and it's heavily rewarded.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.170
I once said, and I'm sure
that I'm not the first person

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.810
to say it, but I was
thinking about addiction,

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.550
and I was thinking about
the underlying circuits

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.520
and I posted something to
social media which said that

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.360
addiction is a progressive narrowing

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.290
of the things that bring you pleasure.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.140
That was the way that
I kind of crystallized

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.050
the literature in my mind.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.090
And then we met and you of course came and

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.850
gave these amazing lectures
in the neuroanatomy course

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.610
for the medical students,
and the rest is history.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:01.610
But I tossed out a kind of
mirroring statement for that

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.590
as well, which was a bit
overstepping, I admit,

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.100
which I said, addiction
is a progressive narrowing

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.330
of the things that bring you pleasure.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.450
And I said, dare I say,

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.730
enlightenment is a progressive expansion

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.010
of the things that bring you pleasure.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.521
Not that anybody knows
what enlightenment is,

00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:22.440
but it was my attempt to
take a little bit of a jab

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.800
at the fact that nobody knows.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.340
And so why not, why wouldn't I throw

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.987
a neurobiological explanation?

00:34:26.987 --> 00:34:28.833
Just to kind of sample the waters.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.440
And people had varying levels
of response but I would've,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.160
the reason I bring that up is that

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.170
I would imagine that being
able to derive pleasure

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:43.143
from many things would
be a wonderful attribute.

00:34:44.189 --> 00:34:45.360
You know people like this,

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.510
that can experience
pleasure in little things

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.200
and in big events.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.230
Not just, you know, the
big milestones of life,

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.310
but also the subtle, you know, as the,

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.573
like the yogis would say,
the subtle ripples of life.

00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:04.870
If such an ability exists,

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.450
do you think that that reflects

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.720
a healthily tuned dopamine system?

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.040
One that can engage and
enjoy, but then disengage.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.880
Is that what we should be seeking?

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.460
And to underscore,

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.210
I know nothing about enlightenment
meditation, or any of it.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.203
I just, I use these as
opportunities to explore.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.562
- Yeah, so it's a great question

00:35:26.562 --> 00:35:29.890
and I understand the question as,

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.300
so what should we be striving for, right?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.760
Where should we settle out?

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.700
And, you know, in my book,

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.480
I really hold out people in
recovery from severe addiction

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.230
as sort of modern day
prophets for the rest of us,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.460
because I do think that
people who have been addicted

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.820
and then get into recovery,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.820
do have a hard won wisdom
that we can all benefit from.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.640
And the wisdom, I guess, you
know, to distill it down,

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.970
I mean it's many things.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:08.210
But in terms of, you know, dopamine,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:13.060
the wisdom is there are adaptive
ways to get your dopamine.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.910
And there are less than adaptive ways.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:21.260
And in general, you could
describe the adaptive ways

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.090
as not too potent.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.570
So not tipping that balance
too hard or too fast

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.553
to the side of pleasure.

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:31.360
- So does that mean never allowing myself

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.580
to be absolutely in complete bliss?

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.240
Or does it mean not allowing myself

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.240
to stay in that state too long?

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.073
- The latter.

00:36:39.073 --> 00:36:40.233
I think the latter.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.470
Then that gets to temperament,

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.073
so I'm going to get that to a second.

00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:46.510
So, in general, what we want is

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.070
some kind of flexibility in that balance,

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.260
and the ability to easily
reassert homeostasis.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.090
We don't want to break our balance,

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.360
which is possible if we overindulge

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.770
for enough period of time

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.440
and end up with a balance
tipped to the side of pain,

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.920
this dopamine deficit state
we've been talking about.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.510
We want a flexible,
resilient balance, right,

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.670
which can be sensitive to things going on

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.503
in the environment,

00:37:10.503 --> 00:37:13.430
which can experience
pleasure and approach,

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.360
which can experience
pain and recoil, right?

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.840
This is all adaptive and
healthy and necessary and good.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.682
We would never want a
balance that doesn't tilt.

00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:23.515
- Right.

00:37:23.515 --> 00:37:25.380
- That would be a disaster,
we wouldn't be human.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.080
And we wouldn't want that,
it'd be really, really boring.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.913
On the other hand,

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:32.350
what people in recovery from
addiction talk about is,

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:36.070
to some extent having
to learn to live with

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.480
things being a little boring
a lot of the time, right?

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.530
So trying to avoid some of this intensity

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.330
and thrill-seeking and escapism,

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.250
that really is at the core
of addictive tendencies.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.740
- Sorry to interrupt,
but when you say boring,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.860
can we add stressful and boring?

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.693
- Yes.

00:37:54.693 --> 00:37:56.863
- Because there are days where I'm not,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.400
I'm one of these people
that have to remind myself

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.450
to have fun,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.283
- Yes.
- because I sort of forgot

00:38:01.283 --> 00:38:02.390
what the term means,

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.820
because I like to think that I experience

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.070
a lot of pleasure in little things,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.030
but I'm a pretty hard-driving guy.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.520
I like goals and big
milestones and all that stuff.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.353
Anyway.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.340
The point being that
many days I'm not bored

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.420
thinking oh, there's nothing to do,

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.480
but I am kind of overwhelmed
by the number of things

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.810
that are really not pleasureful

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.420
that I have to do.
- Yeah, right.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.708
- I won't mention what they are,

00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:29.560
'cause I don't my colleagues to be like

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.750
that's why you don't respond to emails.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.670
No, just your email.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.020
Not yours Anna, but theirs.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.400
In any event,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.907
so anxiety and boredom can
hang out together, right?

00:38:41.907 --> 00:38:43.720
Am I correct in?

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.553
- Oh, for sure.

00:38:44.553 --> 00:38:47.610
I mean, actually boredom is
highly anxiety-provoking.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.544
- Okay.

00:38:48.544 --> 00:38:49.680
That's good to know, 'cause
I think people hear boredom

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.969
and they think like, oh,
there's nothing to do here.

00:38:52.969 --> 00:38:53.802
- [Anna] Right.

00:38:53.802 --> 00:38:54.635
- There's nothing.

00:38:54.635 --> 00:38:55.710
I feel like we have a ton to do,

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.480
we just don't really want to do it.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.799
- Right, right.

00:38:58.799 --> 00:38:59.787
- As opposed to something
that we're excited to do.

00:38:59.787 --> 00:39:02.410
- Right, okay, so this gets to sort of

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.450
some of the core things.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.290
Also we were talking about earlier

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.590
about finding your passion.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.563
So I'm going to try to
link it all together.

00:39:08.563 --> 00:39:11.140
But basically boredom,

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.810
first of all boredom is a rare
experience for modern humans,

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.530
because we're constantly
distracting ourselves

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.520
from the present moment,

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.780
and we have an infinite number
of ways to do that, right.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.810
But boredom is really, I think,

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.300
an important and necessary experience.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.480
But it is scary because when
you allow yourself to be bored,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.250
let's say you were, had
that list of all the things

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.640
you hate to do, but you
actually got them all done.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.473
Imagine that.

00:39:37.473 --> 00:39:40.370
And you got your forthcoming book done,

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.776
and you did all your interviews.

00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:44.146
- It could happen!

00:39:44.146 --> 00:39:45.167
Lightning could strike.
- Right.

00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:47.780
And you walked your dog,
and you cleaned your house,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.730
and you went shopping.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.130
Imagine that for a moment.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.290
You would be sitting in your house,

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:58.290
and my guess is you would
be terrified because, wow,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.090
what am I supposed to do now, right?

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.220
There's nothing I really have to do.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.190
And that is really, really scary.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.830
That can feel like free fall.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.520
And yet that's really an important

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.140
and good experience to have.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.750
And I think that is an experience

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:17.750
out of which we can have a
lot of creative initiative,

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.810
but also really consider
our priorities and values.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.660
Okay, here I am on planet Earth.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.773
What the he-haw am I
going to do with my life?

00:40:25.773 --> 00:40:27.140
What do I really care about?

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.860
How do I really want to spend my time,

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.440
when I'm not distracting myself, you know,

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.280
in order to spend it.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.500
And, you know, then this
gets back to our conversation

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.750
a little bit earlier about
finding your passion.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.790
So I think that one of
the big problems now

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.500
that's very misguided about this idea

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.220
of finding your passion,

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.050
it's almost as if people
are looking to fit the key

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.360
into the lock of the thing
that was meant for them to do.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.610
- Right, and then
everything will feel like

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:53.443
a natural progression?

00:40:53.443 --> 00:40:55.220
- Right, and then everything
will be wonderful.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.570
- I can attest to the fact
that is not how it works

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.810
in any endeavor.
- Yeah, right.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.163
And that you'll have all
this great success or.

00:41:02.015 --> 00:41:06.310
And here's where I really
think the answer lies.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.860
And I really, really believe this.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.826
Stop looking for your passion

00:41:10.826 --> 00:41:15.563
and instead look around
right where you are.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.290
Stop distracting yourself, look
around right where you are,

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.420
and see what needs to be done.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.880
So not what do I want to do,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.830
but what is the work
that needs to be done?

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.663
And more importantly,

00:41:29.663 --> 00:41:32.310
it doesn't have to be some grandiose work.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.820
Like does the garbage need
to be taken out, right?

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.610
Is there some garbage
on your neighbor's lawn

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.443
that someone threw there,

00:41:39.443 --> 00:41:41.820
that you could actually
bend over and pick up

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.670
and put into the garbage can?

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.540
Look around you.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.650
There is so much work
that needs to be done

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.670
that nobody wants to do.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.660
That is really, really important,
and if we all did that,

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.200
I really think the world
would be a much better place.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.950
And this is what people
who have severe addiction,

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:02.620
who get into recovery, realize.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.550
They're like, it's not
about me and my will

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.940
and what I'm going to will
in my life or in the world.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.250
It's about looking around
what needs to be done.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.930
What is the work that I am
called to do in this moment?

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.010
Which also is incredibly freeing

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.750
because I don't have to
search for the perfect thing.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.010
There's a lot of burden
now on young people,

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.810
that they have to find that perfect thing,

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.260
and until they've found
that perfect thing,

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.600
they're going to be miserable.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.180
You don't have to do that.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.860
Look at the life you were given,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.283
look at the people around you,

00:42:34.283 --> 00:42:37.870
look at the jobs that
present themselves to you

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:42.870
and do that job simply and
honorably, one day at a time,

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.660
with a kind of humility.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.180
I think this is really
what's so striking to me

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.430
about the wisdom of people in recovery.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.670
There's this incredible humility

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.350
that comes out of that experience.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.000
You feel so broken, so ashamed,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.990
but you pick yourself up one day at a time

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:02.000
and you build a life that's around

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.680
what can I do right in this moment,

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.360
that might benefit another
person, and thereby benefit me?

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.360
- Yeah it's a really important
point, and if you're willing,

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:17.950
I'd like to actually stay
on this issue of passion,

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:22.950
because I think the dopamine systems,

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.923
if I understand them correctly,

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.560
the dopamine systems merge with this work

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.393
that you're referring to,

00:43:30.393 --> 00:43:32.560
this immediacy of things calling to us,

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.830
like taking out the trash,

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.550
which sounds frankly really
boring, to be honest.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.220
I hate taking out the trash, but I do it,

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.290
'cause I like a clean home

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.323
and I like a home that smells good.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.630
Or at least doesn't smell bad.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.220
So we do these things, and
not that we want to offer

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.290
some larger carrot as a
consequence of doing those things.

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.710
But if I understand correctly,
what you're saying is

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:01.360
in the act of looking at
one's immediate environment,

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.860
acting on that immediate environment,

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:08.860
we cultivate a relationship
to these circuits in our brain

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.090
about action and reward
that, at least to my mind,

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.670
span the range of small
things being rewarding,

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.060
and then lead us to the
bigger things being rewarding.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.300
It's not like all we're
going to do is take out trash

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.310
and tend to house.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.670
We eventually will venture out,

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:27.490
and we eventually will find
careers and work on those.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:28.460
But if I understand correctly,

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.670
you're talking about getting
into a sort of functional

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.090
or adaptive action step,

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:37.210
and it's the action step that
these days we tend to overlook

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:39.900
because most of our mindset is in things

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:43.180
that are truly outside
of our immediate reality.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.230
Do I have that correct?

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.926
- Yeah, that was beautifully said.

00:44:45.926 --> 00:44:47.480
And I would just add to that,

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.820
I see a lot of young
people who, for example,

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.720
spend most of their waking
hours playing video games,

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.010
and they come to me and they say

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.000
I am anxious and depressed.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.830
I'm majoring in computer science.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.683
I hate it, I thought I would like it.

00:45:01.528 --> 00:45:03.040
You know, if I could only find that thing

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.390
that I was really meant to
do, my life would be better.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.920
And my first intervention for

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.640
the many many people like that

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.280
that I see in clinical care
is, you have it backwards.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.040
I don't say it quite like that.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.670
You were waiting for that thing

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.490
to pull you out of the video game world.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.210
And you're never going to find it,

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.050
as long as you're playing video games.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.560
'Cause video games are so
powerfully dopaminergic

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.320
that you have this distorted sense of

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.020
really pleasure and pain.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.370
And you will not be able to
find that thing that you enjoy.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.940
And so of course the intervention is

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.170
abstain from video games,
reset your reward pathways,

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.190
start with a level balance.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:43.610
And what invariably happens,

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.890
and I've just seen it over
20 years so many times

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:49.163
I've become really a believer in this,

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.040
all of a sudden it's like oh wow,

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.070
my computer science class
is interesting this quarter.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:00.780
It's like okay, you know,
you have a receptivity then

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.450
to experiencing pleasure and reward

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.960
in a way you just don't have

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.010
when you're bombarding
your reward pathways

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.910
with these high dopamine drugs.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.360
- Very interesting.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.450
And just to underscore this notion

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.320
that tending to the immediate things

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.543
can lead to super performance.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.260
I may have mentioned it
earlier this episode,

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.300
but if I didn't I'll mention it now,

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.240
which is I have the great privilege

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.210
of having some close friends
that were in the SEAL teams

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.677
and doing some work
with those communities.

00:46:27.677 --> 00:46:30.530
And it's a remarkable community
for reasons that I think

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.840
most people don't understand.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.300
People think, they see the images,

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.940
carrying logs down the
beach, and all this,

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.130
blowing stuff up, all the stuff that's fun

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.250
for guys like that.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.310
But all of the guys I know
who were in the SEAL teams

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:46.190
have this sense of duty
about immediate things,

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.960
and not just holding the door and doing,

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.740
helping with the dishes
and moving things around.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.220
They are constantly
scanning their environment

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.477
for what can be done.

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.310
- Ah!

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.010
- They essentially conquer
every environment they're in.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:00.830
They are also some of the
most competitive human beings

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.220
in the world, and they do it,

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.710
unless they're in the act of war fighting,

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.423
which is their real job.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.470
They do it in every environment,
in a very benevolent way.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.030
And it's a remarkable thing because it,

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.380
I think it's what is part of
what they're selected for.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.740
And, you know, there's a range there.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.490
But I think when we hear about

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:22.540
tending to the immediate things,

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.110
or this phrase, you know,

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.760
how you do one thing
is how you do anything.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.160
That's a tricky one for me,

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.573
because there are certain
things I just don't do well.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.040
But should we always be trying?

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.260
I think that the tending to,
setting the horizon in closely

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.680
and tending to things in
one's immediate environment,

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.850
I think is very powerful and translates,

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:42.860
- Yes.
- because again,

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.700
I think the nervous system,
it performs algorithms.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.850
It has action steps.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.950
The brain doesn't evolve to do one thing,

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.700
it evolves to be able
to use the same approach

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.770
to doing lots of different things.

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.210
- Yes.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.900
I just want to add, so even beyond that,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.150
'cause that totally resonates for me,

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.020
and is very consistent with people

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.520
in recovery from addiction

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.920
who learn to take it one day at a time,

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.390
which is one of the, you know,

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.030
standard lingo from Alcoholics Anonymous

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:10.380
and other 12-step groups.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.600
But I think also, as you say, you know,

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.490
our brain is really wired
for the 24-hour period.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:21.000
We're not very good at sort
of the, you know, 10 year, 20.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.540
I mean we have this huge frontal lobes

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.530
and yes, we're great planners and we can,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.710
but if we live too much in that space,

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.590
we can really get very anxious
and depressed and lost,

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:33.280
and either catastrophize or get grandiose.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.155
But if you can chunk it down to a day,

00:48:36.155 --> 00:48:38.690
what people in recovery talk about is how,

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.410
if I can just do today right,

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:44.470
then I will get a chain of days

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:49.000
that seem insignificant
in their individual units,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.820
but after six months
or a year or two years

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.940
of those good days, I've got
two very good years, right,

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.610
and I look back and it's like oh wow,

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.640
I guess I did all that.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.990
But I think that's really,
you know, one of the keys,

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.990
is really taking it one day at a time,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.830
which your SEALs,

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:07.480
and also this connecting
with the environment, right?

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.450
So being awake and alert
to your environment,

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.320
and connecting with your environment,

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.740
not trying to escape it.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.640
And of course escapism is
what we all want and desire,

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.550
that experience of non being.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.950
And we get it from the
internet or from drugs

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.980
or whatever it is, but
it's the booby prize.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.520
Because ultimately it takes
you further and further away

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.385
from your immediate environment,

00:49:29.385 --> 00:49:30.820
which is where we really have to connect

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.560
to get that sense of
grounded-ness and authenticity,

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.620
and like of being in our own lives.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.970
- Well I think the unit of the day

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.507
is something that comes
up again and again,

00:49:40.507 --> 00:49:42.900
in my discussions with colleagues

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.240
who are extremely successful,

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.195
and who also have balanced lives.

00:49:47.195 --> 00:49:48.028
- Right.

00:49:48.028 --> 00:49:49.260
- This actually came up in the discussion

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.950
with Karl Deisseroth, who is
also a successful scientist

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.950
and clinician and, you know,
manages a family, et cetera.

00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:59.860
So the unit of the day,
I think, is fundamental.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.330
And those stack up, as you mentioned.

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.320
So along those lines,

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.740
I've heard you say that in order to reset

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.520
the dopamine system,

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.270
essentially in order to
break an addictive pattern,

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.483
to become un-addicted,

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.700
30 days of zero interaction
with that substance,

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.450
that person, et cetera.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.680
- Right.
- Is that correct?

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.960
- Yeah, and 30 days is,
in my clinical experience,

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.750
the average amount of time it takes

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.880
for the brain to reset reward pathways

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.810
for dopamine transmission
to regenerate itself.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.770
There's also a little bit of science

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.820
that suggests that that's true.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.000
Some imaging studies showing that

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.480
our brains are still in
a dopamine-deficit state

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.880
two weeks after we've been using our drug.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.620
And then a study by Schukit and Brown

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:51.190
which took a group of depressed men

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.710
who also were addicted to alcohol,

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.880
put them in a hospital where they,

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.480
they received no treatment for depression

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.430
but they had no access
to alcohol in that time.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.550
And after four weeks,

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:06.460
80% of them no longer met
criteria for major depression.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:10.040
So again, this idea that
by depriving ourselves

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.540
of this high dopamine high
reward substance or behavior,

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.160
we allow our brains to
regenerate its own dopamine,

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.770
for the balance to really equilibrate.

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:19.970
And then we're in a place

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.670
where we can sort of enjoy other things.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.220
- So that progressive narrowing

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.320
- Right.
- of what brings one pleasure,

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.440
eventually expands.

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.170
So I'd like to dissect out that 30 days

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.563
a little more finely.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.430
And I also want to address

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.520
how does one stop doing
something for 30 days,

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.720
if the thing is a thought?

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.930
So we'll kind of, I'll put that
on the shelf for the moment.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:45.743
So days one through 10,

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.669
I would imagine will
be very uncomfortable.

00:51:49.669 --> 00:51:50.502
- [Anna] Yes.

00:51:50.502 --> 00:51:52.870
- They're going to suck
basically, to be quite honest,

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:56.963
because the way you described
this pleasure pain balance,

00:51:56.963 --> 00:52:00.270
to my mind says that if you remove

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.110
what little pleasure one is
getting, or a lot of pleasure

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.280
from engaging in some
behavior, that's gone.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.860
The pain system is really ramped up.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.720
And nothing is making me feel good.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.260
I'll just use myself as an example.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.700
I'm not in recovery but, you know,

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.270
that 10 days is going to be miserable.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:23.660
Anxiety, trouble sleeping,
physical agitation.

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.300
- Yes.
- To the point where,

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.410
you know, maybe impulsive, angry.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.860
Should one expect all of that?

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.110
Should the family members of
people expect all of that?

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:34.943
- Yeah.

00:52:34.943 --> 00:52:36.270
So what I say to patients,

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.190
and it's a really important
piece of this intervention,

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:42.920
is that you will feel worse
before you feel better.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.790
- For how long,

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.380
is probably the first question they ask,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.213
right?
- Yes.

00:52:46.213 --> 00:52:49.110
And I say usually, in
my clinical experience,

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.850
you'll feel worse for two weeks,

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:53.630
but if you can make it
through those first two weeks,

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:56.270
the sun will start to
come out in week three.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:57.640
And by week four,

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.860
most people are feeling a
whole lot better than they were

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.746
before they stopped using their substance.

00:53:03.746 --> 00:53:07.190
So yeah, you have to, it's a hard thing.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.150
Like you have to sign up for it.

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:11.880
And I will say, obviously there
are people with addictions

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.990
that are so severe that as
long as they have access

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.100
to their drug or behavior,

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.780
they're not able to stop themselves.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.910
And that's why we have, you know,

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:20.366
higher levels of care,

00:53:20.366 --> 00:53:21.240
- Sure.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.073
- residential treatment.

00:53:22.073 --> 00:53:24.160
So this is not going to be for
everybody, this intervention,

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.530
but it's amazing how many people

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.310
with really severe addictions
to things like heroin,

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:34.000
cocaine, you know, very
severe pornography addictions.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.790
I posit this, I do it as an experiment.

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.520
I said you know what,
let's try this experiment.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.450
I'm always amazed, number one,
how many of them are willing.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.060
And number two, how many of
them are actually able to do it.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.860
They are able to do it.

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.090
And so that little nudge is
sort of just what they need,

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:53.210
And the carrot is, you know,

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.930
there's a better life out there for you

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:58.100
and you'll be able to taste it in a month.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.900
You really will be able to begin to see

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.230
that you can feel better,
and that there's another way.

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:09.230
- So the way you describe
it seems like it's hard,

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.410
but it's doable for most people,

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.840
not everybody.
- Yeah, right.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.950
- And we'll return to
that category of people

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.633
who can't do that on their own.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:24.400
Well, then days 21 through
30, people are feeling better.

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.505
The sun is starting to
come out, as you mentioned,

00:54:27.505 --> 00:54:30.460
which translates in the
narrative we've created here,

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.440
and supported by biology,

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.870
that dopamine is starting to be released

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:38.130
in response to the taste of
a really good cup of coffee,

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:39.620
- Yes, exactly.
- for instance.

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.600
Whereas before it was
only to insert, you know,

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.433
addictive behavior.

00:54:44.433 --> 00:54:46.420
- Right, that's right.
- Whichever it happens to be.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.270
- Of course, coffee can be addictive too,

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.103
but we'll leave that

00:54:48.103 --> 00:54:49.367
aside.
- Sure, yeah.

00:54:49.367 --> 00:54:51.460
I feel like coffee has a kind of

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.170
consumption limiting mechanism built-in,

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:57.600
where at some point you
just can't ingest anymore.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.430
- Yeah.
- But maybe that's wrong.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:03.690
Sorry to give lift to the
caffeine addicts out there.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.113
As I clutch my mug.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.060
So days 21 through 30.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.440
I've seen a lot of people
go through addiction

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.273
and addiction treatment.

00:55:15.273 --> 00:55:18.400
I've spent a lot of time
in those places, actually,

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.620
looking at it, researching.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.010
I've got friends in that community.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:22.743
I'm close with that community.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.070
One thing I've seen over and over again,

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:28.380
sadly often in the same individuals,

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:33.380
is they get sober from
whatever, they're doing great.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:36.610
These are people with families.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.000
These are people that you

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.350
discard your normal image of an addict

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:44.160
and insert the most normal, typical,

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.180
whatever, healthy person you can imagine.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:49.970
'Cause a lot of these people
you wouldn't know were addicts.

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:52.920
And then all of a sudden
you get this call,

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.850
so-and-so's back in jail.

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.880
So-and-so's wife is going to leave him

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.120
because he drank two bottles of wine

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.750
and took a Xanax at 7:00 a.m.,

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.260
crashed his truck into a pole,
has got two beautiful kids.

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.640
Like how did this happen again?

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.220
To the point where by the
fourth and fifth time,

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.720
people are just done.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.010
I mean maybe people,

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:17.860
you might be able to detect
the frustration in my voice.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.130
I'm dealing with this,
with somebody that's like,

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.810
I don't even know that I
want to help this time.

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:25.200
It's been so many times,

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.570
to the point where I'm starting to wonder

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:29.550
is this person just an addict.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:33.080
This is just kind of what
they do and who they are.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.130
And you never want to
give up on people but,

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:37.040
and I'm hanging in there for them.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.790
But I will say that many
people have given up on them.

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:44.160
And so what I'd like to
talk about in this context

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.355
is what sorts of things help other people

00:56:48.355 --> 00:56:49.360
that we know that are addicted?

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.560
What really helps?

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:56.070
Not what could help,
but what really helps.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:57:01.070
And are there certain people
for whom it's hopeless?

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.620
I mean, I don't like to hold
the conversation that way,

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.971
but I wouldn't be close
to the real life data

00:57:05.971 --> 00:57:07.870
if I didn't ask.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.890
Is it hopeless, are there people who just

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:14.160
will not be able to
quit their substance use

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.840
or their addictive behavior,
despite, I have to assume,

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.933
really wanting to?

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.700
- Yeah, so there are people who will die

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.550
of their disease of addiction, you know,

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:27.850
and I think conceptualizing
it as a disease

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.530
is a helpful frame.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.940
There are other frames that
we could use, but I do think,

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.130
given the brain physiologic
changes that occur

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:40.400
with sustained heavy drug use,

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.850
and what we know happens to the brain,

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:47.560
it is really reasonable to
think of it as a brain disease.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.610
And for me, the real window of,

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.810
let's say being able
to access my compassion

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:57.740
around people who are repeat relapsers,

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.760
even when their life is so much better

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.593
when they're in recovery.
- Oh yeah, yeah.

00:58:00.593 --> 00:58:02.373
- It's like a no-brainer, right?

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.480
Is to conceptualize this balance

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.870
and the dopamine deficit state,

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:09.890
and a balance tilted to the side of pain.

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:13.170
And to imagine that for some people,

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:16.980
after a month or six months,
or maybe even six years,

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.170
their balance is still
tipped to the side of pain.

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:24.180
That on some level that
balance has lost its resilience

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.680
and its ability to restore homeostasis.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.250
- It's almost like the
hinge on that balance

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.124
- Yes.
- is messed up.

00:58:29.124 --> 00:58:30.140
- Exactly.

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.900
And so, I mean,

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.980
for someone who's never
experienced addiction,

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:37.520
like yourself, maybe one
way to conceptualize it is.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.353
- Well I didn't say that.

00:58:38.353 --> 00:58:39.186
- [Anna] Oh okay.

00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:43.920
- To be clear, I was not
referring to myself, but I,

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.670
in this example I was giving,
if I were, I would come clean.

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.810
I would reveal that.

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.040
But I think that,

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.840
especially after hearing
some of your lectures

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.500
and descriptions of the range
of things that are addictive,

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.680
I think I've been fortunate
I don't have a propensity

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.720
for drugs or alcohol.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.553
- Right, okay.

00:59:01.553 --> 00:59:03.760
- I'm lucky in that way.
- Right, right.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.850
- Frankly, if they remove all
the alcohol from the planet,

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:06.760
I'll just be relieved

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.950
because no one will
offer it to me any more.

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:08.783
- [Anna] Right, right.

00:59:08.783 --> 00:59:11.140
- So don't send me any alcohol.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.130
It won't go to me.

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:13.574
- [Anna] Right.

00:59:13.574 --> 00:59:16.413
- But I don't have that,

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.330
I like to think I have the compassion,

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:25.330
but I don't that empathy for, you know,

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.660
taking a really good situation,

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.927
and what from the outside looks to be

00:59:31.927 --> 00:59:33.760
- Right, right.
- throwing it in the trash.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.520
- Yeah, so okay, so let me,
and this is really, I think,

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.250
important because I also had to

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:42.330
come to an understanding of
this, and I feel that I have

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.090
in my 20 years of seeing these patients.

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:46.580
And of course addiction
is a spectrum disease,

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.874
- Sure.
- right,

00:59:47.874 --> 00:59:49.573
and so you've got the
severe end of things.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.000
Imagine that you had an itch
somewhere on your body, okay.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.160
And it was, I mean, we've
all had that, like, you know,

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.030
whatever the source, it
was super, super itchy.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:03.940
You can go for, you know,
if you really focus,

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.890
you could go for a pretty
good amount of time

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:08.320
not scratching it,

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.690
but the moment you stopped
focusing on not scratching it,

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:13.523
you would scratch it.

01:00:13.523 --> 01:00:16.600
And maybe you'd do it while
you were asleep, right.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.600
And that is what happens to
people with severe addiction.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.310
That balance is essentially broken.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.410
Homeostasis does not get restored,

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:28.960
despite sustained abstinence.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.400
They're living with that
constant specter of that pull.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.130
It never goes away.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:36.810
So let me say, there are
lots of people with addiction

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:37.970
for whom that does go away.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.310
And it goes away at four
weeks for many of them.

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:45.310
But in severe cases, that's
always there and it's lingering,

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.120
and it's the moment when they're
not focusing on not using,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.200
it's like a reflex.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.920
They fall back into it.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.200
It's not purposeful.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.240
It's not because they want to get high.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.050
It's not because they value using drugs

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.650
more than they do their family.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:00:59.483
None of that.

01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:04.483
It's that really they cannot not do it

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.610
when given the opportunity,

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:08.940
and that moment when they're
not thinking about it.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.880
Does that make sense?

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.840
- That's a great description

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.480
and actually in that description

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.160
I can feel a bit of empathy,

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.930
because the way you described

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:18.380
scratching an itch in your sleep.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.790
- Yeah.
- You know,

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:21.525
I've done that with mosquito
bites and some of them,

01:01:21.525 --> 01:01:22.866
- Right.
- you're scratching, you know,

01:01:22.866 --> 01:01:26.330
like you wake up scratching
that mosquito bite.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:31.330
And I also have to admit
that I've experienced

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.610
not feeling like I want
to pick up my phone

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:36.800
because it's so rewarding, but
just finding myself doing it.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.690
- Yes, of course,

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:38.523
yes.
- Like I'm not going to

01:01:38.523 --> 01:01:39.767
use this thing, I'm not
going to use this thing,

01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:41.650
and then just finding myself doing it,

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.090
like what am I doing here?
- Yes, right, right.

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:44.760
- Sort of the how did I get back

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.487
here again?
- Yes, right.

01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:49.440
- And I know enough about
brain function to understand

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.510
that we have circuits that
generate deliberate behavior.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:55.530
And we have circuits that
generate reflexive behavior.

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:58.370
And one of the goals of the nervous system

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:01.120
is to make the deliberate stuff reflexive,

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.420
so you don't have to make the decision,

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.940
because decision-making is
a very costly thing to do.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.773
- Exactly.

01:02:06.773 --> 01:02:07.606
- Decision-making of any kind.

01:02:07.606 --> 01:02:08.439
- [Anna] Right, right.

01:02:08.439 --> 01:02:09.803
- So that does really help.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.290
I want to just try and weave
together this dopamine puzzle,

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.690
however, because if by week,

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.690
so first phase of this 30 or 40 day detox,

01:02:25.866 --> 01:02:27.067
it's like a dopamine fast,

01:02:27.067 --> 01:02:29.370
- Right.
- right, okay.

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:30.510
First 10 days are miserable.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.030
Middle 10 days, the clouds are out,

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.110
there may be some shards
of sunlight coming through.

01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:38.070
And then all of a sudden
sun starts to come out,

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.790
it gets brighter and brighter.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.670
Why is it then that people will relapse,

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:44.960
not just after getting fired from a job

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.920
or their spouse leaving them,

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.633
but when things are going really well?

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:49.030
- Yes.
- Is it this

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:50.710
unconscious mechanism?

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:52.980
'Cause I've seen this before.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.990
They have a great win,

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:57.700
I have a friend who's a
really impressive creative.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.430
I don't want to reveal any more than that.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.400
And relapsed upon getting another

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.700
really terrific opportunity to
create for the entire world.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.210
And I was like how can that happen?

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.480
But now I'm beginning to wonder,

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.210
was it the dopamine
associated with that win

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.103
that opened the spigot
on his dopamine system?

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.860
Because it happened in a phase of

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.280
a really great stretch of life.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.890
- Yeah, right.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:27.690
Yeah, so you raise that great
point about triggers, right?

01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:30.480
And triggers are things that make us

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.050
want to go back to using our drug.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:35.340
And the key thing about
triggers, whatever they are,

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.070
is they also release a little
bit of dopamine, right?

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:43.310
So just thinking about
whatever the trigger is

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:45.250
that we associate with drug use,

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.240
or just thinking about drug use,

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.040
can already release this
anticipatory dopamine,

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.220
this new little mini spike.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.710
But here's the part that I
think is really fascinating.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:57.240
That mini spike is followed
by a mini deficit state.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.810
So it goes up and then it
doesn't go back down to baseline,

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:02.670
it goes below baseline tonic levels.

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:04.470
And that's craving, right?

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:09.470
So that anticipation is
immediately followed by

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.180
wanting the drug.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.900
And it's that dopamine deficit state

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.810
that drives the motivation
to go and get the drug.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:17.890
So many people talk about dopamine

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.610
as not really about pleasure,

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.460
but about wanting and about motivation.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.460
And so it is that deficit state

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.207
that then drives the locomotion to get it.

01:04:27.207 --> 01:04:29.200
- And earlier your description of dopamine

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.853
being involved in the desire for more,

01:04:30.853 --> 01:04:33.570
giving the sense of
reward, but also movement.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.770
- Right.
- I have to assume

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.195
that those things are braided together

01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:37.430
- Yes, yes.
- in our nervous system,

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:41.050
for the specific intention of
when you feel something good,

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:42.350
then you feel the pain.

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.183
- Yes.
- But maybe

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:44.016
you don't notice it.

01:04:44.016 --> 01:04:44.849
And then the next thing you know,

01:04:44.849 --> 01:04:46.073
you're pursuing more of the thing that-

01:04:46.073 --> 01:04:48.350
- And I love the way you use
the word braided together,

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.183
that's beautiful.

01:04:49.183 --> 01:04:50.530
And let me also just say,

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:52.900
something that I find also fascinating

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.660
in my work with patients,
and I see this all the time.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.940
There are people for whom
bad life experiences, loss,

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.580
you know, in any form, stress,
in many different forms,

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.380
that's a trigger, but
there are absolutely people

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.970
for whom the trigger is things going well.

01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:12.380
And the things going well can be like

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.610
the reward of the things going well,

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.740
but very often what it
is is the removal of

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.640
the hypervigilant state

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.430
that's required to keep
their use in check.

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:24.650
So it's the sense of I want
to celebrate, you know,

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.860
or I want to, this reward happened,

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.480
I want to put more reward on there.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.250
And it's really really fascinating

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.060
because when people
come to that realization

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.430
about themselves, that
they're most vulnerable

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:41.860
when things are going well,
that's really a valuable insight

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.890
because then they can
put some things in place

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.200
or barriers in place
or go to more meetings

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.170
or whatever it is that they do, you know,

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:50.350
to protect themselves.

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:53.910
- Along those lines, I have
a friend 40 years sober,

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:57.080
was a severe drug and alcohol
addict from a very young age.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.080
Really impressive person,

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.240
does a lot of important
work in the kind of

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.600
at-risk youth community out in Hawaii.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.060
And he said something to me, he said,

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:09.340
as former addicts often do,
they've got these great sayings.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.250
But I think it fits very well
with what you're describing.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:14.380
He said, you know, no
matter how far you drive,

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.640
you're always the same
distance from the ditch.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.460
And I said well that's kind
of depressing, and he said no,

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.477
that's actually what gives me peace.

01:06:22.477 --> 01:06:23.310
- Yeah.

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:24.500
- Because what would happen is

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.697
for so many years of
relapsing and relapsing,

01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:32.697
recovering and relapsing, he
felt like it was hopeless.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:36.080
And then somehow conceptualizing that

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.870
the vigilance can never go away,

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.730
instead of making him feel burdened,

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:43.040
- Yeah.
- it made him feel relieved.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.120
So I often think about
that statement, you know,

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.330
no matter how far you drive,

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:48.880
you're always the same
distance from the ditch,

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.020
because in my mind I
conceptualize that as gosh,

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.800
that's a tough way to drive down the road.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.310
But actually, on a road where
you know where the ditch is

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.280
and where you know where
the lanes lines are,

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.000
it's actually a pretty nice drive.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.610
It's when you don't know
where the shoulder is,

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:04.250
that you constantly have
to be looking around.

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:07.678
So there's this, we're
speaking now in analogies

01:07:07.678 --> 01:07:11.450
and imagery and science.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:14.320
But I, one of the things
I find so incredible

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.340
about this community of 12-step,

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.024
and there are a variety of them,

01:07:19.024 --> 01:07:22.513
are the communities that
they create for themselves,

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.260
and some of these sayings,
which I do believe link back

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.333
to really core biological mechanisms.

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:30.370
- Yes, yes.

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:32.480
- I do want to ask
about those communities.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.870
I have a question which might
be a little bit controversial.

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:37.703
- Great!

01:07:37.703 --> 01:07:41.620
- Which is, is it possible that people

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.240
who were addicted to drugs
or alcohol or gambling,

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.040
or some other behavior,

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.210
get addicted to the addiction community?

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:53.480
Because one thing that I
think I observe over and over

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.550
is that there's some circuit
in the brain of human beings

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:58.820
that has to tell you about

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:01.643
the dream they had the night
before, for whatever reason.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.150
There's another circuit that
leads people to wake you up,

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.470
if they themselves can't sleep.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:08.930
I don't know what circuit it is.

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.360
I'm being facetious here.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.100
But there does seem to also be a circuit

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:17.480
in the brain of addicts
to discuss and want to

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:21.710
kind of talk about their recovery a lot.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.930
And I mention this not to poke at them,

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.320
but rather the opposite,

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.300
because I think that one
thing that is challenging,

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.160
at least for me, and having
friends that have a propensity

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.120
for drug or alcohol
addiction, not all of them,

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.520
but certainly some of them,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.530
is when they're talking
about their recovery,

01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:40.800
I feel like it's all they talk about.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.647
This meeting, that meeting, that meeting.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.060
So what I'm really asking here is that,

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:51.563
can we become addicted to sobriety?

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
- Right.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.300
So this is a great
question and it links into

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.490
some of the other things
we've been talking about,

01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:01.660
having to do with where do
we settle out, you know?

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.570
What is the way to live
between pleasure and pain?

01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:06.630
And I implied earlier that

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:08.660
ultimately we want a resilient balance

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.240
that's sensitive to pleasure and pain,

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.300
but that can easily restore
homeostasis after we indulge,

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.283
even when we indulge greatly.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.920
But the truth of the matter is that

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.830
people with severe addiction,

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:25.240
I believe temperamentally
want those extremes,

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.530
and they're wired for
that kind of intensity

01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:31.410
that is more than just
these slight adjustments

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:32.530
around the fulcrum, right?

01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:35.120
It's like they want the
big highs and the big lows.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.560
- They'll say great meeting.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.393
- Yeah, right, right.
- They're like

01:09:37.393 --> 01:09:38.226
that was such an amazing meeting.

01:09:38.226 --> 01:09:40.274
Or they find a group,
- Right, yeah.

01:09:40.274 --> 01:09:41.130
- They find a group in a location.

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:42.460
- Yeah.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.700
- This is almost an inside
joke in those communities.

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:45.840
Again, I'm not reporting,

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.440
I'm not talking about a friend in quotes,

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.759
this isn't me reporting.

01:09:48.759 --> 01:09:51.883
They'll talk about how
attractive people are

01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:54.740
at a given meeting, or
how bonded they feel

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.910
to people at a given meeting.
- Right, right.

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:57.990
- That the meetings themselves

01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:59.410
- Right.
- become their own form

01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:00.243
of dopamine hit.

01:10:00.243 --> 01:10:01.520
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.760
- And again, I'm not
being disparaging, I just,

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.880
I want to understand this.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.610
- Right, so yes, so a lot of
times patients will say to me,

01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:10.290
oh, you know, I don't want to go to AA.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:11.240
It's a cult.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.830
And my response to that is

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:18.600
because it's a cult is
exactly why it works, okay.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.600
Because yes, it is much better
for you to be addicted to AA

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.840
and to recovery,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.450
than almost any other
addiction I could think of.

01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:31.670
And we know from Rob Malenka's
work, who's here at Stanford,

01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:33.980
that oxytocin, you know,

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.340
is the hormone that's
involved in human pair bonding

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.950
and relationships and love.

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:42.580
And it directly links to dopamine neurons

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.030
and causes the release of dopamine.

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.700
So yes, when we connect with other humans,

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.490
especially in a kind of
transcendent spiritual way,

01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:51.050
that's a huge dopamine hit.

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:54.160
And it does replace the dopamine
that people get from drugs.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.420
And for people who have
this addiction temperament,

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.810
they need it on a more intense level.

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:05.180
They're not going to be
generally satisfied with kind of,

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.750
you know, a sort of
acquaintanceship, right?

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.940
They want that intensity of
the intimacy that you get

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.490
with people when you're
cathartically exposing, you know,

01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:16.600
warts and all.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.210
So yes, people can get
addicted to recovery,

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:20.760
and good for them.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.450
Go for it, you know.

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:24.150
And of course this can be disruptive

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.160
for friendships and relationships,

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.620
where the one person is not in recovery.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:29.857
Like you're going to so many meetings,

01:11:29.857 --> 01:11:32.000
you're always talking about
recovery, but you know what,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.550
much better than them
being intoxicated, right?

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:37.040
I mean, so although you
may tire of your friends

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.030
talking about their meetings all the time,

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:41.040
I'm sure you would
rather have them do that

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.480
than, you know, be in their addictions.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.320
- Absolutely.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.160
And this is now the second
time you've done this

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.430
through this discussion,
but now I have empathy

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:50.210
because the way you describe

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:51.954
their enthusiasm about meetings,

01:11:51.954 --> 01:11:53.590
- Yes.
- is probably the way

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:55.100
that people feel about me

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.765
and work.
- Yes, right.

01:11:56.765 --> 01:11:57.930
- In neuroscience.
- Yes.

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:00.930
- I mean, I've been getting
up in front of the class

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:02.390
since I was eight years old

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.190
and talking about things
I read over the weekend.

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.880
Now I just happen to have
this thing called a podcast.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.713
- Right.

01:12:07.713 --> 01:12:08.546
- I've been doing it since I was a little.

01:12:08.546 --> 01:12:11.110
And it annoys a lot of people, right.

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.750
I've learned to suppress it a little bit.

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:16.570
Some people like it, but
I'm poking fun at myself

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:20.140
just to say that I now can understand

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.420
that the way I feel
about the reports about

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.243
yet another amazing meeting or,

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.590
or for there's a different form of this.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.610
But there's some people for which

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.840
they just love intense experiences.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.430
- Yes.
- They're always like

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:35.200
trying to pull me off to Bali

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.330
because they're talking
about how sensual it is

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:39.240
all the time, I'm sure Bali's wonderful.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.210
But there's this kind of ratcheting up,

01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:43.030
it's like seeking Burning Man

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.930
all year long.
- Right.

01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:44.920
- I've never been to Burning Man,

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.470
no desire to go to Burning Man.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.390
But inside of academia

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:54.360
I mean if I were to just
turn the mirror at myself,

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.710
inside of academia, or
here in Silicon Valley,

01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.934
work, and the
- Right.

01:12:59.934 --> 01:13:01.700
- pursuit of more success,

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.540
even if money is kind
of divorced from that,

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.830
sometimes it is sometimes it isn't.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:07.340
Academic work is, you know,

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.660
for sake of pursuit of knowledge.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.060
It sounds to me like the same mechanism.

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:16.300
In fact, it feels to me very
much like the same mechanism.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.270
- So Andrew, here's what I love about you.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.140
First of all, you're willing
to bring your own flaws

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.051
and foibles to this conversation.

01:13:23.051 --> 01:13:24.260
- Well they're everywhere.

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.780
- Well, you know what, it's wonderful.

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.330
And then you're really open and curious

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:31.260
and wanting to understand,

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.610
'cause I can't tell you
how many people I have met

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:37.130
who really see addiction
as some kind of otherness.

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.870
But the truth is we're
all wired for addiction.

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.240
And if you're not addicted yet it's just,

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.440
it's right around the corner.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.540
Do you know what I mean?

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.820
Especially with the incredible
panoply of new drugs

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.820
and behaviors that are out there.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.240
So I love that you're
willing to take a moment

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.090
and really try to understand
this, because it is,

01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:00.040
we can all relate, and
you're relating it to your,

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.810
essentially your work
addiction is right and apt.

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.480
You just happen to be
addicted to something

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.970
that is really socially rewarded.

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:10.090
You know, you figured
that out at an early age.

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:12.900
Oh, when I do X, Y and
Z, all these people go

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.043
look at that smart kid, or
whatever it is, you know.

01:14:15.043 --> 01:14:16.910
- Well for me, it made me feel safe.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:17.743
- Okay.

01:14:17.743 --> 01:14:18.580
- I felt like.

01:14:20.716 --> 01:14:22.554
Yeah, I just felt like this,

01:14:22.554 --> 01:14:24.650
and I pause there 'cause
it's like, it's like peace.

01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:27.610
I'm like ah, I can relax for a moment.

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:29.240
- When you're talking about neuroscience?

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.591
- Or just when I feel like
I'm on the right path.

01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:34.240
- Yeah, okay.
- And I'm onto something.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.140
Or if I see something
that I'm excited about,

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:36.973
- Right.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:40.940
- I'm like, I feel filled
with, it must be dopamine.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.773
- Yes.
- I feel

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:42.680
flooded with pleasure,

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.328
literally from head to toe.
- Right, yeah.

01:14:45.328 --> 01:14:46.373
- And then my next thought is more.

01:14:46.373 --> 01:14:47.880
[laughing]

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.694
- So true, you're a true addict.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:51.527
- Okay, thank you.
- You are.

01:14:51.527 --> 01:14:52.360
You are.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.390
But you just got really,
- I think thank you.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:56.713
- you really got lucky with the fact that

01:14:56.713 --> 01:15:01.713
what you're drawn to is
adaptive, essentially, you know.

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:04.550
And then your challenge
is going to be that

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:06.380
your life doesn't get too out of balance

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:09.280
in the sense that you're 24/7 working,

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.180
you don't stop and do some
other things or think of-

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.170
- And my life, admittedly,
is somewhat asymmetric.

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:17.110
I mean it has other
components of physical health,

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:19.463
et cetera, but it is somewhat asymmetric.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:21.730
Which is why I got a dog.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:24.470
Although I talk about
him an awful lot, so.

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:27.210
- But the dog is good because
that draws you out of yourself

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:28.740
and a little bit away from the work.

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.870
But again, you know, I
think the key here is

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:32.000
for people who feel like they don't,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.190
they've never experienced addiction

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:34.550
or they don't know anybody with addiction,

01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:36.010
or if they do, they don't get it,

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:38.200
just think of that one thing

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.140
that is the most important
thing in your life that you do,

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.750
that gives you pleasure
and meaning and purpose.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:46.110
And then imagine if you couldn't do it.

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:47.960
- Oh yeah, let's not talk about that.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.340
- [Anna] Right.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.040
- Well I appreciate the feedback

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.100
and you can send me a bill at the end.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.320
What is the most ridiculous
sounding addiction

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.090
that you've ever witnessed,

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:07.383
that was actually a real
addiction, along these lines.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.940
Because I think we all know
the standard heroin, pill.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.950
You've been very, I should mention,

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:16.690
because it's important,
your previous book,

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.910
and we will provide a
link to that as well,

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.620
focused on the opioid crisis

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:24.010
and what we thought was medication.

01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:26.770
It turned out to be just
as bad, if not worse,

01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:29.420
than a lot of so-called street drugs.

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.030
So we understand those,
you know, gambling,

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:33.380
sex addiction, porn addiction.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.550
Now video games.

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:36.680
We'll talk about social media
a little bit more in depth.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.110
But what's the most like, wow,

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:42.963
I didn't realize people
could get addicted to that?

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.460
- Water.

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.030
- Really?

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.863
- Really.

01:16:47.863 --> 01:16:50.850
So I had a very lovely patient who was,

01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:52.980
had a severe alcohol addiction,

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:56.364
and she got into recovery
from her alcohol addiction

01:16:56.364 --> 01:16:57.700
for many years.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.970
But she kind of had a
sort of a polydipsia,

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:04.460
or an urge to be drinking something a lot.

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:08.650
And so she drank a lot of
water and slowly, over time,

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.910
she realized that if
she drank enough water,

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:13.720
she could become
hyponatremic and delirious

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.350
and be out of herself.

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:16.452
- You can die from it, right?

01:17:16.452 --> 01:17:17.285
- Right, which is,

01:17:17.285 --> 01:17:19.400
she just wanted to be out of her own head.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.850
And so she would
periodically intentionally

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:26.820
overdose on water, in order, you know, to,

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.460
I know, it was so sad, so sad.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.940
- What happened to her?

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.349
- She eventually took her own life.

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:34.260
- Wow.
- Yeah, it was really.

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.560
- That's rough.
- She was a lovely woman.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.610
She was so bright.

01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:40.020
She had so many interests and passions,

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.690
and of course it was very sad
when, you know, when she died.

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:48.760
But that was a wow to me, it was like wow,

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.170
if you have this disease of addiction,

01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:53.070
you can even get addicted to water.

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.903
- Wow.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:57.650
And I think it just underscores
the generalizability

01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:58.580
of the circuits.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:17:59.413
- Right.

01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:01.550
- There isn't a brain circuit
for addiction to water

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:02.510
that she happened to have.

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:05.560
There's a brain circuit for
pleasure and pain and addiction,

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.330
and water plugged into

01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:09.360
that circuit.
- Right, right.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.193
- Wow.

01:18:10.193 --> 01:18:11.283
That's intense.

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:14.650
In your book, "Dopamine Nation",

01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:19.460
you also describe some
amazing paths to recovery.

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:24.360
People that, you know,
from reading it I would,

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.770
I won't say which ones and who

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.150
'cause there are some great
surprises in the book too,

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:32.460
both tragic and triumphant, as they say.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.540
You've often described your
patients as your heroes.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.640
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tell us

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.230
a little bit more about that.

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:41.460
- You know, when you
think about how hard it is

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.260
to give up a drug or a behavior
that you're addicted to,

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:47.920
how much courage that takes
and fortitude and discipline,

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.680
and stick to it-ness,

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.560
these people are really amazing people.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.937
I mean that's, I don't
know that I could do it,

01:18:55.937 --> 01:18:57.743
what they do, you know.

01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.220
And like, you know, we
talked a little bit about

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.890
just the constant
ever-present urge to use,

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:09.240
even after sustained periods
of abstinence for some people.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.800
That's really really hard.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.980
And of course then you double down

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.450
on the shame that they
feel, because of that urge,

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:18.690
even when their lives are so much better.

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:22.300
I mean these people are
really, really remarkable.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.940
And you take their
remarkable accomplishment

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.880
and then you imagine the
world that we live in now,

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.660
where we are constantly
invited and tempted

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.430
and really bombarded with opportunities

01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:35.520
to become addicted-

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.120
- It's like feeling an itch everywhere.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.089
- Oh yeah, I mean you can't escape it.

01:19:39.089 --> 01:19:40.040
You know, you cannot escape it.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.623
That you'll get an email in your inbox

01:19:42.623 --> 01:19:43.680
inviting you to do X, Y, or Z.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.300
And if you're addicted
to that thing, you know,

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.620
you try to like delete all
your apps and not go here.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.480
All of a sudden your work inbox, you know,

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.820
you're getting those images, let's say.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.140
Really, really, really hard.

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.480
And yet these people find a way to do it.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.120
I think it's absolutely amazing.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.140
And they're really wise people.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.130
They have so much wisdom to offer.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.240
They've taught me a lot.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.380
You know, as I talk about in my book

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:05.520
I have my own addictions,

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.555
and I really just like took
a page right out of their,

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:09.388
I was okay, what do I do now?

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.230
All right, what did this
patient do, what did that,

01:20:11.230 --> 01:20:13.040
okay, I'm going to try that.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.670
- It is an amazing community

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:15.710
- Yeah.
- of people,

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.900
they are very sage.

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.500
I wanted to just touch on
something that you mentioned,

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.990
which is the shame.

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:24.030
- Yeah.

01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:27.870
- You know you can't go to a
meeting, or talk to addicts,

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:31.750
without detecting or hearing about

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:34.530
like lies, shame, et cetera.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:38.380
I heard you say in an interview
with somebody else recently

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:42.510
that truth-telling and secrets

01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.430
are sort of at the core of recovery.

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:48.770
And yeah, tell us more about that.

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:49.812
- Yeah.

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:53.050
So one of the things that I
found really fascinating about

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:56.700
working with people in recovery,
was how telling the truth,

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.640
even about the merest
detail of their lives,

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.550
was central to their recovery.

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:03.480
And I became really curious about that.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.130
Like why would truth-telling
be so important?

01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:07.870
And of course there is
the obvious thing that

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:09.080
when people are in their addiction,

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.010
they're lying about using, you know.

01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:13.810
So part of getting into recovery

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:16.240
is to stop lying to the
people they care about,

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.400
about their use.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.770
But it's really more than that because

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.305
what people in recovery
have taught me is that

01:21:22.305 --> 01:21:25.610
it's not even just not
lying about using drugs.

01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:28.120
I have to not lie about anything.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.690
I can't lie about why I was
late to work this morning,

01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:31.580
which we all do all.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.390
Oh I hit traffic, no I didn't hit traffic,

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:35.590
I wanted to spend two more
minutes reading the paper

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.700
and drinking my coffee, right.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.920
Or just lying about, you know,

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.800
I don't know where I had dinner.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.450
Like, so people with addiction
will get into, you know,

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:46.760
the lying habit where they're
lying about random stuff,

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.290
'cause they're sort of
in the habit of lying.

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:53.540
And how recovery is really
about telling the truth,

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:54.940
you know, in all ways.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.030
And so one of the things that I,

01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:58.960
I had a lot of fun with
in writing the book,

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.890
is sort of exploring
the neuroscience around

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:06.470
why truth-telling is important
to leading a balanced life.

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:08.310
And we know like every religion,

01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:10.300
since the beginning of time,
is all about telling the truth.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.370
Well why, right?

01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:14.500
And there's really interesting
neuroscience behind it

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.680
that suggests that when we tell the truth,

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.900
we actually potentially strengthen

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.580
our prefrontal cortical circuits,

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.800
and their connections to our limbic brain

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.090
and our reward brain.

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:28.410
And of course, these are the
circuits that get disconnected

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:29.940
when we're in our addiction, right?

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.580
Our balance, in our reward
pathway, our limbic brain,

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.270
our emotion brain, is doing one thing,

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.820
and our cortical circuits

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.430
are completely disengaged from that,

01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:38.450
ignoring what's happening,

01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:40.440
which is easy to do
because it's reflexive.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.740
We don't need to think about that balance

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.490
for the balance to be happening.

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:47.120
But we have to re-engage those circuits,

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.370
anticipate future consequences,

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:51.340
think through the drink, you know,

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:54.050
not just how am I going
to feel now if I use,

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:56.780
but how am I going to feel
tomorrow or six months from now?

01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:00.470
And that telling the truth
is in fact a way to do that,

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:02.390
to make these connections stronger.

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:04.700
And there I talk about
some studies in my book

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.780
that kind of indirectly show that.

01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:08.120
So I find that really fascinating,

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.310
plus just that like being
open and honest with people

01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:16.610
really does create very
intimate connections,

01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:20.450
and those intimate
connections create dopamine.

01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:21.870
So we were talking a little bit about

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:23.710
how you know a bunch of people

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:26.170
who need like intensity in their lives.

01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:31.110
For me, I need a lot of intensity
in my human connections.

01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:33.130
Like I'm really not interested in,

01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:38.130
and bored by and made anxious
by, casual interactions.

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:41.970
But you know, like having this
kind of discussion with you,

01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:46.360
that's very intense and also
intimate and self-disclosing,

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.870
is very rewarding for me.

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:49.520
So that's an important source of dopamine.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.079
Thank God I became a psychiatrist.

01:23:51.079 --> 01:23:52.310
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:53.860
- Like I can't disclose all my stuff,

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.900
but I am quite transparent
with my patients,

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.723
which is a slightly unorthodox.

01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:00.110
But, you know, when I think it's right,

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:01.550
I'm also transparent with them.

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:04.010
So that's, you know, that's
a source of dopamine too,

01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:06.690
when we're honest and we disclose.

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:08.400
You think people are going
to run away from you,

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.520
if you tell them about all
like your weird neuroses,

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.880
but really they don't.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.200
What they're like is oh thank God,

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.270
I'm not the only one, right.

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:17.790
- What I love about, I love
many things about your book.

01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:19.330
I read it in one sweep.

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:20.163
- Oh thank you.

01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:21.333
- And I was like wow.

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:27.430
I was pleasantly surprised,
but I was like wow,

01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:29.530
she's really opening up in this book,

01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:30.743
from the very beginning.

01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:34.810
And I don't want to give
it away, but it's yeah,

01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:38.670
you're very open where it's appropriate.

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:43.670
And also I think that this
question about truth-telling,

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:47.690
I always think about like tell the truth,

01:24:47.690 --> 01:24:50.290
be a hundred percent about the truth,

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:52.870
but there's also this element about

01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:57.530
do you report previous lies, right?

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:59.820
What about prior behavior?

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.490
And I'm fascinated by this
'cause to me telling the truth

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:07.140
has many facets, but the
three sides of this thing

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.860
in my mind, are one is
reporting everything accurately.

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.590
The other is what do you withhold,

01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:14.360
what do you not withhold, right?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.560
Because some people say tell the truth,

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.800
or at least don't lie.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.250
That's sort of a-

01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:20.083
- Lies of omission, right.

01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:21.313
- Yeah, so lies of omission.

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.570
Lies of omission.

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:28.070
And then there's the, what I
have to assume for most people,

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:31.490
is a small to enormous batch of things

01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:33.680
that they lied about in the past,

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.781
that still thread into the future.

01:25:35.781 --> 01:25:36.614
- Right.

01:25:36.614 --> 01:25:38.680
- So how important is it for the addict,

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.510
or every person really, to,

01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:43.300
'cause it sounds like
cultivating the circuitry

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.380
between prefrontal cortex
and the dopamine system

01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:47.010
would be great for anybody.

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:48.120
Since we're all addicts,

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.180
- Right.
- everyone should do it.

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:50.720
But in all seriousness,

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.360
it sounds like a good
thing for everybody to do.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.360
How much work needs to be
done on all the priors,

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.643
all the stuff we've hidden?

01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:03.900
I mean not me, but all the stuff

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.570
that everybody else has hidden.

01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:10.180
- Yeah, so the, you know,

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:14.160
the steps of the 12-steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous,

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.660
a good number of those steps
are about that very thing.

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.920
The past, the ways that we've
harmed people in the past.

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.293
And the fourth step is
about making amends,

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.140
you know, by admitting the ways in which

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:33.640
that we've contributed to harming others.

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.570
And it is a really big piece of recovery.

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:39.920
So, you know, how important,
so for people with addiction,

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.160
it's really, really important
to go back and make amends.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.960
And, you know, the key idea there is

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.260
you just go back and
you apologize, you know,

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:53.910
and you don't have to get any
particular kind of response,

01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:55.490
or you don't need to be forgiven.

01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:59.200
It's the act itself of apologizing

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.650
about the ways in which we've harmed

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:04.730
or lied to people in the past,

01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:07.640
that is cathartic and renewing,

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.910
and allows us to kind of shed this skin

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:12.590
and be new in our lives and begin again.

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:16.593
Sort of absolved, you know,
of past sins, so to speak.

01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.113
So it is really important.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.510
You know, are there situations

01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:23.140
when it's maybe not a good idea,

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.260
because of that person or the nature?

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.720
Sure, you know, there
are always going to be,

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.130
it doesn't have to be like, it's not,

01:27:30.130 --> 01:27:32.420
we're talking about not
like Kant's idea about

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.210
I'd never lie, robbers in your house.

01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:36.220
You're a stowaway.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.053
You can't lie even about that.

01:27:37.053 --> 01:27:39.906
It's like no, there are
probably situations where,

01:27:39.906 --> 01:27:41.220
- Absolutely.
- you know.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.650
- For sake of other people's safety,

01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:43.650
- Right, and-
- children's safety, sure.

01:27:43.650 --> 01:27:45.130
- Right, I mean there are,

01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:47.279
you can think of a million scenarios.

01:27:47.279 --> 01:27:51.540
But in general, you know,
when we're taking stock,

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:52.610
because I don't know about you,

01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:55.090
but I have a lot of regrets and guilt

01:27:55.090 --> 01:27:57.350
about a lot of things in my life.

01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:02.350
And they kind of haunt me, you know.

01:28:02.873 --> 01:28:05.090
It means I'll have nightmares, right.

01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:06.607
And I think that's true for most people.

01:28:06.607 --> 01:28:08.753
I mean I occasionally will
meet somebody who's like

01:28:08.753 --> 01:28:11.310
I don't have any regrets
in my life, I'm like wow.

01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:14.533
Like I cannot relate to that at all.

01:28:15.768 --> 01:28:20.210
So, you know, this idea of
like catharsis and, well,

01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:22.610
I mean, in the 12-steps it's telling God,

01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:25.300
or your higher power,
telling another human being,

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.940
the ways in which you've wronged others.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.870
Considering your own character defects

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.950
and how those have contributed.

01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:31.580
To me, that's a really important piece

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.590
and something that we don't do enough

01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.070
in our current culture.

01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:36.560
Especially in psychiatry, frankly,

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.570
where there's like a lot of

01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:40.350
eternally empathizing with patients,

01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:42.500
but not a whole lot of
likes going well, you know,

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.320
actually you kind of messed that up.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.146
Or like that was really
bad on you, you know.

01:28:48.146 --> 01:28:50.580
And in my work, I don't
necessarily use that language,

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.910
but, you know, patients might say like

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:55.390
I really feel badly about,
you know, this thing.

01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:57.380
I'll be like yeah, I get it.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.140
I understand that you feel.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.248
- Well guilt is a-

01:29:00.248 --> 01:29:01.081
- [Anna] Right.

01:29:01.081 --> 01:29:01.980
- There's a circuit for that too.

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.390
- Right, and it's important, right,

01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:07.550
and it's also important to recovery

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:09.013
and to not becoming addicted.

01:29:09.013 --> 01:29:12.810
Experiencing a certain
amount of appropriate shame

01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:15.620
for things that we have
done and, you know,

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.700
feeling the pain that comes with shame,

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.887
which is an incredibly
painful emotion, right.

01:29:20.887 --> 01:29:23.080
And I think that may be the
one that we all try to avoid

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.370
more than any other,

01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:28.830
is like that shame of not being
liked or not being accepted

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.029
or not being celebrated.
- Or the thing that we did

01:29:31.029 --> 01:29:32.940
is really despicable.

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.770
- Right, it's really,
yeah, like oh my God,

01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:37.370
I did that horrible thing, right, right.

01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:39.350
So, I mean, I've done horrible things

01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:43.220
that I haven't gone back and
said I did this horrible thing,

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:45.630
but I'm, maybe I've
tried to pay it forward.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:47.070
Like I've told my kids, you know,

01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:49.420
when I was younger I
did this horrible thing

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.980
and it still haunts me.

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:54.120
So if you're ever tempted to
do something like what I did,

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.010
you might think about my situation.

01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:57.820
So, you know, some kind of way.

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:00.243
But I think wrestling
with that is important.

01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:03.190
- I think it's a really
important element to all this,

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:07.080
and there's not, I love that
there's neuroscience being done

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:07.913
on truth-telling,

01:30:07.913 --> 01:30:08.810
- Yeah.
- and the value

01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:09.643
of truth-telling.

01:30:09.643 --> 01:30:10.476
- Yeah.
- I think,

01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:15.870
if I were to predict a new
and truly exciting area

01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:17.808
that people are going to
be really curious about,

01:30:17.808 --> 01:30:20.900
in this huge sphere we call neuroscience,

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.870
I hope they'll continue to do more work.

01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:26.380
Also, I'm so glad to hear that's
happening here at Stanford.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.040
- No that's, the literature that I look at

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.840
isn't Stanford work, but there's work.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:34.919
- Great.
- It might be people

01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:35.752
at Stanford.
- Great,

01:30:35.752 --> 01:30:37.210
regardless of where it's happening.

01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:39.683
More of that and all the rest please.

01:30:40.931 --> 01:30:45.570
I want to ask you about using
drugs to treat drug addiction.

01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:47.610
These days there's a growing interest,

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.060
or at least discussion about ibogaine.

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:52.080
People going down, going out of country,

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.210
because I think it's still
illegal here, or is illegal here,

01:30:55.210 --> 01:30:57.180
going out of country to, I dunno,

01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:01.000
either inject it or smoke
it or whatever it is.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.900
Or people going and doing
Ayahuasca journeys or MDMA,

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.520
which is still an illegal
drug in this country,

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.600
but there are clinical trials.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.780
There are people on this campus
doing experimental studies.

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:12.850
I don't know of clinical trials,

01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:16.090
but at Johns Hopkins there are
clinical trials, et cetera.

01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:19.410
So this is a vast area, right?

01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:21.150
Different chemistries for different drugs

01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:22.190
and different purposes.

01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:25.370
But the rationale, as I understand it,

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:29.373
is take people who are in
a pattern of addiction,

01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:33.660
launch them into a experience

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:35.800
that's also chemical and extreme,

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:40.800
often of the extreme serotonin
and or extreme dopamine type.

01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:41.663
So MDMA,
- Right.

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:42.540
- ecstasy for instance.

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.030
Tons of serotonin dumped,
tons of dopamine dumped.

01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:47.930
How neurotoxic, if neurotoxic,

01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:49.120
debatable, et cetera, et cetera.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.420
Not a topic for now.

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.910
But a lot.

01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:55.410
And then somehow that extreme experience

01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:59.200
wrapped inside of a
supported network in there,

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.030
whether or not there's just someone there

01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:03.020
or whether or not they're
actively working through something

01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:07.580
with the patient, is
supposed to eject the person

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:12.580
into a life where drug use
isn't as much of interest.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.970
This violates, at a purely rational level,

01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:20.100
this violates everything
we've talked about

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.870
in terms of dopamine biology.

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:25.733
It would, if this arrangement
is the way I described it,

01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:30.180
cause more addiction, is
anything but a dopamine fast,

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.653
it's a dopamine feast.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.450
So we hear about successful
transitions through this,

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:39.810
at least anecdotally, and
maybe some clinical studies.

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:41.763
What is going on?

01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:44.260
What is going on?

01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.860
It doesn't make any sense to me.

01:32:48.526 --> 01:32:49.359
Yeah.

01:32:49.359 --> 01:32:52.530
- Yeah, so I think it's
good that you're skeptical.

01:32:52.530 --> 01:32:54.790
I think we all should be skeptical.

01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:59.790
Having said that, there are
clinical studies showing,

01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:02.370
you know, and these are small studies

01:33:02.370 --> 01:33:05.870
and they're short duration,
small number of subjects,

01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:07.540
but, you know, taking people for example,

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:12.450
who are addicted to alcohol,
and then having them have this,

01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:14.050
let's say a psychedelic experience

01:33:14.050 --> 01:33:16.190
in a very controlled setting.

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:18.710
- So either, typically it's
a high dose psilocybin,

01:33:18.710 --> 01:33:21.430
or three dose, as I saw
it for the MAP study

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:23.000
of MDMA.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:23.833
- Right.
- Of ecstasy.

01:33:23.833 --> 01:33:25.727
Those are sort of the,
seem to be the kind of,

01:33:25.727 --> 01:33:27.190
- Yes, the typical, right.
- the kind of bread and butter

01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:28.550
of this kind of work.
- Right, right.

01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:31.120
But the thing to really
keep in mind is that

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.120
this is completely interwoven
with regular psychotherapy,

01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:39.369
and that these are highly
selected individuals.

01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:40.385
- In clinical trials.

01:33:40.385 --> 01:33:41.218
- Right, right.

01:33:41.218 --> 01:33:42.115
And these are clinical-
- we're referring to

01:33:42.115 --> 01:33:42.948
legal clinical trials.

01:33:42.948 --> 01:33:43.781
- Right, right.

01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:47.006
And so, you know, I think the metaphor

01:33:47.006 --> 01:33:49.290
that helps me think about this is

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.510
there are many ways to
the top of the mountain,

01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:54.200
and these are sort of
like taking the gondola

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.020
instead of walking up.

01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.180
It sort of, instead of doing like

01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.710
a year of psychoanalysis

01:33:59.710 --> 01:34:01.460
where you're sitting
on the couch every week

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.210
reflecting on your life,

01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:07.080
it's a condensed version of
psychoanalysis or psychotherapy,

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:10.990
plus, you know, MDMA, which
gets you there faster.

01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:13.590
- And creates the intimacy,
presumably, because of the-

01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:16.440
- Well I think the main thing that happens

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:21.060
when it's beneficial, is
it just allows the person

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:26.060
to get outside of their own
head and look at their lives

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:31.270
on a much broader sweep,
and to consider themselves

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:36.270
not mired in the quotidian
sort of details of their life,

01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:42.230
but rather as a human on
the large planet Earth,

01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:43.980
in the vast universe.

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.930
So I think it takes,
it's like when it works,

01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:50.290
it's a transformational experience

01:34:50.290 --> 01:34:54.840
because it gives the person another lens

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.180
through which to view their lives,

01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.040
which I think for some people
is positive and powerful,

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.490
because they can come
back from that and be like

01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:08.370
oh my gosh, I care about my family,

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:10.940
and I don't, I want X, Y, or Z for them.

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.583
And I realize that my continuing to drink

01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:15.410
is not going to, you know, achieve that.

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:20.060
So it's almost like a
spiritual or values-based.

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:23.430
So I think it can be very
powerful, but having said that,

01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:27.490
I truly am quite skeptical
because, you know,

01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:30.160
addiction is a chronic
relapsing and remitting problem.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.150
It's hard for me to imagine

01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:34.700
that there's something that
works very quickly short-term,

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:39.050
that's going to work for a disease
that's really long-lasting.

01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:41.258
- Yeah, the two addicts I know that did

01:35:41.258 --> 01:35:45.510
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
as part of this thing,

01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:46.710
both got worse.

01:35:46.710 --> 01:35:48.270
- Yeah.

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:52.650
- But the people I know who
had severe trauma who did this,

01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:55.170
who took this approach,
seem to be doing better.

01:35:55.170 --> 01:35:56.913
- Okay, interesting.
- And so I,

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.590
I think that the discussion,
as we hear it now,

01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:03.760
is just sort of psychedelics,
which is a huge category

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.180
that includes many different
drugs and compounds

01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:07.290
with different effects.

01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:11.500
And we hear about trauma and
addiction lumped together.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.920
And I think that I'm a
splitter, not a lumper,

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.223
as we say in science.

01:36:19.090 --> 01:36:22.550
And I think it's going to be
important for people to know

01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:26.890
that this is definitely
not a one-size fits all

01:36:26.890 --> 01:36:28.150
kind of thing.

01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:30.200
But it sounds like it
may have some utility

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:31.710
under certain conditions.

01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:33.347
- Yeah, I think so.

01:36:33.347 --> 01:36:35.380
I'm trying to be very open-minded

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:38.480
about its potential utility
for certain individuals.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.450
But I can tell you in my clinical work,

01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:43.990
what is a very concerning
unintended consequence

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:45.750
of this narrative,

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:48.640
is I have a lot of people who
are looking for some kind of

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:51.070
spiritual awakening who on their own,

01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:53.470
not in the context of
any kind of therapeutic,

01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:55.130
psychological work, you know,

01:36:55.130 --> 01:37:00.130
microdose or want to try
psilocybin or MDMA with a friend

01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:03.770
or wherever, so they can have
this spiritual experience

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.390
that they can figure out their lives.

01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:09.280
That's a disaster and
almost never works out well.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.240
And I've then had people who literally,

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.210
supposedly you can't get
addicted to psychedelics because,

01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:16.520
you know, something with the biochemistry

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.510
which I don't fully understand,

01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:18.940
'cause it doesn't make any sense to me.

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.410
But I have patients clinically

01:37:20.410 --> 01:37:22.800
who definitely are addicted to,

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.870
you know, MDMA, to micro-dosing.

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:28.480
So that's very concerning
to me 'cause like, you know,

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.230
Pollan's "How to Change Your Mind",

01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:35.400
I respect that work, but on
the other hand, it's penetrated

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.650
the culture-
- Michael Pollan's book.

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:37.483
- [Anna] Yeah, yeah.

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:40.952
- And I don't know him and
so I don't have a problem

01:37:40.952 --> 01:37:43.250
taking a stance.

01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:45.280
So I'll just say my stance on that is

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.230
the narrative of popular authors

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:52.190
can expand and wick out so fast,

01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:53.023
- Yes.

01:37:53.023 --> 01:37:54.410
- that pretty soon people are essentially

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.840
taking their mental health
into their own hands.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.970
And I actually, I have great
optimism for this business

01:38:00.970 --> 01:38:05.970
of clinical use of
psychedelics, including MDMA.

01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:08.750
Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:10.683
is doing fabulous work on this.

01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:13.830
And there are others too, of course.

01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:15.878
But those are controlled settings.

01:38:15.878 --> 01:38:16.711
- Right.

01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:18.040
- And the pharmacology is being tuned up.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.540
And one thing that I think is coming.

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.660
There are several papers
published recently

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:25.483
in great journals like nature
and science, et cetera,

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:30.150
where there are scientists
who are removing

01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:33.310
the hallucinogenic
components of these drugs

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.893
and finding that they still
have the antidepressant effects.

01:38:38.893 --> 01:38:40.680
- Interesting.
- And so the experience

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.570
of a psychedelic,

01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:45.040
and the long-term effects
of the psychedelic,

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.510
might actually be dissociable.

01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:50.520
And so, again I, and I'm
always careful to say

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.340
I'm neither for something or against it.

01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:58.340
I just think that treading
carefully is what's important.

01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:01.440
- I agree with you, and
I can just tell you that

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.183
the downstream effect
for the average person,

01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:09.490
many of whom present in our clinic,

01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:12.730
is that they've misconstrued the data

01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:16.503
on the use of psychedelics
for mental health conditions,

01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:19.460
to this idea that they're safe,

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.590
or that anybody can take
them in any circumstance

01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:23.470
and have this kind of awakening.

01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:26.540
And that's not what the data show, right?

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:30.451
The data are these highly
controlled settings, you know,

01:39:30.451 --> 01:39:32.470
carefully selected patients.

01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:34.700
So that's my worry, you know.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:35.533
- Sure.

01:39:35.533 --> 01:39:38.020
And I'm going to be sitting
down with Matthew Johnson

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.070
at some point, and we'll discuss this.

01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:45.070
And I think that, ah,
that care and that cocoon

01:39:45.088 --> 01:39:47.660
of real clinical care, does seem to be

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:49.720
an important component.
- Yes.

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.610
- Well I'm glad we could
touch on it and, you know,

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:53.860
I'm sure I'll get a bunch of comments

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.583
telling me that, you know.

01:39:57.130 --> 01:39:59.140
But I think it is
important to explore things

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:01.400
from all sides, and that's what we do,

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.250
as scientists.
- Yes.

01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:05.630
- And if Michael Pollan wants
to chat, we can do that too.

01:40:05.630 --> 01:40:07.089
That's fine.

01:40:07.089 --> 01:40:07.922
I very much enjoyed the book

01:40:07.922 --> 01:40:08.890
actually.
- Yes, yes.

01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:12.430
- But I think that people run with ideas.

01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:13.263
- That's right.

01:40:13.263 --> 01:40:14.096
- They don't walk with them,

01:40:14.096 --> 01:40:15.523
they sprint.
- That's right, right.

01:40:15.523 --> 01:40:16.625
Yeah.

01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:19.890
- There are a couple other
things I just want to touch on,

01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:22.010
but they all relate to social media.

01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.843
- [Anna] Okay.

01:40:22.843 --> 01:40:25.230
- You were featured in
"The Social Dilemma".

01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:26.310
It was a powerful movie.

01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:28.310
I think many people
avoided seeing that movie

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:32.160
because it reflects back on us
just how addicted we all are

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.138
and how manipulated we all are.

01:40:34.138 --> 01:40:34.971
- [Anna] Yes.

01:40:34.971 --> 01:40:38.100
- But it doesn't seem to
have changed behavior much.

01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:40.010
I have to say that the movie

01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:42.540
changed my understanding
and my perception,

01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.553
but not my behavior too much.

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.680
If we look at addiction
as a maladaptive thing,

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.690
something that's making our lives worse

01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:54.900
or us less functional at
work and in relationships,

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:57.160
I could imagine a version of social media

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.810
where it's making me more connected.

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:00.817
I mean this is a podcast after all.

01:41:00.817 --> 01:41:02.820
- Yes, yes.
- I post videos.

01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.100
This will show up on YouTube

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:08.050
and elements of it on Instagram as well.

01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:12.420
So much like sugar or other things,

01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:15.260
I have to imagine that
we need to regulate,

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.400
not necessarily eliminate, this behavior.

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.750
So I want to talk about
what that looks like.

01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:23.750
And I want to talk about
what you've referred to

01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.940
as this narcissistic preoccupation

01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.800
that social media is creating.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.570
That we are all far more
keenly aware of how we look

01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:36.910
and how we sound and how
we are being perceived,

01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:39.912
than we were 10 years ago.

01:41:39.912 --> 01:41:40.745
- [Anna] Right.

01:41:40.745 --> 01:41:45.745
- So first of all, social media,
how addicting is it really?

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.343
And what is healthy social media behavior?

01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:56.270
- So the first message I
would want to get across

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:59.660
about social media, is
that it really is a drug

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:02.023
and it's engineered to be a drug.

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:07.950
And it's based on, you know,
potency, quantity, variety,

01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:10.210
the bottomless polls, the likes,

01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:12.800
the way that it's enumerated, all of that.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:16.220
Which doesn't mean that we can't use it,

01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:19.500
but we need to be very thoughtful
about the way we use it,

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.210
just like we need to be thoughtful about

01:42:21.210 --> 01:42:23.033
the way we use any drug.

01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:28.600
And so that means with
intention and in advance,

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.770
planning our use, right.

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:35.650
And trying to use it as
a really awesome tool

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.270
to potentially connect with other people,

01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:43.160
and not to be used by
it or get lost in it.

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.420
And of course, you know,

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:47.540
people are going to come
with different propensities

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:49.560
for addiction to any drug,

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.090
and that's true for social media too.

01:42:51.090 --> 01:42:54.750
Some people will have no
problem using it in moderation

01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:56.440
or using it in a way that's adaptive.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.340
And other people will
immediately get sucked in.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.360
And the key thing about
getting addicted is

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:05.330
when it's happening, nobody
who's getting addicted

01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:06.550
thinks they're getting addicted, right.

01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:10.000
Let's face it, it's only after
the fact that we go woops,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.180
you know, what was that about?

01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.670
- Remember texting and driving,

01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:14.460
there are all these books
about texting and driving,

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.670
how terrible it was.

01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:16.503
- Yeah.

01:43:16.503 --> 01:43:18.560
- Even the governments
have largely given up.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.200
You see these billboards

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.650
- Terrifying.
- like don't text and drive,

01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:23.090
or any text can wait, or whatever.

01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:24.966
Not worth dying for.

01:43:24.966 --> 01:43:25.799
- Right, right.
- But everybody's

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:26.690
texting and driving.

01:43:26.690 --> 01:43:28.180
- Right and if you look at
young people today, teenagers,

01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:30.640
I mean they're basically
cybernetically enhanced,

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.150
that the phone is there.

01:43:32.150 --> 01:43:33.830
You know, it's like they're talking to you

01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:36.360
and texting 12 friends at the same time,

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.950
and there's no stopping it.

01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:40.620
I mean the genie is out of
the bottle where, you know,

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.610
we're not going back.

01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:42.470
- [Andrew] Right.

01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:45.010
- So we do need to figure out, you know,

01:43:45.010 --> 01:43:50.010
how to make this tool
something that's, you know,

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.950
going to be good for us
and not ultimately harmful.

01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:55.220
And I don't have all the answers

01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:58.930
by any stretch of the imagination,
but I do think, you know,

01:43:58.930 --> 01:44:01.260
some of the wisdom that we have learned

01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:05.220
from using other drugs, also
applies to social media.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:07.830
Which is to say that we have to, again,

01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:10.520
put barriers in place that allow us

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:14.440
to remain in control of our
use, which means not too much,

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.760
you know, not too often, not too potent.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.900
- Do you think in, going
back to this idea of

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:23.460
the unit of the day being
a good attractable unit,

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.973
a manageable unit of time for most people,

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.780
so you're saying in advance,
so allocating two hours

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.310
in which you're going to
allow yourself to have

01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:34.427
free reign use of the phone

01:44:34.427 --> 01:44:35.970
and all its apps and all its things,

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:39.910
or even more restricted
than that, meaning okay,

01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:42.360
I'm only going to allow
myself 30 minutes a day

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.760
to post and comment, and then
that's a closeout completely.

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.210
- Yeah, so I think it's,
it depends on the person

01:44:49.210 --> 01:44:50.110
and sort of a combination.

01:44:50.110 --> 01:44:51.300
We talked earlier about, you know,

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.570
having an itch and
scratching yourself at night.

01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:55.330
We've gotten to a point with smartphones,

01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:56.930
people are pulling them out

01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:59.310
and they are utterly
unconscious of doing so,

01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:02.060
pulling them out, you know,
a couple of texts, a couple.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.002
They don't know

01:45:03.002 --> 01:45:03.835
they're doing it!
- I have a friend

01:45:03.835 --> 01:45:06.680
who works in, delivers babies,

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.530
and many pregnant mothers

01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:14.460
won't actually deliver
without their phone in hand.

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.770
And this used to be the hand

01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:17.040
that was connected to their spouse.

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.970
This may be a comment on
spouses more than on phones.

01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:25.970
But it sounds like it's a
kind of a security blanket

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:27.833
of sorts.
- Right, like a

01:45:27.833 --> 01:45:29.160
transitional object, yeah.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:33.700
- Actually that reminds me,
you've referred to the phone,

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.630
I think it's the phone,

01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:38.590
but maybe it's our online
persona or ourselves,

01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:41.923
as we've become sort of
infantile in our need for,

01:45:41.923 --> 01:45:43.699
it's like a baby and a bottle.

01:45:43.699 --> 01:45:44.532
- Right, right.

01:45:44.532 --> 01:45:46.780
- And so I do wonder if we have regressed,

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:50.220
and I do think we've
regressed a bit in terms of

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:51.900
our online behavior.

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.010
Our inability to act like.

01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:55.070
I always thought an adult

01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:56.350
was somebody that can
control their behavior.

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.340
- Yeah.
- That's the difference

01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.330
between a baby and an adult.

01:45:58.330 --> 01:45:59.950
You don't have to be a
developmental neurobiologist

01:45:59.950 --> 01:46:00.910
for very long to understand

01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:02.830
that a young organism
can't control its behavior,

01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:04.490
an older one can.

01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:08.520
So to me, a mature organism,
mature in years organism

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.730
that can't control its
behavior, is a baby.

01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:13.460
It's an immature version of itself.

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.273
And there's neuroscience
to support that statement.

01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:19.790
I look at my own behavior
with the phone sometimes

01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:23.150
and I think, I'm a grown man.

01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:25.483
Like what is the problem here, right?

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.270
You know, I don't eat baby food,

01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:31.843
but I'm acting like a baby
with the phone, all right,

01:46:31.843 --> 01:46:35.570
in the sense that I'm
reflexively picking it up,

01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:39.570
I'm not being intentioned
and deliberate with it.

01:46:39.570 --> 01:46:41.600
Do I need a full 30 days, Anna?

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.140
- So yes, so-

01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:44.811
- 30 days away from my phone?

01:46:44.811 --> 01:46:45.644
- As you know, that's my recommend,

01:46:45.644 --> 01:46:46.928
the full 30 days to reset.

01:46:46.928 --> 01:46:50.940
If you're severely addicted,
I recommend the 30 days.

01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:54.050
But if you're just a little
bit addicted, like most of us,

01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:55.320
you probably don't need 30 days.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.010
In fact, a single day, not
only would be challenging,

01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:02.250
but probably may be sufficient.

01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:05.370
- My phone is off for
substantial segments of the day.

01:47:05.370 --> 01:47:06.203
- Okay, that's great.

01:47:06.203 --> 01:47:08.010
- And it drives other people crazy.

01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:10.423
People expect me to respond.

01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:13.540
But I don't care.

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.373
- Yeah, right, right.
- I really don't.

01:47:14.373 --> 01:47:16.549
And I actually take a
little bit of pleasure

01:47:16.549 --> 01:47:18.040
in the fact that, well,

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.870
because I think the
point I'm trying to make

01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:22.090
is the right one, which is that
it's not just right for me,

01:47:22.090 --> 01:47:26.960
but like why, I don't see
a clause on text messages

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.880
or emails that say must
be responded to within

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.390
X amount of time or else, or else.

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:38.210
So I take the liberty of
replying when I'm able to.

01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:40.317
- Yeah, that's right.
- Or want to.

01:47:40.317 --> 01:47:43.300
- Right, which touches on
one of the big challenges

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.690
about social media, is
that as more and more of us

01:47:46.690 --> 01:47:49.250
are spending more and
more time on social media,

01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:53.180
we're divesting our libidinous
energies, et cetera,

01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:55.310
from real-life interactions.

01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:58.180
So that means even when we want to choose

01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:00.520
to not be online connecting,

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.930
we go outside and there's
no there there, right.

01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:04.760
There's nobody else there.

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:07.870
So I think our collective challenge,

01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:10.130
and it should be our mission,

01:48:10.130 --> 01:48:13.360
is to make sure that we are preserving

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.360
and maintaining offline ways
to connect with each other.

01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:21.600
'Cause if we don't do that then
we'll be very lonely, right,

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.960
if we were not online.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:27.970
But if you have a tribe of
folks that you can be with,

01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:30.570
none of whom are on their phones

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:32.950
while you're together for
that discreet amount of time,

01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:36.270
then it's wonderful and liberating
and nobody's distracted.

01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:38.980
And I think that's really the key.

01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.900
And I think young people are
figuring that out, you know.

01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:44.860
They're trying to create these
spaces or try to, let's say,

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:47.250
instead of doing a
dopamine fast by yourself,

01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:49.110
do it with your friends, right.

01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:51.770
Then there's the FOMO is
less, the fear of missing out

01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:54.640
because, oh you're all doing
the dopamine fast together.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.882
So these are some of the tricks
that we can come up with.

01:48:57.882 --> 01:48:58.973
- I like that.
- Yeah,

01:48:58.973 --> 01:48:59.806
okay good.
- I like that.

01:48:59.806 --> 01:49:02.220
I don't allow, I have a home
gym and I love working out.

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.550
I just enjoy it and always have.

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:08.012
And I don't allow my
phone in my gym anymore.

01:49:08.012 --> 01:49:08.845
- Right.

01:49:08.845 --> 01:49:11.180
- And I live in an area where
I don't get any reception,

01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:13.070
like two meters outside my door.

01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:14.947
So all my dog walks now are just,

01:49:14.947 --> 01:49:16.610
and they were boring as hell.

01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:17.520
- Yes.
- I also have a bulldog,

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.353
he doesn't like to walk.

01:49:18.353 --> 01:49:19.403
It's really slow.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.580
And it was so boring for a while

01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:23.850
- Yes.
- because I was so used

01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:25.040
to taking calls

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:25.914
while I walk,
- Right.

01:49:25.914 --> 01:49:28.630
- and it's super efficient when I do that.

01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:31.610
The walks now are some of
my favorite part of the day,

01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:34.110
- Yeah, right.
- because, and if the phone,

01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:35.670
if I were to get a call on one of those

01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:37.060
or they brought reception of the areas,

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:39.499
I would be very dismayed.
- Yeah, right.

01:49:39.499 --> 01:49:40.530
- So I can attest to this,

01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:42.603
and I don't think I'm a phone addict,

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.850
but I do put work into
regulating my phone behavior.

01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:48.130
- Yeah, so this is the key.

01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.250
You have to, with intention,

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:53.910
prior to being in that
situation, think of literal,

01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:55.890
physical and metacognitive barriers

01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:59.160
that you can put between
yourself and your phone,

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.910
or whatever your drug is,

01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:03.430
to create these intentional spaces

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:06.530
where you're not constantly
interrupting yourself,

01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:08.060
essentially, and distracting yourself,

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:10.620
because I really do think,
you know, I think we talked

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:14.340
just before we started with
the interview, you know,

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.860
we're losing the ability to
have a sustained thought, right?

01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.340
I mean we get so far and then,

01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:23.220
then you get to that point in the thought

01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:26.640
where it's a little bit hard
to know what's coming next.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:30.910
And it's very easy to check
your phone or check your email,

01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:34.530
or look something up on the internet.

01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:36.960
And then you never get that opportunity

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:38.630
to finish that thought,

01:50:38.630 --> 01:50:41.320
which is really the
source of creative energy

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.750
and an original thought, right.

01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:44.480
You're not just reacting to

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.648
what's coming at you.
- Right, and something

01:50:45.648 --> 01:50:46.670
that could contribute to the world.

01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:47.503
- That's right.

01:50:47.503 --> 01:50:51.560
- I'm a big believer that
you're either consuming

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.939
or you are creating.

01:50:53.939 --> 01:50:56.840
And there is, I should
mention, it's important,

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.190
I do believe in neutral time.

01:50:58.190 --> 01:50:59.370
I think sleep is great.

01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:00.740
I'm a big proponent of sleep

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.210
and I've talked a lot
about it on the podcast,

01:51:02.210 --> 01:51:04.810
I care a lot about sleep.

01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:06.070
And not just for sake of performance.

01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:07.863
I actually just really like sleep.

01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:12.640
I think that being a constant consumer

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.930
of visual information and
information of all kinds,

01:51:15.930 --> 01:51:17.193
can be a problem.

01:51:17.193 --> 01:51:19.620
But there's some really
great sources of information

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.490
on the internet.
- Yes.

01:51:20.490 --> 01:51:24.780
- And I certainly benefit
from the fact that

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.163
those channels exist.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.253
Narcissistic pre-occupation.

01:51:30.170 --> 01:51:32.140
Am I a narcissist?

01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:34.550
- You know, first of all, there's healthy-

01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:36.920
- Or is the fact that I asked,
does that take me out of,

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.590
would a narcissist
never ask that question?

01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:40.950
- Oh yes, a highly
sophisticated narcissist

01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:42.011
- Oh I see.
- would know to do that.

01:51:42.011 --> 01:51:44.820
- Well I'm not very sophisticated.

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.980
- So there's healthy narcissism,

01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:50.390
which means that we all
invest our personal energies

01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:52.290
into things that we care about.

01:51:52.290 --> 01:51:55.240
And if our competence in
that arena is threatened,

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.340
we would all experience
a narcissistic injury,

01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.403
and that's normal and healthy.

01:52:00.344 --> 01:52:04.370
But we are living in a
narcissistic culture,

01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:05.640
I mean that's not news,

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:08.870
this preoccupation with
individual achievement

01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:12.870
and individual self-worth and
individual self-confidence.

01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:17.870
And I think all of that is
just fueled by social media,

01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:19.810
where we're not just seeing ourselves,

01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:21.920
but we're seeing people's
reactions to ourselves,

01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.780
and every single, you know,
thing we say or do, you know,

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.840
we get likes and this and that.

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.160
It's really insidious and
it contributes, I think,

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:33.120
ultimately to a lot of personal shame,

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:36.780
because we're not really
meant to be individuals

01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:38.390
bouncing around in the universe.

01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:40.010
We're social animals.

01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:43.000
And we're probably generally happiest,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.720
even for natural contrarians among us,

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:48.220
when we're part of a tribe, right.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:51.330
And if we do too much to
kind of separate ourselves

01:52:51.330 --> 01:52:53.520
from that tribe,

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.430
I think that the brain's natural

01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:59.170
and instinctive corrective
mechanism against that

01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:01.450
is self-loathing and shame.

01:53:01.450 --> 01:53:03.780
So, you know, it's so ironic

01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:07.540
because the culture tells
us if we just achieve more,

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:08.820
we'll like ourselves more.

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.230
But the truth is actually the opposite.

01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:14.040
That I think when people
get these pinnacles

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.692
of personal achievement,

01:53:15.692 --> 01:53:17.740
you know, you have things
like the imposter syndrome

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:18.770
or whatever, you know.

01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:21.390
- Or you just, you know, we're at Stanford

01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:22.650
after a lot of high achievers.

01:53:22.650 --> 01:53:23.870
- Right.
- Right.

01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:26.690
Some phenomenal, amazing
people like yourself

01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:29.320
and other colleagues of mine
that just, I'm always in awe.

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:32.260
Like it's just amazing, like
the mean is shifted so high.

01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:35.800
And also people who have
amazing paths to get here,

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:38.500
coming from very little
and accomplishing so much.

01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.890
But it's also the pressure,

01:53:40.890 --> 01:53:42.027
- Yeah.
- right.

01:53:42.027 --> 01:53:45.230
You know, the way that this
career was described to me

01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:47.930
the day I got my job, was
one colleague of mine,

01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:50.530
the late Ben Barres said,
welcome to schizophrenia

01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:52.830
'cause you're never going to
be able to complete anything

01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:53.990
without getting interrupted.

01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:56.360
That was partially true,
although I've created buffers.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:00.000
And the other one, very
successful scientist,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.560
member of the National
Academy, et cetera, said to me,

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:05.300
you know, just remember, it's pinball.

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.800
You never win.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.010
The best you can do is just keep playing.

01:54:09.010 --> 01:54:13.210
- Yes, right.
- And I thought wow, okay.

01:54:13.210 --> 01:54:14.043
Okay.

01:54:14.043 --> 01:54:15.232
And then you just go.

01:54:15.232 --> 01:54:17.270
- Right.
- But I think that

01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:19.730
as we achieve more, not
just academics of course,

01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:21.730
but as anyone achieves more,

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:24.570
there's the relishing
in the accomplishment.

01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:26.810
There's often the desire for more,

01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:28.620
but there's also the pressure of,

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:31.290
well now I have to do this
for the next 30 years,

01:54:31.290 --> 01:54:32.123
even though I love it.

01:54:32.123 --> 01:54:34.760
It's the pressure of, well,
if the mountain is this high,

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.645
then how do I get here and here and here,

01:54:37.645 --> 01:54:38.680
and then you start shoveling more dirt on

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:39.513
so you can keep climbing.

01:54:39.513 --> 01:54:40.670
And it's a lot of work.

01:54:40.670 --> 01:54:41.503
- [Anna] Yes.

01:54:41.503 --> 01:54:45.330
- And I think that the
perception of success is that

01:54:45.330 --> 01:54:48.130
there's a roar of the
crowd and you cruise.

01:54:48.130 --> 01:54:49.350
You don't cruise.

01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:50.450
They just give you more to do.

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:51.470
- Right.
- Or you give yourself

01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:52.620
more to do.

01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:56.660
- Well what I think is, at
least in my life experience,

01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:59.620
and I've heard this from other
people as well, you know,

01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:03.050
it's that prize that we're going for,

01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:07.740
that if we get it is so unsatisfying.

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:11.100
And it's the prize that we never imagined

01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.970
that we kind of go, well,
how did that happen,

01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:16.600
but gee, you know, that feels good.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.812
And so I'm very, what's the-

01:55:18.812 --> 01:55:19.756
- It's like a mirage

01:55:19.756 --> 01:55:20.890
- Yeah.
- in the one case.

01:55:20.890 --> 01:55:21.723
- Yeah.

01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:27.751
- It's almost like dopamine
can create these mirages.

01:55:27.751 --> 01:55:28.584
- Yes.

01:55:28.584 --> 01:55:30.337
- That there's some place

01:55:30.337 --> 01:55:31.170
there.
- That's right.

01:55:31.170 --> 01:55:32.826
And if I just, it's that pot of gold.

01:55:32.826 --> 01:55:34.339
If I just-
- Constant dopamine.

01:55:34.339 --> 01:55:35.390
- Right, right,

01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:36.970
that's right.
- Constant dopamine.

01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:39.250
- And I think, you know,
this really, I think,

01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:41.930
is related to our discussion earlier

01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:43.510
about this taking it one day at time,

01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:45.890
or paying attention to that, you know,

01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:48.610
24-hour period in your environment.

01:55:48.610 --> 01:55:50.290
I am absolutely fascinated

01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:55.290
by the ways in which we accumulate
success, when we do that,

01:55:56.230 --> 01:56:00.770
totally independent of
the desire for success.

01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:03.000
It's really process-oriented.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.530
It's like, where am I today?

01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:09.650
How can I make today a
good and meaningful day,

01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:11.340
a little bit better,

01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:14.780
or as good as some other days I've had?

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.970
Constantly tweaking and experimenting

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:21.670
with this experiment that
we call our human existence.

01:56:21.670 --> 01:56:25.520
And when we do that in
a way that's authentic

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.920
and paying attention and value-driven,

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:32.460
whatever our, you know,
values are informed by,

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:33.910
it is very, very interesting

01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:37.443
how those days again
accumulate, and you find, well,

01:56:37.443 --> 01:56:40.030
I guess I contributed
something of value there,

01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:42.690
but I wasn't trying to do that.

01:56:42.690 --> 01:56:44.660
You know, I think that's really,

01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:47.100
I mean, what I'm so amazed
by is like, you know,

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.940
20 years ago when I went
to Stanford Medical School,

01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:52.460
or 25 years ago, you know, I just,

01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:55.230
I was happy to just be a good doctor.

01:56:55.230 --> 01:56:58.030
I was like, I guess I'm just
going to try to figure out

01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:59.750
how to be a good doctor,
I'm here to learn that.

01:56:59.750 --> 01:57:02.130
And now I see these medical
students, and they're wonderful.

01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:02.963
They're brilliant

01:57:02.963 --> 01:57:04.673
and they're
- They are.

01:57:04.673 --> 01:57:05.506
- well-intentioned, all that.

01:57:05.506 --> 01:57:07.890
But they're like how can I, you know,

01:57:07.890 --> 01:57:12.890
write the great American novel,
do my startup, go to Africa,

01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:14.230
apply for that grant?

01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:15.520
You know, it's like, really,

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.720
I was just trying to
learn how to be a doctor.

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.700
And it's, as you say, it's
a lot of pressure on them.

01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:24.650
And it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging

01:57:24.650 --> 01:57:28.720
of the real way to accomplish something.

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:30.880
- Right.
- Which isn't about like

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.010
oh how can I accomplish something.

01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:36.360
It's like, what can I do today
that would be of service.

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.193
Right?

01:57:37.193 --> 01:57:41.100
And then finding that of trying
to be of service, you know,

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:43.380
and not really going for recognition,

01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:46.210
can sometimes lead to
what people call success,

01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:47.900
although that wasn't
what you were aiming for.

01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:49.270
- And it's all the more beautiful

01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:50.570
when it's not what you're aiming for.

01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:52.600
- Oh so much better, so much better.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.480
- Yeah, I'm a big
believer that when one can

01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.480
align their compulsion
with some greater good.

01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.540
- Yes, right.
- A service to humanity

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.163
or the planet or animals, whatever it is,

01:58:06.346 --> 01:58:09.760
that's where the really
good stuff emerges.

01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.730
Because there's a lot
of reciprocity there.

01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:14.800
The world starts to,
you're supporting the world

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.760
and then it starts to support you in a way

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.850
that feels very fluid.
- And it comes back.

01:58:18.850 --> 01:58:20.120
Right, and I mean that speaks to you

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:24.320
like your generosity to
me, vis-a-vis my book.

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.153
And I have to say-

01:58:25.153 --> 01:58:26.180
- Well, I love the book.

01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:27.013
- I know, it's-

01:58:27.013 --> 01:58:28.880
- There's like, we're not
in a business deal folks.

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:31.710
It's just purely that I heard
Anna lecture in my course,

01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:33.180
I wanted to learn more about dopamine.

01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:34.013
She taught me,

01:58:34.013 --> 01:58:35.070
I asked her if she would
come on the podcast.

01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:36.770
Turned out she wrote this amazing book.

01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:38.870
She sent me an advanced copy of the book.

01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:41.180
I read it in one sweep, it's incredible.

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.013
And I love it.

01:58:42.013 --> 01:58:45.290
So just like the eight
year old version of me,

01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:48.260
now the 45 version of myself,

01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:50.510
I can't stop blabbing
about the things I love.

01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:52.570
- Well it's awesome, but I have to say,

01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:56.740
I have been surprised by your generosity.

01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:01.740
It's not something I've
encountered frequently at Stanford,

01:59:02.010 --> 01:59:03.170
which is a wonderful place.

01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:08.170
But there is a general
sense that if I give away

01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:14.383
to somebody else, I've lost something,

01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:18.350
which is not the right
way to think about it.

01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:21.630
Not how you are, and also
not how the world works,

01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:24.230
'cause when we give away to other people,

01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:26.590
we get back so much more.

01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:29.297
But it takes a long time

01:59:29.297 --> 01:59:31.970
and it might not come through that path.

01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:34.970
- I never think about reciprocity.

01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:38.830
But I was weaned by good advisers.

01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:39.830
- That's very nice,

01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:40.663
- Yeah.
- yeah.

01:59:40.663 --> 01:59:41.790
- I think it just sort
of got drilled into me

01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:45.613
that the more you give, the
better your immediate life is.

01:59:45.613 --> 01:59:46.446
- Yes, yeah.

01:59:46.446 --> 01:59:49.223
- And I also don't have a
long-term vision, you know.

01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:52.860
I just, I'm just excited about the book.

01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:55.720
I'm excited that people are learning about

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.480
the brain and dopamine.

01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:58.790
I have to admit,

01:59:58.790 --> 02:00:00.930
having grown up in
neuroscience essentially,

02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:03.030
I did not understand
that pleasure and pain

02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:05.380
were orchestrated the way that they are.

02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:07.230
I'm very mindful of it now.

02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:08.063
- Oh good.

02:00:08.063 --> 02:00:10.750
- And it's changed a
number of my behaviors.

02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:12.650
I know a number of people
are going to have questions

02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:14.280
and want to get in contact with you.

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:16.230
You are not on social media.

02:00:16.230 --> 02:00:17.290
- That's correct, yes.

02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:20.470
- You are true to your ideology.

02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:21.777
That's great.

02:00:21.777 --> 02:00:22.970
- And the reason for that is just,

02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:25.120
I wouldn't be able to control myself.

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.950
I mean, that really would be my drug.

02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:29.740
People are my drug, intimacy is my drug,

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.930
and I wouldn't be able to manage it.

02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:35.500
And so just, it was just easier
for me to not do it at all,

02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.033
rather than try to moderate it.

02:00:37.033 --> 02:00:39.610
- Well the book, as you mentioned before,

02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:42.300
and as I can attest to, is
it has a certain intimacy.

02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.810
People get to know you through the book.

02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:46.290
So definitely check out the book.

02:00:46.290 --> 02:00:48.830
If you have questions
about the book, et cetera,

02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:50.440
you're welcome to send them my way.

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.530
I will buffer you from
all those questions.

02:00:52.530 --> 02:00:53.533
I'll filter them.

02:00:55.150 --> 02:00:58.410
Anna, Dr. Lembke, I should
be formal, forgive me,

02:00:58.410 --> 02:00:59.581
I've been referring to you

02:00:59.581 --> 02:01:00.565
- No no, that's fine.
- as Anna

02:01:00.565 --> 02:01:01.530
the whole way through,
'cause we're colleagues,

02:01:01.530 --> 02:01:04.630
but thank you so much for
sharing this information.

02:01:04.630 --> 02:01:06.860
And I know I learned a ton.

02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:09.250
and I know everyone else is
going to learn a lot more

02:01:09.250 --> 02:01:12.250
about addiction and the
good side of dopamine.

02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.470
- That's right.

02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:14.463
Thank you for having me.

02:01:14.463 --> 02:01:17.263
It's been really, really
great to talk with you.

02:01:17.263 --> 02:01:18.610
- Great, thank you.

02:01:18.610 --> 02:01:20.150
