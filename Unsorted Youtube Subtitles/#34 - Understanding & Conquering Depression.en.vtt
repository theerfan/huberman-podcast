00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.350
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.437
where we discuss science

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.350
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.070
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.130
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.820
This month, we're talking all
about disorders of the mind,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.300
things like depression,
attention deficit disorders,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.963
eating disorders, schizophrenia,
and bipolar disorder.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.130
During the course of this month,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.260
we are going to discuss the psychological

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.360
and biological underpinnings
of mood disorders of all kinds.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.970
You'll learn a lot of science.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.190
You'll also learn a lot
about the various treatments

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.770
that exist and that are in development

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160
for these various mood disorders.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.210
We will talk about behavioral
tools, things like exercise,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.270
meditation, breath work,
but also prescription drugs,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.460
supplements and novel compounds
that are now being tested

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.440
in various clinical trials.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.500
Across the month, I think
you'll start to realize

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.850
that there are common pathways

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.420
underlying many mood disorders.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.150
In fact, mood disorders
that look quite different

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.070
from one another often
depend on the action

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.300
of the same neurochemicals
or neural circuits

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.950
in the brain and body.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.460
That actually should be
a point of great relief

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.210
because what it means is that
by understanding the biology

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.510
of one mood disorder or
understanding how one treatment

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.840
or behavioral intervention
can impact a mood disorder,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
we gain insight into other
mood disorders as well.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.690
As always, we will discuss
science and science related tools

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.260
that people could implement
should they choose.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.690
Before we dive into today's topic,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.680
I'd like to discuss a very particular

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970
set of scientific findings
that relate to today's topic,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.280
and that are important for
understanding all mood disorders

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.280
and all states of motivation,
happiness, and sadness,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.300
as well as depression.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.060
Basically, I'm going to
paraphrase a brief segment

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.910
of my discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.650
who I sat down with to discuss addiction

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.690
and the biological basis of addiction

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.933
and addiction treatment.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.750
A very important aspect of that discussion

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.170
was when Dr. Lembke described
the pleasure pain balance,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.920
literally the circuits in our brains

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370
that control our sense
of pleasure and pain,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.350
and ultimately whether
or not we remain happy

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.293
in our pursuit of pleasure or not.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.480
This is an absolutely crucial aspect

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.120
to the way that we
function in everyday life,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.870
and especially under
conditions of mood disorders.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.490
The pathway that she was describing

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.550
is the so-called pleasure system.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.490
However, what most people don't realize

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.990
is that the pleasure system

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.420
is also directly associated with,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.550
and in fact is the very same system

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.150
that modulates mental or
psychological anguish and pain.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.680
Essentially what she described

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.010
is that whenever we pursue something

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.550
that we think will bring us pleasure,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.230
and that could be anything that we think

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.460
will bring us pleasure from
food, to video games, to sex,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.293
to a particular job or goal,
short-term or long-term,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.310
that we experience release of
the neuromodulator dopamine.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.360
Now, dopamine is associated
with increased levels

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.510
of motivation and drive.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.040
It is not the molecule of reward,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.610
it is the molecule of
craving motivation and drive.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.520
However, as Dr. Lembke pointed out,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.600
when we are in pursuit of something,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.720
there is a release of
dopamine in our brain

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.360
that makes us feel motivated,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.870
and in general, it makes us feel good.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.200
But very shortly thereafter

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.050
and beneath our conscious awareness,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.500
there is a tilt of the pleasure
pain balance in the brain,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.290
literally a shift in the neural circuits

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.220
that underlie pleasure and pain,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.370
such that every bit of
pleasure or pleasure seeking

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.520
that causes release of dopamine

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.860
will be balanced out by
a little bit of pain.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.360
And we don't experience
this as physical pain,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.500
at least not at first,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.090
we experience it as craving for more

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.420
of the thing that brought us pleasure.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.780
Now, that sounds pretty good.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.670
You get pleasure and then
you get a little bit of pain

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.860
to balance it out.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.600
It's subconscious and you experience it

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.360
as the desire to seek out more pleasure.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.600
However, it's actually
more diabolical than that.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.120
And we really need to keep an eye on this

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.080
if we are to remain happy,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.660
if we are to remain in
pursuit of our goals.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.690
The crucial thing to
understand is that if we remain

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.260
in constant pursuit of pleasure,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.460
the pain side of the balance tips

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.980
so that each time we are in pursuit

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.340
of that pleasureful thing,
activity, or substance,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.450
we are going to experience,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.490
we literally achieve less dopamine release

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.130
each subsequent time.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.410
So we get less pleasure and the
amount of craving increases.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.050
Now, after a certain point or threshold,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.760
we call that addiction.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.417
And the way to reset the balance,

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:51.600
and this is very important,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.490
the way to reset the balance

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.290
is actually to enter into states

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.320
in which we are not in
pursuit of pleasure,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.800
to literally enter states
in which we are bored,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.830
maybe even a little bored and anxious,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.680
and that resets the pleasure pain balance

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.940
so that we can return to
our pursuit of pleasure

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.910
in a way that's healthy,
and then in an ongoing way,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.310
won't lead to this over
tipping or this increase

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.160
in the amount of pain or addiction.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.340
So this is very important.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.410
And if this seemed vague,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.200
what this means is we
should always be cautious

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.780
of any state of mind
or body or any pursuit

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.860
that leads to very large
increases in dopamine.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.240
And if it does, we should be very careful

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.020
to not pursue that repeatedly over time.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.100
During today's episode, I'm
going to give an example,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.860
a real life example of a
discussion that I've been in

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.560
with a young man who's 21 years old

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.520
who's dealing with a disruption

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.363
in this pleasure pain balance.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.240
He is essentially depressed
and he's depressed

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.260
because of his ongoing pursuit
of a particular activity

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.900
that initially led to a lot of dopamine,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.330
but over time has led to
less and less dopamine

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.410
and more and more of this
pain side of the balance.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.170
We could call him addicted
to that particular activity.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.730
Whether or not he's addicted
by clinical standards or not,

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.140
really, isn't important.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.540
What is important is that he
experiences this as depression,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.580
as low affect as it's called or anhedonia,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.040
an inability to experience
pleasure from that thing

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.500
or from anything else.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.210
And he's currently undergoing treatment

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.160
through a rebalancing of
his pleasure pain pathway.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.010
So while I can't reveal
his identity to you,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.280
that wouldn't be appropriate.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.820
He did give me permission to reveal

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.100
the general architecture
of what he's coping with.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.400
And I spent some hours with
him on the phone this week,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.770
talking to him as well
as to the various people

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.180
that he's working with
to really understand

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.910
what's going on here 'cause
I think it can illustrate

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.930
the relationship between
dopamine, pleasure, and pain

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.930
for sake of addiction,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.670
but also for understanding how
to avoid depressive states,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.520
how to remove ourselves
from depressive states.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.970
And as you'll see today,
as we discussed depression,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.460
many of the molecules and neural pathways

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.490
and biological mechanisms
that we know can be used

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.910
to counter depression,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.450
feed back onto this pleasure pain balance.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.820
Before we begin, I'd like
to say that this podcast

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.770
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.910
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.650
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.630
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.770
In keeping with that theme,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.640
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.420
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.860
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.480
that analyzes data from blood and DNA

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.020
to help you better understand your body

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.020
and help you reach your health goals.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.840
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.430
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.810
that impact our immediate
and long-term health

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.010
can only be detected from
a quality blood test.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.150
The problem with most
blood tests, however,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.770
is that you get information
back about hormone levels,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.777
metabolic factors, et cetera,

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:58.520
but you don't really know what
to do with that information.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.240
Some things might be flagged
as too high or too low,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.200
but really interpreting
those data and taking action

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.540
to bring those numbers into
the ranges that you want

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.610
is what it's really about.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.870
An InsideTracker makes all that very easy.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.140
They have a platform, it's a dashboard

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.920
that will tell you for instance,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.360
what sorts of dietary changes
or supplementation changes

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.080
or exercise changes will help
you bring various hormones,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.270
metabolic factors, and other
factors into the ranges

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.730
that are right for you.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.350
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.630

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.900
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.480
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.910
probiotic drink.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.420
I've been using athletic
greens since way back in 2012.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.010
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.750
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.670
and that I still take Athletic Greens

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.350
is that it really covers
all of my foundational

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.530
nutrient and micronutrient needs.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.170
It has vitamins, minerals,

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.870
and the thing that's especially
important to me these days

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.640
is the probiotics,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.310
because there are so many data

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.680
that show that having a
healthy gut microbiome

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.260
is vital to having a healthy immune system

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.800
and for healthy gut brain axis,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.640
literally the functioning
of your brain, your mood,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.450
various aspects of brain inflammation

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.080
or limiting brain
inflammation are facilitated

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.790
by having a healthy gut microbiome.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.170
And that's facilitated by
getting the proper probiotics.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.710
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.560
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.550
which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.510
while you're on the road or in the car,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.220
and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.700
Vitamin D3K2 have been shown
to have a number of different

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.760
positive health effects on hormones,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.660
on cardiovascular health, and so on.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.380
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.090
to claim their special offer.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.480
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Belcampo.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.170
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.670
that raises organic,
grass fed, and finished

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.660
certified humane meats.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.070
I don't need a lot of meat.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.820
Typically my diet regime
is one in which I fast

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.190
until about noon,

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.470
and then I have a lunch
which is fairly low carbs.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.690
So I'll have some piece
of meat or chicken or fish

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.840
and some salad typically.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.230
And then in the evening is when I tend

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.960
to emphasize carbohydrates.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.170
That helps me be really
alert during the day

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.340
and sleep well at night.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.650
When I do eat meat, I insist that the meat

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.200
be of the very highest quality

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.880
and that it is sourced in humane ways.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.060
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.170
and seasonal grasses,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.340
and that results in meat
that is higher in nutrients

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.490
and healthy fats.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.660
There are now a lot of
data pointing to the fact

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.670
that high levels of omega-3
fatty acids are vital for mood,

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.360
for cardiovascular health
and various aspects

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.390
of maintaining what's called
a healthy Inflammatone,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.210
the various things in our brain and body

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.720
that maintain a healthy
inflammation response,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.810
but one that doesn't go out
of whack or get unchecked

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.330
in any way that is detrimental to us.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.810

and use the code "Huberman" at checkout.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.070
Today we're discussing depression.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.800
In particular, we're going to
talk about major depression.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.420
The phrase major depression
is used to distinguish

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.500
one form of depression from the other,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.803
the other one being bipolar depression.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.310
Bipolar depression, sometimes
called bipolar disorder,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.000
is really characterized by manic highs.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.990
So where people aren't sleeping

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.440
and they're talking very fast,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.160
and they're buying things
and pursuing resources

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.590
that they can't afford,

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.670
they're starting
relationships left and right,

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.080
they're manic,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.330
followed by periods of
crashes of feeling very low,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.380
lethargic, and so on.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.550
Bipolar depression is an
absolutely crucial thing

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.710
for us to discuss.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.020
And therefore we are
going to have an entire

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.930
separate episode related
to bipolar depression.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.880
Today, we're going to talk
about major depression,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.440
also sometimes called unipolar depression,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.660
just because it doesn't
have the highs and lows.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.003
It's more characterized by the lows.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.440
We're going to talk about the biology,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.780
the psychology, and
the various treatments,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.660
behavioral, drug,
supplementation, diet, exercise,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.510
all of that.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.390
Before we go forward into the material,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.830
I just want to emphasize
that any discussion

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.890
about mood disorders carries with it

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.100
a particular sensitivity,

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.423
and that sensitivity is one
related to self-diagnosis.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.590
Today's episode, and indeed
in the future episodes

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.480
for this month on mood disorders,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.420
you're going to hear various
symptomologies that are used

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.223
to diagnose and characterize
these disorders.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.610
If you recognize some of these
symptomologies in yourself

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.380
or in others that you know,

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.260
that's an important thing to take note of.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.330
However, accurate diagnosis
really should be done

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.370
by a qualified healthcare professional.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.430
So at once I'm saying, keep
your eyes and your ears up

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.380
for things that sound familiar to you

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.500
that might be of concern.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.340
And at the same time,

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.630
I'm saying don't necessarily
leap to conclusions.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.140
Take those flags of
concern if they're there

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.510
and bring them to a qualified
healthcare professional,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.010
and they'll be able to
properly diagnose you

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.770
as having a particular mood
disorder or diagnose somebody

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.060
as having a particular
mood disorder or not.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.940
And that's an essential step.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.330
I don't say this to protect us,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.660
I said this really to protect you.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.700
Okay, let's have a fact-based
discussion about depression.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.330
And I promise you that where
we don't know certain things

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.730
about depression, I will
be clear to tell you.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.590
In fact, we are going to
talk about some treatments

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.090
for depression that are
looking very promising,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.960
and that right now are actually
being used more and more.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.350
And from my read of the
mechanistic literature,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.960
we're still a bit in the
dark as to how these work.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.560
That's actually a common
theme of medicine.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.570
Many times there are
treatments that seem promising

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.650
or that look really terrific.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.540
And there isn't a lot of
understanding about mechanism.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.420
However, any good discussion
about neuroscience

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.080
and in particular about mood disorders,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.410
has to get into mechanisms.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.410
So we're going to do that.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.070
And in doing that, we're
going to frame the discussion

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.220
for the tools of how to
keep depression at bay

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.470
and how to deal with it

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.070
if you happen to find yourself depressed,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.030
or if you know somebody
else who's depressed.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.530
What is this thing we call depression?

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.480
Was I mentioned before, it has two forms,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.380
bipolar depression, which
we're not talking about today,

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.350
and major depression, also
called unipolar depression

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.183
is the other.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.720
Major depression impacts
5% of the population.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.190
That is any enormous number.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.830
That means if you're in
a class of 100 people,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.100
five of them are dealing
with major depression

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.200
or have at some point.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.670
Look around you in any environment

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.580
and you can be sure that a
good portion of the people

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.910
that you're surrounded by
is impacted by depression,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.300
or will be at some point.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.160
So this is something we
really have to take seriously

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.623
and that we want to understand.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.510
It is the number four cause of disability.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.430
A lot of people miss work, miss school,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.320
and before then likely perform
poorly in work or school

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.780
due to major depression.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.690
Now there's a very serious
challenge in having a discussion

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.540
about depression and it relates
directly to the challenges

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.083
in diagnosing depression.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.890
Earlier, I did an episode
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.500
who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.333
He's a psychiatrist.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.740
And he made a very important point,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.920
which is that the field of
psychiatry and psychology

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.370
are confronted with a challenge,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.470
which is they're trying to
understand what's going on

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.340
within the stuff that's in our brains

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.490
that's deep to our skulls.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.670
We don't have access to
that without brain imaging

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.550
and electrodes and things like that.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.700
Someone just comes into the
office and the dissection tool

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.550
for depression so to speak is language.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.330
In order to determine if
somebody has depression or not,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.700
we have to use language,
how they talk about things,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.300
also how they carry their body.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.670
Also some general patterns of health.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.880
So let's talk about depression

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.550
the way that clinicians
talk about depression,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.610
because one of the issues is that

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.210
we use the word depression loosely.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.737
A lot of people say,
"Oh, I'm so depressed.

00:16:21.737 --> 00:16:24.187
"I didn't get this job
or I'm so depressed.

00:16:24.187 --> 00:16:25.877
"I just don't know, I
had a really rough week

00:16:25.877 --> 00:16:27.267
"or I'm exhausted.

00:16:27.267 --> 00:16:29.187
"I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed

00:16:29.187 --> 00:16:30.527
"I thought I was going to go on vacation

00:16:30.527 --> 00:16:32.680
"and then they canceled the flight." Okay.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.290
That is not clinical depression.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.350
That's called being bummed
out, being sad or disappointed.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.810
Now that person might be depressed,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.070
but clinical depression

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.930
actually has some very specific criteria.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.460
And those criteria are
mainly characterized

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.200
by the presence of certain things

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.620
and the absence of a
few particular things.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.560
So let's talk about the
things that are present

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.520
in somebody that has major depression.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.930
First of all, there tends
to be a lot of grief.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.170
There tends to be a lot of sadness.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.610
That's no surprise.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.180
The threshold to cry is often
a signature of depression.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.200
Now that doesn't mean
that if you cry easily,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.040
that you're depressed.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.150
Some people cry more easily than others,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.610
but if you're somebody who
typically didn't cry easily

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.290
and suddenly you find
yourself crying very easily,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.207
that could be a sign of depression.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.823
And I want to emphasize, could.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.430
There's also this thing
that we call anhedonia,

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.460
a general lack of ability to enjoy things,

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.120
things that typically or
previously we enjoyed.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.040
Things like food, things like
sex, things like exercise,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.070
things like social gatherings,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.190
a kind of lack of enjoyment
from those things.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.360
Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.850
and sometimes it's just flat,
it's just kind of neutral.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.980
It doesn't feel good
because nothing there.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.520
It's like bland food.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.490
It's like these experiences are analogous

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.540
to biting into your
favorite article of food

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.010
and it just not tasting very good.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.750
It just doesn't taste
like anything at all.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.010
And that's a common symptom
of major depression.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.230
The other one is guilt.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.160
Oftentimes people with
depression will feel very guilty

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.830
about things they have done in the past,

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.100
or they'll just generally
feel badly about themselves.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.600
And we're going to talk
about this because it relates

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.340
to some of the more serious symptomology

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.690
seen in depression sometimes,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.140
things like self harm,
mutilation, or even suicide.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.640
But for the time being, we
want to frame up anhedonia,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.860
this lack of ability to
achieve or experience pleasure,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.720
or kind of a flat affect as it's called.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.550
Sometimes even delusional thinking,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.150
negative delusional thinking,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.120
and in particular anti-self confabulation.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.730
What is anti-self confabulation?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.180
Well, first of all, confabulation
is an incredible aspect

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.250
of our mind and our nervous system.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.520
You sometimes see other
forms of confabulation

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.460
in people who have memory deficits

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.270
either because they have brain damage

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.240
or they have age-related dementia.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.170
A good example of this would be someone

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.960
with age related dementia
sometimes will find themselves

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.660
in a location in the house and
not know how they got there.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.350
And if you ask them, "Oh,
what are you doing here?"

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.247
They will create these elaborate stories.

00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:16.827
"Oh, I was thinking about
going to the shopping today,

00:19:16.827 --> 00:19:19.017
"and I was going to take the bus,

00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:19.850
"and then I was going to do this."

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.020
They create these elaborate
stories, they confabulate.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.110
And yet that person hasn't
left the house in weeks

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.780
and that person doesn't
have a driver's license.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.670
And so they're really
just creating this stuff.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.780
They're not lying to get out of anything,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.710
they're confabulating.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.400
It's as if a brain circuit
that writes stories,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.713
just starts generating content.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.780
In major depression,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.640
there's often a state of
delusional anti-self confabulation,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.940
where the confabulation are not directly

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.190
or completely linked to reality,

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.870
but they are ones that make the self,

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.550
the person describing them,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.950
seem sick or in some way not well.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.250
A good example would be somebody

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.820
who experiences a physical injury perhaps.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.930
Maybe they break their
ankle, maybe it's an athlete,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.300
and they also happen to become depressed.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.987
And you'll talk to them and
say, "How are things going?

00:20:07.987 --> 00:20:09.233
"How's your rehab though?"

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:11.097
And they go, "Oh, it's
okay. And I don't know.

00:20:11.097 --> 00:20:13.497
"I feel like I'm getting
weaker and weaker by the day.

00:20:13.497 --> 00:20:14.607
"I'm just not performing well."

00:20:14.607 --> 00:20:16.100
And then you'll talk to the person

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.750
that they're working with,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.150
their kinesiologist or whoever
the physical therapist is.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.987
And they'll say, "No, they're
actually really improving.

00:20:22.987 --> 00:20:24.057
"And I tell them they're improving,

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.757
"but somehow they're not
seeing that improvement,

00:20:26.757 --> 00:20:28.660
"they're not registering
that improvement."

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.500
You notice that sometimes it's subtle

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.760
and sometimes it's severe, but
they'll start confabulating.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.367
You'll say, "I actually heard
you're doing much better.

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:39.337
"You're getting better,
you're taking multiple trips

00:20:39.337 --> 00:20:40.287
"around the building now

00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:42.130
"before you could barely get out of bed."

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.177
And they'll say,

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:45.537
"Yeah, well basically,
they changed some things

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:48.717
"about the parking lot that
make it easier to move around.

00:20:48.717 --> 00:20:50.130
"So it's not really me."

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.450
And these aren't people that
are just explaining away

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.790
their accomplishments

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.030
'cause they're trying to brush off praise.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.420
They are viewing themselves

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.130
and they're confabulating
according to a view

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.800
that is very self-deprecating

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.540
to the point where it doesn't
match up with reality.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.950
It's not what other people see

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.530
and it's actually not
matched up with reality.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.810
And that's a symptom of depression

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.110
that I think we don't often think about

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.060
or conceptualize enough.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.477
So it's not just telling people,

00:21:19.477 --> 00:21:22.800
"oh yeah, it's not as good as
it seems. Everything's bad."

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.230
These people really believe that

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.340
and it becomes disconnected from reality.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.410
So it's if they're sort
of sinking into a pit

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.010
and they're losing touch with
the realities of the world,

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.010
including data about themselves,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.410
their ability to move and get around it,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.960
for example, in that particular instance

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.000
that I used as an example,
but there are others as well.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.400
The other common symptomology
of major depression

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.750
is what they call
vegetative symptoms, okay?

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.300
So vegetative symptoms
are symptoms that occur

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.100
without any thinking, without any doing,

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.490
or without any confabulation.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.130
These are things that are
related to our core physiology.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.490
The word vegetative,

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.120
you might know it sounds like vegetable.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.570
It actually relates to
a system in the body

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.200
that nowadays is more commonly called

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.530
the autonomic nervous system.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.407
The vegetative nervous system

00:22:10.407 --> 00:22:12.360
and the autonomic nervous system,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.060
historically were considered
sort of one in the same.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.860
And it relates to things
like the stress response

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.760
or to our ability to sleep.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.330
So vegetative symptoms

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.430
be things like constantly being exhausted.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.770
The person just feels exhausted.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.420
It's not because they exercise too much,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.670
it's not necessarily because
of a life event, it could be,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.460
but they're just worn out.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.130
They don't have the energy they once had.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.430
So it's not in their heads, it's probably,

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.630
and now I think we have good
data to support the fact

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.530
that there's something off,

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.570
something is disrupted in the autonomic

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.397
or so-called vegetative nervous system.

00:22:47.397 --> 00:22:49.450
And one of the most common symptoms

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.270
of people with major depression,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.540
one of the signs of major
depression is early waking

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.610
and not being able to fall back asleep

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.870
despite being exhausted.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.250
So waking up at 3:00 AM
or 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.260
just spontaneously and not
being able to go back to sleep.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.950
I want to emphasize that that could happen

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:12.000
for other reasons as well,
but it is a common symptom

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.570
or warning sign of major depression.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.993
So let's talk more about
sleep and depression.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.500
It's well-known that the
architecture of sleep

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.360
is disrupted in depression.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.700
What's the architecture of sleep?

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.150
I've done entire episodes about this,

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.380
but very briefly in two sentences,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.180
although they're probably
be run on sentences,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.540
early in the night,

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.370
you tend to have slow wave
sleep more than REM sleep

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.660
or Rapid Eye Movement sleep.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.540
As the night goes on,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.920
you tend to have more
Rapid Eye Movement sleep.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.450
That architecture of slow wave sleep

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.880
preceding Rapid Eye Movement sleep

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.880
is radically disrupted
in major depression.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.260
In addition, the pattern
of activity in the brain

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.230
during particular phases
of sleep is disrupted.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.480
Now this is during sleep.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.790
So this can't be that people

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.680
are creating this
situation for themselves.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.160
These are real physiological
signs that something is off

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.930
in this so-called autonomic
or vegetative nervous system.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.830
And then there are some
other things that relate

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.830
to the autonomic nervous system,

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.600
but that we normally think of
as more voluntary in nature.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.210
And these are things
like decreased appetite.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:21.210
So you can imagine that one
could have decreased appetite

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.720
because of the anhedonia,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.700
the lack of pleasure from food, right?

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.800
If you don't enjoy food,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.570
then you might be less
motivated to eat it.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.720
That makes sense.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.520
As well because of these disruptions

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.290
in the autonomic nervous system,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.570
these vegetative symptoms,
as they're called,

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.790
you can imagine that someone
would have decreased appetite

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.569
because some of the hormones
associated with appetite,

00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:43.900
hypocretin orexin and things
of that sort, ghrelin,

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.520
that those will be disrupted.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.710
And if those names of
hypocretin orexin and ghrelin

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.860
don't make any sense to
you, don't worry about it.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.210
What those are just hormones
that impact when we eat,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.170
when we feel hungry, and
when we crave food more,

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.650
as well as when we feel full,

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.480
we have enough so-called satiety.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.730
If you want to learn more about those,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.750
we did entire episodes
on eating and metabolism.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.970
So you can see that the
symptomology of major depression

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.830
impacts us at multiple levels.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.200
There's the conscious level of
how excited we are generally.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.380
Well, that's reduced.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.620
There's grief, there's
guilt, there's crying,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.690
but then there's also
these vegetative things.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.900
There's disruptions in sleep,

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.880
which of course make
everything more challenging

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.713
when we're awake.

00:25:24.713 --> 00:25:27.060
We know that sleep is
so vital for resetting.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.140
You're waking up early, you
can't get back to sleep.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.880
That's going to adjust your affect,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.390
your emotions in negative ways.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.570
We know this.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.960
And appetite is off.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.520
And there are hormones that get disrupted.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.680
So cortisol levels are increased.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.650
In particular, there's a
signature pattern of depression

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.090
whereby cortisol, the
stress hormone that normally

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.760
is released in a healthy way

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.940
only in the early part of the day

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.770
is shifted to late in the day.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.550
In fact, a 9:00 PM peak in cortisol

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.040
is one of the physiological signatures

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.860
of depressive like states.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.490
It's not the only one, but
it is an important one.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.560
So there are a lot of things
going on in major depression.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.040
And by now you're probably thinking,

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.230
goodness, this is dreadful.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.550
Like there's all this terrible stuff.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.520
And indeed it is terrible.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.460
It is a terrible thing to find oneself

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.700
in a mode where things
feel sad, you feel guilty,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.090
you're exhausted.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.530
And oftentimes there's also an association

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.660
with the anxiety system.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.420
So just because people are exhausted

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.340
and lethargic and they don't enjoy things,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.360
doesn't necessarily mean that
there's an absence of anxiety.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.690
There can also be a lot of anxiety

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:35.960
about what's going to happen to me.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.160
Am I going to be able to
achieve my goals in life?

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.570
Will I ever get out of this state?

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.470
And so things really start to layer on.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.620
And if this sounds depressing to you,

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.410
it is indeed depressing.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.760
This is really the place that
many people find themselves.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.560
And it's a pit that they just don't know

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.980
how to climb out of.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.750
So let's just take a few minutes

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.420
and talk about some of
the underlying biology

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.320
that creates this cloud
or this constellation

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.990
of symptomology.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.430
I think that's really important to do

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.220
because if we want to understand
the various treatments,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.710
how they work and why they
work and how to implement them,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.290
we have to understand some
of the underlying biology.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.300
So let's spend a few minutes

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.790
talking about the biology of depression,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.520
what's known and what's not known.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.840
Because in doing that,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.910
I think you'll get a much clearer picture

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.060
about why certain tools
work to relieve depression

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.733
and why others might not.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.090
So one of the most
important early findings

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:35.230
in the search for a
biological basis of depression

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.000
was this finding that there are drugs

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.883
that relieve some of the
symptoms of depression.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.560
Those drugs generally fall
into three major categories,

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.370
but the first set of
ones that were discovered

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.830
were the so-called
tricyclic antidepressants,

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:56.830
and the MAO inhibitors, the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.080
You don't need to understand
that nomenclature,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.630
but I'm going to give you
a little bit of detail

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.530
so that if you want to
understand it, you can.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.800
Most of this work took
place in the late 1950s

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.360
and in the 1960s, and
continued well until the 1980s

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.920
when new classes of drugs were discovered.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.790
And these tricyclic antidepressants
and the MAO inhibitors

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.490
largely worked by increasing
levels of norepinephrine

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.140
in the brain, as well as
in the body, in some cases.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.480
And they were discovered

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.350
through a kind of odd
set of circumstances.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.860
We don't have time to
go into all the history,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.170
but suffice to say that
they were discovered

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.800
because of the exploration for drugs

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.370
that alter blood pressure.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.960
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.230
and drugs that lower blood pressure

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.460
reduce levels of norepinephrine.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.320
And that in many cases, was
shown to lead to depression

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.370
or depressive like symptoms.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.750
And so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs,

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.790
and the MAO inhibitors actually
increase norepinephrine.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.820
And frankly, they do quite a
good job of relieving some,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.420
if not all of the symptoms
of major depression.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.210
However, they carry with
the many side effects.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.580
Some of those side
effects are side effects

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.990
related to blood pressure itself,

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.640
by increasing noradrenaline,
norepinephrine as it's called,

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.740
you raise blood pressure.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.630
That can be dangerous,
that can be uncomfortable.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.030
But they also have a lot
of other side effects.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.710
The reason they have other side effects

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.220
is because they impact systems
in the brain and in the body

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:35.070
that impact things like
libido, appetite, digestion,

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.903
and others.

00:29:35.903 --> 00:29:38.320
And we'll talk about each
of those in sequence.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.190
Okay, so the experience
that clinicians had

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.190
of observing some relief for depression

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.190
with the tricyclic antidepressants
and with MAO inhibitors

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.450
was terrific, but there
were all these side effects,

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.500
side effects that people
really did not like,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.562
they didn't like these drugs at all.

00:29:54.562 --> 00:29:57.170
A lot of people get dry mouth,
I mentioned the low libido,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.050
they'd have sleep issues,
appetite issues, weight gain.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.510
They made some people so uncomfortable

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.020
that they preferred not to take them,

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.870
even though when they didn't take them,

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.760
they had a worsening or a maintenance

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.210
of their depressive symptoms.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.900
A decade or so later,
there was the discovery

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.540
of the so-called pleasure
pathways in the brain.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.430
These are pathways,
literally groups of neurons

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.560
that reside in different
locations in the brain

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.630
but connect to one another.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.930
So it's a circuit.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.930
And when you stimulate these
neurons with certain behaviors

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.700
or with electrical
stimulation in an experiment,

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.533
believe it or not,

00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:33.660
that's been done in
both animals and humans,

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.720
animals and humans become
very, very motivated

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.700
to get more stimulation of these pathways.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.450
So this pleasure pathway or
these circuits for pleasure

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.363
are very what we call reinforcing.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.650
In fact, animals and humans will work hard

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.060
to get stimulation of these brain areas

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.640
even more than they will
work to obtain sex, drugs,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.260
or even if they are addicted
to a particular drug

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.900
and they are in a state of withdrawal,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.170
the ultimate state of craving,

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.880
if given a choice, a person or an animal

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.930
will select to have stimulation
of this pleasure pathway

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.110
instead of the drug itself.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.110
And that is a major and
significant finding.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.870
This pleasure pathway,
as it's sometimes called,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.110
involves areas like the nucleus accumbens

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.980
and the ventral tegmental area.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.380
These are areas of the brain

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.550
that are rich with neurons
that make dopamine.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.940
And if you think to the
symptoms of depression,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.800
of anhedonia, lack of pleasure,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.380
a lack of ability to experience pleasure,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.470
well, that was a smoking gun
that there's something wrong

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.330
with the dopamine pathway in depression.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.290
And indeed that's the case.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:44.670
So it's not just norepinephrine,

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.010
it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.690
is somehow disrupted.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.390
And then in the 1980s,

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.020
there was the discovery
of the so-called SSRIs

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.280
Most people are now
familiar with the SSRIs,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.440
the Selective Serotonin
Re-Uptake Inhibitors.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.020
The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.090
from the tricyclic antidepressants
and the MAO inhibitors.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.210
As their name suggests, SSRI,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.050
Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:16.050
prevent serotonin from being
wiped up from the synapse

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.370
after two neurons talk to one another.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.240
What do I mean by that?

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.960
Well, here's some very
basic Neurobiology 101.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.610
If you don't know any neurobiology,

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.510
you're going to know
some in about 15 seconds.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.580
Neurons communicate with one another

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.560
by spitting out chemicals into
the little gap between them.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.740
The little gap between
them is called the synapse

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.360
or by the Brits, the synapse.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.900
Those chemicals bind to the
neuron on the opposite side

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.020
and cause changes in the
electrical activity of that neuron

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.330
on the other side of the synapse.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.070
Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.750
or more specifically,
it's a neuromodulator,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.550
can change the activity
of large groups of neurons

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.940
in very meaningful ways.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.460
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.090
means when a person takes this drug,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.200
some of those drugs include
things like Prozac or Zoloft,

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.340
the more typical names
or more generic names

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.140
are things like fluoxetine,

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.700
when people take those,
more serotonin hangs out

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.130
in the synapse and is able to be taken up

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.600
by the neuron on the opposite side

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.360
because of this selective
re-uptake inhibition.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.740
It prevents the clearance of
serotonin from the synapse

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.560
and thereby more serotonin
can have an effect.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.280
So SSRIs don't increase the
total amount of serotonin

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.220
in the brain.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.960
They change how effective the serotonin

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.060
that's already in the brain is

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.900
at changing the activity of neurons, okay?

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.810
So they don't increase serotonin,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.610
they increase the efficacy
or the function of serotonin

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.590
in the way that I just described.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.040
So that was more than 15 seconds,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.900
but now you understand how SSRIs work.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.220
And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.143
if they didn't in fact work.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.850
Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.960
They do carry certain side
effects in many individuals.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.270
Also, about a third of
people that take SSRIs

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.070
don't derive any benefit,

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.350
it doesn't relieve their
symptoms of depression.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.110
However, for the other two thirds,

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.890
there's often a relief of some,

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.520
if not all of the symptoms
of major depression.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.540
The problem is the side effects
that accompany those SSRIs.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.780
And so these days SSRIs
are a complicated topic.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.820
It's sort of what I would
call a barbed wire topic

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.910
because we often hear about
all the problems with them,

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:36.330
but these drugs also have
saved a lot of lives.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.320
They've also improved a lot of lives.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.690
The issue is that they tend
to have varying effects

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.620
on different individuals,

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.860
and sometimes varying effects over time.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.360
So they'll work for awhile then
they won't work for a while.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.387
There are also a lot of
mysteries about the SSRIs,

00:34:51.387 --> 00:34:53.750
and those mysteries bother people.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.130
What mysteries am I referring to?

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.360
Well, SSRIs increase
the amount of serotonin

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.120
or more specifically,
they increase the efficacy

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.900
of serotonin at the synapse,
that happens immediately,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.010
or very soon after people
start taking SSRIs.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.750
But people generally don't
start experiencing any relief

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.330
from their symptoms of depression

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.070
if they're going to
experience them at all,

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.030
until about two weeks after
they start taking these drugs.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.420
So there's something going
on there that's not clear.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.220
One idea is that the SSRIs
actually can improve symptoms

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.370
of depression or even remove
symptoms of depression

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.870
through so-called neuro-plasticity

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.930
by changing the way that
neural circuits function.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.840
And there are many on this,

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.240
but the main categories
of studies on SSRIs

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.050
that relate to neuroplasticity
fall into two camps.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.430
One is that the ways in which SSRIs might,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.610
and I want to emphasize,
might be able to trigger

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.750
the production of more
neurons in the brain,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.240
in particular areas of the hippocampus

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.520
called the dentate gyrus and
others, that impact memory.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.510
This is important. We're
going to come back to memory.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.560
The other is that the
SSRIs have been shown

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.860
in various scientific studies to reopen

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.520
critical periods of plasticity.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.120
I'll just briefly describe
one of those studies.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.430
There was a study done by
Lamberto Maffei's group in Pisa,

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.840
that explored brain plasticity

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.000
that's known to be
present in young animals

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.470
and disappear in older animals.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.550
And this is also true in
humans that younger humans

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.580
have a far more plastic
brain that can change

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.210
in many more ways more easily
than can the older brain.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.400
And what they showed was
that fluoxetine, Prozac,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.630
given to adult animals can reopen

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.920
this incredible period of plasticity,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.670
can allow more plasticity to occur.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.503
That was interesting.

00:36:43.503 --> 00:36:44.870
I mean, it's purely through increases

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.930
in serotonin transmission.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.600
And there are other studies
showing that fluoxetine

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.040
can increase the number of new neurons

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.860
that are born into the adult brain,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.360
so called neurogenesis, the
production of new neurons.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.410
So it's very clear that there are at least

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.750
three major chemical systems in the brain;

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.860
norepinephrine, dopamine,
and serotonin that relate to

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.020
and can adjust the symptoms of depression.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.160
And those actually can be
divided into separate categories.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.970
So for instance, epinephrin
or norepinephrine

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.370
is thought to relate to the
so-called psychomotor defects,

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.410
sometimes called psychomotor retardation.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.080
This is the lethargy,
this is the exhaustion,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.790
this is the inability to get
out of bed in the morning.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.350
Dopamine is thought to
relate to the anhedonia,

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.740
or I should say lack of
dopamine in depressive patients

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.960
is thought to lead to the anhedonia.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.420
The lack of ability to
experience pleasure.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.420
And serotonin is thought to
relate to the grief, the guilt,

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.070
some of the more cognitive
or more emotional aspects

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.190
of depression.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.800
So we've got the norepinephrine system

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.970
related to activity and alertness,

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.460
the dopamine system
relating to motivation,

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.610
pleasure, and the ability to
seek and experience pleasure,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:02.380
and then the serotonin system
that's related to grief.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.870
And unfortunately, brains and organisms

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.930
don't work in a simple mathematical way

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:08.890
where you just say, oh, well,

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.800
this person's experiencing a lot of grief,

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.490
but they don't have any
problems with lethargy.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.340
And so let's just boost
up their serotonin.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340
On paper it works,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.630
but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.990
And another patient,
you might get somebody

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.570
who can't experience pleasure,
but they're kind of anxious.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.157
They don't have any trouble sleeping,

00:38:26.157 --> 00:38:30.210
but they're just much more
anxious and frustrated

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.170
than they normally are,

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.280
and they meet the symptoms of depression.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.870
Well, you might think, oh, well,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.830
do you just give that person
some drugs increase dopamine

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:38.800
and everything will be better?

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.780
And indeed, in some cases that's true.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.150
There are drugs like Wellbutrin,

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.690
which function more specifically
on the dopamine system

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.500
to increase dopamine and they
also increase norepinephrine.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.580
Many people get great relief
from things like Wellbutrin.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.500
They don't really impact the
serotonin system so much.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.900
And therefore you don't get
a lot of the serotonergic

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.960
or serotonin related side effects.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.490
However, some people feel far
too anxious on those drugs,

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.450
some people get addicted
to those drugs in a way,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.850
because a lot of those
drugs that increase dopamine

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.670
make you want more of those drugs.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.940
So you start to realize that
what makes sense on paper

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.350
doesn't always make sense clinically.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.520
And this is why it's complicated.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.100
And a really good psychologist

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.870
and a really good psychiatrist
will work with someone

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.440
to try and pull and push
on these various systems

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.240
to find the combination
of drugs that may be

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.123
or may not be correct for them.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.210
There's a fourth aspect of
the chemistry of depression

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:32.550
that's really important to understand.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.530
And that's pain.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.510
We've talked about pain
on this podcast before,

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.430
but even if you didn't hear
the episode on pleasure

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.120
and pain, just want to
emphasize that pain is something

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.260
that we experience in our
body, no surprise there,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.140
an injury, a cut, et cetera,

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.320
but that we also
experience emotional pain.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.343
And those systems are linked
in very intricate ways.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.150
There's actually some data
showing that pain relievers,

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.920
Tylenol, Aspirin, these sorts of things,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.727
can help certain people
with emotional pain.

00:39:59.727 --> 00:40:01.400
Now I'm not recommending people run out

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.230
and take those things for emotional pain.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.190
But actually, if you think about it,

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.670
that shouldn't come as any surprise.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.080
given the enormous number of
people that take painkillers,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.180
opioids and things like
them to try and relieve

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.270
their psychological pain.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.430
And as we know, those drugs
are very, very problematic

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.130
for many individuals.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.370
They can help certain individuals,

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.760
but they are very prone to abuse

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.060
and they can induce addiction very easily

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.350
in a number of people.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:29.500
There's a substance that's
literally called substance P,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.350
the letter P, that's manufactured
by neurons in our brain

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.410
and body, which underlies
our sensation of pain.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.820
And indeed substance P
inhibitors have been used

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.410
to treat depression,
and in some cases works.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:45.060
A lot of people with depression
are hypersensitive to pain,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.910
and of course they could have
multiple things going on.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.900
They could have chronic
pain or chronic injury

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.360
and major depression.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.760
So you start to get the constellation

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.910
of the many things that could happen.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.530
So that's all I want to say
today about the chemistry

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:01.190
underlying depression or major depression.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.200
There's a lot more there,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.790
but I think if you understand
the norepinephrine system

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.610
and that it relates to some
of these things like lethargy,

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.430
the psychomotor defects,
as they're called,

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.010
dopamine and how it relates to motivation

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.010
and lack of motivation and lack
of dopamine and depression,

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:20.340
and serotonin and its
relationship to grief,

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.520
and that low serotonin can
lead to extreme grief and shame

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.020
and higher serotonin levels
can sometimes restore

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.930
a sense of wellbeing and safety

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.710
and feeling good about oneself.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.710
If you understand that and you
understand that physical pain

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.450
is somehow involved in certain cases,

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:37.107
I think you will know
more about depression

00:41:37.107 --> 00:41:39.860
and its underlying chemistry
than most all people out there.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.860
And if you'd like to learn more,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.200
I invite you to pursue
searching those terms

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.400
further on the internet.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.120
And we'll certainly go
into them in more depth.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.170
But that really sets the stage
for where we're headed next.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.820
So next I'd like to talk about hormones

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.970
and how they relate to depression.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.770
And I'd also like to talk about stress

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.440
and how it relates to depression,

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.500
as well as talk about some of the genetics

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.780
or the predispositions to depression.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.970
And for those of you that are thinking,

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:04.890
hey, I want the tools.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.110
I want to know how to fix depression.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.770
I understand the desire for that.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.800
I will just ask if you
hang in here with me

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.070
a little bit longer, not only
will you learn a lot more

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:18.030
about how this complicated
mood disorder works,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.280
some of the more
interesting things about it,

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.470
but it will also position
you to get a lot more

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.530
out of the tools that we will describe.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.450
You always have the option
to skip forward of course,

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.330
but I think it's important to understand

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.960
some of the hormonal and stress-related

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.580
aspects of depression.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.113
So let's talk about hormones.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.230
20% of people that have major depression

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.370
have low thyroid hormone.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.663
Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism.

00:42:41.663 --> 00:42:44.500
Oftentimes we think about
thyroid is only related

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.290
to having a fast metabolism,

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.370
but thyroid is related to
all forms of metabolism,

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.840
including our ability to
synthesize new tissues

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.470
like protein and repair injuries.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.500
I did a whole episode on
thyroid and growth hormone.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.530
If you want to check that out,

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.360
all of that is archived
at hubermanlab.com.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.740
It's all timestamped, et cetera.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.370
You can find on YouTube, Apple,
Spotify, all those places.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:07.930
So if you're curious about thyroid hormone

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.700
and growth hormone, and you want
to do the deep dive on those,

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.040
and you want to learn
how to alter their levels

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.680
using various approaches, check that out.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.380
But 20% of people with major
depression are hypo thyroidal.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.290
They don't make enough thyroid.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.280
And that leads to low energy,

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.350
low metabolism in the brain and body.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.100
And there's a condition
called Hashimoto's,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.560
which is essentially low thyroid output.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.340
And again, I don't want
to get into all the tools

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.173
related to thyroid.

00:43:36.173 --> 00:43:40.010
Sometimes a psychiatrists will
prescribe thyroid medication

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.530
to increase thyroid output
in people that are depressed

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.560
and that will work to
relieve the symptoms.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.940
So there isn't necessarily
a direct problem

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.060
with serotonin, dopamine,
and norepinephrine

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:49.893
or substance abuse.

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.670
Sometimes it's a thyroid problem.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.180
So there are certain
situations or conditions

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.170
that can impact the thyroid hormone system

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.700
and make people more
susceptible to depression

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.040
or make a pre-existing depression worse.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.400
And those are things like childbirth.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.810
So it's well-known that
women who give birth

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.460
can often undergo what's
called postpartum depression.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.810
It actually comes from the word
post parturition depression.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.202
They give birth,

00:44:15.202 --> 00:44:17.980
what's happier, what's
more joyful than the birth

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.370
of a new healthy child,

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:20.940
and they will lapse into a depression.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.400
And that's thought to
be hormonally related,

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.990
either directly to the thyroid system

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.800
or perhaps to the cortisol system as well.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.490
We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.990
As well, certain women
during certain phases

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.980
of their menstrual cycle
experience symptoms

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.800
that are very much like
clinical depression,

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.790
and oftentimes are diagnosed

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.140
with clinical depression appropriately.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.750
And of course the menstrual
cycle is associated

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.080
with shifts in hormone levels.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.670
As well, menopausal and
post-menopausal women

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.520
are more susceptible to major depression,

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.810
regardless of whether or not they've had

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.430
that major depression
earlier in their life.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.220
So these are things to
be on the lookout for

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.210
and to definitely talk to a
doctor and get a blood panel

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.750
that hopefully includes
measures of thyroid hormone

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:02.710
and cortisol hormone.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.840
Why cortisol hormone?

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.270
Well more stress is
correlated with more bouts

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:09.840
of major depression across the lifespan.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.720
How many bouts?

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.530
Well, it turns out that as you go

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.340
from having one to two to three,

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.650
well, when you hit four to five bouts

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.750
of really intense,
stressful episodes in life,

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.310
these tend to be long-term
stressful episodes,

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.340
your risk for major
depression goes way up.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.880
So whether or not you have
a genetic predisposition

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.080
to depression or not,

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.020
one of the best things you can do

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.540
to try and avoid getting depressed

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.520
is to learn to control your stress system,

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.910
to not go from short-term stress,

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.190
which everybody experiences,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.280
we all have short-term stressors,

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.440
to medium term stress to long-term stress,

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.820
and to not have too many
bouts of long-term stress

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.210
because that probability
of getting depressed

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.430
goes way, way up.

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.400
And this is something I've
seen over and over again,

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.930
not just in my scientific
career, but just throughout life.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.560
People in all sorts of
domains, young and old,

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.470
I've seen that people will go through

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.510
a very intense relationship, a breakup,

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.510
sometimes it's the staying
together that stressful,

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.920
sometimes it's a graduate
school that can be stressful,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.900
sometimes it's some other event.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.600
And then some months later
they become depressed.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.260
And that's because the stress system

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.290
is associated with the
release of cortisol.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.507
The cortisol system
can dramatically impact

00:46:21.507 --> 00:46:23.930
the way that these
different neuromodulators,

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.270
dopamine, norepinephrine
and serotonin function.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:30.470
And so there's this kind of
latent or longer lasting impact

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.000
on the systems that
impact mood and wellbeing.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.440
So learning how to control
your stress is really key.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.960
If you're not depressed or you're somebody

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.050
that has not lapsed into
a depression recently,

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:43.710
take control of your stress system.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.600
And we did an entire episode
on how to conquer stress,

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.920
and that involves dealing
with stress in the short term,

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.480
the medium term, and in the long-term.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.650
And there are a lot of
different ways to do that.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.640
One of the more important reasons

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.190
for learning how to counter stress

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.030
in order to offset depression

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.970
is that there is a genetic predisposition

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.570
that certain people carry
to become depressed.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.180
There are these studies now

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.290
of many, many thousands of individuals,

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:09.910
these were mainly done in New Zealand,

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.190
but these studies have
now been done elsewhere,

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:15.510
looking at many tens of
thousands of individuals

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.730
who carry particular copies of genes,

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.600
what they call polymorphisms,

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.840
in particular of a gene called 5HTTLPR,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.370
which is a serotonin transporter.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.910
So this is a gene that
controls or regulates

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.670
how much serotonin is
available in the brain.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:36.120
If you have this gene, this polymorphism,

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.490
it doesn't necessarily mean
that you will be depressed,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:43.340
but it greatly shifts your
susceptibility to depression

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.230
under conditions of stress.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:47.027
So I realize some people
are listening to this

00:47:47.027 --> 00:47:48.700
and some people are
watching it on YouTube.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.890
So I'm going to describe this in a way

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:52.010
that doesn't require
looking at any graphs.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:56.770
What I want you to imagine
is a very, shallow hill,

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.140
like a very mellow hill.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.720
It's just a ramp set at
about 10 or 15 degrees, okay.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.680
What we're plotting there in your mind

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.680
is that with each about of serious stress,

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:11.570
so that could be trying to finish a degree

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:15.020
or a relationship breakup, or
a family member that's sick,

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.770
or the loss of a loved one or a pet,

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.810
with each about of stress, the probability

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.100
that you will experience a
major depression goes up.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:28.100
However, if you carry this
gene, this HTTLPR gene,

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:33.410
the steepness of that
curve goes way, way up

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.080
where it's actually more like a line

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.520
such that you need far
fewer bouts of stress

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.420
in order to lapse into a
major depression, okay?

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:46.050
So if the typical person who
doesn't carry this polymorphism

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.870
has to experience two or
three or four or five bouts

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.970
of stress before they
lapse into a depression,

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:55.480
somebody with this gene is
susceptible to getting depression

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.240
after just one about or two
bouts of intense stress, okay?

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.200
So that's how these genes work.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.840
They don't preordain or
determine you to be depressed.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.470
They raise a susceptibility.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.070
And many genes,

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.630
many things related to
heritability in general,

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.140
work in that way.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.360
And we know there's a
strong genetic component

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.193
to depression.

00:49:16.193 --> 00:49:17.026
How do we know?

00:49:17.026 --> 00:49:21.100
Well, in what are called
concordant monozygotic twins.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.630
So these will be identical twins.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.810
And they can either be
in one biological sack

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:30.100
or two biological sacks while in utero,

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.840
what's called monochorionic
or dichorionic.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.650
Well, typically it's monochorionic.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:39.590
And identical twins, for
which one of those twins

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:41.070
goes on to have major depression,

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.470
there's a 50% probability
that the other one

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.630
will have major depression.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.180
So it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited,

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.910
it's not 100% generic, as you might say,

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:55.700
but there's a much higher
predisposition for depression.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.550
Whereas in fraternal
twins, that number drops,

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:02.660
and in siblings, that
number drops to about 25%,

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.410
and in half siblings, it's about 10%.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.150
The numbers vary from study to study,

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.260
but basically the more
closely related you are

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.080
to somebody who has major
depression, the more likely it is

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.550
that you will also get major depression.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.140
And therefore, if you haven't
gotten major depression,

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.640
the more likely it is
that you should take steps

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.690
to learn to mitigate stress

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.170
because stress is the major factor

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:27.360
that can trigger one of
these depressive episodes.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.360
So we've covered a lot
related to the stress

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.880
and the hormones and the
neurochemistry of depression.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.180
In fact, I think this is probably
the deepest I've ever gone

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.990
into the biology of any
topic on this podcast

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.730
before getting to any specific tools.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.670
I mentioned that learning
how to mitigate stress

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:46.503
and deal with stress,

00:50:46.503 --> 00:50:49.250
learning how to measure and
adjust your thyroid hormone,

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.500
those might be useful.

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.830
But next I'd like to turn
to some very specific tools

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:57.150
that people who both have depression

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:58.610
or who are prone to depression,

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.070
as well as people who
don't have depression

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.580
and simply want to maintain a good mood,

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.360
who want to maintain a positive affect

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.930
and pursuit of things in life,

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.370
what are the things that you can do?

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.007
It turns out there are
things that you can do

00:51:09.007 --> 00:51:11.930
and all of the biology that underlies

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.210
the utility of those things.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.460
Meaning the reasons those things work

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.100
will now make sense to you
because they adjust things

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.670
like serotonin and dopamine,

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.270
and they adjust them through
very specific pathways.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.900
I know for many people
learning about mechanism

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.810
is kind of grueling.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.880
I realized this podcast
isn't necessarily one

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.330
that you can listen to passively
while doing other things.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.800
Although I would hope
that you could do that

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.270
and still enjoy it and
extract the information.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.210
Why mechanism?

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.980
Mechanism is so key

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.950
because mechanism is a
little bit like understanding

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.600
some of the chemistry of cooking.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.870
If you read a recipe and
you can follow a recipe,

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:52.480
you often hear people say,
oh, I can follow a recipe.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.470
That means that if you have
every ingredient in that recipe,

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:56.303
you're good.

00:51:56.303 --> 00:51:59.750
You likely can make that
dish. You can make that meal.

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.360
However, if you understand a
little bit of the chemistry

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.860
of why salt has to be
added third and not first,

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.850
or why the heat has to be
adjusted at a particular time,

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:12.180
well then not only can
you follow a recipe,

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.710
but that also gives you flexibility

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.600
for when salt isn't available,

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.400
or when you want to adjust
the flavor of the dish,

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.500
or when you want to try a new dish,

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.690
or you want to get experimental.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.140
So when you understand mechanism,

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.830
it puts you in a tremendous place of power

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.540
to work with your system.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.910
So it's not just plug and chug,

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.710
like take 12 milligrams of this,

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.310
you either feel better or you don't.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:37.100
You can really start to
understand how prescription drugs,

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.530
supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:43.830
how those things weave
together to either work for you

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.370
or not work for you and get you to paths

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.220
of healthy mind and body.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.020
So let's think about
why any tool would work

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.560
to relieve depression.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.940
We've talked about how some of the drugs

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.300
that impact these different
chemical systems might work

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.260
and why they create some of
the problems they create.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.940
Problems are mainly created
by the fact that they impact

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.550
lots of systems in the brain and body.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.880
So you take a drug to increase serotonin,

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.270
but that serotonin is also
related, not just to mood,

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.510
but to things related
to libido and appetite.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:15.063
And so you start disrupting
multiple systems.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.000
The same could be said for
behavioral tools, right?

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.220
That any behavioral tool
that adjusts the levels

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.530
of a particular chemical ought to perhaps,

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:27.310
provide some relief for
some of the symptoms

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:28.750
of major depression.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.620
Let's take an example that
I've talked about before

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.690
on the podcast, which is,

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.670
if you get into a very cold
shower, you take an ice bath,

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.120
you will release
norepinephrine and epinephrine

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:38.953
in your brain and body.

00:53:38.953 --> 00:53:40.950
There's no question about that.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.070
I don't think anyone
can really escape that.

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:46.720
It's a kind of a universal
response to being in cold water.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.730
Well, if some aspects of depression

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.370
are related to low
levels of norepinephrine,

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:55.700
will taking cold showers
relieve your depression?

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.010
Perhaps it might even
relieve certain aspects

00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.960
of that depression.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.860
Is it a cure? Well, that's going
to depend on the individual.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.020
Will exercise help?

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.720
Well, if you go out for a run,

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.950
you're going to increase
the amount of norepinephrine

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:09.110
in your body.

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:12.410
If you enjoy that run, it's
likely that you'll increase

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:15.160
the levels of dopamine
and probably serotonin

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.880
in your brain and body as well.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.030
Will that cure your depression?

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.220
Well, there are a lot of studies exploring

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.060
how exercise can impact depression.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.980
And indeed, regular
exercise is known to be

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:28.033
a protective behavior against depression,

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.510
but it also can help relieve

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.520
some of the symptoms of depression.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.450
So you may ask yourself, why
would you need drugs at all?

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.550
Why would there be prescription drugs

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.610
or the need for
supplementation or other things

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.650
to alleviate the symptoms of depression?

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:44.930
Ah, well, that's the diabolical
nature of depression,

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:49.910
which is if people are far
enough along in this thing,

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:52.530
this sometimes called disease,
sometimes called disorder,

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:57.530
but major depression, oftentimes
they can't get the energy

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.850
to even get up and take
a bath or a shower.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.140
They have no motivation to do it,

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.200
they have no desire to go for a run.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.847
So you say, "Come on, let's
go, you'll feel better.

00:55:06.847 --> 00:55:08.887
"I know you feel better, it
generates all these chemicals

00:55:08.887 --> 00:55:11.967
"I heard on the whatever
podcast, Huberman Lab podcast,

00:55:11.967 --> 00:55:14.197
"or another podcast
that getting into action

00:55:14.197 --> 00:55:15.420
"does all these things."

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.690
And they just don't want to do it.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.210
And to you, a person who's
not experiencing depression,

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.070
that perhaps could just seem
like the most frustrating

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:23.700
and confusing thing in the world.

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.170
But it's very important to highlight

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.900
the fact that these circuits

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.090
that are accessible to some of us,

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.720
the circuits for happiness,
for pursuit of pleasure,

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.410
for exercise, for
getting in a cold shower,

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.620
if that's your thing,

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.990
that those circuits are
present in all people,

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:42.570
but for certain people

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.486
that are experiencing major depression

00:55:44.486 --> 00:55:47.010
and are really in the
depths of their depression,

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.650
they can't really access
those circuits in the same way

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:54.210
that people who are not
suffering from depression can.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:55.230
So I hope that makes it clear.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.400
It's not offering any excuses for them.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.470
And indeed, I think those
behaviors would help

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.420
jolt them out of some of the
symptomology of depression,

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:07.250
but they're just not
accessible to everybody.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.750
So let's talk about the
things that people can do

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.220
to deal with depression.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.100
And again, anytime you add a behavior

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.990
or a tool or a supplement,

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:19.960
or subtract a behavior, tool,
supplement, drug, et cetera,

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.720
you absolutely should
talk to your physician,

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.140
especially if you're somebody

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.220
that's dealing with major depression.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.890
I want to focus on the stress system.

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:29.860
And I'm not just going to tell you

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.210
to get sunlight in your eyes

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:32.440
and to get a good night's sleep,

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.980
although I think everybody should do that

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.680
on a regular basis, ideally every day,

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.000
talked about those ad
nauseum on this podcast.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.200
They will help your sleep,

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.710
they will help you alleviate stress.

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:43.360
I think you should have
tools to deal with stress

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.140
in real time, et cetera.

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.380
But let's look at depression
from the standpoint

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.480
of a deeper biological phenomenon,

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.540
which is inflammation
and the immune system.

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.410
There's growing evidence now

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.500
that many forms of major depression,

00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.500
if not all of them, relate
to excessive inflammation.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.130
Now inflammation plays an
important role in wound healing.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.620
It is a positive aspect
of our immune system.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:12.620
Our ability to combat wounds,
combat illnesses, et cetera,

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.680
but inflammation gone unchecked,

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.240
inflammation that lasts too long,

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.170
or is of too high amplitude,

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.450
meaning too many anti-inflammatory

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.100
or inflammatory cytokines
and things of that sort

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.970
in the body is bad.

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.580
And there's decent evidence
now that inflammation

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.380
can lead to or exacerbate depression.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.420
And that if we want to control depression,

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.780
or limit or eliminate depression,

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.230
that focusing on reducing inflammation

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:42.880
and its associated pathways
is a really good thing to do.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.980
And I think this is a really
good thing for everybody to do

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.220
regardless of whether or not
you suffer from depression

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.053
or not.

00:57:49.053 --> 00:57:52.180
And today we're going to talk
about exactly how depression

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.610
comes about through the
inflammation pathway.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:59.380
So, first of all, who
are the major players

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.670
in creating chronic inflammation
in the brain and body?

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:05.030
They are the inflammatory cytokines.

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.470
Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:11.720
things like Tumor
Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha,

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.380
things like C reactive protein, alright?

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.687
Not all of these are cytokines.

00:58:16.687 --> 00:58:19.280
You have interferons and prostoglandins

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.640
and a lot of these things.

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.640
But when we are stressed,
chronically stressed,

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.470
we get inflamed, our brain
and various locations

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.780
of the brain become inflamed
because certain classes

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.420
of cells, in particular,
those glial cells,

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.180
the cells that are typically thought

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.630
to just be support cells,

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.510
those cells and their biochemistry

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.020
and their dialogue with the neurons

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.623
of the brain and body
starts to become disrupted.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.140
I may have mentioned it
earlier, I don't recall.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.570
But I certainly mentioned
it in an earlier podcast

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:50.270
that adrenaline epinephrin,
when it's released in the body,

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:51.910
it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier,

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:53.510
but there are certain things

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:56.270
that are able to cross
the blood-brain barrier

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:57.103
when we are stressed.

00:58:57.103 --> 00:58:59.020
Things like the E2 prostoglandins,

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.140
those cross the blood brain barrier.

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.560
And our blood and our brain,

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.200
therefore our brain and
our body can communicate

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.430
because certain things can
pass through this barrier

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:11.280
we call the BBB or the
Blood Brain Barrier.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.440
And also we have something
called the glymphatic system,

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.740
which is really a plumbing system

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:15.880
that links the brain and body.

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.570
It's the link between the
immune system and the brain.

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:23.990
Well, there is a set of
actions that we can take

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:26.450
in order to limit inflammation.

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:27.640
And this has been shown

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.480
in several quality peer
reviewed studies now

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.650
to reduce inflammation
and to relieve some,

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.750
and in some cases, all of the
symptoms of major depression.

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:41.680
One of those approaches
is to increase our intake

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.483
of so-called EPAs or
Essential Fatty Acids.

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:49.240
There's now a very long list of papers

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.760
in quality peer review journals

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:53.690
showing that when people ingest

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:58.690
a certain level of EPA
omega-3 fatty acids,

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:03.820
the relief from depressive
symptoms matches the SSRIs.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.930
That's incredible, right?

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.410
That essential fatty acids

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:08.860
could relieve symptoms of depression,

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.820
as well as some of the
prescription antidepressants.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.910
Now, this doesn't
necessarily mean you run off

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.700
and stop taking your antidepressants

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.420
if you've been prescribed
them, please don't do that.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.700
Please talk to your physician.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.530
And I should mention that
some of the same studies

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.600
have shown that increasing our intake

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.010
of these essential fatty acids,

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:30.870
in particular, the EPA
variety of omega-3s,

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:35.720
can lower the effective
dose of things like SSRIs.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.300
Meaning if we required a 50
milligram or 40 milligram dose

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.870
of fluoxetine, that one
can get by on a lower dose

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:46.390
and thereby perhaps not experience as many

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:47.930
or as severe side effects

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.293
by taking or supplementing with EPAs.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:55.010
Now, the threshold level
seems to be about one gram,

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.180
1000 milligrams of EPA.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.360
So you will sometimes see
on a bottle of krill oil

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.010
or fish oil or any other
source, even plant source

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:08.870
or other source of EPA
that it's 1000 milligrams

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:10.400
or 1200 milligrams.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.170
But what's really important to look at

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:16.830
is whether or not there's more
than 1000 milligrams of EPA,

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.340
because the EPA in particular
is what's important here.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.310
And actually in exploring
some of the literature

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:26.150
on the effects of EPAs on
cardiovascular health, excuse me,

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.740
as well as their effects on depression,

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.020
there's some interesting
dose dependent responses,

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.040
such that people who took
anywhere from 400 milligrams

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.270
to 5,000 milligrams of EPAs,

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.560
achieved a variety of different benefits.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.300
And in some cases, some side effects,

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.450
we'll talk about those.

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.330
And it does seem that this 1000 milligrams

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.490
is the critical threshold for benefiting

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.760
or getting some relief
from depressive symptoms.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.400
But people who took two
grams seem to do better.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.720
And in the cardiovascular health realm,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.720
there it's a little more complicated.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.100
Some studies point to
a very positive effect

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.240
on cardiovascular health

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.193
by taking increasing amounts
of EPA, others, not so much.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.300
The current data point to the fact

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.920
that for every gram of
EPA that one ingest,

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.250
there's about a 9% improvement
in cardiovascular health,

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:21.776
the same dose dependent
improvement on psychological health

01:02:21.776 --> 01:02:25.630
in combating depression
can't really be stated.

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:28.250
I wouldn't say that the more EPA you take,

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:30.260
the better you're going
to feel so to speak.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.780
I don't think the data point to that.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.580
However, it does seem
that if you take a gram,

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.470
1000 milligrams or 2000 milligrams of EPA,

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:40.870
there does seem to be
some substantial relief

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:43.540
for many people, should
emphasize many, not all,

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.840
for many people in major
depressive symptoms.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.280
So how would this work?

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.063
Well, turns out that these
inflammatory cytokines,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.640
they impact neurons and
the circuits of the brain

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.390
that relate to things like serotonin,

01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:00.600
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.430
These inflammatory cytokines

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.410
act in a variety of different ways,

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.350
but they mainly act to inhibit
the release of serotonin,

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:12.040
norepinephrine, and dopamine,
or the synthesis of serotonin,

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.380
norepinephrine and dopamine.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.180
And I'll give you one example of how EPAs

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.100
can positively impact this process.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.900
And then it points to a second tool,

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.780
which is the proper
utilization of exercise

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:26.950
to offset the effects of depression.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.450
So now you should understand
why having healthy levels

01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:32.820
of serotonin is important
for maintaining healthy mood.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.890
It's not responsible for all the aspects

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.183
of having a healthy mood,

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.610
there's also dopamine and norepinephrine,

01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.840
but it is a very important one.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.033
Dopamine also called 5HT,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.600
essentially derives from a
precursor called tryptophan.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.470
Tryptophan arrives into our
system through our diet,

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:56.840
okay, tryptophan is an amino acid.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.670
Tryptophan is found in Turkey,
it's found in carbohydrates.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.070
And that should therefore raise the idea,

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.120
hmm, I wonder if one of
the reasons why people

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.770
who are depressed have such an appetite

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.400
for carbohydrate late in foods

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.250
is because they're trying
to get more tryptophan,

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.000
and therefore more serotonin.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.563
And indeed that's the case.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.860
Tryptophan is eventually
converted into serotonin.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.423
However, if there's excessive
amounts of inflammation,

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.747
these inflammatory
cytokines cause tryptophan

01:04:28.747 --> 01:04:31.670
to not be converted so
much into serotonin,

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.223
but to be diverted down
a different pathway.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.790
The pathway involves something
called IDO, Indoleamine,

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.803
which converts tryptophan into kynurenine.

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:46.040
Kynurenine actually acts as a neurotoxin

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:50.713
by way of converting into
something called quinolinic acid.

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.540
And quinolinic acid is pro depressive.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.960
So if that seems like a
complicated biochemical pathway,

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.260
what's basically happening
here is that the tryptophan

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.563
that normally would be
made into serotonin,

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:03.740
under conditions of
inflammation is being diverted

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.290
into a neurotoxic pathway.

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:08.070
And ingestion of EPAs,

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:11.180
because it limits these
inflammatory cytokines,

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.883
things like IL-6, C-reactive
protein, et cetera,

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.940
can cause more of the
tryptophan that one ingests

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.960
or has in their body to be diverted

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.833
towards the serotoninergic pathway.

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:30.030
Exercise, it turns out,
also has a positive effect

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:34.080
on the tryptophan to
serotonin conversion pathway.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.930
And the way it does it
is really interesting.

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.570
You now know that tryptophan
can either be converted

01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:41.330
into serotonin or it can be
converted into this neurotoxin,

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:42.483
which is a bad thing.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.310
Exercise, the activation of the muscles

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.920
through rhythmic repeated use,

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.060
in particular aerobic exercise,
but also resistance training

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.500
has been shown to do this to some extent,

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:58.360
tends to sequester or shuttle
the contouring into the muscle

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.350
so that it isn't converted
into this neurotoxin

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:03.930
that is pro depression, okay?

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.160
There are a lot of steps in the pathway

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.670
leading to depression,

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.150
but what this essentially means

01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:12.410
is that hitting a certain
threshold level of EPA intake,

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.530
whether by supplementation
with fish oil or krill oil

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:16.940
or through some plant source

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.760
if you're not into
ingesting fish or krill,

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.890
or trying to get up above
that 1000 milligram threshold

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.970
for EPA by ingesting
particular food sources,

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:27.080
you certainly can do it through food,

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.580
you don't have to supplement,

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.530
but it's easier to do with supplements,

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:33.660
that doing that will
limit the inflammation

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.800
that diverts tryptophan into
this neurotoxic pathway.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.800
And exercise as well, augments
this conversion of tryptophan

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:45.930
into serotonin because it takes this thing

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:49.920
that would potentially be a
neurotoxin and it sequesters it,

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.260
it pulls it away so that it can't actually

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.570
go have its pro depressive effects.

01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:57.040
So you've got multiple steps here.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.230
We're describing two tools,

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.560
increasing EPA and regular exercise

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.000
as a way of increasing serotonin,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.630
somewhat indirectly, right?

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.510
It's by limiting this bad pathway

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:10.250
to promote the activity of a good pathway.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.530
But from the data that are published

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:13.860
in Quality Peer Review journals,

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.760
it really appears that
this inflammation pathway

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.280
does function to increase
depression through these pathways.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.410
And so knowing that there
are behavioral steps

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:23.010
and supplementation based steps,

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:26.990
or if you prefer getting
your EPAs from typical food,

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:29.620
from nutritional approaches,

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.620
I find that very reassuring
that the mechanisms

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.400
all converge on a common
pathway, serotonin.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.930
That gives me great peace of
mind that when people say,

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.880
hey, go out for a run,

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.630
or you should get outdoors exercise,

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:45.570
or you should take fish oil
like the Scandinavians do,

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:49.880
I have Scandinavian family
members and they are known to,

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.320
or I should say they are
quite open about the fact

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.110
that during the winter
months in particular

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:55.960
when depression is more likely,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.450
but throughout the year, really,

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:01.980
they make an effort to regularly
ingest high levels of EPA,

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:06.220
either through ingesting
fatty fish and its skin,

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.690
I'm not a particular fan of ingesting

01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:08.580
the skin of fatty fish,

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.790
or by supplementing with Cod liver oil

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:12.500
or other types of fish oil, sardines,

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.590
and things of that sort, sardine oils.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.840
There are a number of
different things out there

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.270
that one could use.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:19.610
So I find it very reassuring

01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:21.710
that there's a common biochemical pathway

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.860
that can explain why these
things not just work,

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.550
but why they should work.

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:28.090
They should work because they operate

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:30.570
in the very same biochemical pathways

01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:34.730
that antidepressants that
are prescribed to people do.

01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:35.800
So what does this mean for you?

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.740
Well, if you're somebody who
suffers from major depression,

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.080
again, don't stop taking
your prescribed medication.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.913
Talk to your doctor,

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:46.913
but talk to them perhaps
about the EPAs and exercise

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.410
and how these things can impinge

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:50.190
on the same biochemical pathways.

01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:51.420
If you're somebody who is not suffering

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.710
from major depression, I
still think these pathways

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.550
are really important to understand.

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:59.900
And actually knowing these
pathways is additional motivation

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.150
to get regular exercise.

01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:02.590
I think we all know that
we should be getting

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.860
anywhere from 150 minutes
to 180 minutes per week

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.870
of so-called zone two cardio
for cardiovascular effects.

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.760
Zone two is the kind of melowish cardio

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.410
where you can sort of hold a
conversation if you needed to.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:14.350
But it's a little bit tough,

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.590
you're kind of sucking
for air a little bit.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:20.130
And that's going to limit
these depressive like symptoms,

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:20.990
I think in all of us.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.930
I don't think that we
should think of depression

01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:24.770
as a strict threshold.

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:27.250
I'm somebody who personally
has made the choice

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.770
to take 1000 milligrams of EPA per day.

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:33.070
I do that by supplementing fish oil.

01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:35.150
There's debate out there
as to whether or not

01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:39.900
it's better to take EPA
NDHA in particular ratios,

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.360
and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.300
which is the so-called bad cholesterol.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.010
That's getting really down into the weeds.

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:49.200
And we can talk about
that in a future episode.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.440
But for myself, I notice
a pretty substantial

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.400
positive effect of taking anywhere

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.490
from 1000 milligrams to 2000
milligrams of EPA per day.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:59.780
I do that through supplementation

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.120
and I do strive to try and eat some fish,

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.720
even though frankly, I've
never liked the taste of fish.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.770
For those of you that would
like a little more detail

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:10.380
or perhaps a lot more detail
into the effects of EPA

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.270
on depression and in
relieving depressive symptoms,

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.150
and if you want to get into
the nitty gritty of it,

01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:20.800
I invite you to go to examine.com,
put in depression, EPA,

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.900
they list off and have links to 28 studies

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.130
on the effects of EPA on major depression.

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:28.140
If you go to pub med,

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.240
there are many, many studies on this now

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.993
that date back several decades, really.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:39.310
If you're interested in the
specific effects of EPA,

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:41.170
as opposed to DHA,

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.460
I want to point you towards
a particular study entitled,

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.290
not surprisingly EPA, but not
DHA appears to be responsible

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:51.050
for the efficacy of omega-3
long chain polyunsaturated

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.230
fatty acids supplementation
and depression,

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:56.010
evidence from a meta analysis
of randomized control trials.

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:58.130
This is a really wonderful paper.

01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:02.270
The author is Julian
Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:04.800
It was published in 2009.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.150
We will provide a link to
this study in the caption.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.430
And that study is really
the one that at least to me,

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:15.130
points to why EPA in
particular is what's effective,

01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:19.300
and that whether or not
DHA is problematic or not

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:22.220
as a separate issue,
but it's really the EPA

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:25.200
that one wants to hit a
certain threshold level of

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.210
if one's goal is to get
relief from depression

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:31.630
or to keep depression at bay
by keeping mood elevated,

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:35.030
which is why I take a high-dose EPA.

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:37.270
So we've got EPA, we got exercise,

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:41.460
now you understand how
they work to adjust mood.

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.670
Now, I want to talk about
something that at least for me,

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:47.440
was quite surprising when
I first learned about it

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.440
for sake of treatment of mood disorders,

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.180
and that's creatine.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.930
Creatine has a number of
very important functions

01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:56.260
throughout the body.

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.660
For those of you that are
into resistance training,

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.720
and actually for those of you

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.840
that are into endurance training as well,

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.420
creatine has achieved a lot
of popularity in recent years

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.240
because supplementation with
creatine can draw more water

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.410
into muscles and can increase
power output from muscles.

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:18.340
So it's something that does indeed work.

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.520
There have been debates
about whether or not

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.020
it's unhealthy for the kidneys
to take long-term creatine,

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.540
supplementation at high doses.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.800
And I invite you to go
down that rabbit hole.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.340
I think most people now accept the idea

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.780
that for most people, not
all, but for most people,

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.750
low dose creatine
supplementation of anywhere

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.690
from one gram to five grams per day

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.420
can have a number of positive effects

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.400
on physical performance.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.040
People with kidney issues, et cetera,

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.310
need to be especially cautious,

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:47.010
but creatine is interesting
for that purpose.

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:50.580
However, there's also a
so-called phosphocreatine system

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:53.870
in the brain, and that
phosphocreatine system

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.167
has everything to do with
the dialogue between neurons

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:58.730
and these other cell types called, glial,

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.670
and glial comprise several cell types,

01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:04.320
microglia, astrocytes, et cetera,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.690
but the foster creatine system

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:09.210
in the forebrain in particular,
in the front of our brain,

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:13.560
has been shown to be involved
in regulation of mood

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.010
and some of the reward pathways
as well as in depression.

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:22.310
And there are now several
studies, at least three,

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:26.010
although they're probably more
by the time this comes out

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:28.000
because they're coming
out very quickly now,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.590
at least three quality
studies pointing to the fact

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:33.040
that creatine supplementation

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.350
doesn't just have these positive effects

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:36.330
on physical performance,

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:41.020
but can also be used as
a way to increase mood

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.123
and to improve the symptoms
of major depression.

01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:49.160
This has been now done
in several double blind

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.573
placebo controlled studies.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.060
The studies have looked at women,

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:57.530
have it looked at men,
have looked at adolescents,

01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:01.470
some of whom were taking
SSRIs, some of whom were not,

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:05.900
they've done magnetic
resonance spectroscopy.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.860
So spectroscopy is a way that you can look

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.230
at the concentrations of
particular in the brain

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.010
in real time in humans,

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:15.930
it can be used for other
things as well, of course.

01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:19.780
And basically what's been
observed is that increasing

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.770
the activity of the phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain

01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:25.280
can be beneficial or
at least is correlated

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.190
with improvements in mood.

01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.780
So let's just talk for a
moment about what's involved

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.430
with using or supplementing creatine

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:36.053
in order to improve mood and
perhaps even treat depression.

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.180
First of all, when I talk about creatine,

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:42.340
I'm talking about creatine monohydrate,

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.350
there are a number of
different forms of creatine.

01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:47.310
Here I'm talking about
creatine monohydrate.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:50.760
The American Journal
of Psychiatry in 2012,

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.300
published a study, which was a randomized,

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.810
double blind placebo controlled trial

01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:56.460
of oral creatine monohydrate.

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.470
And what it found is that it could augment

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.970
or enhance the response
to a selective serotonin

01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:03.570
re-uptake inhibitor,

01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:06.320
in particular, in women with
major depressive disorder.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.970
So like EPA, creatine supplementation

01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:13.780
seems to either lower the required dose

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.580
of SSRI that's required
to treat depression,

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:21.580
or can improve the effectiveness
of a given dose of SSRI.

01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:25.270
However, there are other studies
that have looked directly

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.970
at creating supplementation
in the absence of SSRIs.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:29.390
And those are interesting as well.

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:32.800
There's a wonderful and
very comprehensive review

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.810
on creatine for the
treatment of major depression

01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:39.147
that includes beautiful
tables of all the subjects

01:15:39.147 --> 01:15:40.600
and the dosages, et cetera.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.510
I'm not going to read off every line

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:46.200
and every column in that review,

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.700
but we will provide a link
to that review as well.

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:52.010
One of the things that's really striking

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.870
about the lists of
studies that they include

01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:58.130
is that most of them used dosages

01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:01.010
that are pretty reasonable
for most people,

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:04.810
anywhere from three grams to five grams,

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:09.003
sometimes up to as many 10
grams per day of creatine.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.560
Many of these also were shown to increase

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.060
activity of this phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain,

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.640
and some show a relationship

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.290
between that phosphocreatine system

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:24.530
and a particular category
of receptors in the brain

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:28.803
called the NMDA receptor,
N-methyl D-aspartate receptor.

01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:35.120
The NMDA receptor is
one of the first things

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.040
that every budding
neuroscientists learns about

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.210
because it is the receptor
that has particular electrical

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:46.660
and chemical properties
that make it a critical gate

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.000
for so-called neuroplasticity.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.483
So it's not a receptor that's
activated in the brain,

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.380
typically for just the
functioning of the brain

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.710
on a day-to-day basis.

01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:59.290
It's a receptor that's activated

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:01.950
when circuits are going to change,

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.830
when they are inspired to change

01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:07.480
by some very strong stimulus,
meaning some experience,

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.460
or in some cases a drug, or
in some cases something else.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.810
But the NMDA receptor
is a kind of a key node

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:17.380
for shifting brain circuitry.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.140
And so while the details
aren't entirely clear,

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:23.210
it seems that creatine supplementation

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:26.320
leads to increases in the
phosphocreatine system

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.710
in the forebrain.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:31.783
And that increases in the
activity of the forebrain

01:17:31.783 --> 01:17:34.350
phosphocreatine system relate to changes

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.980
in the way the NMDA receptors function

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.910
and may lead to some of the plasticity,

01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:41.540
the changes in neural
circuits that underlie

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.980
the shift from negative mood
and affect to positive mood.

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.430
Now, there are a lot of gaps.

01:17:47.326 --> 01:17:49.720
There are a lot of little
boxes or bins in the diagram

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.920
I just laid out for you.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.690
And some of them are still
truly black boxes, as we say,

01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:55.730
meaning, we don't really
know what's in them yet.

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:57.430
And more mechanistic data are coming.

01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:59.630
However, when you look over
the data in this review,

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:02.153
or when I look over the
data in this review,

01:18:02.153 --> 01:18:04.110
what you find is that
they're pretty striking

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:07.450
positive effects of creatine.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:10.230
And one of the more interesting effects

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:12.990
is that creatine has actually been shown

01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:17.990
to increase mania in people
that are already manic.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.770
And that's interesting,

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:22.050
we're not talking about
bipolar depression today,

01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:25.530
but it seems that creatine
elevates levels of activation

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:26.660
and kind of mood overall.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.190
And you could see why
that would be a problem

01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:29.990
for somebody that's
already in a manic phase,

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:32.560
but it actually might be
beneficial for somebody

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.250
who is very low affect
and has major depression.

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.220
So should you supplement with creatine?

01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:42.590
Well, as always, talk to
your healthcare provider,

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.810
but if you're somebody who
is thinking about things

01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:48.040
that you can do and
things that you can take

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.720
in order to improve your
mood, keep depression at bay,

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.720
maybe even support other
treatments for major depression.

01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:58.720
the creatine system
seems like a logical one.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.690
There's at least strong studies
and a good number of them

01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:04.800
to look to, to determine whether or not

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.280
that's right for you.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.550
I personally take five grams
of creatine for other reasons.

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:15.550
I take it for the physical
performance, enhancing effects,

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.740
but it's kind of nice
to think that perhaps

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.830
it's also helping me improve my mood.

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:21.170
That's a choice that I've made for me

01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:24.160
is in within the margins of
safety for me in my life.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.070
I don't know that it's
right for everybody,

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:27.900
but I find it very interesting.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.940
And again, I find it
particularly interesting

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:32.840
because there's a logical
biochemical pathway

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.240
to support the finding
that it improves mood

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.670
and can offset the effects
of major depression

01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:40.150
in some cases, or can improve the effects

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:44.050
of antidepressant
medication in many cases.

01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:47.300
When I see mechanism
and I see effectiveness,

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.630
and the mechanism and
the effectiveness map

01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:51.240
to a lot of the same mechanisms

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.770
that are involved in prescription drugs,

01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:55.240
that gives me great reassurance
that this isn't just

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.310
some sort of mysterious
pathway or mysterious compound

01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:01.610
by which a creatine might be working.

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:05.040
So now we've kind of
clustered together EPAs,

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.910
exercise, and their
relationship to inflammation,

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:11.400
creatine and its relationship
to forebrain function,

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.960
and the phosphocreatine
system, and this NMDA receptor.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.130
And as you'll see in a few minutes,

01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:20.580
that NMDA receptor turns
out to be vitally important

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.650
and is actually one of
the main nodes of action

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:26.180
for some of the more novel
and exciting therapeutics

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.850
that are being explored
now in psychiatric clinics.

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:33.230
So let's talk a little bit
more about this NMDA receptor

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:36.750
and how it relates to some
of the more experimental

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.170
or novel therapeutic
compounds for the treatment

01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:40.230
of major depression.

01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:43.660
And the compounds that we're
going to be talking about,

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.020
you may have heard of
before, one is ketamine,

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:50.670
which is getting increasing
interest in psychiatric clinics

01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:53.520
and in various experimental
and clinical studies,

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.870
and the other is PCP.

01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:59.980
Both ketamine and PCP
are known drugs of abuse.

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.580
For many years, people
have abused these drugs,

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.480
go by the street name,
special K, et cetera.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.890
And they create dissociative
anesthetic states.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:12.110
So dissociative states
where people don't feel

01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:16.663
as closely meshed with their
emotions and their perceptions.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.820
It's an odd state, I hear.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.090
And it's an odd state that clinicians

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:25.400
are now leveraging for the
treatment of depression.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.720
And we'll talk about why that is,

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.610
but let's talk a little bit
about this NMDA receptor

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:33.340
and why ketamine and PCP
might work for the treatment

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.883
of depression or how they even could work.

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:40.190
I want to be very direct
that this is an area

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:42.990
that still needs a lot of data.

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:44.940
There are however, some excellent papers

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:47.170
from really terrific groups.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:50.060
One of them is a paper that
was published in nature

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.150
last year, 2020.

01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:55.887
First author is Vesuna,
Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A,

01:21:55.887 --> 01:21:57.810
and the last author and
the lead on the study,

01:21:57.810 --> 01:22:00.850
who was Dr. Karl Deisseroth,

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:03.820
who was a guest on the
Huberman Lab podcast

01:22:04.692 --> 01:22:05.680
a few months ago.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.230
He's world expert in
neuroscience, he's a psychiatrist.

01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:14.210
And this paper from Sam
Vesuna and Karl and colleagues

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:17.140
explored how these
dissociative states come about.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:20.440
And they looked at this both
in animals and in humans

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.870
and found that there was a,

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.830
essentially a common mechanism

01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:27.400
whereby a particular layer of cortex,

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.520
so your brain has this
outer shell of tissue

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.210
that is called the neocortex.

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.390
It's where our perceptions lie,

01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:37.210
it's where our associations lie,

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:39.790
it's a very important area for processing

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:41.823
decision-making and planning, et cetera.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.027
It's literally stacks of cells,

01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:48.960
and one of those layers in the
stack of cells is layer five.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.980
And the layer five neurons in particular,

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:54.090
went into a particular rhythm
of electrical activity,

01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:59.090
this one to three Hertz
rhythm after mice or humans

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.423
were administered ketamine or PCP.

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:07.090
There was activation of a
particular area of the brain,

01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:10.590
this retro splenium cortex as it's called.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:14.180
And the dissociative state that emerged

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.900
was an interesting one.

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.190
And clinically what's
described in the trials

01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:21.530
for ketamine and things like it,

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:24.453
that people who are
depressed will take ketamine,

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.130
will experience a kind of separateness

01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:31.080
from their grief and from their emotions.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.700
And that possibly there's plasticity,

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.690
there actually shifts
in the neural circuitry,

01:23:35.690 --> 01:23:39.630
such that their emotions don't
weigh on them so heavily,

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.810
I'm using very loose language here,

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:45.680
but that they don't feel as over written

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.360
or as burdened by their own emotions

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.760
as they did previously
to the ketamine therapy.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.150
Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form

01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:55.170
am I suggesting that people
run out and take ketamine

01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:56.990
in order to treat their own depression.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:00.540
These drugs are still
very much experimental,

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.020
although they are approved
in certain contexts,

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.770
at least in the U S,

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:08.170
by prescription for the
treatment of depression.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.410
What's interesting to me is
that these dissociative states

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:18.300
sound at least at the outset
to be more of a separateness

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:20.160
from everything.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.400
It sounds a little bit
like depression itself.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.800
That's sort of like
anhedonia and an inability

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.350
to experience pleasure.

01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:30.550
And then one takes a
dissociative anesthetic

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:32.980
and somehow is able to get relief

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.040
by getting even further
away from an experience.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.650
To me, that doesn't make sense,

01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:40.547
but that just speaks to
the fact that these drugs

01:24:40.547 --> 01:24:43.670
and these receptors and these pathways

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:46.720
operate through very cryptic means.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.100
And we really don't understand
all the pathways in the brain

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.780
that relate to motivation
and mood and so forth.

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.540
And the results with these ketamine trials

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.640
are looking very promising.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.020
In fact, there are a number of trials

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:01.280
that show that a fair number
of people that take ketamine

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.330
in a therapeutic setting
legally with a psychiatrist

01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:05.970
guiding the experience

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:08.560
are able to get relief from their symptoms

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.113
without the need for many,
many treatments with the drug.

01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:14.690
Just how many treatments varies

01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:15.940
from individual to individual,

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:18.470
but it's not like people have
to take this stuff ongoing.

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:22.420
This is really an attempt to
tap into this NMDA receptor

01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:25.780
that is related to neuroplasticity.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:30.600
Both ketamine and PCP
essentially act as antagonists,

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.700
which means they block the NMDA receptor.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.730
They do it through different methods,

01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:38.850
non-competitive and competitive for you

01:25:38.850 --> 01:25:40.367
chemists and pharmacologists out there.

01:25:40.367 --> 01:25:42.330
You can look it up if you like.

01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:45.170
But what's therefore even more surprising

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:48.450
is that every neuroscientist
learns that activation

01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:50.410
of the NMDA receptor,

01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:53.690
not antagonism or blocking
of the NMDA receptor

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:56.490
leads to changes in neural
circuitry in very profound ways.

01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:57.940
In fact experimentally,

01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.230
and I've done these experiments myself,

01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:01.440
if you want to prevent plasticity,

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.710
you want to prevent an experience

01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:05.220
from reshaping neural circuitry,

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:08.070
you give an MDA receptor blocker.

01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:09.250
I've done that many times

01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:11.800
in the course of my experimental
neuroscience career,

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.920
not to myself, obviously,

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.973
but in the course of doing experiments.

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:21.330
So it's still a bit mysterious
to me how this could work.

01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:22.163
A couple things.

01:26:22.163 --> 01:26:26.750
One is this layer five
activation is pretty interesting.

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:28.310
We're going to come back to layer five

01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:31.130
when we talk about yet another emerging

01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:33.250
treatment for depression,
which has psilocybin,

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.763
so-called magic mushrooms,

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.980
and the effects of psilocybin
on layer five neurons

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.040
in the cortex.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.650
So there's a common theme emerging here,

01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:45.400
which is that layer five
activity in the cortex

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.260
may be important for rewiring
the brain in certain ways

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.260
that can lead to recovery
or to an alleviation

01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:56.453
of some of the symptoms
of major depression.

01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:59.460
So if this is sounding a
little bit vague to you,

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:03.420
it's because this is still
truly experimental and new,

01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.650
and still very much on the cutting edge

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:06.980
of what's happening now.

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.480
We don't have all the answers.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.580
So if it sounds like I'm
moving slowly through this,

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.579
and I'm being extra
careful about what I say,

01:27:12.579 --> 01:27:14.430
you are correct.

01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:18.013
Your antenna are correct in this case.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.800
I never want to misstep and
say something that's not true,

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.010
but that's especially the case

01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:26.280
when we're talking about
experimental therapies and drugs,

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.260
which formerly were
taken as drugs of abuse,

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.870
which are now being used as
drugs for therapeutic treatment

01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:31.703
in the clinic.

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.890
There is a very interesting study.

01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:38.670
This was published in science in 2019.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:41.160
So these are very recent studies.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.480
The last author on this
is Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.897
The title of the paper is

01:27:45.897 --> 01:27:49.297
"Sustained Rescue of
Prefrontal Circuit Dysfunction

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:52.220
"by Antidepressant
Induced Spine Formation."

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:54.210
And here, when we hear spine,

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:57.400
we're not referring to
spine as in your vertebrae,

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.067
running down your spinal column,

01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:01.130
we're talking about the spines,

01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:04.230
which are these little
protrusions on neurons.

01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:07.410
Neurons are not smooth by any stretch.

01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:10.500
If you zoom in on a neuron,
if you were to come to my lab

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.170
and look down the microscope
at a neuron and zoom in on it,

01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:14.480
you'd find that some neurons are smooth,

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.390
but most neurons have
these little protrusions.

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:18.440
And those little protrusions
are called spines.

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:22.030
And those little spiny
protrusions are little sites

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.940
where neurons can reach
out and form and receive

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.790
new synapses from neighboring neurons.

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:29.920
So they increase the
surface area of a neuron

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.000
and allow new connections to be formed.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.390
And so spine formation is
synonymous with neuroplasticity,

01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:38.850
which is synonymous with
changes in circuit function,

01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:42.570
which is synonymous with changes
in the ways that we think,

01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:45.190
we feel, and we behave.

01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:47.960
And what was shown in the
study is really interesting.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.900
What they showed is that ketamine

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.440
can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.950
by changing or increasing in this case,

01:28:56.950 --> 01:29:00.700
the spines on these neurons
in the prefrontal cortex.

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.780
And if that word prefrontal rings a bell,

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.903
well, now you remember the
phosphocreatine system,

01:29:05.903 --> 01:29:10.660
the ingestion of creatine
monohydrate, and the forebrain,

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:14.060
activation of the
forebrain were related to,

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:17.360
in some way or another,
to relief or improvement

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.430
of major depressive symptoms.

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:21.850
So we're starting to
converge on a picture here

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:24.453
whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:27.410
used in a therapeutic context,

01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:30.580
may be increasing neuroplasticity.

01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:33.680
Literally the changing of
neurocircuits in the forebrain

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.590
somehow through dissociative states.

01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:38.690
And I don't want to speculate too much

01:29:38.690 --> 01:29:40.640
about how that might come about,

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.760
but one of the things
that's such a resounding

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.650
or repeating theme of major depression

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:50.110
is that when you talk to somebody
who has major depression,

01:29:50.110 --> 01:29:52.040
it is a real downer.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.230
And I'm not being
disparaging of those people.

01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:55.420
But if you've ever had a conversation

01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.010
with someone who's depressed,

01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:59.230
they're always talking about
how exhausted they are,

01:29:59.230 --> 01:30:01.180
or in really severe cases,

01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.860
they are not even responsive at all.

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:06.530
They just kind of stare at you
blankly, or they fall asleep.

01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:08.190
I mean, they're truly depressed.

01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:12.170
Their system is lowered in
terms of its activation state.

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:16.750
So I think that it's
interesting that the application

01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:20.720
of drugs that allow people
to separate from that state

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.600
of not caring or being
uninterested or unwilling

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.720
to do anything is actually
one of the paths to treatment.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:29.300
It's not always about
just getting people peppy

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.470
and excited and happy.

01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:32.950
There also seems to be requirement

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:36.390
for getting them distanced
from their own grief.

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:38.730
And this brings us back to
something that we talked about

01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:40.890
way back at the beginning of this episode,

01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:43.970
which was this particular feature

01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:46.810
of the anti self confabulation,

01:30:46.810 --> 01:30:49.350
that everything that
happens is a reflection

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:50.980
that I should say for
the depressed person,

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.790
that everything that
happens is a reflection

01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:54.990
of how life is bad and their experiences

01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:58.140
just point to the fact that
nothing is going to get better.

01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.140
This is the common language of depression.

01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:03.170
If this is very depressing
to hear me talk about it,

01:31:03.170 --> 01:31:04.090
it is heavy.

01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:06.370
And that's what it's like
to hear these things,

01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:07.470
it's even heavier, of course,

01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:09.510
for somebody to experience them.

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:14.510
And those beliefs, those
patterns of guilt and grief

01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:18.890
and anhedonia and delusional
anti self confabulation,

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.530
those are the things that eventually,

01:31:20.530 --> 01:31:22.170
if they get severe enough,

01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:26.220
start to convert into things
like self harm mutilation,

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:29.610
and in the most tragic of
cases, of course, suicide.

01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:33.460
And so I think we can
look to these treatments

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.700
such as ketamine and PCP,

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:38.670
but in particular ketamine
and its use in the clinic,

01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:42.700
as ways for people to get
distanced from the negative affect

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:46.640
that they feel isn't just
inside them or overwhelms them,

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:49.330
but that for the very
severely depressed person,

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.460
they feel is them.

01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:54.100
And we hear this sometimes,
you are not your emotions.

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.650
That's a statement that I've
always been a little bit

01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:56.483
challenged by.

01:31:56.483 --> 01:32:01.170
I mean, yes, indeed
emotions are not who we are.

01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:03.150
They are states that
we go into and out of,

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.990
including happiness and sadness,

01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:08.980
but they are very much a part
of us when we experience them.

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.250
We don't experience them
as next to us or behind us

01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:12.880
or across the room from us.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.940
We experienced them as our emotions.

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:18.650
They are so much part and
parcel with our experience

01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:22.350
of ourself that a statement
like we aren't our emotions

01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:24.160
is a very hard statement to digest,

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.060
especially for the depressed person.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:30.110
And so I think that the NMDA
receptor and its capacity

01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:32.520
to induce neuroplasticity,
circuit changes,

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.860
the fact that PCP and
ketamine are both showing

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:38.700
activation of neural circuits
by way of suppressing

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.190
activity of the NMDA receptor,

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:43.470
and some of the positive or
exciting therapeutic outcomes

01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:45.790
that are coming from this
really point to the fact

01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:50.790
that ketamine and PCP and
removal of negative experiences

01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:53.710
or the experience of
a negative experience,

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:55.120
sort of getting meta there.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.950
But the experience of
a negative experience

01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:59.840
may be an important path by which people

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.660
treat their depression, especially
in its most severe forms

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.980
where people are veering
towards self-harm, mutilation,

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.530
and suicide.

01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:08.900
So you may have noticed a theme,

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.120
which is that certain
categories of approaches

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.740
that we've been discussing for offsetting

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:16.500
the symptoms of depression,
such as exercise,

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.830
ingesting EPAs, reducing inflammation,

01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:22.723
or even the SSRIs for
increasing serotonin,

01:33:23.850 --> 01:33:27.470
focus on changing some
core biological function,

01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:29.740
like raising the amount
of a chemical, serotonin,

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:33.410
or reducing the amount
of inflammatory cytokines

01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:34.513
in the brain and body.

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:38.270
And yet things like ketamine

01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:40.760
focus more on rewiring circuitry,

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.980
changing neural circuitry
so that it functions better

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.420
in the immediate and hopefully
in the long-term as well,

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.080
and keep people with major depression

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.150
in what they call, remission,
away from major depression.

01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:53.820
Another category of treatments

01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:57.080
that's being actively
explored now in laboratories

01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.820
and in the psychiatry
realm are the psychedelics.

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.853
And that's a huge category of compounds.

01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:06.650
However, one in particular,

01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:09.860
psilocybin is one that's
being most intensely

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.070
and actively pursued for its capacity

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:14.270
to treat major depressive disorder.

01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:16.310
I want to be very clear that the work

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:18.900
that I'm going to describe
as work that's being done

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.870
in university settings,
university hospitals,

01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:25.860
by scientists and psychiatrists,

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.270
and these are clinical
studies, clinical trials,

01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:30.380
leading to peer reviewed data.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.260
And those are the data
that we'll be discussing.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.520
Some of the major luminaries
in this area include,

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.211
of course aren't limited to,

01:34:38.211 --> 01:34:39.044
but include people like Matthew Johnson

01:34:39.044 --> 01:34:40.350
who's at Johns Hopkins.

01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:42.920
We'll discuss some of his
work now, and fortunate to say

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.980
that he will be coming
on the podcast as a guest

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.350
to just scribe the studies
in a variety of laboratories,

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:52.740
working on a variety of
different psychedelic compounds,

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.700
but let's focus on
psilocybin for its capacity

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:59.323
to rewire neural circuits
and alleviate depression.

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.540
There have been anecdotal data
or evidence over the years

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.730
that psilocybin has this capacity,
how does psilocybin work?

01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:11.630
Well, psilocybin, magic mushrooms,
as it's sometimes called,

01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:15.337
mainly works on what's called
the serotonin 5H2A receptor

01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:20.020
with some affinity for the 5HT1 receptor.

01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:20.853
What does that mean?

01:35:20.853 --> 01:35:22.260
Well, basically, you've
got a lot of different

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.640
kinds of serotonin
receptors just as you have

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.510
a lot of different kinds
of dopamine receptors

01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:28.240
or other types of receptors.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.330
The advantage of having
different receptors

01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:33.040
expressed in different
parts of the brain and body,

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.570
even on different parts
of individual cells

01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:38.670
in the brain and body is that
the same compound, serotonin,

01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:40.970
can have a diverse set of effects

01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:42.580
on different cells and tissues.

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.720
This is also the basis of some
of the side effect profiles

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.060
of SSRIs, because maybe for instance,

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.540
we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.080
will increase serotonin in one area,

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.320
but also in another area.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.540
And then they will go have diverse effects

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.820
on different brain circuits

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.900
because of the variety of receptors.

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.880
Receptors are just like parking slots

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.060
where the molecule serotonin parks

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.540
and has different effects.

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:09.980
Well psilocybin engages

01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:12.810
or increases serotonin transmission,

01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:15.450
meaning it increases
the amount of serotonin,

01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:19.030
mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors,

01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:21.230
but where in the brain does it happen

01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:22.460
and what are the major effects?

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.890
First, let's talk about the major effects

01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:26.150
'cause I think that's what
people are interested in.

01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:29.950
The study that I'd like to
highlight is a fairly recent one.

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:33.780
It was published in may of 2021 in Journal

01:36:34.842 --> 01:36:37.280
of the American Medical
Association Psychiatry,

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.287
so JAMA Psychiatry, and it's entitled,

01:36:40.287 --> 01:36:42.407
"Effects of Psilocybin Assisted Therapy

01:36:42.407 --> 01:36:45.850
"on Major Depressive Disorder,
a Randomized Clinical Trial."

01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:49.090
It's an absolutely beautiful
study, a very important study.

01:36:49.090 --> 01:36:51.140
It includes some of the
luminaries in this area

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.670
like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan,

01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:55.360
Roland Griffiths, and others.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.210
We will provide a link to this study.

01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:02.120
It is available in its
full form at zero cost

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:02.953
if you want to read it.

01:37:02.953 --> 01:37:03.840
It's got a lot of detail.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.410
So I'm just going to
summarize a few things,

01:37:05.410 --> 01:37:09.510
but basically what they did
was they screened for patients

01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:10.430
to come into the clinic.

01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:11.460
These were people that suffered

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.870
from major depressive disorder,

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:18.870
and administered either one
or two rounds of psilocybin.

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.660
They used particular dosages
that are listed in the study.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:24.020
So you can look it up if
you're really interested

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.710
in that level of detail.

01:37:25.710 --> 01:37:29.290
Typically it was 20 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight.

01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:30.830
So it depends on body weight.

01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:35.390
Or 30 milligrams of
psilocybin per 70 kilograms

01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:36.960
of body weight.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.140
They were given in capsule form.

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:39.640
So people weren't eating the mushrooms.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.440
This is obviously a very controlled study

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.230
and they wanted to control
the dosages appropriately.

01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:48.650
They were randomized to begin
the treatment immediately

01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:50.800
or after an eight week delay.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.480
They had all the
appropriate control groups

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.010
that one would like to see.

01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:56.430
What's really striking this study

01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:00.760
is that there was a very
significant improvement

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:04.370
in mood and affect and relief
from depressive symptoms

01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:09.210
in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people

01:38:09.210 --> 01:38:12.480
that were subjects in
the study who received

01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:16.170
the psilocybin treatment.

01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:19.070
And whether or not it was 50
or whether or not it was 71%,

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.110
varied according to how
long after the study

01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:25.420
they maintain these
antidepressive effects,

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.700
whether or not they stayed in
remission from the depression,

01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.847
but these are really enormous
insignificant effects,

01:38:30.847 --> 01:38:35.670
and very exciting and are
pointing in the direction

01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:39.670
of psilocybin very soon,
becoming a treatment

01:38:39.670 --> 01:38:43.840
for various forms of depression,
including major depression.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.080
Now, of course, this is
limited to the laboratory

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.210
at present.

01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:50.180
There are a number of
elements of these studies

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.020
that are important to take
into consideration too,

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:55.380
which is that there are
highly trained guides,

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.650
meaning people to direct
people through the experience.

01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:00.710
As Matthew Johnson has told me,

01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:03.640
there is the occurrence from time to time

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.410
of people having so-called bad trips

01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:08.000
of having anxiety attacks
during the hallucinations

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:08.833
and all that.

01:39:08.833 --> 01:39:10.980
And they have ways to mitigate
that and deal with that

01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.810
because the guides are trained.

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:16.730
They have all the sorts of
medical monitoring devices

01:39:16.730 --> 01:39:18.300
for heart rate and temperature and things

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.010
that one would like to
see for a study like this,

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:24.330
because these are very powerful compounds.

01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.830
I don't want to give away any
elements of the discussion

01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:28.310
with Matthew Johnson,

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:30.470
because it will be
released in podcast form

01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:33.800
reasonably soon here,
the Huberman Lab podcast.

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.580
But one of the things that came up

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:37.180
and is a fundamental question that I had,

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.880
that I think probably
many of you are asking,

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.820
is does the experience that
one has on these compounds

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.500
make a difference for whether
or not somebody gains relief

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:50.800
from depression, from these
psilocybin journeys or not?

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.820
In other words, does it
matter what they talk about?

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.950
Does it matter what they think about?

01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:56.020
Does it matter if they have
a good trip or a bad trip?

01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.740
And I don't want to hold
you in too much suspense,

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.990
I'll let Matthew provide
the more thorough answer.

01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:02.650
But what's really interesting

01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:07.650
is there are some common themes
to psilocybin administration

01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:11.460
and experience that lead to
relief from depressive symptoms,

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:16.460
but they are subjectively very varied,

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.520
meaning that whether or not people feel

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.570
they had a good experience
or a bad experience,

01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:24.650
whether or not people
thought about their parents

01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:27.470
or thought about the color of the ceiling,

01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:30.170
doesn't seem to have too much of an impact

01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:32.840
on whether or not they receive relief

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.323
during these studies in
these clinical studies.

01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:38.900
It seems like different people can have

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:42.810
lots of different experiences
and still receive benefit.

01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:45.470
And that points to something deeper.

01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:48.200
It points to the fact that these drugs,

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:49.830
which is really what they are,

01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:53.830
are rewiring neural
circuitry in a common way

01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:57.030
despite a diversity of
experience while on the drug.

01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:58.750
And that itself is really interesting.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:01.150
And it takes us back to a
place that we've been before

01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:04.110
in this discussion, which
is layer five of the cortex.

01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:06.560
This area that ketamine
seems to impact as well

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.223
by generating rhythms of the,

01:41:08.223 --> 01:41:10.210
I mentioned one to three Hertz activity

01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:13.290
in layer five of certain
areas of the cortex.

01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:17.520
Well, the 5HT1A receptor
is known to be enriched

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.850
in layer five of the cortex,

01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:23.570
and layer five of the cortex
is a very interesting area

01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:25.130
because it's an area in which

01:41:25.130 --> 01:41:27.340
there's a lot of lateral connectivity.

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:30.680
So connections between
different brain areas laterally,

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:34.600
generally is what allows us
to merge different senses.

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.050
So for instance, when we
hear a sound off to our right

01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:39.240
over here, we turn to our right.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.050
There's a very hardwired response.

01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:42.720
And typically we hear
something off to our right,

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.190
we don't look to our left.

01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:46.750
That's how hardwired some
of these circuits are.

01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:49.370
What appears to be happening
is that the activation

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:53.630
of the serotonin system and
5HT1A receptor in layer five

01:41:53.630 --> 01:41:57.490
is offering up or providing an experience

01:41:57.490 --> 01:42:01.300
whereby the lateral
connections are able to engage

01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.880
much more broadly than
they would normally.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:07.120
Now that also could be a bad thing.

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.530
And I asked Matt about this,
that sounds kind of spooky.

01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:12.660
I don't know that when I hear
something off to my right,

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:13.950
that I want to look off to my left.

01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:15.490
That could be highly maladaptive,

01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:18.500
especially if it's a car
coming at me from my right.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.030
That doesn't seem to be what's happening.

01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:24.080
It's not really rewiring these
deeply reflexive circuits.

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.720
It's somehow rewiring
associations between events,

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:30.280
emotional events, past
events, current events,

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:33.140
and future events in
ways that allow people

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:35.750
to get some sort of relief or distance

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:39.180
from these narratives,
these depressive stories

01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:41.500
about their past and
present and allow them

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.373
to see new opportunity and
optimism in the future.

01:42:44.373 --> 01:42:47.020
It's really a fascinating thing

01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:48.440
if you really think about it,

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.510
because I would have thought

01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:53.910
that simply by ramping up
laterality of connections,

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:56.100
meaning that cross associations,

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:59.680
that things could either
be rewired randomly

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.300
in ways that don't serve us,

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.900
or would perhaps just
cause no effect at all.

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:06.520
So it's either going to be bad or neutral,

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.730
but that's not really the
way things are turning out.

01:43:08.730 --> 01:43:10.640
Again, these are highly
controlled studies.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.210
I do want to emphasize
that ketamine, psilocybin,

01:43:13.210 --> 01:43:14.780
these things are still illegal.

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.500
Most all places.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.190
There are some regions and
cities in the United States

01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:21.470
where they are locally decriminalized,

01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:22.600
but they are not legal.

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.560
They're still illegal.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.550
So what we're referring to here
are indeed clinical studies

01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:29.810
in which people are taking them legally.

01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:32.940
I think it's very likely
we will see a shift

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.420
in the legislature around psychedelics,

01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.720
and in particular, psilocybin
in the not too distant future.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.190
And I think that for
now, what we should know

01:43:43.190 --> 01:43:47.113
is what Matt told me and what
you'll hear far more about,

01:43:48.190 --> 01:43:52.690
which is that psilocybin.
this one where in most cases,

01:43:52.690 --> 01:43:55.970
two dose treatments done in
a highly clinical setting,

01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:58.560
controlled setting with patients

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.610
that are carefully
selected, can in many cases,

01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:05.310
the majority of people
receive and maintain relief

01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:07.160
from their depressive symptoms,

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.540
simply through the experience
of this psychedelic journey.

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.603
I did ask them about micro dosing.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.008
I made it sound as if I'd
never heard about it before.

01:44:17.008 --> 01:44:18.940
Microdosing, not micro dosing.

01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:22.700
Microdosing, and his
answer was interesting.

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:25.520
His answer was that
the microdosing effects

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.603
don't seem to be nearly as
impactful as some of these,

01:44:29.850 --> 01:44:31.350
well, let's just call them what they are.

01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:34.530
These kind of high amplitude sessions

01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:37.860
that there are just one or two,

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:40.780
there are some studies ongoing
where there's more than two,

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:43.180
but that the microdosing
doesn't seem to compare

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:47.660
to these macrodosing, I
mentioned the dosages before,

01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:49.670
this 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms

01:44:49.670 --> 01:44:53.159
or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages

01:44:53.159 --> 01:44:56.010
given several weeks apart.

01:44:56.010 --> 01:44:58.270
So you'll hear more about microdosing

01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:00.480
and other psychedelics and their impact

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.230
on depressive states and major depression

01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:05.690
in the episode with Matt.

01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:08.270
But for the time being, it
really seems as if, again,

01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:09.620
we're looking at neuroplasticity,

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:11.080
we're coming back to layer five,

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:13.100
just like with ketamine and PCP.

01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.370
We're hearing about layer five,

01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:15.980
we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry,

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:18.610
we're hearing about a
dissociation or a distancing

01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:23.300
of oneself from these
negative moods and affects

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.880
and narratives, but
there's a key distinction

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.170
between the ketamine work
and the psilocybin work,

01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:31.550
which is that in the ketamine work,

01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.610
it really is about
dissociating from experience

01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:36.850
during the session with the psychiatrist,

01:45:36.850 --> 01:45:38.790
whereas during the psilocybin journey,

01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:41.770
it's really about immersing
oneself in the experience

01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:43.890
and being fully present
to that experience.

01:45:43.890 --> 01:45:45.750
That does seem to be
an important component

01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:47.490
and what the difference is there

01:45:47.490 --> 01:45:50.600
and why they both seem
to provide some relief

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.480
from major depression isn't clear.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.430
I think most likely it
takes us back to the fact

01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:59.290
that this thing we call major depression

01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:03.530
clearly involves serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.190
And in some individuals,
they may be more deficient

01:46:06.190 --> 01:46:08.650
in one or several of
those or all of those,

01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:09.780
whereas in other individuals,

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.230
it might be a different
collection of chemicals.

01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:14.410
And of course there
are a tremendous number

01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:18.620
of other psychedelic compounds
that people are exploring

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:21.270
for treatment of major depression.

01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:22.650
But really psilocybin is the one

01:46:22.650 --> 01:46:24.590
that we have the most data on.

01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:29.100
MDMA has mainly been explored
in the clinical realm

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.300
for treatment of trauma.

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:34.470
There are some trials ongoing
for treatment of depression,

01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:38.200
but the big breakthrough
seemed to be happening

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.440
in the realm of trauma treatment,

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.520
the so-called maps
group that's doing this,

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.890
again, legally in a clinical setting.

01:46:44.890 --> 01:46:45.890
And there are other groups

01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:47.310
that are starting to do it as well.

01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:50.557
We are going to do an
entire podcast about MDMA

01:46:50.557 --> 01:46:52.240
and some related compounds.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.610
So I'll save that discussion for then.

01:46:54.610 --> 01:46:57.370
One of the most common
questions I get for this podcast

01:46:57.370 --> 01:47:00.760
is about different
diets, different regimes,

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.377
different nutritional
plans, things like keto,

01:47:03.377 --> 01:47:08.040
ketogenic diet, or vegan
diets, or intermittent fasting,

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.790
or the all meat diet, the
so-called lion diet, et cetera.

01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:14.410
There are actually really interesting data

01:47:14.410 --> 01:47:18.760
relating nutrition and diet
to major depressive disorder.

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.690
And I think we just need to frame this

01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:23.600
by returning to something
that was said earlier,

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.720
which is that the
ingestion of carbohydrates,

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:29.680
in particular carbohydrates
and some meats like turkey,

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.680
that are rich in tryptophan,
this precursor to serotonin,

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.680
are in many ways the
self-medicating version

01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:41.750
of depression treatment.

01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:43.180
Now, to be clear, I'm not saying

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:46.140
that people should use food
to medicate their depression.

01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:48.350
Many people do that reflexively however,

01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:50.270
they reach for carbohydrate rich foods

01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:53.790
to blunt their cortisol, because
that's indeed what it does.

01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:56.120
It blunts cortisol when you
ingest high carbohydrate foods,

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.750
in particular starchy foods,

01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:00.840
and it does increase serotonin,

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.810
in particular, if those
foods rather are rich

01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:06.940
in the amino acid tryptophan.

01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.360
Now ingesting food is wonderful
and important and great,

01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.420
but ingesting excessive
foods of any kinds,

01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:16.470
carbohydrate or otherwise
it's not healthy, of course.

01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:19.240
There have been some explorations

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.050
of whether or not a vegan diet can improve

01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:23.150
symptoms of depression.

01:48:23.150 --> 01:48:25.500
Not a lot of data, not impressive data.

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.750
There have been very
few controlled studies

01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:31.140
looking at the carnivore or all meat diet.

01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.740
On that, I think there are now some

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.060
that are starting to spin up,

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:35.580
meaning those studies
are starting to spin up.

01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:39.170
However, the ketogenic
diet has been explored

01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:44.000
for its ability to relieve
certain symptoms of depression,

01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:49.461
in particular to what's
called maintain euthymia.

01:48:49.461 --> 01:48:51.850
Euthymia is the kind
of state of equilibrium

01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:55.060
between a manic episode
and a depressive episode

01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:56.380
in a manic bipolar person.

01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:58.250
We'll return to this
more in a future episode,

01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:01.890
but it basically, maniacs
have highs and they have lows,

01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:04.360
bipolars, either cycle back
and forth really quickly.

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.400
So rapid cycling bipolars
or slow, some people

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.250
So really quickly can be day to day,

01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:11.160
other people it's month
to month or week to week,

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.490
they're going highs and lows.

01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:16.090
And you hear about mania and
you hear about dysphoria,

01:49:16.090 --> 01:49:19.200
euthymia is that kind
of place in the middle

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.890
where people feel neither
too high nor too low.

01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:25.210
And there are some interesting studies

01:49:25.210 --> 01:49:28.450
looking at the ketogenic
diet for maintaining euthymia

01:49:28.450 --> 01:49:29.740
in manic depressives,

01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:32.570
but also in people with
major depressive disorder.

01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:33.630
Why would this work?

01:49:33.630 --> 01:49:36.630
Well, we have to remember
that the ketogenic diet

01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:41.460
wasn't discovered so that
self appointed nutrition gurus

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:44.410
could talk about it
online or so that people

01:49:44.410 --> 01:49:48.050
could make money selling
anything related to ketosis.

01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:49.970
And here I'm not disparaging
of the ketogenic diet.

01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:50.803
It's helped a lot of people.

01:49:50.803 --> 01:49:53.640
The ketogenic diet was actually shown

01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.640
to be medically relevant for
its use to treat epilepsy.

01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:02.840
It turns out that in epilepsy,

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.330
or in particular pediatric epilepsy,

01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:09.620
that a ketogenic diet and
the shift of brain metabolism

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.870
to predominantly one in which
ketones are being metabolized

01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:17.720
rather than more standard
glucose tight metabolism,

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.820
can greatly reduce the
number of epileptic seizures

01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:22.780
that these children experience.

01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:24.357
It's not always the case,
but it's often the case.

01:50:24.357 --> 01:50:27.360
And so you talk to a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.350
who's specialized in epilepsy,

01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:34.087
in particular pediatric epilepsy,
and they'll tell you this,

01:50:34.087 --> 01:50:36.817
"Oh yeah, the ketogenic
diet, in many cases, not all,

01:50:36.817 --> 01:50:38.780
"can be very effective
for this treatment."

01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:40.000
How?

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.640
How is it that a ketogenic
diet reduces seizures?

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.420
Well, the way it reduces seizures

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.980
is by increasing what's
called GABA transmission.

01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:54.300
GABA is a substance that is
naturally released in our brain.

01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.400
It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter,

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.010
meaning that when it's
released into the synapse,

01:50:59.010 --> 01:51:01.760
it has the tendency to reduce the firing,

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:04.760
to reduce the electrical
activity of the next neuron

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.023
or sets of neurons.

01:51:06.970 --> 01:51:09.550
There are various compounds
that increase GABA,

01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:10.960
in particular, GABA in the forebrain.

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:14.570
One common example would
be something like alcohol,

01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:16.960
drinking alcoholic drink or two

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.990
will increase GABA transmission,

01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:23.010
ironically will lower
your social inhibitions

01:51:23.010 --> 01:51:26.010
by increasing your
neurochemical inhibition.

01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:30.060
It basically suppresses the
self-monitoring pathways.

01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:31.030
And if people drink enough,

01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:32.247
it will suppress all pathways

01:51:32.247 --> 01:51:34.880
and people will urinate
themselves and fall over.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:37.520
It will eventually inhibit
all sorts of pathways.

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:41.270
So the GABA system has
a rich array of effects

01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:42.960
all over the brain and body.

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:47.190
But alcohol tends to
activate the release of GABA.

01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:49.550
You might say, well then
why not just take alcohol

01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:50.383
to suppress seizures?

01:51:50.383 --> 01:51:51.530
Well, that be a terrible idea

01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:54.170
because there tends to
be a rebound excitability

01:51:54.170 --> 01:51:57.720
after alcohol stops having its effects

01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.920
on the GABA receptors.

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.690
And so then there's an excitability

01:52:00.690 --> 01:52:03.160
for which an epilepsy would be terrible.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.150
The reason why the epileptic
diet is useful for epilepsy

01:52:07.150 --> 01:52:09.627
is that increases what
we call the tonic level,

01:52:09.627 --> 01:52:13.890
the sort of the ti, the
level of GABA in the brain,

01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:16.630
and that suppresses some
of the hyperexcitability,

01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:20.220
that is the characteristic
feature of epilepsy.

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.940
And there are other drugs, for instance,

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.620
the benzodiazepines and
things of the Xanax, variety,

01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:28.260
Valium, and so forth.

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:30.130
Those increased GABA transmission.

01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:32.670
Those drugs also have a
lot of potential for abuse

01:52:32.670 --> 01:52:34.040
and addiction, et cetera,

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.010
and they're problematic for other reasons.

01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:38.660
But the ketogenic diet,

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.950
by way of increasing ketone metabolism

01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:44.610
or shifting brain's
metabolism over to ketones

01:52:44.610 --> 01:52:49.610
tends to modulate GABA such
that GABA is more active

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:54.040
and adjust the so-called
GABA glutamate balance.

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:55.050
This is getting technical,

01:52:55.050 --> 01:52:58.100
but glutamate is an
excitatory neurotransmitter,

01:52:58.100 --> 01:52:59.770
GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter,

01:52:59.770 --> 01:53:02.520
and their balance is
vital for neuroplasticity,

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:05.770
for maintaining healthy levels
of activity in the brain,

01:53:05.770 --> 01:53:06.830
et cetera.

01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:10.160
And so there is decent evidence

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.370
that people with major
depressive disorders,

01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:17.190
in particular, the people with
major depressive disorders

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:20.790
that are refractory,
meaning they don't respond

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:23.113
to classical antidepressants,

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:28.860
can benefit, it seems,
from the ketogenic diet.

01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:30.270
Now this is not always the case,

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:33.040
but for those of you out
there who are struggling

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.100
with major depression, and for
which drugs have not worked,

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.410
please talk to your psychiatrist.

01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:38.400
I don't know how many of
them are up on the literature

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:42.900
about the ketogenic diet
or the EPAs and the rest.

01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:45.530
Psychiatrists vary in
terms of how involved

01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:47.470
in the current literature they tend to be,

01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:49.920
but there are many excellent
psychiatrists out there.

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:51.600
Most of them in my experience,

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.677
are actually quite avid
learners about what's happening

01:53:55.677 --> 01:53:59.290
and what's new in this realm
that they call psychiatry.

01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:03.030
So it's really interesting that
eating in a particular way,

01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:05.920
lowering carbohydrates to
the point where you rely

01:54:06.772 --> 01:54:09.020
on ketogenic metabolism in the brain,

01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.960
increases GABA and can provide some relief

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.820
for depressive symptoms.

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:16.890
And that in particular, that
seems to have positive effects

01:54:16.890 --> 01:54:19.270
in people that are
refractory or don't respond

01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:21.070
to classic antidepressants.

01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:24.090
And that would include things
like fluoxetine, et cetera.

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:26.740
I'll make one final point
about ketogenic diets

01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:27.970
and GABA and depression,

01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:29.970
which is that it's also been shown

01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:34.840
that for people that
respond well to these drugs

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:37.290
that impact the serotonin
system, dopamine system,

01:54:37.290 --> 01:54:40.210
or norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet,

01:54:40.210 --> 01:54:43.790
there may improve the ability

01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:45.620
for those drugs to work at lower dosages,

01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:48.010
which is reminiscent of
what we saw with the EPA

01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:49.170
supplementation.

01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:51.860
So today we've covered
what at least feels to me,

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:53.870
like a tremendous amount of material.

01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:56.560
This topic of depression
is indeed an enormous topic

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.200
to try and get our arms around.

01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.530
We talked about the symptomology,

01:54:59.530 --> 01:55:01.227
we talked about some of the
underlying neurochemistry

01:55:01.227 --> 01:55:02.530
and biology,

01:55:02.530 --> 01:55:04.800
and then we talked about
approaches to deal with it

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:08.740
that are really grounded in
the neurochemistry in biology.

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:11.520
I just want to recap a few of those tools

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.820
and what those things are.

01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:14.683
First of all,

01:55:14.683 --> 01:55:17.600
we talked about making the
effort to not overwhelm

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.110
the pleasure system.

01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:20.670
That might seem counterintuitive.

01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:22.700
To not overly seek out pleasure,

01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:26.530
or else one can find themselves
in a place of depression.

01:55:26.530 --> 01:55:29.090
I mentioned way back at the
beginning of the episode,

01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:32.760
a young man who I know
to be really struggling

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.060
with depression, and it is thought,

01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:38.130
and we don't know for sure, but is thought

01:55:38.130 --> 01:55:40.210
that some of that depression
was probably triggered

01:55:40.210 --> 01:55:42.650
by an overindulgence in video games

01:55:42.650 --> 01:55:45.410
and other highly dopaminergic activities

01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:47.650
to the point where those
activities eventually

01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:50.890
were countered by the pain balance that

01:55:50.890 --> 01:55:52.720
Dr. Anna Lembke described.

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.180
And he now has to do those
activities repeatedly

01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:00.090
and for many, many hours
each day, just to feel okay,

01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:02.450
not even to derive pleasure from them.

01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:06.010
And worse, many other activities,

01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:09.570
practically all other
activities have lost their zest,

01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:12.360
they've lost their excitement
and his sense of pleasure

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.210
for them.

01:56:13.210 --> 01:56:15.960
And so there's a really
active campaign now

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.860
to reset that system.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:22.060
So, number one, don't
overwhelm your pleasure centers

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.110
either through activities or compounds.

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:25.440
Might seem counterintuitive,

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:28.590
but you're setting yourself up
for anhedonia and depression

01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:29.423
if you do that.

01:56:29.423 --> 01:56:31.040
It's not just about addiction that too,

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:33.580
but it's also about setting
yourself for anhedonia

01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:35.200
and depression.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.500
How often can you engage
in these activities?

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.440
Well, that's going to differ
from person to person,

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.930
everyone's slightly different,

01:56:40.930 --> 01:56:43.520
but you should really
mind your extreme highs

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.310
and your extreme lows and
be cautious about those.

01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:49.230
We'll probably have a Dr.
Lembke on again at a future time

01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:51.330
to try and get some more
specifics about that.

01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:54.700
But if you do feel like you
need to reset that system,

01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:58.980
it really does seem like
a 30 day complete detox

01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:01.150
from whatever activity
or substance that is.

01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:03.900
And ideally it doesn't
continue after that 30 days,

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:06.920
especially in conditions
of drugs of abuse.

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:10.140
Second of all, talks about
the norepinephrine system

01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.920
and how the norepinephrine
system is really deficient

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:16.480
in many forms of major depression.

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.580
And in depression, there is
now more deliberate pursuit

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:23.120
of nor epinephrin inducing
activities that are healthy,

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:26.300
that aren't adrenaline seeking per se,

01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.550
things like cold showers,

01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:31.550
things like particular
patterns of breathing

01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:35.320
that engage and tend
to make us more alert,

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:38.060
things like exercise that
will increase our levels

01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.180
of noradrenaline.

01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:42.070
I'd be remiss if I said
that these activities

01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:45.370
could completely eliminate
depressive symptoms

01:57:45.370 --> 01:57:46.900
in people with major depressive disorder.

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:47.890
I don't think that's the case.

01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:48.900
And again, I want to acknowledge

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:50.940
that people with major depressive symptoms

01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:54.000
often don't have the
energy, the willingness,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.160
or the capacity to engage
in some of these activities,

01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:00.040
but things like cold shower,
deliberate cold showers,

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.340
things like regular exercise,

01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:05.170
they aren't just feel good activities.

01:58:05.170 --> 01:58:07.500
They actually engage the
norepinephrine system

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.130
and keep that system tuned
up and allow us to increase

01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:13.060
our norepinephrine levels
at will on a regular basis.

01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:15.670
And their mood enhancing
effects are real effects

01:58:15.670 --> 01:58:17.880
at the level of neurochemistry,

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:20.230
then we talked about EPAs,
Essential Fatty Acids,

01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:23.120
and it's clear that for most people,

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.940
getting above 1000 milligrams

01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:28.300
and probably even closer to
2000 milligrams per day of EPAs

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:31.870
can be beneficial for mood,
especially in attempts to treat

01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:34.690
or offset major depressive disorder.

01:58:34.690 --> 01:58:35.640
Are there side effects?

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.850
Well, you need to explore
those for yourself

01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:38.683
and with your doctor,

01:58:38.683 --> 01:58:40.620
everyone has a different
health background.

01:58:41.939 --> 01:58:43.240
For the margins of safety,

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.920
for most people would
probably be quite large,

01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.540
but for some people that
might not be the case.

01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:51.000
So definitely check with your physician.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.970
We also talked about exercise
and how EPA and exercise

01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:57.180
on a regular basis can offset
these inflammatory pathways.

01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:58.630
I want to mention something I've mentioned

01:58:58.630 --> 01:58:59.720
on a previous podcast,

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:02.160
but in terms of keeping the Inflammatone,

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:04.330
all these molecules that
create inflammation,

01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:07.060
and then the inflammation can
limit the amount of serotonin

01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:08.670
through the pathways we described.

01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:12.760
In order to do that, it's
also very, very useful

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:16.080
to ingest two to four
servings of fermented foods

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.960
on a daily basis or near daily basis.

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.960
These are data that were
published by the Sonnenberg Lab

01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:22.070
at Stanford recently in the journal Cell,

01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:24.290
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:27.640
that ingestion of these fermented foods

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:31.410
really keeps the gut microbiome
tuned up, so to speak,

01:59:31.410 --> 01:59:34.190
well in order to offset
these inflammatory cytokines,

01:59:34.190 --> 01:59:35.810
keeping inflammation at bay,

01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:38.070
it just turns out to
be a really good thing

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:40.790
in order to keep our mood in a good place.

01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:42.670
So EPA, exercise, fermented foods,

01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:45.910
creatine as a potential source
of relief from depression

01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:49.370
or offsetting, or keeping us
away from major depression

01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:50.880
or relapse into depression.

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:53.630
And then we talked about
the prescription compounds

01:59:53.630 --> 01:59:55.130
and the compounds that are being used

01:59:55.130 --> 01:59:57.960
mainly in the course of
studies and of psychiatry

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:00.680
and depression, things like
ketamine, PCP, psilocybin,

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:01.700
and related compounds.

02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:03.530
And then lastly, we talked about ketosis,

02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:04.990
which may not be right for everybody,

02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:08.100
but might be right for
certain individuals out there

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:09.500
who are grappling with this.

02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:12.000

Throughout the course of today's episode

02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:07.060
and in previous episodes,

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:10.590
I mentioned supplements that
may be appropriate for you.

02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:12.900
If you want to check out
the supplements that I take,

02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:17.410
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:22.410
That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.

02:01:23.370 --> 02:01:25.260
There, you can see the supplements I take.

02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:27.270
If you want to try any
of those supplements,

02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:29.190
you get 20% off any of those supplements.

02:01:29.190 --> 02:01:32.040

that location in the website

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:33.990
to any other locations in the Thorne site,

02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:36.680
you will also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.850
that Thorne makes.

02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:40.430
We partnered with Thorne
because they have the absolutely

02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:43.060
highest levels of stringency
in terms of the quality

02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.990
and quantity of the
supplements that they put

02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:47.400
in their formulations.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.340
And last but not least,
I want to thank you

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:52.230
for embarking on this journey
of trying to understand

02:01:52.230 --> 02:01:55.510
what is depression, how does
it work, and how to treat it.

02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:57.861
And thank you for your
interest in science.
