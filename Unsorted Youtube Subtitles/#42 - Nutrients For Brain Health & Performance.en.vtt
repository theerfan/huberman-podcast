00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.280
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.710
where we discuss science

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.044
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:09.430
[upbeat rock music]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.370
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.870
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.000
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.170
Today, we are talking all
about food and the brain.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.120
We are going to talk about

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.760
foods that are good for your
brain in terms of focus,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.600
in terms of brain health generally,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.540
and the longevity of your brain,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.810
your ability to maintain cognition

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.050
and clear thinking over time.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.330
We are also going to talk about why

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.350
and how you prefer
certain foods to others.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.860
And I'm going to talk about
the three major signals

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.840
that combine to drive your food choices.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.190
I'll give you a little
hint of what those are.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.610
One of those signals comes from your gut

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910
and is completely subconscious.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.540
This is not the gut microbiome, per se.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.960
These are neurons in your gut

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.490
that are sending signals to your brain

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.200
that you are unaware of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.520
about the nutrient contents of
the foods that you're eating.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.550
The second signal is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.830
how metabolically
accessible a given food is,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.990
meaning how readily that food

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.630
can be converted into
energy that your brain,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.463
not your body,

00:01:11.463 --> 00:01:13.890
but that your brain can use.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.230
And the third signal is perhaps
the most interesting one.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.940
It's the signal of belief.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.150
It's the signal of what you perceive

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.850
and believe the food that
you're eating to contain,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.550
and what you think it can
do for you health-wise

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.980
and energy-wise.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.220
And that might sound a
little wishy-washy or vague,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.110
but we're going to
provide mechanistic data

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.870
to support the fact that
you can change what you eat

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.790
so much so that you can drive your brain

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.910
and your body to crave
foods that are good for you,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.760
or at least better for you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.920
than the foods you might
currently be eating.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.610
This is an incredibly powerful
mechanism that we all have.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.200
It's one that I think is
very underappreciated.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.910
And today, I'm going to review the data

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.050
from both animal models,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.980
and fortunately, more
recently, human studies,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.000
that really do underscore the fact

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.400
that you can control your
desire for particular foods.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.600
Before we dive into today's topic,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.620
I just want to briefly touch on

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.620
some key takeaways from
a previous episode,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.560
which is the episode on
time restricted feeding,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.210
also called intermittent fasting.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.480
The key elements of
time restricted feeding

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.970
that will benefit your health the most,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.350
in terms of weight loss or maintenance,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.220
fat loss, organ health,
quality sleep, and cognition,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.280
are that the feeding window begin

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.220
at least one hour after waking.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.800
You could push that feeding
window out to begin later,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.437
but at least one hour after waking.

00:02:43.437 --> 00:02:46.350
And that it end at least two,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.570
and ideally, three hours
before going to sleep.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.980
Some people can end that feeding window

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.320
much further away from
the beginning of sleep,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.890
meaning they're finishing
their last bite of food,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.120
for instance, at 6:00 PM,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.860
and they're not going
to sleep until midnight.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.680
But many people struggle
to get quality sleep

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.700
if that feeding window is set too early

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.200
relative to when they go to sleep.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.447
So begin the feeding window at
least one hour after waking.

00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:14.670
End the feeding window

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.200
at least two hours before going to sleep.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.230
And a key feature based on
the scientific research,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.500
is that the feeding window itself

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.810
fall more or less at the same
period of each 24 hour day

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.140
from day to day.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.600
Meaning, if you are going to
eat over an eight hour period,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270
that's your feeding window,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.880
you wouldn't want to
start that feeding window

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.200
at 10:00 AM one day and end it at 6:00 PM,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.048
and then the next day, start
at noon and end it at 8:00 PM,

00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:44.426
and the next day, start it at 2:00 PM

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:46.940
and end it at 10:00 PM, and so forth.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.780
As much as is reasonably possible,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.420
if you want to extract the maximum

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.400
benefit from time restricted feeding,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.690
the idea is to keep
that feeding window at,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.380
more or less, the same
phase, as it's called,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.270
of each 24 hour day.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.620
If it slides around a little
bit for social reasons

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.920
or whatever reasons,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.570
it doesn't seem to be a big deal,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.640
but you don't want it sliding around

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.830
by many hours from day to day,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.830
because of the way that
that feeding window

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.080
impacts other genes called clock genes

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.390
that regulate a bunch of
other processes in the body.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.400
Before we begin,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.200
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.280
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.970
It is, however, part of my desire

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.650
and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.870
about science and science related tools

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.360
to the general public.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.790
In keeping with that theme,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.820
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.030
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.280
ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses that are

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.950
of the absolute highest quality.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.500
I've spent a career working
on the visual system,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.100
and one of the key problems

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.200
that ROKA sunglasses has solved is,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.470
if you've ever worn sunglasses,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.790
and you've gone from a
very bright region to, say,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.030
a region with shadows,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.380
oftentimes, you have to
take the sunglasses off.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.140
They've designed their
sunglasses in a way,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.890
that no matter whether
you're standing in the shade

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.030
or in bright sunlight,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.100
you always see things with
absolute crystal clarity,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.220
which is wonderful.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.340
Their eyeglasses as well are designed

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.173
so that you can move from

00:05:11.173 --> 00:05:12.840
one region of brightness to another

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.550
without noticing it at all.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.940
The other thing that's really terrific

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.820
about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.270
is that they are very lightweight.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.103
Most of the time,

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:21.740
you don't even remember
that they're on your face.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.910
And you can wear them

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.540
whether or not you're
exercising or working,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.253
because they won't slip
off, even if you get sweaty.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.880
The other thing that's really wonderful,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.670
is that the aesthetic is terrific.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.590
Unlike a lot of so-called
performance glasses out there

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.340
that make people look like cyborgs,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.530
or frankly, just look rather strange,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.410
ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
have a terrific aesthetic.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.950
You could wear them to dinner,
to work, running, exercising,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.180
and they'll work for all those situations.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.470
If you'd like to try ROKA,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.260
you can go to ROKA.com.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.820
That's R-O-K-A.com and

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.710
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.750
Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.170
that's designed to cover your
foundational supplementation

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.530
and health needs.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.950
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.580
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.360
The reason I started
using Athletic Greens,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.420
and the reason I still drink

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.640
Athletic Greens once or twice per day,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.240
is because it covers all of my
vitamin mineral basic needs,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.380
and because of the probiotics.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.320
There's now ample data supporting the fact

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.110
that probiotics support
a healthy gut microbiome,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.310
and that the gut microbiome is important

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.660
for keeping inflammation
low, which is good,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.630
as well as for supporting
the immune system,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.360
and for supporting brain health

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.760
through the so-called gut brain access.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.270
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.210
you can go to Athleticgreens.com/Huberman.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.650
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.330
They'll give you five free travel packs.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.770
So these packs make it really
easy to mix up Athletic Greens

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.050
when you're on the road,
in the car, et cetera.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.800
And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3/K2.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.039
There's now a lot of
data pointing to the fact

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.230
that vitamin D3 and K2 are
important for hormonal health,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.910
for cardiovascular function.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.880
And so if you go to
Athleticgreens.com/Huberman,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.070
you'll get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.230
and a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.490
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.130
Headspace is a meditation app

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.790
backed by 25 peer-reviewed
published studies.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.080
I think by now, most people have heard

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.040
of the benefits of meditation.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.050
Reduce stress, improves sleep,
better cognition, et cetera.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.040
I've been meditating for a long time,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.970
but I have to admit,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.450
it's been sort of an on and off thing.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.910
There are periods of
time over the last 10,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.970
or gosh, even 20 or 30 years,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.580
that I've meditated consistently,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.260
and then I'll stop meditating.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.980
One of the terrific things about Headspace

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.190
is that it has meditations
of different duration

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.320
and different type.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.060
And so I found, that as soon
as I started using Headspace,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.990
that I was meditating
far more consistently.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.780
One of the great things about meditation

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.880
is that it works the first time,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.140
and it works every time.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.570
And the more consistently I do it,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.380
the more positive
benefits I seem to derive.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.610

go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.550
I'd like to point you toward

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.570
what I think is a very valuable
zero cost resource online.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.610
Recently, I took part in an
event called Rethink Education

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.370
that was put on by Logitech.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.820
And there, I gave a 20 minute lecture

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.260
where I describe the classic

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.120
and modern neuroplasticity literature

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.150
in both animal models and humans.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.010
The neuro-plasticity
literature is, of course,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.260
the literature that describes

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.640
how to rewire the brain in order to learn.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.880
During that 20 minute talk,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.930
I describe that literature,

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.040
but I also spell out what I call

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.190
the neuroplasticity super protocol,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.960
which is nine-plus steps of things

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.260
that teachers can apply in the classroom

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.930
to teach any sort of information,

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.890
music, math, sports, anything,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.270
and that students of any kind in any age

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.270
can use to enhance the
speed and depth of learning.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.670
You can find that talk on YouTube

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.650
by following the link in
the caption to this episode,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.170
or by simply going to YouTube

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.220
and entering the search
terms: Logitech Huberman.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.850
Some of the most frequent questions I get

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.360
are about food and the brain.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.690
Everybody seems to want to
know what they should eat

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.200
and what they shouldn't eat

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.130
in order to have peak brain function,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.620
to be able to focus, and
memorize things, and so forth,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.420
and in order to maintain
brain health over time,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.650
because nobody wants to lose their memory

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.210
or have troubles with cognition.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.370
Fortunately, there are a lot of data now

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.540
from really good quality
peer-reviewed studies

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.860
that indicate certain
things that we can do,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.290
including certain foods
that we should eat,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.700
and perhaps, even some
foods that we should avoid,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.400
in order to enhance our brain function.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.750
And, of course, when I say, brain,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.730
what I really mean is
nervous system function,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.270
because how we are able to move,

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.940
and remember things, et cetera,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.530
doesn't just depend on the neurons,

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.820
the nerve cells that are in our head,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.040
it also depends on our spinal cord,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.910
and the neurons that connect
to all the organs of our body.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.940
So in general,

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.400
there are two categories of things

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.720
that are going to improve brain health

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.030
from the perspective of nutrition.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.300
The first category is the general category

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.120
of things that we eat and avoid,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.400
and things that we do and avoid doing,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.210
that will modulate brain
health and function.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.640
What do I mean by modulate?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.333
Well, getting quality
sleep on a regular basis.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.580
Making sure that you're
socially connected.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.710
Making sure that you're not depressed.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.400
All these things are vitally important

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.610
to our overall health ,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.780
and, of course, they will
impact brain function,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.440
but they do it, more or
less, indirectly, okay?

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.040
There are a few things
that happen in sleep

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.580
which directly benefit brain function,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.130
and repair, et cetera.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.880
But today, I really want to concentrate,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.880
not on the things that
modulate our overall health,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.570
but rather, the things that
mediate brain health directly,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.720
and in particular, how certain
foods enhance brain function.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.350
And we are going to talk about

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.750
how we can change our
relationship to food.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.810
Literally, how we can start
to prefer certain foods

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.380
that are better for us than others.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.110
So just briefly, I want to touch
on the modulatory components,

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.090
because they are vital.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.400
First of all,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.040
getting quality sleep on a regular basis

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.480
and ample sleep on a regular basis

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.770
is the foundation of all mental
health and physical health.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.360
There's no question about that.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.090
We've have done several episodes,

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.370
including the Mastering
Your Sleep episode,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.610
which is episode two of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.670
And we've done a lot of other episodes

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.960
that are all about sleep,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.830
and how to get better at sleeping.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.460
So I just want to make crystal clear,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.510
that unless you're sleeping
well on a regular basis,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.610
your brain will suffer.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.770
You won't be able to focus
very well, learn very well,

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.360
and indeed, there are data linking

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.960
poor quality sleep to dementia,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.850
or at least exacerbating
pre-existing dementias,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.700
and things of that sort.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.300
So get your sleep in order.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.910
The other, of course, is
cardiovascular health and exercise.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.860
The general prescription that's
out there in the literature,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.440
and I think is well supported,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.130
is to get somewhere
between 150 and 180 minutes

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.250
of cardiovascular exercise per week.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.580
If you choose to also use
resistance exercise, that's great.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.750
But the 150 to 180
minutes minimum per week

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.370
of cardiovascular exercise

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.840
is crucial for heart health,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.470
and heart health directly
relates to brain health,

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.680
because the brain consumes
a lot of oxygen, glucose,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.570
and other factors that are
delivered via the blood.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.610
So if your arteries are clogged up,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.430
and you've got poor
vascular supply to the brain

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.700
in any region of the brain,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.300
your brain will suffer.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.453
So get cardiovascular health in order.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.680
Now, with those two
modulatory elements set forth,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.100
so that we're all aware that they're there

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.530
and they are vitally important,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.210
now, I'd like to turn to the
elements that have been shown

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.990
to be vitally important
for directly controlling,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.310
for mediating neuron function.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.640
Neurons, of course, are
nerve cells in the brain,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.000
and there are other cell
types, too, of course,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.010
that will impact brain function.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.420
The most prominent of which
are the so-called glia.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.680
Glia means glue.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.790
But even though, for a long time,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.690
people thought that these cells

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.590
were just kind of holding
things together passively,

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.310
the glia play a very active role

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.060
in the metabolism neurons
in brain function,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.140
and probably, also, in cognition,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.410
in thinking, and so forth.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.050
So what are the things that
directly impact brain health,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.870
and what are the foods that we can eat

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.730
that will support brain health?

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.487
Generally, when we think
about neuron function

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:44.230
and brain function,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.970
we default to a discussion about fuel.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.950
The fact that neurons use
glucose, which is blood sugar,

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.770
and that they require a lot of it.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.590
In some cases, they'll use ketones,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.250
which we will talk about
a little bit later,

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.480
especially in people that are
following a low carbohydrate

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.470
or ketogenic diet.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.980
But before we can even consider the fuels

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.320
that neurons use in order to function,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.620
we have to talk about

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.680
the elements that actually
allow those neurons to be there

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.020
and to stay healthy,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.800
what actually makes up those neurons.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.710
And that brings us to, what I would argue,

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:19.410
is the most important food
element for brain function,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.230
and that is fat.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.900
And that may come as a surprise,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.140
but unless one considers the
water content of the brain,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.193
which is very high,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.580
a lot of our brain,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.820
and a lot of the integrity
of the nerve cells,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.880
the so-called neurons in our brain,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.950
and the other types of
cells comes from fat.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.870
And that's because nerve cells
and other cells in the brain

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.990
have a external layer.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.610
It's what's sometimes called
a double-layered membrane.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.320
It's essentially two thin layers

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.967
that serve as a boundary
between those cells,

00:14:49.967 --> 00:14:51.710
and that boundary is important,

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.250
because how things pass
across that boundary

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.600
actually regulates the
electrical activity of neurons,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.900
which is the way that neurons
fire, and communicate,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.150
and keep you thinking, and acting,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.090
and doing all the good things

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.270
that those neurons allow us to do.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.830
And those membranes are made up of fats,

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.090
but they're not made up of the fats

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.290
that are around our belly,

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.000
around the other organs of our body.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.640
They're not made up of storage fat.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.400
They are made up of structural fat.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.380
And maintaining the so-called integrity

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.870
of that structural fat,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.020
meaning the health of those neurons,

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.900
is going to come, in large part,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.850
from the foods that we eat.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.990
Now, this needs to be underscored.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.060
What I'm saying is, that
the foods that we eat

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.100
actually provide the structural
basis, the building blocks,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.690
of the very neurons that
allow us to think over time.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.470
And as I mentioned earlier,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.920
the fat that makes up those
neurons and other nerve cells

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.210
is different than the other
types of fat in the body.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.440
So what type of fat is it,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.770
and what should we eat

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.550
in order to support that
fat and those neurons?

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.570
And the answer is

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.820
the so-called essential fatty
acids and phospholipids.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.440
Now, those are, more or
less, the same thing,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.880
but I just want to make
a very large literature

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.050
very crystal clear.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.980
Essential fatty acids can include

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.420
the so-called EPA variety or DHA variety.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.080
You hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.510
Most people are getting enough
omega-6s from their diet.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.280
Not everybody, but most people
are getting enough omega-6s.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.410
However, most people
are not getting enough

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.380
omega-3s in their diet to
support healthy brain function

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.050
in the short and long-term.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.410
I've talked before about the benefits of

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.270
elevating the levels of
omega-3s in one's diet

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.870
for sake of offsetting depression
and for enhancing mood.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.370
And indeed, there's a
wealth of literature now

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.010
pointing to the fact that
ingesting at least one, or two,

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.532
or even three grams per day of

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:43.700
EPA form of essential fatty acid

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.100
can have effects, positive effects,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.320
on mood and wellbeing
that are at least on par

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.590
with some of the major
antidepressant treatments out there,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.670
but without similar side effects

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.210
to those antidepressant treatments.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.920
And that for people that are
already taking antidepressants,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.350
that supplementing with one, to two,

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.760
to three grams of EPA
essential fatty acids

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.320
can actually allow a lower dose of

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.030
antidepressant treatment to be used,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.380
and still be effective.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.970
So that's depression.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.860
But just in terms of maintaining
normal cognitive function

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.080
in people that aren't depressed,

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.290
the EPAs and omega-3s seem to
play a very important role.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.750
Of course, you can supplement EPAs

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.240
through various fish oils,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.300
and it could be liquid fish
oil, or a capsule fish oil.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.100
Some people, if they're not
interested in eating fish

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.110
for whatever reason,

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.950
they're allergic, or for ethical reasons,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.260
they can take krill oil.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.800
And if they don't want to use krill oil,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.730
they can use algae and other forms of EPA.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.300
However, I think it's clear,

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.870
that one can get a lot of
EPA from the proper foods.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.820
And it turns out, that those
foods, not surprisingly,

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.380
don't just contain high levels of EPA,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.160
but they also contain other things

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.020
that are beneficial for brain health.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.890
So what are foods that
are high in omega-3s

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.030
that we should all probably be consuming,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.763
at least on a daily basis?

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.380
The number one is fish.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.350
So things like mackerel,
and salmon, and herring,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.330
and oysters, and sardines, and anchovies.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.350
And perhaps, the heavyweight champion

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.280
of EPAs per unit volume is caviar.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.670
Now, I don't know about you,

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.460
but I'm not eating a lot of fish.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.580
I'm not eating a lot of caviar.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.413
I don't think...

00:18:20.413 --> 00:18:22.150
I can't remember the
last time I had a caviar,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.610
unless it was sprinkled
on a little bit of sushi.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.560
I'm not a big fish eater personally.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.940
I will from time to time.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.410
But that's one reason why

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.690
one might want to supplement
with EPAs from another source.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.630
But also, EPAs are found
in chia seeds, in walnuts,

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.010
in soybeans, and other plant-based foods.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.550
You can look these up online,

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.940
and you'll immediately see

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.570
that there are a lot of sources of EPAs.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.790
And many of the foods that I listed off

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.070
might be appetizing to you,

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.780
some of them might be unappetizing to you,

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.230
or some of them you might
be sort of neutral about.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.170
But it's very clear,

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.680
that eating foods that
are rich in omega-3s,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.360
and/or supplementing with omega-3s,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.920
to get above that 1.5 grams,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.500
and ideally, up to two,
or even three grams,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:10.280
per day of EPA can be very
beneficial for cognitive function

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.570
in the short and long-term.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.650
Later in the episode,

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.570
I'm going talk about

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.040
how to actually change your relationship

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.930
to particular foods,

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.760
so that foods that you
don't particularly like,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.860
you can actually start to like more,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.610
and that might be
important for those of you

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.607
that are thinking, mackerel, sardines.

00:19:25.607 --> 00:19:27.030
I'm making this face,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.350
'cause, frankly, those are not
foods that I naturally like.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.780
But again, I want to emphasize,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.760
that you don't have to consume fish

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.890
and animal products in order
to get sufficient EPAs.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.170
You can get them from plants.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.650
But I do believe,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.290
based on the quality
peer-reviewed research,

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.640
that everybody should be striving
to get a minimum threshold

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.800
of at least a gram and
a half of EPAs per day

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.400
one way or the other.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.930
The great thing about omega-3s

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.950
is that they are also
thought to be beneficial

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.710
for things like cardiovascular health.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.030
And although there's
some controversy there

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.870
as to whether or not two
grams, or three grams,

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.010
or six grams is ideal for
cardiovascular health,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.310
I think the bulk of
evidence points to the fact

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.260
that getting sufficient
omega-3s in the diet

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.830
is going to support cardiovascular health.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.580
Certainly not the only
thing people should be doing

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.540
to support their cardiovascular health.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.680
Aerobic exercise, and so
forth, being important also.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.447
But it does seem to support
cardio vascular health,

00:20:17.447 --> 00:20:20.170
and in doing so, supporting brain health.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.400
However, what I'm emphasizing is,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.160
ingestion of omega-3s to support

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.800
the very cells within the brain

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.040
that make up our cognition,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.710
that allow for cognition,
and for movement, and memory,

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.040
and all the other marvelous
things that the brain does.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.720
The other compound that has been shown

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.540
to be directly supportive
of neuronal function

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.640
is phosphatidylserine,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.950
which is abundant in meats and in fish.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.800
So here we are again

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.830
back to fish being an important source

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.240
of brain supporting food.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.230
Phosphatidylserine is
something that, nowadays,

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.450
people are supplementing.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.980
It's a lipid-like compound that,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.340
at least in three studies,

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.060
have been shown to improve cognition.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.310
These weren't huge effects,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.730
but they were statistically
significant effects.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.770
And as well in more than three,

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.430
at least five studies,

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.890
to reduce cognitive decline.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.820
And this is interesting.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.653
In every case,

00:21:13.653 --> 00:21:17.530
it was 300 milligrams
supplemented phosphatidylserine,

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.363
but one, again,

00:21:18.363 --> 00:21:21.160
doesn't need to supplement
phosphatidylserine.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.750
Phosphatidylserine can be
derived, as I mentioned,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.960
from meats and fish,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.070
and to some extent, from
cabbage of all things.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.470
So I don't know how much
cabbage people are ingesting.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.100
But later, when we talk about gut health,

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.430
and the relationship between
gut health and brain health,

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.100
I'll mention fermented foods.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.370
And, of course, one of the most

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.170
readily available
fermented foods out there

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.790
that at least many people
find appetizing is sauerkraut,

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.210
which is, of course, made from cabbage.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.470
It's fermented cabbage.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.730
So for those of you that
do consume meat and fish,

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.930
provided you're getting enough fish,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.900
you're probably getting
enough phosphatidylserine.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.160
For those of you that are interested in

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.180
supplementing phosphatidylserine
to get these effects

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.620
that were reported in
these various manuscripts,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.090
which, by the way, I've
read, and looked solid.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.590
I mean, I don't think we've seen

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.220
the landmark study showing

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.040
that supplementing with phosphatidylserine

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.610
at 300 milligrams per day

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.690
is going to create a huge offsetting

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.260
of a massive cognitive decline,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.520
or a massive increase in brain function.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.640
These seem to be modest effects,

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.030
but the effects do appear to be real.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.030
For those of you that are interested

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.940
in supplementing with phosphatidylserine,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.510
it's a relatively
inexpensive supplement that,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.690
again, is lipid-like.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.440
So it's mimicking some of the same things

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.380
that you would get from food,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.600
but in a higher concentration.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.133
Now, after EPA, fatty acids,
and phosphatidylserine,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.800
I would say, third on the list

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.740
of things that come from food

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.380
that can readily support brain
function would be choline,

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.690
and that's because of the
relationship to choline

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.180
in the biosynthesis pathway
for a acetylcholine.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.360
Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.440
not a neurotransmitter,

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.743
but a neuromodulator in the brain.

00:22:56.743 --> 00:23:00.260
A neuromodulator is a
chemical that modulates

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.520
the function of many brain circuits,

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.720
and also, circuits within the body.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.430
I'll mention what those are in a moment.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.670
But acetylcholine, as a neuromodulator,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.930
tends to enhance the activity,

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.980
the electrical activity
and chemical activity,

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.740
of certain sets of neurons,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.750
and downplay the activity
of other neurons.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.720
So it's sort of a conductor of sorts

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.890
leading to enhanced function

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.190
and activity in certain
brain areas and circuits,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.363
and not in others.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.970
For instance, the brain
areas that are involved

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.570
in focus and alertness.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.980
We have multiple clusters
of neurons in our brain

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.890
that make acetylcholine.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.650
Two of the most prominent and well-known

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.050
are the so-called nucleus basalis,

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.510
which is a cluster of neurons

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.130
deep in the basal forebrain

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.900
that highlight particular
areas of our brain.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.190
Highlight meaning when acetylcholine

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.890
is released from those neurons

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.010
at their nerve endings in
particular areas of the brain,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.720
those particular areas of the brain

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.760
can undergo enhanced levels of activity

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.300
relative to surrounding area.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.620
So it's kind of a
electrical highlighter pen,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.093
if you will, by analogy.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.390
That is the basis of much
of what we call focus,

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.220
or our ability to concentrate

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.350
on a particular batch of information

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.320
that's coming in through our
eyes, our ears, our nose,

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.550
or even things that we're
just thinking in our head.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.640
So having ample choline for
production of acetylcholine

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.230
allows for focus through, of
course, many intervening steps.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.020
There are also regions of the brain

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.270
in the so-called back of
the brain, the hindbrain,

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.080
that release acetylcholine

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.240
that are involved in
general states of alertness.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.510
And not surprisingly then,

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.970
many of the treatments
for Alzheimer's disease,

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.710
which is an inability

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.210
or challenges with remembering
things and focusing,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.180
are drugs that impact the
acetylcholine pathway,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.570
and are aimed at enhancing
the amount of acetylcholine

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.530
that's available to neurons.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.780
And it can do that through a
number of different mechanisms.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.930
You can do that by enhancing

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.870
the amount of acetylcholine
that's created,

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.620
or you can do that by taking a drug

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.880
that can reduce the amount of enzyme

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.250
that gobbles up the acetylcholine,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.320
and in doing so, leading
to more net acetylcholine.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.400
But outside of the scenario

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.400
where somebody has cognitive
decline due to Alzheimer's,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.040
all of us are able to focus
to some degree, or not,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.820
or are able to be alert
to some degree, or not,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.010
based on the amount of
acetylcholine that we have.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.070
Now, other processes,
of course, are involved.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.080
But what this means,

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.470
is that making sure that we have enough

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.950
of the substrates to create
acetylcholine is vital

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.500
if we want to be able to focus,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.770
and that's why dietary
choline is so vital.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.280
And the primary source for
dietary choline would be eggs,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.030
and in particular, egg yolks.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.730
And this, again, has a very
interesting relationship

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.123
to our evolution as well.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.590
We're always referred
to as hunter gatherers,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.970
but when one hears hunters,

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.560
we often think about
meat and animal sources.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.100
And indeed, as a species,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.290
we hunted many, many
other species of animals

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.260
to consume them, and still do.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.690
But we also fished.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.800
We talked about that earlier.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.147
And consumed a lot of fish,

00:25:59.147 --> 00:26:01.080
and we consumed a lot of eggs.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.830
Eggs are an incredibly rich source

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.840
of nutrients for the brain,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.800
and that's because the egg, actually,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.633
if you think about it,

00:26:10.633 --> 00:26:12.710
contains all the nutrients
that are required

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.230
in order for an organism to grow.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.100
You know, a bird that's in a egg shell,

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.980
it's got the yolk there,

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.980
and it's using that yolk for a reason.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.780
It's using that yolk as a source of fuel.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.620
It's using that yolk

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.830
as a source of, literally, building blocks

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.470
in order to create its nervous system.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.550
Many years ago, I worked on chick embryos,

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.960
and it was these amazing experiments.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.920
You could actually take an egg,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.420
and you could create a
little window in the top,

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.740
and these were fertilized eggs,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.950
and you'd see, over time,
you could peer in there,

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.420
literally look in with a microscope,

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.600
or even with the naked eye,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.890
and you would see this little chick embryo

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.710
sitting on top of that
yolk growing, and growing,

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:48.550
and growing, and growing,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.300
and the yolk getting smaller, and smaller.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.080
It's really, yeah, incredible.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.470
They're using that as a source

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.300
for all the building blocks of the body,

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.520
but in particular, the nervous system.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.470
So eggs are a rich source of choline.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.810
Some people will supplement with choline.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:06.840
However, food sources seem to
be the best source of choline.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.440
And as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.430
there are plenty of foods
that are non-animal-based

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.390
that contain choline.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.560
So if you're somebody
who doesn't eat eggs,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.830
or doesn't want to eat eggs,

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.830
things like potatoes, nuts, and seeds,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.970
and grains, and fruit,

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.940
they don't have as much choline as eggs,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.490
but they do contain choline.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.270
So you can look up the values of choline

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.310
that are present in those various foods,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.881
and make sure that you're
reaching the threshold

00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:32.714
amount of choline for you.

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:34.620
In general, most people
should probably strive

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.730
to get somewhere between 500 milligrams

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.650
and a gram of choline per day.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:39.950
So 1,000 milligrams.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.953
And some people rely on supplementation

00:27:41.953 --> 00:27:43.880
in order to hit those levels,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.570
because they're not
eating a lot of egg yolks,

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.980
or they're not eating
a lot of other foods.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.520
Certain fish contain
choline, for instance,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.930
and the other foods I
listed off a few minutes ago

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.000
from plant-based sources.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.100
So some people will supplement with

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.750
50 to 100 milligrams,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.240
or whatever amount is necessary

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.850
to get them up to that one gram,

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.720
or even a two gram, dose per day.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.050
So we have three things

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.713
that we know can support nerve cells.

00:28:09.607 --> 00:28:13.290
EPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.280
phosphatidylserine, and choline,

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.920
those three things I would list off

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.720
as the top three things

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.740
for enhancing neuron function,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.340
and the integrity of neurons
in the short and long-term.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.620
And this, again, is setting aside

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.090
the vitally important factors
of hydration and electrolytes.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.520
I've said it before on other podcasts,

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.750
but if you're not ingesting enough water,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.250
and you're not getting enough sodium,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.200
and magnesium, and potassium,

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.110
then, obviously, your neurons can't run,

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.650
because a lot of the brain is water.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.240
You need to maintain proper hydration.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.050
And sodium, potassium, and
magnesium are important

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.400
in order for nerve cells to function.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.150
In fact, they are actually
the components, the ions,

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.420
that pass across those lipid membranes,

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.950
those little fatty membranes

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.070
that we were talking about earlier,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.000
that allow the neurons to
generate electrical activity

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.560
and communicate with one another.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.860
So definitely, you want to hydrate enough.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.400
We will do an entire other episode

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.100
all about hydration and electrolytes.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.100
But omega-3s, the EPAs,
phosphatidylserine, and choline,

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.130
it's obvious are going to
improve brain function.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.640
How much they will improve brain function

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.473
probably depends on

00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:20.900
how well your brain
was working previously.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.440
In fact, many of the studies

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.520
that have looked at the
effectiveness of these compounds

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.470
have looked in people that
are suffering from mild

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.720
or even severe cognitive decline.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.960
And while the outcomes
of those studies vary,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.130
given the interest in
maintaining brain function,

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.240
given the fact that we
don't make new neurons

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.780
throughout our entire life,

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.310
and given that everybody has to eat,

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.130
these are quality healthy foods

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.840
that we should all be ingesting anyways.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.500
And it's clear that they
can support brain function

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.920
to some degree or another.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.130
Many people will ask what I do
in light of this information.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.210
And while I can only talk
about what works for me,

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:00.110
I choose to ingest fish
oil mainly in liquid form,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.397
because that turns out
to be the easiest way

00:30:02.397 --> 00:30:05.340
and the most economically affordable way

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.470
to do it for most people.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.790
So there are various forms
of liquid fish oil out there.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.390
Some of them include some lemon flavoring,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.720
so it doesn't taste like fish oil,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.520
because frankly, fish oil, to me,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.110
is sort of noxious tasting.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.980
And I'll take a tablespoon
of that, or two, per day.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.810
If I'm traveling, I'll
use the capsule form

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.410
in order to hit that threshold.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.240
For me, about two, sometimes even three,

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.560
grams per day of EPA.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.440
So not just two or three
grams per day of fish oil,

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.690
but two or three grams per day of EPA.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.110
Now, if I'm eating fish,

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.030
which as I mentioned
earlier, is not often,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.090
then I might reduce the amount
of fish oil that I take.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.313
But that's my major source of fish oil.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.480
Currently, I do not supplement
with phosphatidylserine.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.290
A number of people that I know and trust,

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.129
and indeed, several colleagues of mine,

00:30:51.129 --> 00:30:53.150
do take phosphatidylserine.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.440
I don't have any good explanation

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.580
for why I don't take it yet,

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.520
but I have not tried
supplementing with it yet.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.630
Maybe if some of you have,

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.790
you can place your experience
in the comment section.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.640
It would be of interest.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.720
And then in terms of choline,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.660
in order to get choline in my diet,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.040
I do pay attention to

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.140
the various foods that contain choline,

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.750
and I try and get those foods
on a semi-regular basis.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.530
I do supplement with
something called alpha-GPC,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.010
which is, essentially, in
the acetylcholine pathway,

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.840
or biosynthesis pathway.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.280
I don't take it very often,

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.350
but I will take 300 milligrams

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.410
of alpha-GPC from time to time.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:30.243
From time to time,

00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:33.300
I mean anywhere from two
to three times per week.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.740
I'll generally do it early in the day,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.573
'cause it, for me,

00:31:35.573 --> 00:31:37.590
can have a little bit
of a stimulant effect.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.080
Although, it's not nearly
as stimulating, say,

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.620
as a double espresso, or triple espresso.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.090
But that's one way in which I
enhance my choline function.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.470
And some people choose to
get it from supplementation,

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.180
because it's straightforward.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.013
There are a lot of supplements out there

00:31:51.013 --> 00:31:52.840
that contain alpha-GPC.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.280
Some people are taking dosages

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.950
as high as 900 milligrams per day.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.270
That sounds very high to me.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.250
The studies of offsetting
cognitive decline using alpha-GPC

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.360
did use quite high dosages of 600 to 900,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.860
or even 1200, milligrams per day.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.910
So it has been used at those
much higher concentrations.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.170
But because, fortunately,

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.250
at least, not yet, or not to my awareness,

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.470
I'm not suffering from
any cognitive decline,

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.810
I will supplement with 300
milligrams every now and again.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.510
Next on my list of compounds

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.550
that have been shown in
peer-reviewed research

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.520
to improve neuronal and
brain function is creatine.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.880
Creatine can be derived from meat sources.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.533
It can also be supplemented.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.030
Some of you are probably
familiar with creatine

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.230
or have heard about creatine

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.880
from the context of the
health and fitness world,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.240
where creatine is used to
bring more water into muscles,

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.570
which can enhance the
strength of those muscles,

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.720
as well as bring water into other tissues.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.430
It doesn't just draw
more water into muscle,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.113
it can draw more water
into the body generally.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.370
Creatine has also been shown to have

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.340
an important role in brain function.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.100
And once again, this is
something that came up

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.263
during the discussion about
depression a few episodes back.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.760
Creatine can actually be used
as a fuel source in the brain.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.850
And there's some evidence

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.130
that it can enhance the function

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:16.780
of certain frontal cortical
circuits that feed down onto,

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.633
or rather, connect to, areas of the brain

00:33:18.633 --> 00:33:21.200
that are involved in mood
regulation and motivation.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.370
And that's where creatine
plays a role in depression,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.470
or rather, where creatine supplementation

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.180
seems to be able to assist in
some forms of mild depression.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.410
That's an emerging literature.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.330
It's still not well-established.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.350
However, there is now ample evidence

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.350
that creatine supplementation
can enhance brain function

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.770
in certain contexts.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.190
And if you're interested in

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.590
learning more about
what those contexts are,

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.600
there's an excellent
review that just came out.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.480
The first author is
Roschel, R-O-S-C-H-E-L.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.660
We will provide a link to this study,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.240
rather, this review,
excuse me, in the caption.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.890
This was published just
very recently in 2021.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.530
And one thing to make clear,

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.440
is that creatine supplementation

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.990
has been shown to be especially useful

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.480
for people that are not consuming any meat

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.440
or other sources of foods
that are rich in creatine.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.970
What is the threshold level
of creatine to supplement

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.040
in order to get the cognitive benefit?

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.170
It appears to be at
least five grams per day.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.590
Now, the most typical form of creatine

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.290
is so-called creatine monohydrate.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.370
There are other forms of creatine as well,

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.690
some of which are thought to not draw

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.530
as much water into non-muscle tissues,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.930
and for some people,
that's attractive to them.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:35.620
They don't want water sitting
below their skin, et cetera.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.453
I should emphasize,

00:34:36.453 --> 00:34:39.680
that the responses to creatine
in that sense can differ.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.700
Some people get a little
bit of water retention.

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.400
Some people experience more.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.910
There's some evidence
that creatine can impact

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.090
some of the hormonal pathways,

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.340
that it might enhance levels of

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.920
so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.550
and therefore, because DHT
is involved in hair loss,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.580
there are these theories that
creatine can cause hair loss.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.610
And indeed, for people that are

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.973
very DHT sensitive, it might.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.580
There's going to be a lot of
variation person to person

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.250
in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.640
and how many DHT receptors
they have on their scalp,

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.610
and therefore, whether or not
they experience hair loss.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.100
I'm just giving you all this information,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.070
so that you're aware of the various things

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.530
that creatine can do.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.470
But nonetheless, I think it's interesting

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.150
that creatine supplementation
of five grams per day,

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.680
that's creatine monohydrate,

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.070
has been shown to improve cognition

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.240
in people that aren't getting
creatine from animal sources.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.880
And there's some evidence
detailed within the review

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.560
that I just described,

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.990
that creatine supplementation
can also enhance cognition

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.060
in people that are also
eating animal products.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.930
So I personally take
creatine five grams per day,

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.590
and have for a very long time.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.530
I can't say that I've
noticed a tremendous benefit,

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.667
because I've actually
never really come off it,

00:35:49.667 --> 00:35:51.660
and so I've never done
the control experiment.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.530
I take it more as kind of a
baseline insurance policy.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.120
For me, I'm probably losing,

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.560
I'm certainly losing some of my hair.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.210
Whether or not that's
due to creatine or not,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.200
I've never done the analysis.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.210
But what I can say is that,

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.850
I generally consume these things

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:11.290
like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:16.290
to set a general context
of support for my neurons,

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.330
for my brain.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.040
And, of course, I also pay attention

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.280
to the foods that contain
these various compounds.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.700
So I don't actively eat additional meat

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.900
just to obtain creatine.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.580
I eat a fairly limited amount of meat.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.760
I don't restrict it,

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.000
and I do eat meat,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.410
but I don't actively seek
out creatine in my diet.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.690
Rather, I use supplementation

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.400
in order to hit that five
grams per day threshold.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.380
Next on the list of foods

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.870
that are beneficial for brain health

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.450
is one that you've probably
seen pictures of online,

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.110
because there seems to be a practice

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.490
of putting pictures of blueberries

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.627
and other dark berries next
to any title that says,

00:36:50.627 --> 00:36:52.377
"Foods that benefit your brain".

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.090
There are a lot of foods out there

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.980
that have been purported
to improve brain function.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.280
The interesting thing about
blueberries and other berries,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.650
blackberries, dark currants,

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.110
any of these thin-skinned berries

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.630
that are purpleish in color,

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.860
is that they contain what
are called anthocyanins.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.610
Anthocyanins actually
have some really nice data

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.050
to support the fact that
they improve brain function.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:23.010
Now, whether or not it is
direct effects on neurons,

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.853
or whether or not it is
by lowering inflammation,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.000
or some other modulatory
effect, isn't quite clear.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.910
But I think by now, there's
enough data to support the fact

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.950
that eating a cup or two of
blueberries pretty often,

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.510
every day, or maybe you have blackberries,

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.970
or maybe it's black currants,

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.770
that these anthocyanins are good for us,

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.890
that they are enhancing
our overall wellbeing

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.990
at a number of different levels.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.560
And just to give you a couple examples

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.880
of where there are actually
peer-reviewed studies

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.940
to support those statements,

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.230
the anthocyanins of which blueberries

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.350
and other dark berries are rich in

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:04.450
have been shown to reduce
the amount of DNA damage,

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.610
has been shown to reduce significantly,

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.700
although, albeit, slightly,
excuse me, cognitive decline.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.190
And that particular study was

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.430
supplementation of a blueberry extract.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:17.757
I'll talk about the
difference between extract

00:38:17.757 --> 00:38:19.400
and actual blueberries in a moment.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.350
But supplementation of blueberry extract

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.220
in offsetting cognitive
decline in elderly people.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.150
So what constitutes elderly

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.530
is always a little bit of
a debate and a discussion.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.210
But in this case, what they did,

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.767
is they supplemented with
somewhere between 428,

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.110
I don't know why they selected 428,

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.570
and 598 milligrams of
anthocyanins daily for 12 weeks

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.870
was associated with improvements

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.370
on verbal learning and memory.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.830
And they had some other beneficial changes

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.600
that were within the bodily organs,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.950
and blood glucose
regulation, and so forth.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.210
Positive changes.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.950
But that's one study.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:02.120
In this case, elderly meant 65 or older.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.870
That study, and a number
of studies like it,

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:08.590
looking at things like
mildly enhanced memory,

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.400
reduced insulin levels,
reduced oxidation of LDL,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.690
these sorts of things,

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.870
have basically created a situation where

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.460
anytime you Google

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.310
or look up foods that
enhance brain function,

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.040
you're going to see a
picture of a blueberry

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:25.873
or some other berry,

00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:28.060
because of these anthocyanins.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.200
I personally don't
supplement anthocyanins.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.240
I do like blueberries.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.750
I eat blueberries when they're in season.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:35.583
I love them.

00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:37.520
I'm what you would call a
drive-by blueberry eater.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.490
Like if there are blueberries
in a bowl on a table,

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.330
and I'm walking by,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:42.740
I just have to scoop them up,

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.800
like some sort of bear, or other animal,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.760
and pop them in my mouth.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.210
So blueberries don't last long around me.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.570
One of the issues with berries,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.270
like blueberries, and
blackberries, and so forth,

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.910
is that quality sources of
them can be pretty expensive.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.810
And then, of course, when
they're not in season,

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:56.643
they're hard to get,

00:39:56.643 --> 00:39:59.100
and so that's why some people
will supplement with them.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:04.100
So that range of about 400 to
about 600 milligrams per day

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.290
seems to be the minimum threshold

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:12.290
for getting a cognitive effect
in these elderly patients.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.040
In that case, they were patients.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.000
A good review about the anthocyanins

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.940
potentially contributing to
offsetting cognitive decline

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.500
in things like Alzheimer's,

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.980
and also enhancing brain function

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.300
in people that don't have Alzheimer's,

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.370
is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L,

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.220
that was published in 2019.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.203
We will also provide a link
to that study in the caption.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.290
When one looks across the
total batch of studies

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.030
that are out there on this,

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.200
it appears, that if one
is going to supplement

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.340
with blueberry extract to get the

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.513
anthocyanin effect on cognition,

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:53.400
dosages of somewhere between
5 1/2 or about 11 grams

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.530
seem optimal with the higher end,

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:59.430
closer to 10 or 11 grams
being more beneficial.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.410
The blueberry eaters out there like me,

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.970
who prefer to get their anthocyanins

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.330
from the actual berries,

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:08.450
it appears that somewhere
between 60 to 120 grams

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.530
of fresh blueberries each day

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.210
is the way that you can
get sufficient anthocyanins

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.770
to at least shift your system,

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.930
or bias your brain towards these
enhanced cognitive effects.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.870
So we've got EPA fatty acids,

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.430
we've got phosphatidylserine,

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.820
we've got choline,

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.130
we've got creatine, and
we have the anthocyanins.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.610
And the last item that I'd
like to place in this list

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.620
of food-derived things

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.560
that can enhance brain
function is glutamine.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.710
Glutamine is a very
interesting amino acid.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.980
I've talked about
glutamine on here before.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.110
There's some evidence,
although, somewhat scant,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.050
there's some evidence that glutamine

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.870
can enhance immune system function.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.530
So people will supplement with glutamine,

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.870
or people can get glutamine from foods.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.240
Foods that contain a lot of glutamine

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.690
are things like cottage cheese.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.110
There are also other sources of glutamine.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.730
Glutamine is rich in protein rich foods,

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.270
things like beef, chicken,
fish, dairy products, eggs.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.450
But also, for you non-animal food

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.800
consuming people out there,

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.730
vegetables, including
beans, cabbage, once again,

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.090
spinach, parsley, things of that sort.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.520
So those foods contain glutamine.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.420
For people that supplement with glutamine,

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.730
generally, they will take
anywhere from a gram,

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.150
as much as 10 grams, per day.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.140
Why would they want to do that?

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.410
Well, there's also some
evidence starting to emerge

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.430
that glutamine can help
offset sugar cravings,

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.600
and I've talked about this
on the podcast before.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.280
We're going to talk more about

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.300
the basis for this a little bit later.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:43.650
But in brief, we all
have neurons in our gut

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.790
that sense the amino acid
content, the fat content,

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.660
and the sugar content of
the foods that we eat,

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.410
and signal in a subconscious
way to our brain

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.800
whether or not the
foods that we are eating

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.680
contain certain levels
of certain amino acids.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.260
And so we actually have
glutamine-sensing neurons in our gut

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.950
that actually have their little processes,

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.840
their little axons and
dendrites, as we call them,

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.260
in the mucosal lining of the gut.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.620
They're not just sensing glutamine,

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.130
but when they do sense glutamine,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.813
they respond, and they
send signals to the brain

00:43:13.813 --> 00:43:17.500
that are signals of
satiation, of satisfaction.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.160
And in doing so, can offset
some of the sugar cravings

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.110
that many people suffer from.

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.520
Now, here, we're talking about glutamine

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.010
for sake of enhancing cognitive function.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.130
And this is interesting,

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.430
because it's been shown that
glutamine supplementation

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:34.520
can offset some of the
negative effects on cognition

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.520
caused by altitude and oxygen
deprivation of other sorts.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.710
Yeah, okay, well, that's kind of a strange

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.890
and unique situation.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.750
If you're going up to altitude,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.330
should you supplement with glutamine

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.990
in order to be able to think more clearly?

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:52.270
Well, it appears that there's
good rationale for doing that.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.400
But the reason I bring this up,

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.060
assuming that most people, including me,

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.790
are not going up to high
altitudes very often,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.860
is that it's been
well-established that apnea,

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.230
failure to breathe properly during sleep,

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.340
can contribute to age-related,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.900
and even non-age-related,
cognitive decline.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.800
There are a lot of reasons for apneas,

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.610
ranging from obesity to
obstruction of the airways,

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.623
for other reasons.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.727
There are tremendous number
of underlying causes of apnea,

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:25.480
and it's something to be taken seriously.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.410
I mean, heart attacks, all
sorts of metabolic issues,

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.370
are caused by apnea.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.700
Apnea is a serious issue that
disrupts the depth of sleep,

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.300
and it's a serious
health issue in general.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.330
In any event,

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.040
apnea is associated with cognitive decline

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.920
and cognitive dysfunction,
even in young people,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.120
and it does appear that
glutamine supplementation

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.230
can offset some of the cognitive deficits

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.570
that are associated with reduced
oxygenation of the brain.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.910
If you'd like to learn more about

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.800
how apnea can negatively impact cognition,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.950
there's an excellent paper

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.800
that was published on this in 2018.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.330
The first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:05.400
It should be easy to find.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.233
The title of the paper is

00:45:06.233 --> 00:45:10.110
"Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Severity Affects Amyloid Burden

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.180
In Cognitively Normal Elderly".

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.810
This was a longitudinal study.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.560
Amyloid burden is a
correlate of Alzheimer's

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.730
and other forms of neurodegeneration

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.470
and cognitive decline
associated with memory deficits.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.710
So obstructive sleep apnea
[clears throat], excuse me,

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.180
is a very serious issue

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.880
for which glutamine appears to be able to

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.920
offset some of the
negative symptomatology.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.720
So how is it that glutamine,

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.460
either from food or
through supplementation,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.220
can offset some of these

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.890
so-called hypoxic effects
caused by sleep apnea?

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.690
Hypoxia being a lack
of oxygen for the brain

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.540
that relate to cognitive decline.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.090
It appears to have this positive impact

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.580
by way of reducing inflammation.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.350
So if you want to look
more deeply into the

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:58.950
various biological pathways

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.440
and the supplementation regimes for this,

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.700
the paper that I think is
really spectacular is a paper,

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:09.700
last author is Quaresma, Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.640
That's Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.517
It's a review.

00:46:13.517 --> 00:46:14.650
"The Possible Importance of

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.440
Glutamine Supplementation to Mood

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.550
and Cognition in Hypoxia
from High Altitude".

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.100
And even though paper is about

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.240
high altitude-induced hypoxia,

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.280
it does seem to have direct relevance

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.170
to the sorts of apnea that
are related to Alzheimer's

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.950
and other forms of cognitive decline.

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:33.350
Now, I've been taking
glutamine as a supplement,

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:34.670
gosh, since I was in college,

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:38.660
mostly because I felt, either
by superstition or by reality,

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.380
that it protected me from
various flus and colds,

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.380
and things of that sort,

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.723
because of the purported
immune-enhancing effects.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.190
Again, those immune-enhancing effects

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.220
have some data to support them, not a ton.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.340
However, I got into the
habit of taking glutamine,

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.620
and now that I've learned that glutamine

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.990
seems to also have some

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.310
cognitive-enhancing effects, possibly,

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.440
it's a supplement that I continue to take.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.000
I take very small amounts of it,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.670
but I do take it on a regular basis.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:11.130
So that, more or less, completes
the list of things that,

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.970
at least by my read of the literature,

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.740
are things that are
supported by at least three,

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.810
and in some cases, as many
as hundreds of studies,

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.330
in various populations,

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.510
that have been explored
in mouse studies often,

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.250
but also in a number of human studies.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.350
I want to emphasize again,

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.170
that all of the things I listed out,

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:31.620
whether or not it's EPAs,

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.300
whether or not it's phosphatidylserine,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.270
whether or not it's choline,

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.600
whether or not it's the various compounds

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.940
that are in berries, et cetera,

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.130
all of those can be extracted from food.

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.240
There is not any law that says

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.040
that you have to get them
from supplementation.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.530
Supplementation can help you get

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.560
to the very high levels of those things,

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.380
if you want to work on the higher end,

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.350
if that's right for you.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.580
Obviously, check with your
doctor before taking anything

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.350
or removing anything from your
diet or supplement regime.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:00.773
But in general, you can get
these things from foods.

00:48:00.773 --> 00:48:04.700
It's just so happens, that
for some of these compounds,

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.310
the foods that they're
contained in, like fish,

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.040
are not foods that I particularly enjoy,

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.220
and so I rely on [clears
throat], excuse me,

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.720
I rely on supplements in order to get

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.190
sufficient levels for me.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.630
But again, you can get
these levels from food.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:20.550
And the reason I made this list,

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:23.270
the reason that I emphasize these things

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.080
in this particular order,

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:30.000
is that they support the
structure of neurons.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.830
They support the structure of
the other cells of the brain

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:33.977
that make up our cognition

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:36.150
and that are important for our focus,

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.920
and our ability to remember
things, and so forth.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.010
And they are less so in the category

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:44.330
of so-called modulatory effects.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.330
They will also have
modulatory effects on sleep,

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.163
on inflammation,

00:48:48.163 --> 00:48:49.970
or reducing inflammation
throughout the body,

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.690
on cardiovascular function,

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.420
all of which I believe
are positive affects.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.130
At least what the literature tells us,

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.580
is that none of these compounds

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.510
are harming other systems of the body,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:04.120
provided they are taken
at reasonable levels.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:08.250
But everything in this
list is directed towards

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.290
answering the question, what can I eat,

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:14.040
what can I ingest by way of
food, and/or food supplement,

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.800
that can support brain
function in the short-term

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.750
and in the long-term?

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:19.630
So I hope you find that
list beneficial for you.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:22.960
If not for use, at
least for consideration.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.460
So now, having talked
about some of the foods

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.130
and micronutrients that are
beneficial to our immediate

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.520
and long-term brain health,

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.060
I'd like to shift gears somewhat,

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.880
and talk about why it is

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.420
that we like the foods that we like.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.480
We've all heard before

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.560
that we are hardwired to pursue sugar,

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.777
and to like fatty foods,

00:49:42.777 --> 00:49:45.130
and that calorie-rich
foods are attractive to us

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:46.140
for all sorts of reasons,

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.680
you know, surviving famines,
and things of that sort.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.110
And while that is true,

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.030
the actual mechanisms that underlie

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.350
food seeking and food preference

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.290
are far more interesting than that.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.380
There are basically three channels

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.840
in our body and nervous system

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.520
by which we decide what foods to pursue,

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.020
how much to eat, and
whether or not we will find

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.760
a particular food attractive,

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.190
whether or not we will
want to consume more of it,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.390
whether or not we want to avoid it,

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.510
or whether or not it's just sort of so-so,

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:21.510
what I refer to as the
yum, yuck, or meh analysis.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.530
And indeed, that's what
our nervous system is doing

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.510
with respect to food.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.730
It's trying to figure out whether or not,

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:29.890
yum, I want more of this,

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:31.900
yuck, I want to avoid this,

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.870
or meh, it's so-so.

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.210
Now, while that may seem like

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:38.260
a overly simplified
version of food seeking

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.670
and food preference,

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.100
it's actually not that far from the truth.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.820
It actually correctly captures

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.280
much of the biology of food preference.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.220
So let's talk about what
these three channels

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.080
for food preference are.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.130
The first one is an obvious one.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.190
It's taste on the mouth.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.430
It is the sensation that we
have of the foods that we eat

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:00.910
while we're chewing them,

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:02.380
and those sensations,

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.350
which are literally just
somatosensory, touch sensations,

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:08.750
you know, the palatability of food

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:13.320
as it relates to the consistency
of food, that's important.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.070
And as you've all heard before,

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.600
we have sensors on our tongue

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.340
and elsewhere in our mouth

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:21.410
that detect the various
chemicals contained within food,

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.600
and lead to the senses of taste,

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.240
which we call bitter, sweet,
umami, salty, and sour.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.940
Now, most of us are familiar
with the sense of bitterness

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.810
that comes from something
like a raw radish,

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:35.380
sweet, which comes, obviously,

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.730
from sugars of different kinds,

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.940
fructose, glucose, et cetera,

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.210
salty, salty,

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:46.070
and sour, think lemon or
lemon juice, for instance.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.040
And then I mentioned umami.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.550
The umami receptor is a
receptor that responds

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.740
to the savory taste of things.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.200
So that's what you might find in a really

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.510
wonderfully rich tomato sauce.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.500
For those of you that
eat meat, and like meat,

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.950
a really well cooked ,not
necessarily well done,

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:08.580
but properly cooked, I should say, steak,

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.840
if that's your thing.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.550
And umami is present in
both plant and animal foods,

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.360
and gives us that sensation of savoriness.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.820
It almost has a kind of little
bit of a briny taste to it,

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.450
or braised taste to it.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.310
And indeed, brazing of meats
and brazing of vegetables

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.620
is done specifically to
activate that umami receptor.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.690
So we have those five basic tastes.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.970
Those are chemical sensors
on the tongue that,

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.480
what we call, transduce those chemicals.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.860
Those chemicals, literally, in
food bind to those receptors,

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.763
and it is transduced,

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.890
meaning the binding of those
chemicals to the receptors

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.000
is converted into an electrical signal

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.800
that travels in from the tongue

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.980
along what's called the gustatory nerve.

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.070
The gustatory nerve then synapses,

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.360
meaning it makes
connections in our brainstem

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.970
in the so-called nucleus
of the solitary tract.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.620
There are other nuclei back there.

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.610
Nuclei just aggregates of neurons.

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.280
And then it sends information up to

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.610
the so-called insular
cortex, to the insula.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:11.680
I want to highlight the
insula this episode,

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.720
because we are going
to return to the insula

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.500
again and again in this
episode, and later.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.530
The insular cortex is
a incredible structure

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.720
that we all have

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.520
that mainly is concerned
with so-called interoception,

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.840
or our perception of what's
going on inside our body.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.500
So it could be the amount
of pressure in our gut

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.240
because of how much food we've eaten.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.460
It could be the acidity of our gut,

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.860
if we're having a little bit
of indigestion, for instance.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.520
It can also be the case,

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.610
that neurons within the
insula are paying attention

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:45.700
to how stressed you are,
or how alert you are,

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.800
or how tired you are.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.960
So it's really an inward
focusing structure.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.040
It focuses on how we feel internally.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.250
And not surprisingly,

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:58.210
the taste system sends information
up to the insular cortex

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:02.710
to give us a sense, literally,
of what we've ingested,

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:06.080
whether or not what we're
tasting tastes good or not.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.130
We will return to insular
cortex in a few moments.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:11.290
A very important thing to understand,

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.050
is that the neurons in
the areas of the cortex,

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:17.000
your cortex and mine, that
respond to particular tastes

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.980
are providing an internal representation

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.880
of an external sense.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.850
What do I mean by that?

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:27.810
I don't want to be at all abstract.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:28.810
We take these foods,

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:32.730
we break them down in our
mouth by chewing them,

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:33.563
or sucking on them,

00:54:33.563 --> 00:54:35.950
whatever it is the food happens to be,

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.650
those chemicals bind to those receptors,

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:40.010
and electrical signals
are sent into the brain,

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.670
but they are just electrical signals,

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:45.040
just like notes being played
on the keys of a piano.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.090
There's no unique signature
for salty or sweet.

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:53.090
It is the relative activation
of one set of neurons

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.930
that was activated by sweet,

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.570
or another set of neurons
that was activated by umami.

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.510
It's that relative activation

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:04.090
traveling into the brain in,
essentially, the same form,

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:05.550
the same electrical signals.

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:06.610
This is really incredible, right?

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:07.990
Electrical signals are
sent into the brain,

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.000
and you say, aha, that's
sweet and I want more of it,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.550
or that's bitter, or I want less of it,

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:13.790
or that's umami flavored,

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.410
and I really, really like that,

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.883
really like savory foods, as I happen to.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.000
That should immediately
strike you as incredible,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.040
because it means that your representation

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:27.310
of what you want more of or
less of is electrical in nature.

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:31.090
And to really tamp this issue down,

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:36.030
studies that were done by
Charles Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R...

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.160
He's a absolutely
phenomenal neuroscientist

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:43.130
at Columbia University in New York.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:47.040
Studies done by the Zuker
Lab have shown that,

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:51.440
first of all, they could identify
the neurons in the cortex

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.420
deep in the brain that
respond to a sweet taste

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.400
or to a bitter taste.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.900
It turns out, they are non-overlapping

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.510
populations of neurons.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.070
And then using some molecular tricks,

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.660
they were able to either silence

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.300
or activate the neurons
that, for instance,

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.823
respond to sweet.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:10.283
When they do this,

00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:14.350
they see incredible
consequences on perception

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.950
that, indeed, occur in your brain,

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.730
and my brain as well, all the time

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.220
without these kind of manipulations.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.320
Here's the experiment.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:27.270
They have a subject drink
water that contains sugar,

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:29.670
or drink water that
contains a salty substance,

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.920
or drink water that contains

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.670
a bitter substance, for instance.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:36.090
Okay, I'm sort of paraphrasing
a large amount of work.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:39.953
They identify the neurons
that respond to sweet tastes.

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.780
They see, as many researchers have seen,

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.950
that subjects prefer sweet
taste to other tastes,

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:49.520
and certainly, sweet tastes to bitter,

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.093
or sweet tastes to
nothing, so to plain water.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.860
And then they go in,

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.690
and they are able to
selectively silence the neurons

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:00.173
that represent sweet.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.290
And when they do that,

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:06.123
they eliminate the preference
for that sweet taste.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.610
Now, that might seem obvious,

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:09.680
the neurons respond to sweet,

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.700
and you silence those neurons,

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.640
they no longer seek out sweet.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.780
But that should strike
you, also, as incredible,

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.300
because they're not actually changing

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.530
what's happening on the tongue

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.380
or in the deeper layers of the brain.

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:27.640
Conversely, they can have
subjects drink bitter water

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.780
or plain water while activating,

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.190
selectively activating, the
neurons that respond to sweet.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.400
And what they find,

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:40.400
is that then subjects will
actively prefer bitter

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:45.700
or plain water to actual
preferences, such as sweet.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:48.210
So what this means is that,

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:51.450
your perception of what
you like is a central,

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:54.520
meaning deep within the brain, phenomenon.

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.530
It's not about how things
taste on your mouth.

00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:59.240
Now, of course, under normal conditions,

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.073
where there aren't these

00:58:00.073 --> 00:58:02.360
experimental manipulations being done,

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.490
those things are positively correlated.

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:06.340
Sweet tastes trigger the activation

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.180
of sweet neurons, for instance.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.800
Neurons in the mouth
that respond to umami,

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.920
trigger the activation
of neurons in the brain

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.720
that respond to umami, and so forth.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.510
So they're correlated in a way

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:20.020
that makes you seek out
the things that you like,

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.260
and avoid the things that you don't like.

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.760
But as we'll see in a few minutes,

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.100
turns out, that that is
not a direct relationship

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.520
that is hardwired.

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.540
You can actually uncouple

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.870
the preference for a particular taste

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.430
with the reward systems in the brain

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.400
in a way that, for instance,

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.940
would allow you to eat,

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.390
or I should use myself as an example,

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.830
'cause I don't particularly like fish.

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:46.240
I've had a few meals that include a fish

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.510
that were pretty good,

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:49.230
but none of them were memorable

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:50.300
in the kind of positive way,

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.000
that like some other events
in my life were memorable.

00:58:54.327 --> 00:58:55.850
But by way of these circuitries,

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:57.300
and the way they link up with one another,

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:01.380
it's actually possible to
rewire one's sense of taste

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.230
and preference for particular foods.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:04.830
If this is seeming at all vague to you,

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:07.250
just hang in with me a little bit longer,

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.240
because I will provide you
with the information, tools,

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.130
and resources with which
to navigate this process.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.820
But the most important
thing to understand is that,

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.010
like with our hearing,

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.333
like with vision,

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.823
like with smell,

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.690
taste is an internal representation

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:31.830
that has particular goals for you.

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.170
Your sense of what tastes good

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.870
is related to particular things

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:36.550
that are occurring in your brain and body,

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:38.740
and that are likely to give your brain

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.530
and body the things that it needs.

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.230
It is not simply a matter of

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:44.560
what you, quote/unquote, "like",

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.190
or what tastes good, or
what doesn't taste good.

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:50.150
Let me give you a
relatively simple example

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:53.260
of how your body and your brain are acting

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.850
in a coordinated way

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:55.754
to make you prefer certain foods,

00:59:55.754 --> 00:59:59.393
and indeed, to pursue certain foods more.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.540
As I just mentioned, you
have neurons on your tongue

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.290
that respond to different tastes.

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.930
But, of course, your digestive
tract isn't just your tongue,

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:07.930
it's also your throat.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.910
It goes all the way down to your stomach,

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.140
and, of course, your intestines.

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.743
It's a long tube of digestion.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.690
All along that tube there are neurons.

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:20.200
Some of the neurons are responding to

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.400
the mechanical size of

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.690
whatever portion of the
digestive tract it happens to be.

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:28.750
So for instance, how distended,
or empty, or full, rather,

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.634
it doesn't have to be distended,

01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:31.610
it depends on how much you ate,

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:34.860
but how full or empty
your gut happens to be,

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.420
whether or not something you
just ate is temperature hot,

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.120
you know, is hot in the
sense of hot to the touch,

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.980
or whether or not it's spicy hot,

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.250
whether or not it's soothing,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.690
whether or not it's
kind of hard to swallow,

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:47.600
this kind of thing.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.570
So you have neurons all along your gut

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.510
that are responding to the mechanics

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.050
related to food and digestion,

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:56.050
and that are related to the
chemistry of food and digestion.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.610
There's a population of neurons,

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:01.430
nerve cells in your gut,

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.210
that are exquisitely
tuned to the chemistry

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.210
of whatever it is in your gut.

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:09.600
And these are neurons
called neuropod cells.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.510
They were discovered many, many years ago,

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.600
but really defined with

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.710
and classified with modern tools

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.170
by Diego Bohorquez.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:20.870
I hope I'm pronouncing
your name correctly.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.510
Diego, we've spoken many times,

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:24.160
but I can't ever seem to quite capture

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.280
the proper pronunciation just right.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.660
But Diego Bohorquez at Duke University,

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.250
who discovered that these cells

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.470
reside within the gut,

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.050
and place little processes,

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.630
they're little axons and dendrites,

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:43.100
within the mucosal lining of the gut.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.840
And there, they are paying attention to,

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.600
meaning they respond to,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.800
amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.030
So as your food is digested,

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:57.220
as food lands within your gut,

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.980
neurons there are sensing what
types of foods are available,

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.480
and what types of things
are making their way

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:06.050
through the gut environment.

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:08.277
Now, those neurons aren't
actually taking those foods

01:02:08.277 --> 01:02:09.430
and doing much with them.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.680
What they're doing, is they're essentially

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:16.670
surveying what qualities
of food are there.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.260
And these particular neurons

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.010
that Diego and his group discovered,

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:24.680
send electrical signals up into the brain

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.680
through a little passage that
we call the nodose ganglion.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.280
The nodose ganglion is
a cluster of neurons

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.710
that then send up their
own process into the brain,

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.350
and trigger the release of dopamine,

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:40.200
which is a molecule that
inspires motivation, reward,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.323
and more seeking for whatever
it is led to their activation.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.870
These are super interesting neurons,

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:48.980
because what they're essentially doing,

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.350
is they are providing
a subconscious signal

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:55.700
about the quality of the
food that you're eating,

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:56.950
what it contains,

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.550
and then triggering the release

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:01.420
of a molecule within your brain, dopamine,

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.173
that leads you to go
seek more of those foods.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:09.940
Now, this has profound
impact on a number of things.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.520
First of all,

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.370
there's the consideration
of so-called hidden sugars.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:17.460
Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a
pediatric endocrinologist

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.780
at University of
California, San Francisco,

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.220
has been among the most
prominent researchers

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.230
to talk about the fact

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:26.460
that there are these so-called
hidden sugars in foods.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.820
Now, these are not just sugars,

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.430
that they sneak in just to be sneaky,

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:32.890
these are sugars that
are literally snuck in

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:35.520
in a way that you can't taste them.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.170
That's why they're called hidden sugars.

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.200
It's not that they just
put them in there for fun.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.780
These are sugars that are
placed into processed foods

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.010
that are designed to trigger activation

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:46.890
of these mechanisms

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.110
to lead you to want to
eat more of these foods,

01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:54.300
but not because they necessarily
taste sweet or delicious,

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.290
but because they are activating

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.580
these subconscious mechanisms

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.100
that are driving you to
pursue more of these foods.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.000
It sounds like a very diabolical strategy,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.623
and indeed, it is somewhat
of a diabolical strategy.

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.470
However, these neurons are also involved

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.630
in signaling to your
brain when, for instance,

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:15.510
you are eating a food that is
rich in omega-3 fatty acids,

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.860
the fatty acids that we
were talking about earlier.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.870
So why is it that you don't crave salmon?

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:21.300
Why is it that I don't sit around

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.030
daydreaming about mackerel?

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:24.870
Well, because there's also the influence

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:26.630
of the actual taste on the mouth.

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.660
Under normal conditions,

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.450
it's a combination of the taste
of the thing on the mouth,

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.090
plus the subconscious
signaling from the gut.

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:37.310
And while this isn't a
discussion about gut microbiome,

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:40.170
I should just mention,
that it's very clear

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.640
that having a healthy gut microbiome

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:46.320
allows these neurons to function in a way

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.890
that serves our seeking of
healthy foods in positive ways.

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:53.550
And without getting into a
lot of detail about this,

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:56.100
the best way to ensure
a healthy gut microbiome

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.880
that I am aware of

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.590
is not necessarily

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:03.280
to take supplemental
prebiotics or probiotics.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.390
There are actually some reasons why

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:06.240
you might not want to do that.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.510
But rather, to ingest two to four servings

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:11.363
of fermented foods that
are low in sugar each day.

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.100
There is a recent study published in Cell

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.720
showing that the ingestion
of fermented foods,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.163
two to four servings each day,

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.920
can enhance the quality of
the mucosal lining of the gut

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.420
that allows certain gut
microbiota to flourish,

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.140
and the gut microbiota
that are not good for us

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:31.973
to not flourish,

01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:33.900
'cause that's the environment
that they settle down into.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.450
This is work that was carried out

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:38.330
by my colleagues, Justin Sonnenburg,

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:40.970
which is in the laboratory
upstairs from me,

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.673
as well as Chris Gardner,
and others at Stanford.

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:46.940
They are certainly not the only
researchers exploring this.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.070
But it does appear,

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.830
that two to four servings of

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.280
fermented foods each day,

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.250
so these would be things
like natto, sauerkraut,

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:59.410
low sugar fermented foods, is
great for the gut microbiome.

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.480
And separate studies, not their study,

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.610
but separate studies have shown

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.610
that the correct gut microbiome conditions

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:07.850
allow these neurons
that signal to the brain

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:10.350
to signal the right, at the right times,

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:13.710
and in the right ways to
promote healthy food seeking.

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:18.500
Many people opt to supplement
with capsule form probiotics.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.010
There are some data that suggests

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:24.380
that maybe those don't
contain the correct prebiotics

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.990
and probiotics for setting the correct

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:28.930
gut microbiota conditions.

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.700
That's a little bit of
a controversial issue.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:36.320
Nonetheless, getting
probiotics from fermented foods

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.480
is probably the simplest and
most straightforward way.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.690
It's also the way that we
evolved to do that over many,

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.290
at least hundreds, and
probably, thousands,

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:45.170
or even tens or hundreds
of thousands of years,

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.360
people have been
ingesting fermented foods,

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.230
not just for their tastes,

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:50.550
but for their health benefits as well.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:53.470
So now I've mentioned two
of the three mechanisms

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:55.940
by which we prefer certain foods.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.757
One is from the actual taste
that we're familiar with,

01:06:58.757 --> 01:07:00.820
the taste on our tongue, and in our mouth,

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:05.300
in the sensations that make
us go mmm, or ugh, or eh,

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.380
the yum, yuk, meh responses,
as I referred to them earlier.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.380
And then there's this
subconscious signaling

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.213
coming from the gut

01:07:11.213 --> 01:07:13.970
that's really based on the
nutrient content of the foods.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.550
There's a third pathway,

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:21.570
which is the learned association
of a particular taste

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:25.960
with the particular quality
or value that a food has.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.040
And this is where things
get really interesting,

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.190
and where there's
actually a leverage point

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:33.200
for you to rewire

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.546
what it is that you find tasty,

01:07:35.546 --> 01:07:37.680
and that you want to seek more of.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.060
The work I'd like to talk about next

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.500
has been carried out in mouse models,

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.320
and has been carried out in
parallel experiments in humans.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.390
This is largely, not exclusively,

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:53.390
but largely the work of Ivan
de Araujo and Dana Small.

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:58.740
Ivan de Araujo is at Mount
Sinai School of Medicine.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.930
And Dana Small is at Yale.

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.810
And they, and others in their field,

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:04.890
have done incredible experiments

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:08.320
exploring how taste and food value,

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.360
the nutritional value of food,

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:15.160
and the impact of that food
on metabolism in the brain

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.020
drives our food choices,

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.270
and allows us to change our
food choices for the better.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.190
Their groups have done
some really amazing studies

01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:26.840
involving ingestion of
a particular substance

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.940
that either contains sugar,

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.920
and thereby, can elevate
glucose, blood sugar, or not.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.460
And varying, meaning
changing the taste associated

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:41.170
with that ingestion of sugar.

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.300
So let me just give you a simple example

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.820
where they have subjects,

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.460
these could be mice or
these could be humans,

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.330
'cause they've done both sets of studies,

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:54.790
drink sweet water as an alternative

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:58.400
or a choice to non-sweetened
water, or bitter water,

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.640
or some other flavor.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.040
And what they find, is that
mice and humans will prefer

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.100
to consume the sweet beverage.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.530
Now, it's not always sweet water.

01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:07.540
Mice like sweet water,

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.340
but humans will prefer,
for instance, a milkshake,

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.763
a fatty sweet drink.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.740
They'll consume more of that,

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.140
and not surprisingly,

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.783
dopamine levels in the brain
increase in response to that.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:26.670
So the taste and the nutrient content

01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:29.670
of what it is that they're
ingesting are aligned.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:30.633
They are matched.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.350
They've also done experiments
where they have no taste,

01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:39.260
but subjects are being infused with sugar

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.230
directly into the gut.

01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:43.080
And not surprisingly,

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.140
based on everything I've
told you up until now,

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.980
subjects will pursue more of that thing

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.650
relative to some other taste,

01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:54.330
either neutral or negative taste,

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:56.490
because that sugar in the gut

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.680
is triggering the activation

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.930
of the neurons I mentioned earlier,

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.100
which is signaling to the brain

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.970
to pursue more of that thing.

01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:03.510
So this tells us something important.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:06.110
It tells us that we are driven,

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:08.220
meaning we have mechanisms in our brain

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.160
that make us motivated to pursue

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.400
more of what brings both
a taste of sweetness,

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.710
but also that brings actual changes

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.760
in blood glucose levels up, okay?

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.610
So we are motivated to eat sweet things

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.080
not just because they taste good,

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.870
but because they change
our blood sugar level.

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:26.970
They increase our blood sugar level.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:27.910
This is important,

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.490
because it needn't be the case.

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:31.450
It could have been that we were just wired

01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:34.340
to pursue things that taste good.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.220
But what this tells us,

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.300
is that we are actually
wired to pursue things

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.283
that increase our blood glucose,

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:46.470
so much so that when the small lab...

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.553
It's not a small lab.

01:10:47.553 --> 01:10:48.386
It's actually a big lab.

01:10:48.386 --> 01:10:52.510
But when Dana Small's lab,
and/or Ivan de Araujo's lab,

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:53.620
have done experiments

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:58.320
where they use a compound
called 2-deoxyglucose,

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.320
this is a compound that

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.990
can prevent glucose from
being metabolized by neurons.

01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:05.270
So blood glucose is going up,

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:07.000
but neurons can't use it.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.080
What they find, is that the reinforcing

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.530
or the rewarding properties of a food

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:14.350
or taste are eliminated.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:17.670
Put simply, it is not
sufficient for a food

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.370
to taste good consciously.

01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:24.730
It is not sufficient for a
food to increase blood sugar.

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:27.350
You need blood sugar to go up,

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.720
and that blood sugar glucose

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.053
has to be utilized by the neurons,

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:36.400
even if it's not associated
with a good taste.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.080
And to make it even simpler,

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.900
if this isn't sinking in,

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.610
this should make it very clear.

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:43.160
What your brain,

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.360
meaning, what you are seeking
when you eat, is not taste,

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.200
is not dopamine,

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.650
is not even a rise in blood glucose.

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:54.240
What you're seeking, even
though you don't realize it,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.110
because it's subconscious,

01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:58.740
is you are seeking things
that allow your neurons

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.920
to be metabolically active.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.660
And this is fundamentally important

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.070
for understanding why you eat,

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:08.990
why you eat particular foods,

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:11.890
and how you can change your
relationship to those foods.

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:14.070
Now, earlier, I referred to circuits

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:16.870
that are wired for a particular outcome.

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:19.140
And in biology, and in
particular, neuroscience,

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:22.040
we refer to things that
are either hard-wired,

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.173
meaning immutable, and
unchangeable, or soft-wired.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:28.320
A good example of soft-wiring would be

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.200
the areas of your brain that
are responsible for speech

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.950
and language are always, more or less,

01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:39.500
in the same place in your brain
and everyone else's brain.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:43.450
However, they are not
hard-wired to speak French,

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:45.250
or to speak English, or to speak Chinese,

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:46.800
or to speak German,

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.630
because depending on where you were born,

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.640
and the parents that you're born to,

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.002
you need to be able to speak one

01:12:52.002 --> 01:12:54.830
or maybe even more languages.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.040
The taste system,

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.320
and this general system of
seeking particular foods,

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.840
similarly is hard-wired to obtain

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.210
certain types of nutrients.

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:05.730
It tends to like sweet things.

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:07.550
Most children naturally like sweet things,

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:08.890
some more than others.

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:12.500
But naturally, most people
from childhood onward

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.140
don't particularly crave
very bitter substances.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.380
Maybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.670
So there's some hard-wiring of preference,

01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:22.300
but there's also some
soft-wiring in the system

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.653
that allows it to change.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.220
The groups I mentioned earlier

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.220
have done some really
beautiful experiments

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.120
looking at how artificial sweeteners

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.480
interact with the actual
sweet sensing system.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.110
And this gets right down
to a number of issues.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:39.060
First of all, it gets to the issue of

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.707
how we can rewire our taste system

01:13:41.707 --> 01:13:44.940
in ways that serve us
for better or for worse.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.520
Second of all, it gets
right down to the issue

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.620
of whether or not artificial sweeteners

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.510
are good for us or bad for us.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.720
And indeed, as of just this last year,

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.000
we know an answer to that question,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.060
and turns out, it depends.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.500
And I will tell you in a few minutes

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.160
when it is okay to ingest
artificial sweeteners,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.000
and when it is very detrimental

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.373
to ingest artificial
sweeteners of any kind.

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:13.130
Regardless, I'm not going
to name off brand names,

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:14.440
but there are different forms of these

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.990
artificial sweeteners nowadays.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:18.600
And there are various forms

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.240
of non-caloric plant-based sweeteners

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.670
for which the same information

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.960
that I'm about to tell you applies.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.030
Okay.

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:27.900
So the experiments that were done

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.370
beautifully illustrate that
you seek out particular foods

01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:33.300
because of the way they taste,

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.380
because of their impact
on blood glucose levels,

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.610
but also on their impact
on the dopamine system,

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:43.240
even if your blood glucose
levels don't change.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.053
So here's the experiment.

01:14:45.053 --> 01:14:47.870
One group of subjects
is given a sweet taste

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:49.460
of a substance that also raises

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.330
blood glucose levels, blood sugar,

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:53.663
and dopamine goes up, not surprisingly.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.000
The second condition,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.290
separate subjects consume
an artificial sweetener

01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:01.230
or a non-caloric sweetener.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.610
It is not preferred much
over other substances,

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:07.600
but it is sweet, so
it's preferred somewhat.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.723
And it does not cause an
increase in blood glucose levels,

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.400
and not surprisingly,
dopamine levels don't go up.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.390
So initially, we don't tend to like

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:18.710
artificial sweeteners that much.

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:20.090
That's the simple way of putting it.

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:22.820
However, if subjects continue

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.533
to ingest artificial sweeteners,

01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:27.690
even though there's no increase
in blood glucose level,

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.040
and therefore, no increase
in brain metabolism,

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.250
dopamine levels eventually start to rise.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:37.560
And when those dopamine levels
eventually start to rise,

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.780
you've essentially conditioned

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:43.780
or reinforced that artificial
or non-caloric sweetener,

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:45.880
and then subjects start
to consume more of it,

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.693
and they actually get a
dopamine increase from it.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.413
So that's interesting.

01:15:50.413 --> 01:15:52.820
It says that, consuming more
of these artificial sweeteners,

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:55.150
or consuming them for a
longer period of time,

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.020
can start to tap into the dopamine system,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.150
and lead us to seek out

01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.910
or consume more of these
artificial sweeteners.

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.050
Many people are probably
familiar with this,

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.680
because we tend to,

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.100
or I should say, people report,

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.120
that when they ingest these
artificial sweeteners,

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.310
at first, they don't taste very good,

01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.440
but then, over time, they
seem kind of tolerable,

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.397
and then maybe even pleasureful,

01:16:12.397 --> 01:16:14.037
and then some people feel, quote/unquote,

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:18.010
"addicted" to various diet
sodas, and things of that sort.

01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:21.930
Now, there's another condition
that's been explored,

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:23.860
and that's the really
interesting condition,

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.740
and it's the condition where
an artificial sweetener

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.270
is paired with a substance
that can increase blood sugar,

01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:33.750
but not because it tastes sugary,

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:35.000
like a normal sweet substance.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.810
So now, there's an artificial sweetener

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:42.120
that's coupled with an actual
increase in blood glucose.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.180
The natural world scenario
where this would happen

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.550
would be drinking a diet soda
which contains no calories,

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:50.260
and therefore, would not
increase blood glucose,

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.623
but is sweet, with a food
that increases blood glucose.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.370
And when that happens,

01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:58.330
what you're essentially doing,

01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:00.060
is tapping into the dopamine system.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.030
This non-caloric sweet
taste is paired with it,

01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:07.580
and there's an increase
in neuron metabolism.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:10.490
So you have all of the
components for reinforcement.

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:12.430
And as a consequence,

01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:15.268
you get in a sort of
Pavlovian conditioning way,

01:17:15.268 --> 01:17:17.810
a situation where, later,

01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:20.640
when you ingest that artificial sweetener,

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.790
you actually get not only
the increase in dopamine,

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:27.290
but you get alterations
in blood sugar management.

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:29.480
Now, blood sugar cannot go up

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.630
if you don't ingest something
that makes blood sugar go up.

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:35.190
So it's not as if you
ingest artificial sweetener

01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:38.420
with some food that
contains calories or sugar,

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.430
and then later, you remove the food,

01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:41.820
and you just drink the soda,

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.330
and your blood glucose goes up.

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:47.653
Rather, it's a much worse situation.

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:51.800
I'll make this in the
natural world context.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.440
If you ingest an artificial sweetener,

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.930
say, drink diet soda while consuming foods

01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:58.783
that increase blood glucose,

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:04.150
then later, even if you
just drink the diet soda,

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:08.100
it's been shown that you
secrete much more insulin,

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.970
the hormone that regulates blood glucose,

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.140
in response to that diet soda.

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.110
Studies have been done
in both adult humans

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:17.660
and in human children.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.940
In general, when we say children,

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:19.773
we mean human children,

01:18:19.773 --> 01:18:22.460
but just to be very clear
what we're talking about.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.700
Exploring consuming diet
soda with or without food,

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.820
then later, consuming just the diet soda.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.960
And what they found was,

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.020
having previously consumed
diet soda with food,

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.683
and then later, only
consuming the diet soda,

01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:38.920
of course, there isn't an
increase in blood glucose,

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.620
because they're not
bringing in any calories

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.480
when they just drink the diet soda,

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.980
but there is a significant
increase in insulin release,

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.380
and that is serious in a terrible way,

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.330
because increased release of insulin,

01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:54.290
and so-called insulin sensitivity,

01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:56.810
is the basis for type 2 diabetes.

01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:00.320
So much so, that in the
study with the children,

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.053
consuming non-caloric
beverages in this way,

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:07.080
first with food, and then on their own,

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.170
led to increases in insulin
that made them pre-diabetic,

01:19:10.170 --> 01:19:12.320
and they actually had to halt the study.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.427
So I want to zoom out from this,

01:19:14.427 --> 01:19:16.820
and just really illustrate
the major findings,

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.930
and then talk about
how this can be applied

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:19.780
in the positive sense.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.380
I also want to mention what this means

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.970
in terms of your consumption

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:25.490
of artificial sweeteners of any kind.

01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:26.430
So first of all,

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:29.920
the direct takeaway about
artificial sweeteners.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.620
Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.280
I'm not going to say that.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.360
What I am going to say,

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.380
is that whether or not
you ingest them alone,

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:40.760
or you ingest them in
combination with food,

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.210
or as part of foods that
raise blood glucose,

01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:47.020
is vitally important for
your insulin management.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.800
And the simple extractor
tool from this is,

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.204
if you are going to consume
artificial sweeteners,

01:19:53.204 --> 01:19:56.510
it's very likely best to consume those

01:19:56.510 --> 01:20:00.660
away from any food that
raises blood glucose levels.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.220
So if you're going to enjoy
diet soda, be my guest,

01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:07.180
but do it not while consuming food,

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.460
in particular, foods
that raise blood glucose.

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.210
Because what these studies show,

01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:13.120
and I will provide references for these,

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:16.800
is that they can vastly disrupt

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.560
blood sugar management by way of

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.690
the insulin glucose system, okay?

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:22.830
And actually, I'll just
give you the reference now.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:25.460
This is a paper from Dana Small's lab.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:30.130
The first author is
Dalenburg, D-A-L-E-N-B-U-R-G.

01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:31.547
And the title of the paper is

01:20:31.547 --> 01:20:33.447
"Short-term Consumption of Sucralose With,

01:20:33.447 --> 01:20:34.940
nut Not Without Carbohydrate,

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.380
Impairs Neural and Metabolic Sensitivity

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:39.740
to Sugar in Humans".

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.590
This is a paper published
in "Cell Metabolism"

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:42.810
in March of 2020.

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:45.000
I think it's a very important paper.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.450
And similar findings have
been addressed in mice,

01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:49.283
and in other studies.

01:20:49.283 --> 01:20:50.580
And now, because of this paper,

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:54.970
there's now a bunch of other
groups working on this issue.

01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:58.610
There's some evidence previously
published in "Nature",

01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:00.860
an excellent top-tier journal.

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.740
Sort of among the Superbowl
of top three journals,

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.060
being "Nature", "Science", and "Cell".

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.870
A paper published in
"Nature" a few years back

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:11.000
showing that particular
artificial sweeteners

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.760
can disrupt the gut microbiome,

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.573
and have deleterious health effects.

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:17.190
That result, I think, stands,

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:18.450
although, there are some results

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:21.030
that may not agree with that,

01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:22.840
depending on whether or not
the artificial sweetener

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.060
is saccharin, or sucralose,
or aspartame, or stevia.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.660
That's the gut microbiome.

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.910
But what we are talking about here

01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:32.320
is independent of the form of artificial

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.330
or non-caloric sweetener,

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:34.560
because it has everything to do with

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.830
whether or not there is a match

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:39.330
or a mismatch between the perceived taste,

01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:42.710
and the effect of the thing
that you are consuming

01:21:42.710 --> 01:21:45.290
on blood sugar and metabolism.

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:48.960
So the first takeaway from this is,

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.800
if you're going to consume
artificial sweeteners,

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.530
it's really important that you do that

01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:57.700
not in conjunction with foods
that increase blood glucose.

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.180
Second of all, it points to the fact,

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.963
that the foods that we prefer,

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.853
and the activation of the dopamine system,

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:08.700
both through the gut,

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.350
and at the level of conscious taste,

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:15.030
in other words, what we
like, is very plastic.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.490
It's mutable, and we can change it.

01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:18.660
How can we change it?

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:22.340
Well, earlier, I mentioned
a structure in the brain

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.490
called the insula,

01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:26.290
this incredible structure that's
involved in interoception,

01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:28.150
and interoception of all kinds.

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:30.330
In fact, just as an aside,

01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:31.950
a year or so ago,

01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:34.350
my lab published a paper showing that

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:38.690
activity within certain
compartments of the insula

01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:42.420
of humans is responding to

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.200
a heightened state of anxiety in the body.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.640
It can respond to changes
in our respiration,

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.750
changes in our heart rate.

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:48.583
So this is...

01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:51.200
Again, it's a readout
of our internal state,

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.100
not just of taste,

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.600
but of many, many different
aspects of the mechanics

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.330
and chemistry of our internal
milieu within our body.

01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:02.730
All of the work that I
was describing previously

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.350
has also been addressed
at the neural level.

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:09.700
And using a broad brush
to explain these results,

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.873
what we can say is,

01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:14.423
when there is dopamine increase,

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:19.060
one sees activation of the
so-called nucleus accumbens,

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:22.410
which is part of the so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway.

01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:23.243
If you'd like to learn more about

01:23:23.243 --> 01:23:27.440
the mesolimbic reward pathway,
and dopamine in general

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.970
in humans and in animal studies,

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:31.690
and all the various incredible

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.980
and challenging things that
dopamine can do for us,

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:38.990
there's a episode all about
dopamine that you can look up.

01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:40.893
It's easy to find at Hubermanlab.com.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:45.740
The increases in dopamine
associated with sweet taste

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:49.683
and/or blood glucose
elevating foods and drinks,

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.760
cause activation of the nucleus accumbens.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.570
That's not surprising.

01:23:54.570 --> 01:23:55.920
Also in the circuit

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.930
is activation of the
so-called arcuate nuclei

01:23:58.930 --> 01:23:59.900
within the hypothalamus.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.560
These are areas of the hypothalamus

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.470
that respond to hormones from the body,

01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:06.960
and respond to hormones and
neuropeptides in the brain,

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.220
as well as neural signals in the brain,

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.390
to drive us to eat
more, or to stop eating.

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:14.870
So it's hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens.

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.080
These are sort of the...

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.480
Hypothalamus and the arcuate
being the motivating to eat,

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.780
or motivating to stop eating.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:25.380
Both sets of neurons are contained there.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.510
There are other areas like the
lateral hypothalamus as well.

01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:29.210
But hypothalamus is
sort of the accelerator

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:30.330
and the break on eating.

01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:32.320
And then the nucleus accumbens

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.280
and dopamine release can be thought of

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.590
as kind of a nitro boost, if
you will, like the kids say.

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:39.470
Do the kids say that anymore?

01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:43.930
Anyway, a nitro boost to
increase what we call the gain

01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:47.840
or the volume of how much you
want more of something, okay?

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.010
When dopamine is present,

01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:50.880
it's this kind of generic signal

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.430
to go seek out more of
whatever caused that release.

01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:55.940
And then there's the insula.

01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:58.220
This very thoughtful, rational...

01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.053
Not really.

01:24:59.053 --> 01:24:59.886
It's not thinking.

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:00.719
It's a brain area.

01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:03.303
You're thinking, but it's part
of the areas of your brain

01:25:03.303 --> 01:25:05.400
that are interpreting what's
going on in your body.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.930
Whether or not you feel good or not good.

01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:11.720
Whether or not you feel
anxious, excited, or fearful.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:14.330
It's integrating all that information.

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:18.370
And fed into this entire circuit as well

01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:20.560
are the inputs from
your prefrontal cortex,

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.080
which is your thinking, rational,

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.810
neuronal structure, if you will,

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:27.720
informing you, for instance,

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.610
ah, well, I don't really
like salmon very much,

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:34.120
or I'm not so crazy about kale,

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.980
but it has omega-3s,

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:41.550
or it's rich in these
polyphenols that are good for me.

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:46.220
And if one decides that they
are going to eat these things,

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:48.350
not just because they are good for them,

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:50.110
but believe it or not,

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:52.880
if one takes the perception

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.100
or adopts the perception that
they are both good for you,

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.590
and that in being good for you,

01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:01.450
they are good for your brain metabolism,

01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:05.200
and that you desire to be healthy,

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.930
as crazy as it sounds,

01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:09.920
those subjective signals
of what you tell yourself

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.720
about the foods that you're eating

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:16.150
can actually impact how
those foods will taste,

01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:17.294
maybe not immediately, but eventually,

01:26:17.294 --> 01:26:20.500
and can impact the way in which your body

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.350
utilizes those foods.

01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:25.560
Now, that might seem like
a absolute pipe dream.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.670
If I just imagine that I like mackerel,

01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:29.130
mackerel will start to taste good.

01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:30.030
I'm not saying that.

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:34.200
I didn't say that you
could override yuck signals

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.320
with this mechanism.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.610
I didn't say that you could take a food

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.460
that would be absolutely noxious to you,

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.360
or make you want to
vomit, and override that.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.340
However, foods that are
somewhat neutral to you

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:51.450
can take on a different value

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:54.400
based on the activation
of the dopamine system.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.410
And now, knowing what you know,

01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:58.930
there are a couple ways that
you could imagine doing that.

01:26:58.930 --> 01:27:02.940
First of all, you could,
in this so-called gedanken,

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.960
or thought experiment,

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.550
you could, for instance,
swap out sucralose,

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:09.620
because sucralose is just a taste, right?

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.500
It's an artificial sweet taste.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.170
You could swap that out,

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:15.410
and insert kale,

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:19.810
but eat the kale with something
that raises blood glucose

01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:21.010
to some degree or another.

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:23.170
Now, I'm not encouraging
anyone to run out there

01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:25.710
and spike their blood
glucose glucose like crazy.

01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:29.100
And in fact, blood glucose
isn't really the goal.

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.960
If you recall, the goal is to get neurons

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.220
to be metabolically active
with that blood glucose, okay?

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:36.620
That's what's actually rewarded

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:38.350
at a sub-sub-conscious level,

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:41.020
meaning at a deep subconscious level.

01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:44.180
But consuming these foods with other foods

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.280
that increase blood glucose,

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.420
and thereby, brain metabolism,

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:49.750
or I suppose, if you're ketogenic,

01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:51.833
here in the ketosis,

01:27:52.770 --> 01:27:53.930
I don't know what the range of foods

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:55.220
that are allowed on ketosis are,

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.420
so I don't want to misspeak here,

01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.600
and say, cracker, which
would probably be a sin

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.940
in the context of ketosis,

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.470
and no knock against ketosis.

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:04.470
I'm offering this, in part,

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:07.050
because I think that there are
a number of people that have

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:10.310
and can positively benefit
from a ketogenic diet.

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:11.143
But for instance,

01:28:11.143 --> 01:28:14.250
if there's a food that you
want to consume more of,

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:18.310
but that you find somewhat
meh, or mildly yuh, yuck,

01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:21.950
even pairing it with ketones,

01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:25.900
if indeed, you are using ketones
for your brain metabolism,

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.020
'cause that's what happens
on the ketogenic diet,

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.320
over time, that food will be reinforced

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.300
by the dopamine pathway.

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.830
We know this from these studies

01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:36.800
where sucralose was the
substance paired with

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.980
the glucose elevating.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:43.010
In other words, metabolically
elevating the food substance,

01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:44.840
or liquid substance.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.010
So how does one go about doing this?

01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:50.250
Well, first of all, I want to emphasize,

01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:52.870
that this experiment
actually has been done

01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:54.603
in a slightly different context.

01:28:56.150 --> 01:28:58.820
Studies by my colleague, Alia Crum,

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.270
in the Psychology Department at Stanford

01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:04.660
have explored the bodily response,

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.200
in terms of insulin release,

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.913
and the release of other food
and eating-related hormones,

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.020
as well as overall feelings
of satisfaction, et cetera,

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:19.680
in groups of people
that drink a milkshake,

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.330
and are either told that
it's a low calorie shake

01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:25.570
that contains various nutrients
that are good for them,

01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:27.550
or a higher calorie shake

01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:30.143
that has a lot of nutrients, et cetera.

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:32.660
And what they found,

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.840
was that the different groups,

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.650
and here, again, I'm being very general

01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:37.390
with my description of these studies,

01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:41.020
but what they found, is that
the physiological response,

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:43.400
the insulin response, the
blood glucose response,

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.610
and the subjective measures

01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:48.140
of whether or not people
enjoyed something or not,

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.610
were heavily influenced
by what they were told

01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:52.060
were in these milkshakes.

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.460
So blood glucose would go up.

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.293
Insulin would go up

01:29:54.293 --> 01:29:56.240
when people were told it
was a high calorie shake

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.270
with lots of nutrients.

01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:00.750
Less so when people
ingested a shake that was,

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:04.090
you know, that they were
told had less nutrients,

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:05.350
and so forth.

01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:09.690
When in reality, it was
the identical shake.

01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:10.523
This is incredible.

01:30:10.523 --> 01:30:11.850
This is a belief effect.

01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:13.560
This is not placebo, right?

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.140
A placebo effect is different.

01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:16.900
Placebo effect is in comparison.

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.460
It's where the control condition actually

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.430
influences outcomes to a same,

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:26.540
or to some degree, just like
the experimental condition.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:27.730
This is not a placebo effect.

01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:29.480
This is a belief effect,

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.210
where the belief and the
subjective thoughts about

01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:35.270
what a given food will do

01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:38.350
has a direct impact on
a physiological measure,

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:40.200
like blood sugar and blood glucose.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.210
Okay, so let's zoom out
from this for a second,

01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:45.780
and think about how we
can incorporate this

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:50.130
into adopting consumption of healthy foods

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:53.680
that serve our brain health in
the immediate and long-term.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.910
And if you're wondering what those are,

01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:56.820
I listed them out at the
beginning of the episode,

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.170
and their justification
for being on that list.

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:01.910
What this means is,

01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:04.810
obviously, you want to
consume foods that you like,

01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:07.720
but because brain health
is very important,

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.683
and many of the foods
that promote brain health,

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:14.000
perhaps, are not the most palatable to you

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.100
or desirable to you,

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.380
the key would be to ingest the foods

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.430
that you want to ingest more of

01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.370
simply because they're good for you,

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:25.313
and not because they taste good to you,

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.940
alongside foods that increase

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.430
whatever fuel system you
happen to be relying on.

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:33.500
I think that's the most nutritionally

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.910
politically correct way to say it.

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:35.743
So if you're keto,

01:31:35.743 --> 01:31:37.690
that would mean ketones, okay?

01:31:37.690 --> 01:31:39.240
If you're not ketogenic,

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.600
and I think most people
probably are not in ketosis,

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.370
or trying to maintain ketosis,

01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:44.203
but for instance,

01:31:44.203 --> 01:31:46.060
people that are on a
purely plant-based diet,

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:47.160
that would be one set of foods.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.720
For people that are omnivores,

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.553
a different set of foods.

01:31:49.553 --> 01:31:50.840
And for people that are carnivores,

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.123
yet another set of foods.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.090
If you want to eat more
of a particular food

01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:56.020
because it's good for you,

01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:58.550
pair it with something in the same meal.

01:31:58.550 --> 01:32:00.470
You don't have to hide it physically,

01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:02.400
or in the flavor sense.

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.250
You don't have to hide it
within that other food,

01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:06.340
but pair it with that other food

01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:09.900
that provides you a shift
in brain metabolism,

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:13.070
because that's really what
your brain and you are seeking,

01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:14.840
even though you don't realize it.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.210
How long will this take?

01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:19.990
Well, according to the
data in humans on sucralose

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:23.950
and the conditioning for
sucralose to have these effects,

01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:26.800
which, in many cases,
were detrimental, right?

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.410
Because they were increasing insulin.

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:30.740
But in this case, you're trying to

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:33.660
hijack this conditioning
of food preference

01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.940
for healthy purposes,

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.860
not with sucralose,

01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:39.200
but by ingesting things
that are good for you,

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.980
then the data really point to the fact

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.950
that even within a short period
of time of about seven days,

01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:47.120
but certainly within 14 days,

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:50.650
that food will take on
a subjective experience

01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:54.920
of tasting at least better
to you, if not good to you.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.490
Now, I believe this has
important implications

01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:59.460
for much of the controversy

01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:02.090
and food wars that we see out there.

01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:04.230
Food wars being, of course,

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:09.000
these groups that ardently
subscribe to the idea

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.330
that their diet and the
things that they are eating

01:33:12.330 --> 01:33:13.727
are the foods that are good for us,

01:33:13.727 --> 01:33:15.670
and that are the most pleasureful,

01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:18.550
and the things that
everyone should be eating.

01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:23.150
We see this with every community
within the nutrition realm.

01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:26.000
Now, of course, there are
studies that point to the fact

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.970
that certain foods and food
components are healthier,

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:31.120
probably for us and for the planet,

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.980
but you really see it on
both ends of the spectrum.

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.930
You've got people who are
on a pure carnivore diet

01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:37.730
who are arguing with a
lot of biomedical evidence

01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:40.430
that that's what's best
for us and beneficial.

01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:42.130
And then you've got
people that are arguing

01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:44.100
the same general sets of arguments,

01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.640
but for a purely plant-based diet.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:46.610
And then I think most people

01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:48.383
fall into the omnivore category.

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:51.920
What's very clear, however,

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.500
is that what we consume on a regular basis

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:59.620
and what leads to increases
in brain metabolism

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:01.530
leads to increases in dopamine,

01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:04.440
and thereby our motivation to eat them.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.730
So what this really says,

01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:08.600
is that what we tend to do regularly

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.260
becomes reinforcing in and of itself.

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.700
And I think, in large part,

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:14.170
can explain the fact that,

01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:16.010
yes, indeed, for certain people,

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.700
a given diet not only feels good,

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:21.420
but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:24.740
and kind of health beneficial
effects of that diet.

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.270
And they often will
provide evidence for that,

01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:29.700
whether or not you ask them for it or not.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:32.050
But that's true of every subcategory

01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:34.453
within the nutrition realm.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.770
Again, this is not to take away

01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:38.480
from some of the beautiful data

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.410
emphasizing that certain foods,

01:34:40.410 --> 01:34:42.510
and micronutrients, et cetera,

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.580
are better for us, or worse
for us, and for the planet.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.683
That's not a debate I want
to get into right now.

01:34:47.683 --> 01:34:49.220
What this emphasizes,

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:53.530
is that foods impact our
brain and its health,

01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:57.900
but they also impact
how our brain functions

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.750
and responds to food,

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:02.630
and that is largely a learned response.

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.500
We can't completely
override, for instance,

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:09.500
that certain foods evoke a
strong, [grunts] yuck component.

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.680
Certain foods are truly putrid to us.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.570
I should just say, certain
things are putrid to us,

01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:15.483
and we should not consume them, right?

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.890
At the far end of the spectrum,

01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:19.900
it's hard-wired for us to avoid those,

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.970
because they can be dangerous for us.

01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:24.150
They can make us very, very sick.

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:25.640
But it's also true,

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.790
that if we continue to eat foods

01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:29.550
that are progressively sweeter and sweeter

01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:31.000
and highly palatable,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.780
it shifts our dopamine system,

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.970
because it activates our dopamine system

01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:36.850
to make us believe that those foods

01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:39.960
are the only foods that can
trigger this reward system,

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.190
and make us feel good,
and that they taste good.

01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:46.070
But after consuming foods
that perhaps are less sweet

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:47.950
or even less savory,

01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:49.910
that are not what we would call highly,

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:52.320
or I would say, nowadays,
it's super palatable foods,

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.220
we can adjust our sense literally

01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.820
of what we perceive as an
attractive and rewarding food,

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.620
and indeed, the dopamine system

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:04.320
will reward those foods accordingly.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.550
I can't emphasize enough

01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:10.040
how much this learning
of associated food reward

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.790
is important for not just understanding

01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:14.570
why we like the foods that we eat,

01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:17.440
and how to eat more of foods
that are healthy for us,

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.070
and enjoy them,

01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:24.070
but it also speaks to the fact
that our brain, as a whole,

01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:26.820
is a perceptual device
trying to make guesses

01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.130
or estimations about

01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:30.450
what certain foods are going to do for us.

01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:31.990
So put simply,

01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:34.040
we don't just like sweet
foods because they taste good,

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.330
we like them because they predict

01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.223
a certain kind of metabolic response.

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.530
This is important also,

01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:44.140
because Dana Small, and Ivan de Araujo,

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.560
and others have been exploring

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.480
whether or not people, for instance,

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.830
that have type 2 diabetes,

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:51.090
or that suffer from any number

01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:52.360
of different metabolic disorders,

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.250
whether or not somehow

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:56.630
these food reward systems
are permanently disrupted,

01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:58.520
and through a beautiful set of experiments

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:01.610
that have been done by mainly
by Dana Small's group at Yale,

01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:05.810
but also by the de
Araujo group and others,

01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:10.300
exploring how the reward
pathways are altered

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.790
in various metabolic disorders, et cetera,

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:14.913
people suffering from type 2 diabetes.

01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:18.070
We don't have time to go
into all those data now,

01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:19.400
but the takeaway is,

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.300
that food preference,

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.770
and the ability to reshape these circuits

01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:26.150
is not disrupted in these people

01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:28.240
to the point where it can't be rewired,

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.370
and that's very encouraging,

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:30.710
because what it means is that,

01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:33.350
for people that are suffering
from these syndromes,

01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:36.803
through some simple
alterations in dietary choice,

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:39.890
provided those are carried out over time

01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:41.580
and in the correct way,

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.780
by pairing with the foods
that will appropriately

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.490
shift metabolism of the brain,

01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:48.780
one can actually rewire what they consider

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:49.820
not just palatable,

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.500
but attractive as foods.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:55.600
If you want to learn
more about food reward

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.830
and food reinforcement,

01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:59.150
'cause it turns out, those
are slightly different things,

01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:02.960
there's a wonderful review
written by Ivan de Araujo.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.070
They have a middle author,
Mark Schachter, and Dana Small.

01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:07.870
It's called "Rethinking Food Reward",

01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:10.830
and it was published in the
"Annual Reviews of Psychology".

01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:12.250
You can find it very easily online.

01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:14.070
It was published in 2019.

01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:16.280
And it's a beautiful, deep dive,

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.490
although, quite accessible to most people,

01:38:18.490 --> 01:38:20.720
about how different foods,

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.570
and the way that we perceive them

01:38:22.570 --> 01:38:24.030
impacts our brain and body,

01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:25.790
and why we like the things we like,

01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:28.070
and how to reshape what we like.

01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:31.140
So once again, we've done a
fairly extensive deep dive

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.690
into food and your brain,

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:36.830
focusing first on how particular foods

01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:38.800
and compounds within foods

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:41.280
that are available also
through supplementation

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.272
can impact immediate and
long-term brain health.

01:38:43.272 --> 01:38:46.800
Came up with a relatively short list

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.820
of what I would call super foods,

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:52.370
only because there are
ample data to support

01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:55.290
their role in enhancing short
and long-term cognition,

01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:57.330
and neuronal health, and so on.

01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:00.330
And we also talked about food preference,

01:39:00.330 --> 01:39:02.320
and why particular tastes,

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.300
and particular events within the gut,

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:07.700
and particular events
within the brain combine

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.950
to lead us to pursue particular foods,

01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:12.710
and to avoid other foods,

01:39:12.710 --> 01:39:15.370
and how you can leverage those pathways

01:39:15.370 --> 01:39:17.180
in order to pursue more of the foods

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.410
that are going to be
good for you, and good,

01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:20.420
not just for your brain,

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.150
but for your overall body health,

01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:24.010
and to enjoy them along the way.

01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:26.730

If you're not already
following us on Instagram,

01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:50.650
we are Huberman Lab at Instagram,

01:39:50.650 --> 01:39:53.170
and there, I do neuroscience tutorials

01:39:53.170 --> 01:39:55.240
that sometimes have
overlapped with the podcast,

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.090
but often, are original
content altogether.

01:39:58.090 --> 01:40:00.970
We are also Huberman Lab on Twitter.

01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:02.520
Another terrific way to support us

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.030
is by checking out our sponsors

01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:05.980
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the episode.

01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:07.230
we also have a Patreon.

01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:09.940
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.720
And there, you can support the podcast

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:13.123
at any level that you like.

01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:16.980
During today's podcast, and on
many other previous episodes,

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:18.840
we talked about various supplements.

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.010
One of the major issues with supplements

01:40:21.010 --> 01:40:23.320
is that supplement
companies don't always have

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.800
the highest quality standards,

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.310
and/or the amounts of the supplements

01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:28.420
that they list on the bottle

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.780
aren't what actually are
contained in the capsules,

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:33.100
and pills, and powders
of those supplements.

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.880
For that reason, we partner
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.920
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.050
with respect to the quality
of the supplements they use,

01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:44.400
and the quantity of the
supplements they use.

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.200
They partnered with all
the major sports teams,

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.240
and with the Mayo Clinic,

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.670
and we have tremendous confidence

01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:49.990
in the quality of their supplements.

01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:52.170
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:57.170
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.870
There, you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.

01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:03.340
And if you navigate into the main site

01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:06.460
through that portal of
thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.100
you can also get 20% off any

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.250
of the supplements that Thorne makes.

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:12.450
And last, but not least,

01:41:12.450 --> 01:41:14.149
thank you for your interest in science.
