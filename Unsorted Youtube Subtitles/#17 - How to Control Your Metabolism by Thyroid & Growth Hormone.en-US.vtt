00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.420
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.389
for everyday life.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.490
[guitar music]

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.290
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.700
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.850
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.110
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.110
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.960
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.980
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.270
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.280
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.473
Our first sponsor is Four Sigmatic.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.510
Four Sigmatic is a wellness company

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.100
that makes mushroom coffee.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.230
And if you're asking yourself,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.430
why would you want to
put mushrooms in coffee?

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.390
First of all, let me tell you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.040
these are not psychedelic
mushrooms and no,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.070
the coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.700
The coffee is delicious

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.930
and you don't taste mushrooms at all.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.020
I know this because I've been
using Four Sigmatic coffee

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.960
and been stocking it in my
laboratory for several years now

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.930
long before I ever had the podcast

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.140
or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560
The two kinds of mushrooms that
are in Four Sigmatic coffee

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.270
our lion's mane and chaga mushrooms,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.103
both of which have been shown

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:10.490
to have a slight anxiolytic
effect to reduce anxiety.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.310
And lion's mane has also been shown

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.950
in several studies to lower the symptoms

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.480
of depression just slightly.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.170
Although I wouldn't consider
it a treatment for depression,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.680
that's an attractive benefit,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.050
as well as have some effect at
offsetting cognitive decline.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.180
Albeit slightly, the effects were real

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.650
in the studies that I've found.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.363
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Blinkist.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.840
Blinkist is an app that has thousands

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.550
of nonfiction books condensed
down to just 15 minutes

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.520
of key takeaways that you
can read or listen to.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.240
I'm a big reader and I'm a
big consumer of nonfiction.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.840
And most of the time I consume books

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.400
in their traditional form like a book

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.420
where you flip the pages and so forth.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.680
I also listen to full length audio books.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.640
However, over time we know
that we forget lots of things.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.870
And even though sometimes I think

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.340
I got all the critical
information from a book,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.240
when I listen to Blinkist and
I get the 15-minute rundown,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.860
either an audio or in written form,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.980
what I find is there key points
that oftentimes I missed.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.020
And so it's a great way for
me to both jog my memory

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.300
and to bring forward ideas

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.410
that I hadn't considered previously.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.900
They have thousands of nonfiction titles

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.360
and some really terrific
ones in the science category.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.110
For example, David
Eagleman's book "Livewired"

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.880
which came out recently as a
book I read in full length form

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.957
and I've listened to the
Blinkist version of it as well.

00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:50.180
"Livewired" is a book
about neuroplasticity.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.470
The brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.340
I get so many questions and requests

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.270
for books about neuroplasticity.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.550
In my opinion, "Livewired"
is the most recent

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.380
and up-to-date and the best one to date.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.440
So that's there.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.690
David Sinclair's book "Lifespan."

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.240
David, as many of you know,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.787
is a professor of genetics
at Harvard Medical School.

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:13.950
"Lifespan" is this terrific
book about aging as a disease

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.570
and the future and present
of longevity treatments.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.910
Very interesting book.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.220
As well as Matt Walker's
book, "Why We Sleep."

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.540
Matt, of course, is a
professor at UC Berkeley

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.500
and "Why We Sleep" is a terrific book

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.980
about why we sleep, the
science of sleeping,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.650
and things you can do
to improve your sleep.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.410
All of those are on Blinkist.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.250
But with Blinkist you get unlimited access

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.850
to their massive library of nonfiction.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.973
This episode is also
brought to us by Munk Pack.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.720
Munk Pack is a company that
makes keto-friendly snacks

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.100
that taste incredible

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.040
but have just one gram of sugar or less.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.720
As I've said before on this
podcast, I am not in ketosis.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.080
I'm not ketogenic.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.020
I don't advocate or follow
any one particular diet.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.970
For me, what works is to fast
in the early part of the day

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.610
and to eat low carb and
keto-ish throughout the day.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.440
That's for alertness and attention.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.020
So I can work and focus

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.380
and I don't feel sluggish or brain fog.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.090
And then at night and in the evening

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.140
is when I tend to eat my carbohydrates

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.710
to aid the transition to sleep.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.210
That's what works for me.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.630
Munk Pack bars are a terrific snack

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.150
whether or not you're keto all the time,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.020
whether or not you're low carb,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.370
or even if you're not, they
are absolutely delicious.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.780
And I don't say that lightly.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.890
I'm not a big fan of bars in general.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.350
Most bars to me tastes like
a combination of, you know,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.350
a metal bumper mixed with some cardboard

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.170
and some lawn trimmings
and some artificial sugar.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.930
Munk Pack bars, when they were sent to me,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.000
I was like, all right, I'll try them.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.833
I tried it.

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.460
Like, uh-oh, this is a problem

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.170
'cause I liked them very, very much.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.610
And when I say it's a problem,
it really is a problem.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.700
I actually keep the Munk
Pack boxes in my basement

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.570
so that I don't tear
through them all at once.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.420
I'm a huge fan of the
caramel sea salt flavor.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.253
It's delicious.

00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:24.240
Just talking about it
makes me hungry for one.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.360
But they also have sea salt,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.910
dark chocolate, peanut
butter dark chocolate.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.050
They're terrific.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.410
In addition to being keto-friendly,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.640
they're also gluten-free, plant-based,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.900
non-GMO, no soy, trans fat,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.880
sugar alcohols or artificial colors.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.420
So all the bad stuff that you don't want.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.070
And as I mentioned before, they're keto,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.470
less than one gram of sugar.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.580

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.770
This month, we've been
talking all about hormones,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.870
which are these absolutely
incredible chemicals

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.690
in our brain and body.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.560
They impact our entire lifespan.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.130
So from the time that we are in the womb,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.500
they're controlling the development

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.540
of our brain and our bodies.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.460
After we are born,
they're still controlling

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.380
the development of our brain and bodies.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.530
And I did say development,

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.250
and that's because, contrary
to what most people think,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.020
development lasts the entire lifespan.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.080
From the time you're conceived
until the time you die,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.760
you are developing, you are changing.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.640
And hormones are constantly
updating and changing

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.720
the different functions of your body.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.060
They have two major kinds of effects.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.640
One are immediate effects,
so they can actually bind to

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.000
or kind of park in parking spots on cells

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.910
and impact all sorts of things

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.900
like the growth of cells, et cetera.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.340
They also can control gene expression.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.240
This is the way that
hormones during puberty

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.360
control body hair growth
and breast development

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.160
and growth of muscles and limbs and height

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.140
and all sorts of things.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.630
They are incredible.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.210
We've talked about
testosterone and estrogen.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.760
We talked about insulin and glucagon

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.020
and some of the other things.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.790
Today, we are going to
talk about metabolism.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.690
Mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.320
and growth hormone and some
other related pathways.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.880
I'm going to explain to you the logic

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.180
of how thyroid hormone
and growth hormone work.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.360
It will become obvious
why I've paired thyroid

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.810
and growth hormone together
in the same episode.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.500
And I will of course talk about tools

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.730
that you can use to elevate
or reduce thyroid hormone.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.610
There are cases where people
want to reduce thyroid hormone.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.180
I will talk about tools that you can use

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.170
to elevate growth hormone.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.550
There are rare cases where people

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.940
want to reduce growth hormone.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.400
Most people are interested
in increasing growth hormone.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.780
So today is going to be
rich with information,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.020
rich with actionable tools.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.080
And as always, the idea is to spell out

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.290
an organizational logic
so you can come away

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.630
from this episode and in fact

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.810
the entire month on hormones,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.230
really understanding at some level

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.930
what these things we call
hormones are and how they work.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.050
And that's really to arm
you to encounter information

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.690
going forward, whether
or not it comes from me

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.440
or from somebody else, a book or a course,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.110
someplace else online to
make sense of how to work

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.050
with these incredible
chemicals we call hormones.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.010
Before we begin to talk about
thyroid and growth hormone

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.540
and how our metabolism works
and how to control metabolism,

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.100
I want to answer a few
questions that I received

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.410
from you from the audience.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.280
Every once in a while,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.570
someone will send me a
quite earnest question

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.170
about something they saw on the internet.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.860
And one of the things I've
heard about quite a bit

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.660
in the last couple of
weeks as we've been talking

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.160
about hormones and food
intake and how those interact

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.670
is this question of are certain foods

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.680
particularly good for
certain organs of the body?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.930
And can that be predicted

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.180
on the basis of the shape of those foods?

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.860
So first of all, I want to
acknowledge the question

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.360
as a valid one, because I see this

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.630
every once in a while out there.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.840
People will say, well, you know,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.770
walnuts are in the shape of the brain

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.430
and therefore they are good
for your brain or, you know,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.150
a particular fruit like the
beet often looks like a heart

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.890
and it's good for your heart.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.440
And I certainly invite
questions of all kinds,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.210
provided they're sincere questions.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.210
However, I am not aware
of any science whatsoever

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.830
supporting the idea that
the shape of a given food

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.730
or object for that matter is relevant

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.520
to its functional role in the
body in reference to biology.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.670
Now, beets contain something

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.710
that we're going to talk about today.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.410
They contain a substance called arginine,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.810
which actually can control the dilation

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.800
of blood vessels and arteries.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.763
So it has some relationship
to heart and heart health.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.400
Walnuts contain various fatty acids

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.220
that maybe, I want to underscore maybe,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.230
beneficial for certain
aspects of brain health

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.010
but there's no evidence whatsoever

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.970
that the shape of the
food itself is relevant.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.760
And, you know, I think what's happened is,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.930
is that people have gone out there

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.370
and found foods that
contain certain substances

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.130
like carrots and vitamin A

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.530
or walnuts and particular fatty acids

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.960
or beets and arginine.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.080
And they've selected the foods

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.410
that happen to be in
the shape of the thing,

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.300
the organ that the particular
substance like vitamin A

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.580
or fatty acids and so forth
might benefit or support.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.370
But of course, there are
many, many other sources

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.620
of these nutrients that
don't come from walnuts

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.110
or from beets or from carrots.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.660
And so I guess the short way to put it

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.390
is that the idea that
the shape of some food

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.010
is an indication of
whether or not that food

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.010
would be healthy for a
particular organ in the body

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.640
is absolutely unfounded.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.620
I don't know of any evidence for it

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.170
and I'm not out to quash
anybody's great love

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.003
of these foods.

00:11:16.003 --> 00:11:18.030
I enjoy all the foods I just described,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.520
but the shape of things
in the physical universe

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.650
bears very little, if any, relevance

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.690
to the nutrients that it contains

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.560
and therefore the organs that it supports.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.400
So thank you for your question

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.074
but if you see that out there,

00:11:36.074 --> 00:11:38.650
I don't even think you
need to tell the person

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.930
who's putting that information
out into the world.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.640
I would just, you know, back away slowly.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.500
One other thing, before we
move into today's material,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.380
last episode, I talked about the problems

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.930
with emulsifiers in highly processed foods

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.120
and the way that they can strip

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.870
the mucosal lining of the gut.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.090
And they can limit the
signaling of hormones like CCK

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.180
that can signal to the brain satiety,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.310
the signal to stop eating.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.410
And then we got into a discussion

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.530
about artificial sweeteners

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.020
and I threw out Stevia as
an artificial sweetener.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.950
And several people
reached out to correct me

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.080
that Stevia is not an
artificial sweetener,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.040
it is a noncaloric sweetener,
and you are correct.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.970
I lumped artificial and
noncaloric sweeteners together.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.180
And thanks to many of you that
also sent me some references.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.220
It does not appear that
Stevia can negatively impact

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.310
the gut microbiome.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.960
It does seem unique among
noncaloric sweeteners.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.900
There are probably others out there.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.940
The other thing that we
discussed is how Stevia

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.160
can lead to slight
increases in blood glucose

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.960
but can also improve insulin
management just slightly,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.840
probably cancels to zero
in terms of its impact

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.860
on blood glucose,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.190
provided it's not at concentrations

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.370
that are super, super sweet.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.480
Ingestion of anything that's very sweet,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.130
whether or not contains calories
or not, artificial or not,

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.030
will create an insulin response.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.730
In fact, just walking past a bakery

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.210
and smelling delicious baked goods

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.170
can increase your insulin secretion.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.300
And so we just want to point that out.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.990
Thank you for the information

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.270
and the references that you found.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.530
Please send additional
ones if you do find them.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.490
And I appreciate that you
allow me to make corrections

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.690
every once in a while I must speak here

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.120
and the opportunity to make corrections

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.770
keeps us all on the same page.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.010
And please do keep any
feedback that you have

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.803
about particular things I
cover here coming my way.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.710
There is so much interest in metabolism.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.690
We hear about having a
high or a low metabolism.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.920
There are some people out there

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.190
who would like to reduce their metabolism.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.310
They simply can't eat enough
to maintain their weight.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.840
Most people, however, struggle
with the opposite issue.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.644
They struggle to maintain a healthy weight

00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:53.090
and/or their metabolism is too low.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.510
Now, there are a variety of reasons

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.200
why metabolism can be low.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.280
Today, we are going to
talk about two hormones,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.470
thyroid hormone and its related pathways

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.790
and growth hormone and
it's related pathways,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.570
which arguably are the two hormones

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.100
and two systems in the body
that are most significant

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.083
for setting your overall
level of metabolism.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.290
Before we dive into those,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.900
I just want to cover a little
bit of what metabolism is.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.960
And I want to talk about
which organs in your body

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.400
use the most energy.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.520
So metabolism is the
consumption of energy,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.860
not necessarily eating,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.110
but it's the use of energy
in the cells of the body

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.660
for growth of tissues,
for repair of tissues,

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.820
and also just for day-to-day
maintenance of function.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.450
A good example of maintenance of function

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.730
would be your brain.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.840
Most of your metabolic needs,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.970
your so-called basal or
resting metabolic needs

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.840
are for your brain, for thinking.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.720
If you were to just sit in a bed all day

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.830
and do nothing but think,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.600
that consumes about 75%
of your metabolic needs.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.850
Now, there's also moving around.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.580
If you have a job that
requires a lot of heavy labor

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.440
or lifting things or you're a new parent

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.520
and you're carrying kids around

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.660
and you're going up and down the stairs

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.950
or back and forth to the refrigerator

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.120
for formula, et cetera,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.810
well then you're burning more
energy, burning more calories.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.450
But even if you are
very physically active,

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.990
unless you're an ultra
marathoner or a marathoner,

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.720
chances are that 75%
of your metabolic needs

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.560
are coming just from your brain.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.420
And that's because neurons
consume a lot of energy.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.260
Neurons, of course, are just
the nerve cells of your brain.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.690
So these two hormones, thyroid
hormone and growth hormone,

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.920
we think of as related to
metabolism of things in the body,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.970
keeping body fat low, and
keeping muscles strong,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.830
and tendons strong and
repairing themselves, et cetera,

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.020
but they are also key for brain function,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.330
for the ability to
maintain cognitive function

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.810
throughout the lifespan.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.990
So the big theme I'd like to introduce

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.400
is that metabolism isn't
just about losing weight

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.930
but having a high metabolism,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.660
provided it's not too high, is great.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.600
It means that you will
have more lean tissue,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.847
more bone and muscle and
less adipose tissue, fat.

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:14.120
And we know that that's healthy.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.360
How much fat and how much muscle?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.290
Well, that varies,

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.220
and the numbers on this
are always shifting.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.220
But in general, muscle
and its related tissues

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.860
burns more energy than
does adipose tissue or fat.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.470
And the water in your body
doesn't consume any energy.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.030
So metabolism can be increased

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.380
simply by adding muscle to your body

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.540
and reducing fat or adjusting
the ratio of the two.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.520
But regardless, even if
you're not interested

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.590
in changing body composition,
these two hormones,

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.160
thyroid hormone and growth hormone,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.560
are super important for
metabolism of all kinds,

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.900
including tissue repair after injury,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.720
including maintaining cognitive function

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.700
and well-being and the ability
to think clearly as you age,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.720
offsetting dementia and so forth.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.720
So the big theme here really
includes the previous episodes.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.070
You don't have to have seen those episodes

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.120
but for the last three
episodes and today as well,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.480
we've been talking about hormones,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.390
these substances that are
released from one location

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.180
in the body that go and act
other locations in the body.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.320
I'm going to tell you how that works

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.900
for thyroid and growth hormone.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.610
But now that you've heard
about testosterone and estrogen

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.030
and you're going to hear about
thyroid and growth hormone,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:29.030
I want you to realize that
there's a repeating logic.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.570
First of all, there are
neurons in your brain

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.020
in an area called the hypothalamus,

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.200
which just means it's
below the thalamus, hypo.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.360
It sits at the base of your brain,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.360
in the front, it's part of the forebrain.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.190
So it's more or less above
the roof of your mouth,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.020
maybe about a centimeter or so,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.050
and then about a centimeter
forward in most people.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.847
And neurons in the
hypothalamus release hormones

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.300
that are called releasing hormones.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.980
So we've talked in previous episodes

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.610
about, for instance,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.190
So those are a little
neurons that then signal

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.290
another brain area called the pituitary

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.890
to release other hormones.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.070
Today, we're going to see this again.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:14.020
In the brain, you have neurons
that release thyrotropin

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.610
or thyroid-releasing hormone.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.860
You also have growth
hormone-releasing hormone.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.780
So anytime you hear releasing,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.220
chances are those are neurons
that are in your brain

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.250
and they extend little wires we call axons

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.110
into your pituitary and the pituitary

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.570
releases a bunch of hormones
into the bloodstream.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.410
And the pituitary releases things

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.580
that most often have the
name of stimulating hormone

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.700
because they stimulate organs.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.440
So in keeping with the
theme of thyroid hormone,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.540
you have thyroid-releasing
hormone in the brain,

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.630
tells the pituitary to release
thyroid-stimulating hormone

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.570
and then the thyroid, which
we'll talk about in a moment,

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.470
releases thyroid hormones.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.020
In the testosterone and estrogen episode,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.550
we talked about how you have
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.370
there's the releasing
again, up in the brain.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.100
Remember, releasing hormone
comes from the brain.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.460
Then you had things
like luteinizing hormone

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.050
and follicle-stimulating hormone,

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.090
which were in the pituitary
and those traveled

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.520
to the ovaries or the testes

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.740
and acted on those tissues, okay?

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.740
So please try and embed this logic.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.540
If you hear the word releasing hormone,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.710
it's coming from the brain,
and that makes it actionable

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.610
in certain ways that
we'll return to later.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.800
In addition, the pituitary is letting go

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.380
of all these hormones into the bloodstream

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.520
that are stimulating different tissues.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.710
So for thyroid, it's
thyroid-stimulating hormone.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.900
And then it goes to the thyroid.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.210
And the thyroid is a little
butterfly-shaped gland

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.240
that's right around the Adam's apple.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.580
If you want to see yours, not directly

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.800
'cause it's got skin over it,

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.120
what you would do is
you'd take a sip of water,

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.270
you'd look in the mirror
and you'd swallow.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.210
And the thing that moves up
and down, that is your thyroid.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.130
Now, some people call it your Adam's apple

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.820
because it sits right near
this protrusion in the trachea,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.670
which is the Adam's apple.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.360
No matter, whether or
not you're male, female,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.550
or regardless of what your
chromosomal background is,

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.450
everyone has an Adam's apple.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.100
It tends to be more pronounced in people

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.380
that got a surge of testosterone
early in development

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.650
because it has a testosterone
sensitivity to it.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.740
And that actually controls the timbre,

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.230
the so-called deepness of the voice.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.570
So the thyroid gland sits right there

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.560
and it's got four little bumps behind it

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.010
called the parathyroid gland.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.500
And it releases two
hormones into the blood

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.800
to stimulate different
tissues and their metabolism.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.430
And those hormones are called T4 and T3.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.640
So if this is already sounding

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.140
like a lot of information,
it's really easy, I promise.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.530
Releasing hormone comes from the brain.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.610
Stimulating hormone
comes from the pituitary.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.270
And in this case, we're
talking about the thyroid,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.040
binding up that stimulating
hormone and saying, oh,

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.873
I need to release something.

00:20:50.873 --> 00:20:52.430
And it releases T4 and T3.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.263
And guess what?

00:20:53.263 --> 00:20:55.060
You can basically forget about T4.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.150
T4, it's not completely
inactive, it has some roles,

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.040
but T3 is the one that's
more or less active.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.050
Now, what does thyroid hormone do?

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.500
A lot of people think, oh, thyroid,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.920
it's like metabolism and
people who are hyperthyroidal

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.640
have bulging eyes and are real thin

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.880
and people who have
hypothyroid are overweight

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.290
and their eyes are like are, you know,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.420
half closed or something.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.840
And indeed thyroid hormone controls

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.993
a lot of the features of
the face and the eyes.

00:21:20.993 --> 00:21:25.170
And it can control amounts of
adipose tissue and so forth.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:30.170
But the main role of
thyroid hormone, of T3,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.870
is to promote metabolism.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.960
And that doesn't just mean
the consumption of energy,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.900
it means the utilization of energy,

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.290
including the buildup of tissues.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.700
So it acts on all sorts of
target tissues in the body.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.370
It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.100
it acts on the cartilage,
it acts on the bone.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.460
And it's not just
involved in using energy,

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.030
it's also converting energy.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.780
I do realize I said that twice.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.750
It's involved in taking fats

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.010
and breaking them down into fatty acids

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.480
and converting those into ATP,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.800
which is an important thing
for cells to use energy.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.220
It's also involved in taking sugars

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.170
and turning those into energy.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.600
And yes, it goes to adipose tissue to fat.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.490
We have different kinds of fat
that we'll talk about today

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.580
but it goes to white fat

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.960
and it liberates or helps
liberate some of the fats

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.630
from those fat cells
and use them for energy.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.000
And this is why higher thyroid

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.400
is associated with leaner bodies.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.430
Lower thyroid is associated
with less lean bodies.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.620
So one thing that's absolutely
key and is actionable,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.400
we're right there already in
discussing tools is iodine.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.330
Iodine comes from things
in the ocean, right?

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.190
And here are a couple of
interesting facts about iodine.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.660
And then we'll talk about whether or not

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.010
you should be supplementing iodine or not.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:59.563
First of all, iodine is most common

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.080
in sea salt, in kelp and in seaweed.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.020
And most people can get enough iodine

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.773
from the food they eat and/or
the table salt they consume.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.640
Almost all table salt
from all over the world,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.103
regardless of where you
are, contains iodine.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.820
The thyroid needs iodine

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.990
in order to produce thyroid hormone.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.000
And you need sufficient
levels of thyroid hormone,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.210
not too much, but you need it.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.580
So chances are you are
getting enough iodine.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.200
Although, you might not,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.610
especially those of you
following a particularly,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.070
quote, unquote, clean diet,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.330
might not be getting enough iodine.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.750
Here's the deal with iodine.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.340
Iodine combines with an amino acid

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.430
that we've talked about
before called L-tyrosine.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.710
L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.880
There are some plant-based
sources as well.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.770
It is the precursor to dopamine.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.220
But in the thyroid,
iodine combines or works

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:01.220
with L-tyrosine to produce T3
and T4, the thyroid hormone.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.460
So you absolutely need sufficient iodine,

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.920
you need sufficient L-tyrosine,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.230
and then you also need something else,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.270
which is called selenium.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.780
And we'll talk about selenium in a moment.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.940
So there's a condition that shows up

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.490
in little pockets in the world.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:21.490
It's not super common, meaning
it's not very widespread,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.050
but in certain areas that
are far away from the ocean,

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.160
at one point, this was historically

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.030
in the Midwestern states
of the United States,

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.550
in some mountain regions
of other countries,

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.550
in some areas of Africa that
were far from the ocean,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.290
people would get extremely
swollen bulges in their necks.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.540
And this was called goiter.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.130
And the reason they were
getting those swollen bulges

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.720
is because the thyroid
itself was hypertrophying.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.660
It was growing in an attempt
to churn out more thyroid.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.760
And because it was getting a lot

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.863
of stimulating hormone from the pituitary.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.180
And I don't want to go
too far off track here

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.860
but as you recall,

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.700
the brain and the pituitary
are paying attention

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.687
in a cellular sense to the
levels of hormones in the blood.

00:25:12.687 --> 00:25:14.780
And when those hormones get too high,

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.330
they shut off the stimulating hormone,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.780
they shut down the signal to make more,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.060
kind of like a thermostat.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.820
When the levels are too low,

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.900
like there's not enough
testosterone in the bloodstream

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.020
or there's not enough estrogen,

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.170
the brain will continue to push
out the signal to make more.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.670
Similarly, if there's not
enough thyroid circulating

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.280
or there's not enough
iodine to make thyroid,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.940
therefore not enough
thyroid hormone circulating,

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.530
the thyroid gland itself
is not getting shut down.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.090
There's tons of stimulating hormone

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.510
and releasing hormone
coming from the brain,

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.620
like release, release, release,

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.057
and there's no way they
can make thyroid hormone

00:25:46.057 --> 00:25:48.460
and so the gland just gets
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.920
And so people get goiter.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.260
This is one of the reasons why
table salt has iodine in it.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.230
Although there are other foods

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.460
that have iodine in it as well.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.390
So how much iodine do you need?

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.440
Well, you don't need a whole lot.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.170
Some people who are hypothyroidal might,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.130
and I want to emphasize might,

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.820
you absolutely should talk to your doctor.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.010
This is a serious matter.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.140
Anytime you're talking about hormones

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.900
or manipulating levels of thyroid,

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.730
you absolutely want to
talk to your doctor.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.370
Some people benefit from
supplementing iodine.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.960
It is contained in most salts.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.720
It's in Himalayan salt,
not always, but often.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.990
I know these days, there's
a lot of excitement

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.040
about pink salts and sea salts and what,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.920
you know, they're kind
of artisan salt thing

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.450
has kind of taken off in the
foodie land, which is great.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.420
Some of them are actually quite tasty.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.240
You can just take it directly
if you like the taste of salt.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.290
But iodine can be supplemented

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.970
through things like kelp and
seaweed and kelp tablets.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.100
Now, if you are hyperthyroidal,
you make too much thyroid,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.820
that actually can be a problem.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.300
So really, the best way to figure this out

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.100
is to get your blood levels
tested of thyroid hormone.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.010
But there's so much iodine in the ocean

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.550
that believe it or not people
that live near the coast

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.570
can actually just absorb
it through the air,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.360
just by breathing ocean air.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.500
So that gives you a sense
of just how little iodine

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.700
you actually need to
consume in food or in salt.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.290
So if you're within a
few miles of the ocean

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.760
or you visit the ocean from time to time,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.620
you're probably getting plenty.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.550
It does have to come
together, as I mentioned,

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.910
with L-tyrosine,

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.853
and this is why foods
that contain L-tyrosine,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.993
and provided that you have
sufficient iodine in your diet,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.030
and if you have sufficient
selenium in your diet,

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.640
does serve to increase your metabolism.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.910
And that again is for the
growth and repair of tissues.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.600
And that's really important.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.550
It's not just about keeping
your metabolism high

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.950
so that you can be on
the leaner side of things

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.130
or adjust your body weight, excuse me,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.800
your body composition
ratios the way you like.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.080
Repair of injuries,
repair of brain tissue,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.880
clearance of any damage from neurons,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.480
clearance of any damage to the body

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.210
is also going to depend on thyroid.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.870
Again, metabolism being this kind of rate

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.470
of fuel consumption and
use in the body, generally,

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.010
not just about body mass
indexes and things of that sort.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.840
So let's talk about selenium
because it's really important.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.810
And even though most
people are getting a lot

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.763
of sufficient iodine,

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.310
and most people are probably
getting enough L-tyrosine.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:21.560
I'm guessing most people may
not be getting enough selenium

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.840
if their goal is to
increase thyroid hormone,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.100
at least that's what the literature says.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.520
Without going into the biochemistry,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.160
selenium is important in order

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.830
for thyroid hormone to be made

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.000
because of the way that
it allows L-tyrosine

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.520
and iodine to interact.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.150
And the thing is most people
aren't getting enough selenium

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.080
because they don't eat foods
that are high in selenium.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.640
Now, how much selenium you need

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.920
will depend on where you live.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.970
It actually varies country by country.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.370
Some countries I found

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.180
say that you should get 100 micrograms,

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.590
some say 200, some say 155.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.780
The average was about 155 micrograms,

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.380
the countries I looked at.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.780
People who are trying to
increase thyroid levels

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.010
might want to consume more selenium.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.550
And if you consume a vitamin, of course,

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.350
you want to make sure if it has selenium

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.920
that you're not overdoing it by consuming

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.120
a lot of selenium rich foods either.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.380
But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.970
that most people probably could do well

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.080
by ingesting slightly more
selenium than they currently are.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.260
Although, of course,
always talk to your doctor.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.080
Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.470
of foods to get selenium from.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.690
It has very high
concentrations of selenium.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.640
In just six or eight Brazil nuts

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.420
contain something like 550
micrograms of selenium.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.290
It's also present in fish.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.970
So certain fish like yellowfin tuna,

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.180
although nowadays whenever
I mention tuna or shellfish,

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.890
which is the other rich
source of selenium,

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.660
people will tell me immediately

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.240
there are all sorts of issues around farm,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.150
not farm, mercury, et cetera.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.250
So I've never particularly
liked eating fish

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.650
'cause of the way it tastes.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.780
So that's why I avoid it.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.920
But for those of you that like it,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.430
I'm sure you're much more skilled

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.610
in knowing which fish to buy
and which fish not to buy.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.830
Ham, of all things,
contains a lot of selenium,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.520
for whatever reason pork does.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.260
I'm not a big consumer of pork.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.760
Beef has some selenium,
but what's interesting

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.030
if you look at the sources,
you know, pork, beef,

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:25.640
turkey, chicken, cottage
cheese, eggs, brown rice,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.070
what you want to understand
is that Brazil nuts,

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.980
six to eight Brazil nuts has
550 micrograms of selenium.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.120
And all the other foods I mentioned

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.710
at much greater portion size

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.780
than equivalent to six
to eight Brazil nuts,

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.100
either by volume or by calories,

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.570
they have something like 30
to 50 micrograms of selenium.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:48.850
So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.450
I'm guessing most people aren't,

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.160
and you're not eating a
lot of animal based foods,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.750
which I know many of you aren't,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.900
then you're probably not
getting enough selenium.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.350
And again, you can have
these levels measured

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.350
or you can just check what
you're consuming and figure out

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.860
whether or not you're meeting
the ration that you need

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.900
in order to get healthy levels of thyroid.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.370
It is present in things
like mushrooms, but again,

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.630
in a bowl of mushrooms, you
know, what is the equivalent

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.610
to a bowl of mushroom is
12 micrograms of selenium.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.540
And if the daily ration is
something in 100 to 200 range,

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.200
again, look it up for the area you are.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.850
You can see really quickly
why even though things

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.040
like mushrooms and spinach
and milk and yogurt

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.100
and lentils and cashews,

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.380
and now we're into the vegetarian segment

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.040
of the list that I constructed,

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.770
you're probably not
getting enough selenium.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.960
So it's kind of an interesting thing.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.050
If you're an experimenter

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.160
and you get the clearance
from your doctor,

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.970
you could try increasing
your selenium levels

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.120
and see how that impacts your metabolism.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.090
Again, Brazil nuts are probably
going to be the most direct way

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.050
to get sufficient selenium levels

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.200
but because levels are
so high in Brazil nuts,

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.700
it also means that you
could overdo it as well.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.700
I'm not really aware of
what the consequences are

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.370
of getting too much selenium,
although you can get too much

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.490
of anything and I'm guessing
those consequences aren't good.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.640
I also want to mention that for children,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.710
their daily requirements
of selenium are much lower,

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:18.710
as low as 30 or 40 micrograms
for kids 14 years or younger.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And in some areas, I really
want to underscore this,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.140
the amount of selenium
that's recommended daily

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.090
is as low as 55 micrograms.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.190
So it's not that you should be shooting

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.200
for thousands or even
high levels of hundreds

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.810
of micrograms of selenium.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.310
And again, that's
micrograms, not milligrams.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.640
So again, look into what you need

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.730
but if you're somebody who's interested

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.730
in keeping thyroid function
healthy and productive,

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.810
then you certainly want to make sure

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:48.950
you're getting enough iodine,

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.810
you're getting enough selenium

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.630
and you're getting enough L-tyrosine.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.090
And it's interesting
when you start looking

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.980
at the various foods, especially
highly processed foods,

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.140
then you start to realize

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.560
that perhaps many people,
maybe you, are not.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.160
Not incidentally, selenium
has some other effects

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.440
on health that can be quite positive.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.200
And even though these
don't relate to thyroid

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.140
or growth hormone function specifically,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.310
I think you might want to know about them,

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.390
given that we're on the topic of selenium.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.720
The first is that there are three studies,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.380
all of which showed very high efficacy

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.130
for reducing the risk of
something called preeclampsia,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.560
excuse me, preeclampsia.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.820
Preeclampsia is seizures that are related

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.600
to blood pressure issues during

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.240
or around the delivery of a new baby.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.890
And actually, it's a rare-ish condition

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.410
but it actually can be quite deadly.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.880
And so the fact that selenium is important

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.840
for offsetting preeclampsia
risk is interesting.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.490
I don't know the exact mechanism

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.510
and I'm guessing there are
only a few of you out there

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.200
that are either pregnant or
thinking of conceiving soon,

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.490
but that's worth noting.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.590
Obviously, anything related
to pregnancy or lactation,

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.770
especially talk to your doctor.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.900
I'm guessing that selenium is probably

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.590
in a lot of prenatal formulas

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:10.570
but that's one clear benefit
of having sufficient selenium.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.220
The other is a reduced
prostate cancer risk.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.140
There's a study showing that
having sufficient selenium

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.203
can reduce prostate cancer risk.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.150
And there is some evidence

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.260
that if you consume foods
from areas with soil

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.810
that's low in selenium,
that can be a problem.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.320
And last episode, we talked
about all these issues related

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.033
to soil quality, things that
are making their way into food

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:36.043
that are disrupting hormones and so forth.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:40.300
But having sufficient selenium from food

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.640
could offset the low content in any soil.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.840
And so that apparently can
reduce prostate cancer risk.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.770
It's a minor effect

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.100
but it's a statistically significant one.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.470
And the other one is a reduction in acne,

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.620
which is interesting.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.730
I'm guessing that that probably has to do

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.260
with the thyroid hormone pathway

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.110
because of the way thyroid
hormone can impact the liver.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.910
And it turns out that the liver

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.910
and various biochemical reactions

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.420
in the liver can impact acne.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.750
And that's probably an
episode all into itself

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.120
but those are just some
additional benefits

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.220
of getting a sufficient selenium.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.070
Okay, so we're already deep into tools

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.970
related to making sure that
you have sufficient selenium,

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.430
iodine, and L-tyrosine
in order to make enough

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.660
thyroid hormones that can
support your metabolic processes

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.500
in your liver, your muscles, your tendons,

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.700
for whatever purpose,
keeping your metabolism high,

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.510
for body composition
reasons or for healing,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.830
for keeping your brain working well.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.580
Earlier I mentioned, there are people

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.720
who are following very clean diets.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.410
So these are people that
consume no processed foods.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.920
You know, any starch they might eat

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.550
is going to be maybe a rice or a grain

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.920
or any protein they might consume

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.910
is going to be either from, let's hope,

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.010
from humanely raised animal sources

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.480
or maybe they're pure plant-based.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.140
Believe it or not, those folks

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.930
are actually very
susceptible to low iodine

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.770
because it turns out that
diets that are very meat rich

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.320
and don't have many vegetables,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.150
as well as diets that
are very vegetable rich

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.040
but don't have many meats or salts

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.330
are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.930
by way of the iodine
pathway and other pathways.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.740
And so let me try and
simplify this for you.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.810
Chances are if people are
doing the all-meat diet,

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.950
they're not sprinkling, they're
not wrapping those steaks

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.230
in seaweed and they may

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.270
or may not be supplementing with iodine.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.040
Chances are they're probably
consuming iodine salt

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.440
but their requirements go up

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.880
if they're not consuming vegetables.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.420
People who are consuming
vegetables is kind of interesting.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.253
We always hear

00:36:50.253 --> 00:36:52.520
that we should have our
cruciferous vegetables

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.740
and those are so important

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.090
but there are actually substances,

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.810
compounds within high quality
cruciferous vegetables

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.700
that can interfere with
thyroid hormone function.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.010
So if you're eating a lot of that stuff,

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.670
a lot of cabbages and
just look up your other,

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.640
I think broccoli is a
cruciferous vegetable,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.960
and I won't read off the whole list,

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.890
you could just put into the internet.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.140
But we're always told to eat a lot

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.570
of the dark, leafy green stuff.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.510
Well, unless that dark, leafy green stuff

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.590
is kelp or seaweed,

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.960
chances are that we're
not getting enough iodine

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.390
unless we're adding salt to our food.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.860
And chances are that we may be lowering

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.950
the total amount of
thyroid that we're making,

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.950
as well as the fact that
in plant-rich diets,

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.710
it's hard to get enough L-tyrosine

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.300
and I don't want, you know,
I'm not here to inflame

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.070
any of the vegans or the carnivore folks.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.380
I don't take a stance
either way on any of that.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.970
I'm just learning, trying
to report the science.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.740
The point I want to make is
your health is important.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.730
So if you are purely plant-based

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.440
and you're eating a lot
of cruciferous vegetables,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.240
make sure you're getting enough iodine.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.410
It does seem like the
cruciferous vegetables

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.510
can increase the need for further iodine.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.173
And same thing if you're
purely on this all-meat diet

00:38:06.173 --> 00:38:10.000
or your keto, and you're not
ingesting many vegetables.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.120
So I always thought that the
cleaner the diet, the better,

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.030
but it turns and probably that's true

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:19.130
from the standpoint of, you
know, hormone regulation,

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.720
you know, estrogen and
testosterone and other hormones.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.510
The highly processed
foods really are terrible.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.110
There's so much evidence for that.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.760
The phthalates in plastics
and the processed foods

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.670
and the emulsifiers,

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.870
all this stuff we talked
about previous episode,

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.410
but it does seem to be that people

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.190
that are not getting enough
iodine for whatever reason,

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:44.320
really need to check out whether
or not their iodine levels

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.330
need to be increased because of the fact

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.324
that they're consuming so
many plants or so many meats

00:38:49.324 --> 00:38:50.540
and in some cases,

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.750
plants that actually
lower thyroid hormone.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.460
And not to beat a dead horse or cabbage,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.490
but there are a number of
things that iodine can do

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:01.000
that are positive that are sort of,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.190
they're related to thyroid, not directly,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.400
they're kind of offshoots
of the thyroid pathway

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.990
on their downstream of it, we would say,

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.410
in terms of how they
impact metabolic function.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.310
One of those is to reduce something

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.930
called c-reactive protein.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.950
Some of you may have heard
of CRP or c-reactive protein.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.990
C-reactive protein is
something that you want to keep

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.930
at modestly low levels.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:23.220
It's associated with
inflammation and various forms

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.620
of heart disease and even eye
disease, macular degeneration.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.100
So it does appear that
iodine supplementation

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.690
or getting sufficient iodine
from food, either works,

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:39.360
is associated with reduced
levels of c-reactive protein

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.610
in the blood and an
anti-inflammatory effect.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.010
And the anti-inflammatory
effect brings us back

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.810
to our old friend, interleukin 6.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.480
Remember, they're these
inflammatory cytokines.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.180
They have many, many names

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.020
because there are many, many of them.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.320
Interleukin 10 is the one
that's anti-inflammatory.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.330
Interleukin 6 is the
one that's inflammatory.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.450
Anytime you see IL-6,

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.170
that usually means that there's
an inflammatory response,

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.330
there's a wound, there's
inflammation of the brain,

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.170
somebody is either sleep
deprived or had a brain injury

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:12.190
or they're dealing with
some sort of infection.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:15.130
IL-6 is kind of a
catch-all for inflammation.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.070
And it does appear that
iodine supplementation

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:22.130
can reduce circulating IL-6
associated with inflammation.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.590
So in that sense,

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.340
iodine can have an
anti-inflammatory effect.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.680
So by now, it should be abundantly clear.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.230
If you care about thyroid hormone,

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.960
if you care about the
pathways that it impacts

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.530
like having a high level of metabolism,

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.300
which I guess if for no
other reason is attractive

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.580
'cause then you can eat more

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.780
and still maintain a
healthy body composition,

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.230
but also for brain health,
cognitive function,

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.300
tissue repair, all that stuff,

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.160
keeping c-reactive protein
low, keeping IL-6 low,

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.480
make sure you're getting enough iodine,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.240
selenium and L-tyrosine.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.477
If you're curious how
thyroid actually increases

00:40:57.477 --> 00:40:59.920
the metabolism, allows you
to eat more, et cetera.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.200
It relates to something
we covered last issue,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.690
which is glucose.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.860
Remember when you eat
something, blood sugar goes up,

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.340
insulin is secreted from the pancreas

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.470
and it makes sure that blood
glucose doesn't go too high,

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.470
which can damage tissues or too low,

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.133
which can make you hypoglycemic.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.810
Thyroid increases glucose uptake

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:21.360
by various tissues, in
particular muscle and bone.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.720
It actually can increase
bone mineral density,

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.830
which is a really good thing.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.190
As you get older, injuries,

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.120
when I say older, I mean
basically 30 and older,

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.840
the reason you can recover
more quickly from injuries

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.330
if you have a healthy thyroid
and healthy thyroid pathways

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.740
is because you can consume energy.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.800
That energy is diverted toward bone repair

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.960
and muscle repair and cartilage repair.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.810
And so the way it does this
again is by increasing ATP.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.030
But the whole idea here is that iodine,

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.420
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow
thyroid to be at healthy levels

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.760
so that thyroid then can
take glucose in the blood

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.330
and divert it to tissues
for it to be used,

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.580
in particular your brain.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.410
And that's why these things
that we're talking about,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.750
supplementing or getting from food,

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.940
can actually improve or
support brain function.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.970
People are always asking me,

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.870
what is the food that I
should eat for my brain?

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:16.470
Like, are blueberries good for your brain?

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.860
Or they do ask me, are
walnuts good for your brain

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.230
'cause it looks like a brain?

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.580
We talked about that earlier.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.240
The fact of the matter is what you need

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.580
are nutrients that support hormones

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.770
and biological pathways
that support the brain.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.980
That's the way to think about it.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.210
And I realized when people ask,

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.700
what should I eat to support my brain?

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.760
That's basically what
they're asking in short form.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.020
So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.890
at healthy levels that is,
is going to be terrific

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.820
for your brain because
75% of your metabolism

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.700
is from your brain.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.520
The ability of your brain to use glucose

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.060
or ketones for that matter
is going to be aided

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.230
by having healthy thyroid.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:55.170
So do the things, take
the things, eat the things

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.380
that are going to allow you

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.010
to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.840
I'm sure a number of you
are out there wondering,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.320
do I have healthy levels
of thyroid hormone?

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.890
Those can be measured from the blood.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.550
There are some telltale signs
of having really high thyroid

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.590
or really low thyroid, and I
could start listing those off.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.580
They're easy to find online as well.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.630
Things like bulging eyes,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.100
inability to maintain
weight, shaky, anxiety,

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.720
that's kind of hyperthyroidal,
thinning of hair,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.498
this kind of thing.

00:43:23.498 --> 00:43:26.750
I don't want to get into
diagnosing hypothyroidism

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.880
and hyperthyroidism.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.780
It's just impossible 'cause you're there

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.590
and I'm here and we're kind
of shouting back and forth

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.430
through a tunnel of video and comments.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.160
If you're concerned about
having excessively high

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.640
or excessively low levels
of thyroid hormone,

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.000
absolutely look up what the symptoms are.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.930
Talk to your physician.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.600
And there are a number of good treatments.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.400
I didn't talk about prescription drugs

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.770
that can improve symptoms
related to hypo or hyperthyroid.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.240
Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.610
So if you don't make enough thyroid,

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.200
you can take thyroid,
it's by prescription.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.220
If you have too much thyroid,

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.670
sometimes they'll take
out the thyroid gland

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:05.620
or they can administer drugs

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.290
that will either block
receptors or will interfere

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.420
with some of the pathways from the brain

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.010
to the pituitary or from
the pituitary to the thyroid

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.770
in order to adjust the
thyroid hormone that way.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:21.140
So there are the big guns
in terms of the treatments

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.140
for different thyroid disorders

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.050
but we're not talking
about thyroid disorders,

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.370
we're talking about how to get
and maintain thyroid levels

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.340
in healthy ranges and some
straightforward ways to do that

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.770
through diet and supplementation.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.200
There's also a lot of evidence

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.520
that for people who menstruate,

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.010
levels of thyroid hormone
can fluctuate dramatically

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.580
across the menstrual cycle.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.860
So that's really going to be
a process of experimentation.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.940
I don't know that you could,

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.560
you could, in theory, take
blood at different phases

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.220
of your cycle and figure
out whether or not

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.300
your thyroid hormone was
excessively high or low

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.700
at different phases of the cycle.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.570
That's going to be pretty tough to do.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:57.960
If you have an endocrinologist

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.250
that's willing to do
that with you, terrific.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:02.730
I think most people are
going to have to figure out

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.650
how supplementing the sorts of things

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:05.650
that we talked about before,

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.570
or getting them from foods relates

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.380
to different aspects of their cycle.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.310
In general, the first half of
the cycle before ovulation,

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:14.830
people crave carbohydrates and sweets more

00:45:15.677 --> 00:45:18.570
and that makes total
sense based on the biology

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.400
of the menstrual cycle.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.800
Thyroid hormone is going to go up as you,

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.850
as anyone, male or female,
menstruating or not,

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.560
increases more starchy carbohydrates.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.840
This is interesting because
ketogenic diets have been shown

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.680
to slightly lower thyroid levels.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.990
And that makes sense
because in ketogenic diets,

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.250
blood glucose levels are very low.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.940
And thyroid hormone is
secreted in large part

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.090
in proportion to how much
glucose is in the bloodstream

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.800
and how much that glucose,
excuse me, needs to be regulated.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.050
So I'm not trying to
demonize the ketogenic diet.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.410
I think it definitely has its place.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.670
There are 22 studies now

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.940
showing that it can dramatically
reduce blood glucose.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.320
And about a third of those show
that thyroid hormone levels

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.430
are slightly reduced,
sometimes significantly,

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:12.560
if not more, in the ketogenic diet

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.120
that may explain, I want
to highlight may explain

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.320
the fact that when people go
back to a more traditional diet

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.700
if they've been on a ketogenic
diet for a long time,

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.010
that oftentimes they will
gain weight very quickly

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.630
as they bring carbohydrates
back into their diet.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.500
Some people are cycling

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.220
between ketogenic and non-ketogenic
every three, four days.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.540
So-called cyclical ketogenic diet.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.830
Some people are staying ketogenic
for long periods of time.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.450
Some people six days on, one day off.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.730
So there's a huge variation there.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.400
The point is that carbohydrates,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.860
starchy carbohydrates in particular,

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.500
support the healthy
production of T3 and T4.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.540
And so if you're very low carbohydrate,

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.110
you're going to have a
reduction in T3 and T4.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.210
And so if you're going
to bring carbohydrates

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.360
back into your diet,

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.790
then you might want to
do it more gradually.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.430
And for those of you that menstruate,

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:01.550
and are craving carbohydrates

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:02.740
in the early part of the cycle,

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.000
that is actually associated
with having a healthy cycle.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.960
If any of you have had a healthy
cycle on a ketogenic diet,

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.850
that would be interesting.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:12.490
Maybe let me know through the comments

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.430
or point me in the
direction of some research

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:15.550
if you're aware of it.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:16.470
So as you can start to see,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.110
there's this really beautiful interplay

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.230
between the different hormones,

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:23.850
between insulin and glucose,
between estrogen and thyroid,

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:28.090
between thyroid and blood
glucose and the ketogenic diet.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.800
It all starts to fit together

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.590
in ways that make a lot of sense

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.680
once you understand just
kind of the core elements

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.760
of what the hormones are

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.030
and the variety of
tissues that they work on.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.130
The simple version of this

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:41.410
is if you haven't had a
carbohydrate for a year,

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.880
then your T3, T4 levels
are going to be pretty low.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.710
And I'm sure there's some
ketonistas out there.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:47.650
They're going to say, wait, no,

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.080
thyroid hormone levels go up with keto.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.670
That might be true for other reasons,

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:55.650
indirect reasons related
to hormone pathways

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:58.270
that are cascade from being in ketosis

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.270
for long periods of time.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:00.103
Great.

00:48:00.103 --> 00:48:02.680
But for most people that don't
consume any carbohydrate,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.280
T3, T4 are going to go down.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.530
And when they start to consume foods

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:08.950
that require thyroid metabolism

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.720
in order to work with, to metabolize,

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.860
then weight gain can
sometimes happen more quickly.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.550
So it's just something to consider.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.860
And it's something to work with carefully

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.300
if you're going to be cyclic
ketogenic, long-term ketogenic.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.520
And if you're not ketogenic,

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.060
and you're consuming carbohydrates.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.490
And the three things that
we talked about earlier,

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.590
selenium, tyrosine and iodine,

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.220
chances are unless there's
an underlying condition there

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.860
that your levels of
thyroid are going to be

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.210
in healthy range.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.150
Next, we're going to talk
about growth hormone.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.800
Growth hormone has
received a ton of attention

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.910
in the last 20 years.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.350
I actually remember when
it was for sequenced.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:48.200
This was a huge deal.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.600
There was a huge patent drama.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.820
I won't mention the universities
of the people involved.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.350
There were companies and
monster patents and payouts

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.740
and it was really interesting.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.240
You can look that up online

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.680
if you're interested in some
of the scientific history.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.510
Growth hormone is a
pretty straightforward one

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.350
for you to understand
now because it follows

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.300
the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:13.110
In fact, their functions
are so closely overlapping

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.840
on the, you know, when we
first look at the face of it

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.990
that you're probably going to think,

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.680
why do you have these two systems?

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.680
So just very briefly, growth
hormone-releasing hormone.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.850
So remember releasing means
it comes from the brain,

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:28.110
comes from the brain
and tells the pituitary

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:29.630
to release growth hormone,

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:31.040
and then growth hormone is released

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.620
into the bloodstream
where it goes and acts

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.000
on a ton of tissues, muscle, ligaments,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.950
bone, fat, et cetera,
to increase metabolism.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.460
It sounds just like thyroid hormone.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.840
And they do work in parallel.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.060
And that's why we've lumped them together

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.893
in the same episode.

00:49:46.893 --> 00:49:49.200
They increase metabolism and repair

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.453
and growth of tissues.

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.770
A conversation about growth
hormone would be incomplete

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.670
if we didn't talk about
the kind of extremes.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:58.180
There are certain people who are born

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.230
that don't make enough growth hormone,

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.100
and they end up very short in stature.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.697
There are certain people who
make a ton of growth hormone

00:50:05.697 --> 00:50:07.890
and they end up very, very large.

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.170
They tend to have very large appendages.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:12.200
They have something called acromegaly.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.740
It's kind of like a
ridging of the forehead.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.740
It's actually a bone ridge.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.060
They are giant.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.400
And it used to be called giantism.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.290
And most people of course
are in a range of height

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.170
and appendage length.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.270
That doesn't imply

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.940
that there's a growth
hormone disruption there.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.730
Growth hormone received a lot of attention

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.820
after it was sequenced because
that meant the opportunity

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.020
to inject growth hormone

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.890
and replace growth hormone that was lost.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.890
And there was actually a lot of cases

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:47.130
of people taking their
kids and trying to get them

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:49.399
to be taller for whatever reason

00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:51.790
by injecting growth hormone.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.410
Today, we're going to
talk about the things

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.100
that anyone can do to
increase growth hormone.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.830
And there are reasons why certain people

00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.663
would want to do that.

00:50:58.663 --> 00:51:00.130
People who overproduce growth hormone

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.400
certainly would not want to do that.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.390
People who underproduce it
would probably want to do that.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.710
People that make normal, quote, unquote,

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.130
levels of growth hormone
might want to do that

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.970
as they age because during
puberty and development,

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.820
the pituitary is churning
out tons of growth hormone.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.810
It's responsible for the
growth, not surprising,

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.570
of the body and all its features.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.200
Height, just being one of those.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.040
And so as we age, we
make less growth hormone.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.980
And that is one of the
reasons why we recover

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.240
more slowly from injuries.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:37.600
It's one of the reasons
why we accumulate body fat.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.250
And it's one of the reasons
why our metabolism slows.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.770
And so growth hormone replacement therapy

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.670
has been tremendously
popular in the last 20 years,

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.520
which is not to say it doesn't
carry its problems, it does.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.240
Here's one of the major problems

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.490
with injecting growth hormone.

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.920
Not saying people shouldn't do this

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.590
if the doctor has approved
it or it's in keeping

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.000
with their particular life goals,

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.433
but growth hormone, if it's
in levels that are too high,

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.550
will cause growth of all tissues.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.830
So not just muscle, not just reduction

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.570
in body fat by metabolizing, you know,

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.750
by allowing fatty acids to
be pulled out of storage

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:20.910
and used for ATP, but it
will also cause increase

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.990
in growth of the heart and the lungs

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:24.650
and the liver and the spleen.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:28.090
And so this is the concern
with abuse of growth hormone.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:29.030
So we're not going to be talking

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.140
about abuse of growth hormone.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.720
We will, however, talk about
tools that anyone can use

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.880
to increase levels of growth hormone.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.930
Some of them are behavioral,

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:38.630
some of them are supplement-based

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:42.280
and some of them interact with
behaviors and supplements.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.370
And what's cool about the discussion

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.820
about growth hormone is that the tools

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.980
that exist out there to
increase growth hormone

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.940
are very actionable.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.720
Most people can do these without the need

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.420
for any equipment or even any supplement.

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.890
Although there are some
supplement related themes

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.090
for tools for growth hormone increase.

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.720
And also the increases that one can get

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.230
in growth hormone are substantial.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.490
So normally, when you
talk about the difference

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:10.370
between taking something
as an exogenous substance

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.310
like testosterone or estrogen
versus using supplements

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.880
or behaviors to increase them,

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.130
you're talking about tenfold
differences from, you know,

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.880
administering the prescription compound.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.920
In terms of growth hormone,

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.530
there are things that can
increase growth hormone three,

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:29.090
four, 500% or more.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:32.230
And even though that's
a short-lived increase,

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.570
they can have very powerful effects

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.860
on metabolism and on repair of tissues.

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.480
So let's talk about those.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.540
Okay, let's go step by
step in terms of the things

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.500
that anyone, perhaps everyone,

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.670
should be doing in order to maintain

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.020
healthy growth hormone levels

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.200
or increased growth hormone levels.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.270
Unless you have overproduction
of growth hormone,

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.313
chances are these things
are going to benefit to you.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.010
However, as always, I want to emphasize,

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:00.750
talk to a doctor before you do anything,

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.340
including remove any treatments.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.150
So anything you would add or take away,

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:07.790
that's the responsibility of you

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:09.550
and your healthcare provider, okay?

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.850
I don't just say that to protect me,

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:12.960
I say that to protect you.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.740
First of all, growth hormone is released

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.570
every night when you go to sleep

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.170
and it's released in
the early part of sleep,

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:22.073
during so-called slow-wave sleep.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:25.800
So the two conditions that have to be met

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.210
in order for growth hormone
to be secreted regularly

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:31.620
for tissue repair, et cetera,

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.610
are you need to get into slow-wave sleep

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:39.410
that so-called deep sleep
and you need blood insulin

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:41.800
and glucose to be relatively low.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.740
So eating within two hours of sleep,

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.300
excuse me, eating within
two hours of going to sleep

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.200
is going to suppress
growth hormone release.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.690
That's very clear.

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:52.970
However, some people are
going to have problems

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:55.470
falling asleep if they are too hungry.

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:56.970
So you have to work with that

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:59.520
and decide what you're going to eat.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.420
And when you're going to eat that thing

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.640
so that you're not so hungry

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.840
that you're having trouble falling asleep.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.660
The episodes on sleep that were covered

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.760
in episodes two, three, and
four of the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.160
has, I believe, more tools
there than you could ever want

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.460
or make use of in terms
of how to optimize sleep.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.620
So you can refer to those, if you like.

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.850
So don't eat too close to sleep

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.430
and then get into slow-wave sleep.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.350
And as I talked about in one
of those earlier episodes,

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:25.820
the first half of the night,

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.380
slow-wave sleep and
deep sleep predominate.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.270
The second half of the night,

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.910
it's another kind of sleep,
we call it REM sleep.

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:36.050
So what is special about
this early phase of sleep?

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:37.370
This is how you should be thinking

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:39.200
if you listen to this podcast.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.400
You should be thinking, okay,

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.960
I hear that something is important,

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.560
it's related, it's in the pathway,

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.680
but mechanistically when we
say get into slow-wave sleep,

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.080
get into deep sleep,

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.990
that's when growth hormone is secreted.

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:51.750
The question you should
be asking yourselves

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:56.750
as scientists of yourselves
is wait, why slow-wave sleep?

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:01.470
What in particular about
slow-wave deep sleep

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:04.400
allows the pituitary to
release growth hormone?

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.410
Like, what is it?

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:08.270
Because if you can understand that,

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.490
if you can understand a
little bit of mechanism,

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:12.800
there are actually ways
that you can increase

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.810
the amount of growth
hormone that you release

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:18.260
both in sleep and out of sleep.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.610
So the answer is it's delta
wave activity in the brain.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:26.320
Delta waves are these big
giant waves of activity

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.930
in the brain that correlate
with slow-wave sleep

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:31.560
as opposed to faster waves of activity

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.450
that is associated with
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.810
So slow-wave sleep and the delta activity

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:40.810
actually triggers the
neurons in the brain,

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:42.580
the releasing hormone, right?

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.380
Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.040
to signal to the pituitary.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.320
Now, how do I know this is true?

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.230
And what can you do with this?

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:49.130
Well, we know this is true

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:50.937
because researchers have taken people

00:56:50.937 --> 00:56:54.750
and sleep deprived them,
and they just asked, well,

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:57.100
is it just one period
of time every 24 hours

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.260
and then the pituitary
releases growth hormone?

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.930
If that were the case, that would say

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.680
that growth hormone is just released

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.400
in a so-called circadian dependent way.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.460
Every 24 hours is the pulse of it, but no,

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.680
it's always relating to slow-wave

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.420
deep sleep and delta waves.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.410
And this is cool because what it means

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.470
is that even if you're not
measuring your brainwaves

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:19.490
during sleep, which most
of you probably are not,

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.040
you might be measuring slow-wave sleep

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.060
or deep sleep using a
device like a Whoop or Oura.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.230
And even if you're not,

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.500
what this means is that during the day,

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.440
there's the potential

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.380
to also increase growth hormone release

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.480
if you can get the brain into
the so-called delta waves.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.300
And it turns out there
are things you can do

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.310
in waking as well to increase
growth hormone release.

00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:42.890
So we're going to talk about those next.

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:45.330
But as a tool and to just really make sure

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.200
that we put brackets around this,

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.380
try and have blood glucose not too high.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.840
So if you do need to eat close to bed,

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.020
you wouldn't want to eat anything

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.610
that would increase
blood glucose too much.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.080
Try not to eat too close to bedtime.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.010
Get into deep sleep early in the night.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.990
Get the growth hormone release.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:03.970
And understand that it's
the delta waves of activity,

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:06.190
the sweeping big waves of
activity in the neurons

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:08.373
that stimulate the brain
to stimulate the pituitary.

00:58:08.373 --> 00:58:10.570
Because once you understand that,

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:11.940
then you have something to anchor to

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.480
in terms of thinking what
are the things I can do

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.190
in waking that will allow me
to release more growth hormone

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:20.970
which for most people is
going to be a good thing.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.600
Several times before on this podcast,

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.940
I've talked about the fact
that I'm not a big fan

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:30.240
of melatonin supplementation
for most purposes.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.393
It might be helpful under
conditions of jet lag.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.930
However, there are a lot of reasons

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.270
why I personally don't like melatonin.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:41.030
It interacts with the
reproductive hormones,

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:42.420
testosterone and estrogen,

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.530
and that whole access in
ways that are unattractive,

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.363
at least to me.

00:58:46.363 --> 00:58:48.770
It suppresses puberty during development.

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:53.110
It's present in much, much
higher doses in most supplements

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.240
than one would normally make
like a hundred fold, 300 fold.

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.250
However, today I'm going
to talk about an instance

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:03.870
where very low levels of
melatonin supplementation

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.170
might actually be advantageous.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.900
And that is aiding the transition

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:12.080
to the delta wave, slow-wave
sleep I just described

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.010
because that's the pattern of sleep

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:17.940
and brainwave activity that
triggers growth hormone release.

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.530
So whereas most melatonin
supplements are one milligram,

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.920
three milligrams, 12
milligrams, this kind of thing,

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.330
that is super physiological.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.330
There are some data
showing that microgram,

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:35.330
maybe 500 micrograms of
melatonin, so half a milligram,

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.970
can be beneficial in shifting the pattern

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:41.550
of early night's sleep
toward more of the slow-wave

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:43.650
deep sleep delta activity

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:45.930
and improving growth hormone release.

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:49.610
Not a lot of studies but the
ones that I saw are quality.

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.210
They were done in subjects that, you know,

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.660
both sexes, sufficient numbers, et cetera.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.580
So this is interesting.

00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.020
So if you're interested in
melatonin supplementation,

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.250
you might think about it
just at very low levels.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:05.130
You know, hundreds of micrograms

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.990
as opposed to the milligram dosages.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.430
Most of the ones out there

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.300
are going to be in milligram dosages.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.660
So that's one way that
some studies have shown

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:17.080
that you can increase the
amount of growth hormone

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.970
that's secreted in early phases of sleep.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:23.020
Now, the delta wave activity
and the slow-wave activity

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.830
in the brain being very important

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.360
for growth hormone release
and growth hormone release

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.830
being so important for metabolic functions

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:33.410
and peeling away unwanted body fat

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:35.840
and repairing tissues, et cetera,

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.630
forces us to ask, well,
what other things can we do

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.980
in waking in order to increase
growth hormone release?

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:42.813
So let's start

01:00:42.813 --> 01:00:46.540
with the ones that have
a potentially big effect

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.400
but are a little bit harder to access.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.210
And for that, I want
to point toward a book,

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:52.710
which is really kind of interesting.

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:54.470
It's not focused on growth hormone

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.000
but the book is called "Altered Traits."

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.480
This is the book.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.287
It's an excellent book,

01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:03.087
"Altered Traits" by Goleman and Davidson.

01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:04.860
"Science Reveals How Meditation

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.410
Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body."

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.120
Very interesting book.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.550
For those of you that are
interested in meditation,

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.170
and perhaps those of you who are not,

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.946
but are considering it,

01:01:15.946 --> 01:01:18.250
what they talk about in
this book is the fact

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:21.170
that meditation has two
separate lines of effects.

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.870
One of those lines of effects are things

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:25.260
that change your state.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.580
So you're stressed.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.910
You sit down, you meditate

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.890
and you relax and you go
into a particular state.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:32.660
The other are the changes
that occur over time

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.650
and those are changes in trait.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.720
So personality can actually change

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.720
with long bouts of TM meditation
or repeated meditation.

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:44.090
In any case, the reason we're talking

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:49.090
about "Altered Traits" today
is because certain types

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:52.760
of meditation can get people's brains

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.590
into states that very closely
mimic slow-wave sleep.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.700
If you hear snoring in the
background, Costello is,

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.470
sounds like he's in slow-wave sleep.

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:04.320
These big oscillatory snores

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.970
that he's in 23.6 hours per day.

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:11.340
So what this means is for
people that are interested

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.930
in increasing growth hormone,
a meditation practice

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:19.930
that allows you to get into
these slow-wave delta type

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.810
frequency activity in the
brain may be very beneficial

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:25.900
because as I mentioned before,

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.060
that's what's gating
growth hormone release.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.900
It's not just a circadian phenomenon,

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.010
it's actually controlled
by these brainwaves.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:34.970
I did look up binaural beats.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:36.970
I get so many questions
about binaural beats

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.730
and it's a really attractive idea, right?

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:39.940
Binaural beats, for
those of you don't know,

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.090
you listen to one frequency
of tone in one ear

01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:45.370
and another frequency of
tone and the other ear,

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:50.110
and then the brain essentially
takes the average of the two

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.870
or there's some other
wiring in the brainstem

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.060
that makes it not quite the average

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.600
but it takes the average of
the two for sake of discussion.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.310
And that frequency is
what the brain entrains

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.930
or maps onto.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:03.840
There are a lot of apps that are claiming

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.840
that you can get the
brain into delta waves

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.910
using binaural beats.

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:09.880
I could not find quality
peer review studies

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.930
supporting that, but I know
there are a lot of fans

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:13.260
out there of binaural beats.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.660
If you know of any literature

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.500
that's independent of the company

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.690
that makes the binaural beat technology,

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:22.010
so unbiased research,
please send it my way.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:26.580
But in "Altered Traits,"
Goleman and Davidson

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.360
talk about the fact that
people who do 20 minutes

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.970
of sitting meditation per day

01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:36.970
can access these slow-wave
sleep like brain states.

01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:38.320
Now, I've talked a lot on here

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.410
about non-sleep deep rest,

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:42.650
things like yoga nidra and hypnosis.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.600
I'm not aware that those will put people

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.890
into slow-wave sleep per
se, or delta waves per se.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.420
So we're really talking about 20 minutes

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.300
of more traditional type meditation.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.750
Okay, so we've talked about
very low doses of melatonin

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.250
as a way to trigger delta waves

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.640
and more growth hormone release in sleep.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.860
There's science to support that.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.140
We've now talked about a
waking behavior of 20 minutes

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.050
of sort of what I would
call standard meditation

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:10.030
or just sitting there,
concentrating on one's breathing

01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:12.340
to try and access delta waves.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.860
Binaural beats, no science yet.

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.693
Who knows?

01:04:15.693 --> 01:04:17.310
Maybe there's science to support it.

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:18.940
If you're aware of it, let me know.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.620
Now, let's move to the
things that one can do

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.130
that have been shown to have
what's, let's just be honest,

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:29.080
pretty enormous effects on
growth hormone release in waking.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.930
And these are things
that are very actionable.

01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:34.290
One of the things that
can have a dramatic effect

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:37.110
on levels of growth
hormone release in waking

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:42.050
as well as in sleep the
following night is exercise.

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:46.630
But the key is the type of
exercise and the duration.

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:48.910
Now, there's a logic to this.

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:51.340
There are hundreds, if
not thousands of studies

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.210
measuring growth hormone,

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:57.480
both during or sometimes after exercise

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.780
or the following night.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.500
And the conclusion that one takes away

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.140
from all of these is that exercise

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:08.640
has to be of particular
duration and intensity

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.810
in order to get growth hormone release.

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:12.560
So first I'm just going to tell you

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.570
what I found to be the maximum amount

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:15.930
of growth hormone release

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.910
as it relates to a
particular form of exercise.

01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:22.280
The particular form of exercise
is either weight training

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.850
or it can be endurance training,

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:28.170
but the endurance training
and the weight training

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:31.460
actually have to be limited
to about 60 minutes,

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.340
not much longer.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.350
Now, this is important

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:37.350
because it's been shown
over and over again

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.590
that if one exercises
too long with weights

01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:44.620
or endurance exercise, that
cortisol levels go high enough

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.540
that it starts to inhibit the testosterone

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.700
and even the estrogen pathways.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.460
This is why I believe
people who overexercise

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.800
or exercise a lot can lose
their menstrual cycles.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.180
They stop menstruating.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.090
It's why you get
suppressions in testosterone

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:01.400
if people train too long and too hard.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.970
The cutoff has always been, you know,

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.370
60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:08.830
It's going to vary a lot
from person to person,

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:10.770
but in terms of growth hormone,

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.570
the conditions that seem to lead

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:17.570
to the greatest growth hormone
releases are one, get warm.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.410
This is interesting, we're
going to talk about temperature.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:23.030
So a proper warmup seems to accelerate

01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:24.880
the release of growth hormone

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.280
once the hard work phase starts.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.570
So 10 minutes of warmup
or so was the number

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.000
that I extracted from all these studies.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.920
There's a beautiful review
on this, by the way.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.983
Growth hormone responses
of varying, excuse me,

01:06:40.527 --> 01:06:43.310
"Growth hormone, arginine and exercise."

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.960
We'll talk about arginine
in a few minutes.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.930
That's by Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y.

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:51.940
It was published in Current Opinion

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:54.520
in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.700
The Current Opinion journals are generally

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:00.150
of pretty high quality
in terms of the reviews

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.830
just because they tend
to be pretty recent.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:06.170
And then the references
therein are also quite good.

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:07.560
So what does this mean?

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.910
This means warm up.

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:09.900
And when you say warm up,

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.600
it doesn't mean just warm
up the limbs and tissues

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.130
that you're going to use
so you don't get injured,

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.990
actually warm the body.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.580
So there was actually some discussion

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.420
about whether or not
in cold winter months,

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.900
people should wear like a stocking cap,

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.240
bringing the conditions,
making the room warm.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.410
So getting the body warm as a
warmup seems to be important

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:30.400
because temperature of the body

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.640
seems to be an important condition

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.630
or prerequisite for certain
patterns of exercise

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:37.760
to maximize growth hormone release.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.000
So it's really interesting to me.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.970
I have an obsession with
how body temperature,

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:44.110
light exercise and food interact.

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:47.650
We're going right there with
the fact that if you get warm,

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:49.190
you bring up the body temperature

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:53.810
a degree or two or maybe
three, and then start exercise.

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:57.640
It does appear that
high-intensity exercise,

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.190
but again as discussed
in a previous episode,

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:05.260
not exercise that brings
muscles to failure

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.270
but close to it.

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:08.120
So if it's weight-bearing exercise,

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.150
it would be getting close
to that final repetitions

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:12.190
where you can't complete them

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:14.710
but not pushing through those
or even going to failure

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:17.520
but getting close leads to anywhere

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.990
from 300 to 500% increases in
resting growth hormone levels

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:26.090
and 300 to 500% increases
in growth hormone

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:28.340
the following night when you go to sleep,

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:30.260
which is incredible.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.960
Now, I want to dissect this properly.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.910
Okay, so one of the other conditions

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.520
that seem to be important, again,

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.490
was to have relatively low blood glucose.

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.530
So it's looking a lot like
the conditions you need

01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:44.250
for sleep in order to get maximum

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:46.000
growth hormone release in sleep.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.143
So not having blood glucose
too high or too low,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.610
that's a discussion unto itself.

01:08:51.610 --> 01:08:54.250
You want to have sufficient
energy to do the exercise

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:55.290
but getting warm,

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.230
not having blood glucose
too high or too low.

01:08:57.230 --> 01:08:59.790
So probably not eating
too close to exercise

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:04.300
or not in ingesting a lot of
sugars during the exercise.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.310
That was supported by
the fact that ingestion

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:09.350
of a sports drink that
contains caloric sugar

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:12.260
immediately flat-line the
growth hormone levels.

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.190
So really interesting relationship

01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:17.070
between insulin, glucose
and growth hormone.

01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.190
So then doing the training for anywhere

01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:23.080
from 60 to 75 minutes to
maximize growth hormone release.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.930
And then the other interesting thing

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:28.590
was that even after the exercise,

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:30.630
taking body temperature back down

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:35.140
to normal levels relatively
quickly seemed to be associated

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.160
with these big spikes in growth hormone.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.090
Otherwise, what would happen
is you get these big spikes

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:42.000
in growth hormone, but if
the exercise went too long

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.790
or if body temperature
remained too high for too long,

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:46.760
then you didn't get the second increase

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.930
in growth hormone the
following night, okay?

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:50.730
So I hope I made that abundantly clear.

01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:53.160
Warm up well, get body temperature up,

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.600
exercise 60 to 75 minutes.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.110
Don't go to absolute failure

01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:00.860
if your interest is in
growth hormone release

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.210
both during the exercise
and later that night.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:07.320
And if you can bring body
temperature back down

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.820
to normal levels by cooling off,

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.080
maybe cool shower or maybe
ice pack or something,

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.010
or maybe just turning
off the heat in the room

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.840
or going outside, whatever it is,

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.420
then you increase the probability

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.720
that you're going to
increase growth hormone

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.600
the following night as well.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.210
And again, these are big
increases, 300 to 500%.

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:25.050
It's almost like you're getting

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.390
a second sleep during the day.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.670
But if the exercise is too
hard, if body temperature

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:33.180
stays too high for too long,
you disrupt the whole process

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.850
and you don't get the effect
of increased growth hormone.

01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.420
Growth hormone is really powerful

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.100
but it doesn't work alone.

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.130
In fact, a lot of the effects
of growth hormone are mediated

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:43.700
by its effects on the liver.

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.610
So growth hormone is
released, goes to the liver,

01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:47.980
and then the liver releases
something called IGF-1,

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.450
insulin growth factor 1.

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:53.430
Insulin growth factor 1 was popular

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:55.720
in the neuroscience
community as an area of focus

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.290
because of its ability
to trigger improvements

01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.410
in memory and learning after exercise.

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.080
And indeed exercise triggers

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.774
both the release of
growth hormone and IGF-1.

01:11:05.774 --> 01:11:08.710
IGF-1 seems responsible
for a lot of the effects

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:10.600
of improved memory.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.050
Some people report that that is due

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.690
to increased number of
neurons or neurogenesis,

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.570
birth of new neurons.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:18.210
It's pretty clear that in humans,

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.870
that's not what's happening.

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:21.260
Yes in animals, not in humans.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.480
IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.290
on memory and cognition.

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:27.147
And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release

01:11:27.147 --> 01:11:30.520
and growth hormone release
is through exercise.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.510
Now, the interesting thing,

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.050
and the reason I'm bringing up IGF-1 here

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.500
is that certain patterns of exercise,

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.500
actually duration of exercise
have different effects

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.463
on IGF-1 and growth hormone,

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:45.810
depending on whether or not the exercise

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:47.590
is done by men or women.

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:50.550
There's what we call sex-dependent effect.

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:53.820
And the sex-dependent
effect is as follows.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.000
In this particular study
and several others,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.480
what they did is they had people exercise.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.760
They measured growth
hormone and IGF-1 levels

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.690
from the blood before,
during and after exercise.

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:08.390
And they could see when the
greatest increases occurred.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.750
This was standard sorts
of resistance exercise.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:12.843
So some squats.

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:17.350
There was a sprint like activity.

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:21.830
It doesn't really matter what
the specific exercises were.

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:22.930
None of them were to failure.

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:24.980
These were in kind of the 10 repetition

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.230
or less range, six sets.

01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:28.840
So kind of standard weight training stuff

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.630
that anyone might do.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:35.250
But what was interesting is
that women were able to access

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:38.070
the biggest peak in
growth hormone and IGF-1

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.410
early in the exercise.

01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:40.970
So in the first 30 minutes.

01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:45.190
So what this means is even
if you just have 30 minutes,

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:48.920
at least for women, there's
going to be a big increase

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.050
in growth hormone and IGF-1
in the first 30 minutes.

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:53.950
For men, the biggest
increase occurred later

01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:58.950
in the exercise, which was
at 60 minutes or so total.

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:02.620
And so the sex-dependent
effects are interesting.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.510
They point to the fact

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:05.810
that things like cortisol,
testosterone, and estrogen,

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:07.270
which of course vary in different levels

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:10.240
in men and women are going to impact

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.570
the release of things like
IGF-1 and growth hormone.

01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:16.290
And yes, they did control
for all sorts of things

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.930
like diet and they controlled for weight

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:20.030
and prior experience.

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:21.890
It's actually a quite nice study.

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:25.317
If you'd like to check it
out, it's by a Pierce et al,

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.940
"Growth Hormone and
Insulin Growth Factor-I

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.350
Molecular Weight Isoform Response

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.230
to Resistance Exercise Are Sex-Dependent"

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:35.820
in Frontiers in Endocrinology,
fine journal in 2020.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.130
So it's quite recent.

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:38.470
So what does this mean?

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:41.220
This means if you're exercising

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.840
and you want growth
hormone release, warm up,

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.390
do the type of exercise
that we've been discussing.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.010
Women, in the first 30 minutes,

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:50.690
is when you're going to
get the maximum benefit

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:52.630
in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:55.910
Men, you have to keep going
for the entire 60 minutes.

01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:58.270
So don't tap out early
if you're interested

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.880
in getting the growth
hormone and IGF-1 release.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.520
And the same conditions apply

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.710
about then cooling down and not making

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:07.030
the exercise last so
long that you don't get

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.840
the increase in growth
hormone the following night.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.310
My experience thus far
in doing this podcast

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:16.160
is that people fall into
one of two categories.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.950
There are the just tell
me what to take people,

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:22.010
the people that are really
eager to try supplements

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:24.250
and maybe in prescription compounds.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.030
And then there are people
who are a little bit more shy

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.490
about supplementation.

01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:30.080
They are more focused on what they can do

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.940
with diet and behaviors
and things of that sort.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.150
I don't have a bias either way.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.580
I try and offer tools that are supported

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.290
by the scientific literature.

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.350
And I always point to safety margins.

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:44.410
There are supplements that
can increase growth hormone

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.330
to a considerable degree and no,

01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:49.130
these aren't growth hormone itself.

01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:51.110
Although, that of course
will increase growth hormone

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:52.100
to a considerable degree.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.200
We will talk about
prescription drugs at the end,

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.480
not just growth hormone,

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.470
but some other things
that are quite prominently

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:59.550
in use right now,

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:03.580
in particular in the
entertainment industry.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.320
There are pretty interesting compounds.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.950
But first let's talk about supplements.

01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:10.550
So this has been known about for some time

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:14.320
but arginine, the amino acid arginine,

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.060
as well as the amino acid ornithine

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.590
can increase growth hormone
levels substantially.

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:24.660
Now, arginine has a number of effects.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.230
You can get it from food, you
can get it from supplements.

01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:30.830
Some people take it in
pill form or capsule form.

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:34.943
Some people will actually
take it by IV, intravenously.

01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:39.650
The levels and the amounts
of arginine required

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:42.610
to get big growth
hormone release increases

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:43.730
is pretty substantial.

01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:46.900
So some people will take
arginine before bedtime,

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.770
some people will take it before exercise.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:53.430
The prerequisite again
is low blood glucose.

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:56.880
Blood glucose is high, it's
going to quash the effect.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.770
The amounts of arginine that people take

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:04.300
are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams,

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.670
or sometimes even more.

01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:09.223
Although, this is definitely
a case of more is not better.

01:16:09.223 --> 01:16:12.840
There's a threshold at
which growth hormone release

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.880
is actually blunted by taking

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.880
more than nine grams of arginine.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.740
Now, nine grams of arginine
orally is a lot of pills.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.070
It's at minimum nine pills.

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:26.670
And it can cause some
GI disturbance, right?

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:27.810
People can feel nauseous.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:29.110
Some people will throw it up.

01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:34.110
Some people get some constipation
or diarrhea, et cetera,

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:35.570
or just stomachaches.

01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:38.500
I'm certainly not
suggesting people do this

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.510
that they take arginine

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:43.270
but that's the reason why most
of the studies that looked

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:46.180
at the role of arginine
on growth hormone levels

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.250
did it by IV, intravenous infusion.

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:52.640
So what's interesting, however,

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.020
is that whether or not
it's by mouth or by vein,

01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.230
taking arginine can dramatically increase

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.390
growth hormone release and the levels

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:07.460
or the amount of increase was anywhere

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:12.355
from 100 on the low-end but
anywhere basically from 400

01:17:12.355 --> 01:17:14.120
to 600% above baseline.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.770
So these are huge increases
in growth hormone.

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:19.320
Now, I've never tried arginine.

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.900
Arginine is out there for a
number of different purposes.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.980
One of them is to increase growth hormone.

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.970
Some of the supplements out there

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:30.320
to increase growth hormone
include arginine and ornithine.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.240
Arginine does have the
effect of dilating arterials.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.851
And it basically increases blood supply.

01:17:38.851 --> 01:17:42.170
The arginine pathway is
involved in vasodilation.

01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.250
It's actually the pathway

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:45.570
that's downstream of a lot of drugs

01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:49.090
that are used to treat things
like erectile dysfunction.

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:51.900
And anytime people have problems

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.070
with peripheral blood flow of any kind,

01:17:55.070 --> 01:18:00.070
they focus on compounds that
will either disrupt the enzymes

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.020
or will adjust the levels of amino acids

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.370
to get more vasodilation.

01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:07.550
So taking arginine for the purpose

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:10.320
of increasing growth hormone
will also have the effect

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.020
of dilating blood vessels

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.610
and for people with blood, excuse me,

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:17.280
with heart conditions, that
actually can be a serious issue.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.350
Now, here is something really important

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:20.810
and interesting to note,

01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:24.930
which is that increasing arginine levels

01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:28.440
with the specific goal of
increasing growth hormone release

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.460
can actually short circuit
the effects of exercise

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:34.360
on growth hormone.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.950
Several studies that I looked at,

01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:39.800
looked at the interaction
of taking arginine

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.390
and the exercise or just the arginine

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.810
or just the exercise alone.

01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:47.080
And so you don't, unfortunately,

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.700
if growth hormone increase is your goal,

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.190
you don't unfortunately get to
increase growth hormone 800%

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:53.880
by taking arginine and exercising.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.230
It always seems to be clamped

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.630
at about 300 to 500% increases.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:18:59.220
Still large increases.

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.960
So I make that point for several reasons.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.520
First of all, be aware that arginine

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.640
has these other effects on vasodilation.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.230
Take those seriously if
you have a heart condition

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:10.660
or take them seriously in any case.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:13.540
Second of all, you can
supplement with arginine,

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.270
not exercise and get these big increases

01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:19.160
in growth hormone by
taking them before sleep.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:23.340
But if you're taking the
arginine before exercise,

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.380
you're going to short circuit

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.070
or clamp the effects of exercise
on growth hormone, okay?

01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.770
So it's something that one could use

01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:35.460
but it doesn't have a
synergistic effect with exercise.

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:39.210
The two more or less cancel
each other out, not to zero,

01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:41.130
but you end up with the
same effect you would

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.890
had you done one or the other.

01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:44.310
So hopefully that's clear.

01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:46.280
The other thing is if one's goal

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.630
is really to increase
arginine in the blood

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:49.510
for whatever reason,

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:53.170
arginine may not actually
be the best way to do that.

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:56.210
Because of the way it's
metabolized in the gut,

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:59.430
it doesn't have access or get access

01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:01.660
to the tissues that
you're most interested in

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:03.250
in terms of increasing growth hormone

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:04.900
or vasodilation for that matter.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:06.080
And in that case,

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.280
there's something else called L-citrulline

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.900
which has powerful
effects on vasodilation,

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:16.900
powerful effects potentially
on growth hormone levels

01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:19.210
via the arginine pathway.

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:21.610
But basically L-citrulline,

01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:23.590
it acts as sort of a donor,

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:26.560
or it's kind of a biological
prerequisite for arginine

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.810
and can lead to even
bigger arginine increases

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:32.190
than you would get if
you took arginine itself.

01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:34.700
And so L-citrulline is out there.

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.030
Keep in mind that anything that dilates

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:39.130
the blood vessels will
lower blood pressure.

01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:42.050
So L-citrulline, yes, will
lead to increase blood flow

01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:44.660
for whatever purpose
you want to use it for,

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.210
whether or not that's pumps
in the gym or whatever.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.480
It also can lead to big increases

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.120
in arginine and growth hormone,

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.240
but it will lower blood pressure.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.180
So be aware of that.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.740
And understand that the biology
isn't so straightforward.

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.430
L-citrulline may actually
be the better way

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:03.960
to get arginine increases
than arginine itself.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.830
And ornithine can also
increase growth hormone,

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:10.180
although that's also
through an indirect pathway.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.140
And nowadays, there isn't a lot of focus

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.450
on ornithine as a way to
increase growth hormone.

01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:17.760
That was kind of all the rage in the 90s,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.760
not so much anymore.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.930
Nowadays, the people are really
in the know for this stuff

01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:23.420
tend to focus on L-citrulline.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.590
And if you're interested in
L-citrulline or arginine,

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:30.370
I highly recommend you
go to our old friend,

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:32.590
good friends, examine.com,

01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:35.940
because there you can
put it into their list.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:39.040
You can just put search
and it's totally free.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.430
And it will tell you that blood pressure

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.520
will be slightly decreased.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.500
Power output in the gym will increase.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.390
There's very strong
effects on blood glucose.

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:48.840
Fatigue is reduced notably.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.240
Big increases in nitric oxide.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.060
That's also related to the
increase in vasodilation.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:58.210
Plasma arginine, very high, excuse me,

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:02.020
notable effects, very
high support for studies,

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:04.900
which allow people more training
volume, aerobic exercise,

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.450
arterial stiffness is brought down.

01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:07.920
There's a huge list of things.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.700
Increase in growth hormone.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.550
So two studies showing,
this was done double-blind.

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:15.020
Great, you always want
to see double-blind,

01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.130
placebo controlled.

01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:18.990
This was only done in
males, not in females.

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:21.800
Unfortunately, just have data from males

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.800
but increases in growth hormone,

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:27.430
it's a small, but a
real significant effect.

01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:29.330
And again, from quality studies.

01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:31.430
So there's a huge number of effects there.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.710
And some of the other kind
of more interesting ones

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:38.620
about L-citrulline that you
might not have thought about

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.000
are things like muscle oxygenation

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.310
as we scroll down, decreases
in c-reactive protein.

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:49.740
So a lot of the same things
that you might affect,

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.080
expect, excuse me, from
the same sorts of compounds

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.060
we saw before.

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.190
The takeaway here is if you
want to increase growth hormone,

01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:57.830
think about the arginine pathway,

01:22:57.830 --> 01:23:01.110
but arginine itself might
not be the best direct route

01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.943
to get there.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.910
L-citrulline might be a better option.

01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:07.130
But please do consider take very seriously

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:08.630
the effects on blood pressure.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.910
So we've been talking about big effects

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:15.420
from supplementation or
exercise on growth hormone,

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.760
this extremely powerful hormone.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.360
And one thing to note is that
the profile of growth hormone

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.540
as we age, changes, I
mentioned that earlier,

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.570
but it's important to
understand how it changes.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.250
One thing that's particularly
interesting to me

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:32.010
as somebody who's in his 40s

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:36.670
is that it's actually
between ages 30 and 40

01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:38.050
that the amount of growth hormone

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:40.980
that you release each night is reduced

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.010
by two to threefold.

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:44.380
That's really incredible.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.070
You know, we hear so much
about testosterone levels

01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:50.010
going down as we age or
estrogen levels going down.

01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:50.843
But if you recall

01:23:50.843 --> 01:23:53.140
from the testosterone
and estrogen episode,

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.290
we talked about the fact
that if you really look

01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:58.130
at the data, just for
instance, on testosterone,

01:23:58.130 --> 01:24:02.190
there are men in their
90s and they are not rare,

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:05.520
it turns out, that are
making as much testosterone

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.300
and DHT, dihydrotestosterone,

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.820
as they were in their 20s, okay?

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.850
So we hear so much nowadays
about how testosterone levels

01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:15.570
are dropping, sperm levels
are dropping, et cetera.

01:24:15.570 --> 01:24:17.460
And I don't dispute that.

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.580
I talked about that in that episode.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.620
But it's clear that testosterone
levels vary tremendously

01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:24.000
from person to person.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.550
And just getting older
does not necessarily mean

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:28.800
that testosterone levels are dropping.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.430
Growth hormone levels, it seems,

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:33.950
are dropping when people
are in their 30s and 40s

01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:35.390
and they're dropping substantially.

01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:37.610
And that seems to be the
case across the board.

01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:40.490
You're just not going to find
people in their 40s, 50s and 60s

01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:42.580
that are making as much growth hormone

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:44.800
as they were in their teens and 20s.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.330
And as somebody who, I feel really good,

01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:50.700
but as somebody who definitely noticed

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.960
that as I got into my 40s

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.200
that even if I slept the same amount,

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.730
I wasn't feeling quite

01:24:55.730 --> 01:25:00.690
as I would say able to
recover from exercise

01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:03.540
or wound healing even with
the same amount of sleep.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.920
And I was trying to optimize
a great number of things.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.660
This business of growth hormone

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:09.430
became a particular interest to me.

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:11.810
And since the ways to
manipulate growth hormone

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:14.060
in men and women are so straightforward.

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.310
And since everybody goes

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:18.540
through this age-related
decline very dramatically,

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.010
it seems to me that the things

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:22.880
that we're supposed to be
doing anyway, like exercising,

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.660
like trying not to eat
too close to bedtime,

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.730
trying to optimize sleep.

01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:27.130
All of these are wonderful tools

01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:31.590
that we should be pursuing
and perhaps using.

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:34.260
And they can actually offset

01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:36.370
the two to three fold decrease, right?

01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:38.150
If we're talking about a
two to threefold decrease

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:40.270
for people that are in their 30s and 40s.

01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:41.940
And then we're talking about increases

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.200
from exercise or maybe
from supplementation

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.030
but certainly from
exercise of 300 to 500%.

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:50.990
Well, then, all of a
sudden we're in a position

01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:53.210
to actually offset the age-related decline

01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:55.820
in growth hormone completely
just through behaviors.

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.160
And I think that's quite
interesting and quite powerful.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.050
Now, I'd like to discuss a way that anyone

01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:04.170
can increase their levels of
growth hormone dramatically.

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.560
And when I say dramatically,
I mean dramatically.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.430
I'll get to the numbers
in a couple minutes.

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:13.140
But we have to remember how
growth hormone is released

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.510
in the first place.

01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:18.040
Remember, it all starts in the
brain, in the hypothalamus.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.590
The hypothalamus is a
brain area that controls

01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:24.440
things like sexual behavior,
temperature regulation,

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.840
circadian behavior, meaning
when you want to be awake

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.500
and when you want to be asleep,
aggression, all of that.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.170
There are other brain areas involved too

01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:35.210
but it has a rich collection
of different neurons

01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:38.920
involved in all these
very basic functions.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.600
Now, as we talked about
the releasing hormones,

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.700
the growth hormone-releasing hormone,

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.330
it comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.

01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:49.750
Those then communicate with the pituitary

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.980
and the pituitary releases growth hormone

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:53.870
and then the growth hormone

01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:55.710
acts on all these
different tissues, muscle,

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.433
liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:00.787
Makes them use energy.

01:27:00.787 --> 01:27:02.300
That's why you lose body fat

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.470
when growth hormone levels are high.

01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:07.493
It makes you grow muscle,
strengthens bones, et cetera.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.690
Now, one of the things
that has a profound effect

01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:17.310
on growth hormone levels,
growth hormone release,

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:18.810
is temperature.

01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:21.090
Now, the data on this are very strong

01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:23.280
and the data come from both animal studies

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.140
and human studies.

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.360
So there are a number of studies

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.050
that have explored how
making animals cold or hot

01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:31.720
can increase growth hormone.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.270
And if you're guessing which
direction this is going to go,

01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:38.200
you can probably imagine
that making animals

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.140
or people warmer is the way to go

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.250
if you want to increase growth hormone.

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.980
Now, anytime you're going
to increase temperature

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.700
of yourself or anyone else
or an animal, it is risky.

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.230
I want to be really clear about this.

01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:53.440
Not everyone should engage

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.653
in the behaviors I'm about to describe.

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.130
And I should just say
the reason it's risky

01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:01.080
is it doesn't take much
of a temperature increase

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.820
in the brain to cook the
brain, to cook neurons.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.660
And after that point,
neurons can't come back.

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:09.580
And people can die from hyperthermia.

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.470
We have a much greater
range in terms of cold.

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:13.030
You can also die of hypothermia.

01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:14.980
You can freeze to death.

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.230
But you have a much greater
range of getting cold

01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:20.450
than you do warming up the brain.

01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:24.810
However, there are really
strong data pointing to the fact

01:28:24.810 --> 01:28:29.810
that sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia,

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.060
not too high, however,
that sauna can increase

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.060
the release of growth
hormone and other hormones.

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.120
And what's so dramatic
about this literature

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.710
is the size of the
effects that are reported.

01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:43.543
So first of all,

01:28:43.543 --> 01:28:46.400
let's talk about these
temperature increases.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.510
And yes, I will refer to
things that people can do

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:52.370
even if you don't own a sauna

01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:54.810
because I realized not
everybody has a sauna

01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:57.060
in their backyard or
has access to a sauna.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.850
So first of all, recall our study

01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:03.610
about exercise where
warming up a few degrees

01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:08.010
before the exercise led to
bigger and quicker increases

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.150
in growth hormone during
the exercise about itself.

01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:12.680
So that already point in the direction

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.490
that temperature was important.

01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:17.740
Now, the degrees, no pun intended,

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:21.680
that we're talking about
increasing body temperature

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:25.180
is by entering saunas that are somewhere

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:28.170
between 176 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:30.663
so that's 80 degrees Celsius,

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:36.590
and all the way up to like
210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.520
I personally know people
that go even higher than that

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.450
but they've trained themselves to deal

01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:42.340
with very high heats.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:43.780
And again, high heat is dangerous.

01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.650
You must clear this with your doctor.

01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:47.500
Now, what happens in high heat?

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.780
A couple things happen in high heat.

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.050
First of all,

01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:52.410
you start getting bigger
stroke volume of the heart.

01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:53.550
Kind of like an exercise.

01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:55.730
Once you get well-trained
in endurance activity,

01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.220
your stroke volume and the amount of blood

01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.663
that your heart can pump
each time gets larger.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:02.890
You dilate the blood vessels, right?

01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:04.040
There are a lot of
things that happen also.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:04.873
You're sweating.

01:30:04.873 --> 01:30:06.693
Your body's trying to unload heat.

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.460
Dilation of blood vessels,
arginine, increases in heat.

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.670
We're starting to see
and hear a common theme.

01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:17.200
But it appears that getting into,

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.360
I'm not saying getting the body

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.847
up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,
I want to be very clear,

01:30:20.847 --> 01:30:22.480
I'm not talking about getting the body

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.930
up to 100 degrees Celsius.

01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:25.510
That would be terrible.

01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:26.450
You would die.

01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:30.210
But entering environments
where it's very hot

01:30:30.210 --> 01:30:31.410
for short periods of time,

01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:34.203
anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:39.020
where the temperature
is 80 degrees Celsius

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:42.570
to 100 degrees Celsius or
175 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.260
more or less, to about
210 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:48.920
more or less, has been shown to increase

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.770
growth hormone release 16 fold.

01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:53.200
That's right, 16 fold.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.830
That's 1,600%.

01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:58.060
Now, there are also
effects on other hormones,

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.540
prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:04.030
So the pattern that was
described in this study

01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:05.780
and there've been many studies now.

01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:11.890
Endocrine effects of repeated
sauna were done in 17 humans.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.530
This was from doing this repeatedly.

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:17.900
So it wasn't the first time they did this.

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.940
They had to do this three days in a row.

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:23.310
And the pattern was to get
into the sauna for 20 minutes,

01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:25.470
followed by a 30-minute cooling period.

01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:26.440
Remember, you don't want to spend

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.770
long periods of time at high heat.

01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:30.910
You can cook your brain and other tissues.

01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:33.370
Be very careful as you
approach this if you decide to.

01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:36.590
But 30 minutes, excuse
me, 20 minutes sauna,

01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:38.160
followed by 30 minutes of cooling,

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.650
followed by 20 minutes sauna again,

01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:42.720
led to a five fold
increase in growth hormone.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.160
And then by doing that
day after day after day,

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.170
on the third day, you would
see these huge increases

01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:52.680
of like 16 fold, up to 16 fold.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:54.470
And there are now many studies like this.

01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:59.470
This was described a few
years ago, but since then,

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.210
there've been a number of
other studies that have pointed

01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:07.920
in the direction of
deliberate hyperthermia,

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.000
but not too hot that you kill yourself

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.950
in order to increase growth hormone.

01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:13.790
And I know I keep highlighting
the dangers there,

01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:16.700
but again, anytime you're
going to mess with heat,

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.020
you have to be cautious,
you have to be careful.

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.950
So standard sauna can be useful.

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:23.520
If you don't have access to a sauna,

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.320
one way that people do this,

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.670
we have to look to our
friends, the wrestlers, right?

01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:31.270
They wear plastics, which
are basically bodysuits

01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:32.860
that are fairly inexpensive

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:37.860
that you can buy on any
online purchase platform,

01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:39.750
I should say.

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:41.440
Some people in the old days

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.440
before they had these plastic
things so readily available.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.700
I actually knew people
that wrapped themselves

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.680
in garbage bags and then
throw on sweats and a hoodie

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.200
and then go out for a jog.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.560
Again, you have to be really careful,

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.590
especially on a hot day.

01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:56.720
Overheating can equate to death.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.980
But that's another way to heat up.

01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:00.640
You don't actually need a sauna.

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.960
I've known people who will do this

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.010
in hotel rooms while they're traveling.

01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:06.650
They'll turn on the heat,
you know, make a hot bath.

01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:08.440
They won't actually get in the bath

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.340
but they'll fill the
room with steam and heat

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:13.390
and they'll put on a
hoodie and some sweatshirt,

01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.760
sweat pants, and they'll sit there

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.610
with wool socks on and they'll
get warm for 20 minutes,

01:33:17.610 --> 01:33:19.210
then they'll take a cool shower,

01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:20.820
and then they'll do it again.

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.750
I guess when the hotel
is paying the water bill,

01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:24.120
you don't worry about it too much.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.560
Some people of course own saunas.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.393
There are a lot of ways to do that.

01:33:26.393 --> 01:33:27.770
I have friends who were in the military

01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:30.690
who made saunas out of cars
while they were overseas.

01:33:30.690 --> 01:33:31.730
All sorts of things.

01:33:31.730 --> 01:33:32.930
You do have to be careful.

01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:34.230
I know I've said it many, many times.

01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:35.770
I just don't want anyone
to hurt themselves.

01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:38.090
But these increases in growth
hormone are tremendous.

01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:40.280
And what they probably stem from

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.920
are increased activity of
neurons within the hypothalamus

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.860
that stimulate growth hormone
release from the pituitary.

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.160
And that's probably

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.700
because the growth
hormone-releasing hormone neurons

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.470
in the hypothalamus sit very closely

01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:57.210
and may even be intermixed
with some of the neurons

01:33:57.210 --> 01:34:00.810
in the hypothalamus that regulate
heat and body temperature.

01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:03.540
Remember, metabolism is impart a heat.

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:06.150
It's like a furnace of how
much energy you're consuming

01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:11.120
and using for building or
for energy usage purposes.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.690
So sauna can be very, very interesting.

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.150
And again, it's 20
minutes, 30-minute cooling,

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:20.300
20 minutes again, proceed
with extreme caution,

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:23.230
but nonetheless, these
are pretty extreme effects

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:25.110
in terms of their abilities

01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:27.400
to increase growth hormone levels.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.500
Along the lines of
temperature and hormones,

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.480
I just want to mention
a very recent study,

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.750
it just came out.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:35.307
March, April, 2021,

01:34:35.307 --> 01:34:38.040
"Endocrine Effects of
Repeated Hot Thermal Stress

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.520
and Cold Water Immersion
in Young Adult Men."

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.530
Unfortunately, it was just in men,

01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:42.670
they didn't look at women,

01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:44.640
but nonetheless I think
the data are relevant

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.640
to everybody as a general theme.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.880
This is Podstawski et al.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.520
I will put a link to
the study in the caption

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.710
and they looked at testosterone,

01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:57.040
prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.170
And what they found was that the sauna

01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:04.190
does indeed lead to a
significant decrease in cortisol,

01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:07.080
a stress hormone, a hormone
that you want to be released

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.770
early in the day when you wake up.

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:13.350
But sauna definitely led to
significant decrease in cortisol

01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:17.540
but did not change testosterone,
DHEA or prolactin levels.

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.110
So that's interesting.

01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:23.150
And it turns out that the cold did affect

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.870
some of these hormones
but the results there

01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:27.640
were a little bit more mixed.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.000
So the takeaway here is that heat

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.620
seems to have positive
effects on growth hormone,

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.453
big effects.

01:35:33.453 --> 01:35:35.090
It seems to have positive effects

01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:37.660
on reducing cortisol levels.

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:39.680
And it does not seem to have effects

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.820
on things like testosterone,
DHEA, or prolactin directly.

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:44.670
You can imagine that
a shift in any hormone

01:35:44.670 --> 01:35:48.050
is going to alter the levels of
other hormones down the lines

01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:49.440
or have indirect effects

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:52.800
but in terms of direct effects just during

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.040
or immediately after the sauna
bath, there were no effects.

01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:00.580
So we've talked about
diet, supplementation,

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.590
behavioral tools.

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.900
And of course, we talked

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:06.840
about the underlying biology and logic.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.100
And hopefully you heard
the safety precautions

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.870
for all of those.

01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:13.750
Now, I'd like to just briefly talk

01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:17.390
about the prescription side of all this.

01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:21.610
There are, as we know, many
people taking growth hormone

01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:23.450
because it's been prescribed
to them by a doctor.

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:25.620
And presumably there are
people taking growth hormone

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:27.900
even though it has not been
prescribed by a doctor,

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.080
which is none of my business.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.880
But the point here is that most all

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.300
of the hormones that we
make have been synthesized.

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:38.780
So there are versions of them

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.073
in little bottles or little
ampules that people can inject.

01:36:42.998 --> 01:36:44.800
Here are a couple of
important things to consider

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.900
if you're going to go that route.

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:49.310
First of all, talk to
a physician, all right?

01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:51.360
They actually are only legally available

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360
through a physician.

01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:55.730
Second of all, anytime
you're injecting something,

01:36:55.730 --> 01:36:57.580
you're going to shut
down your own production.

01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.430
That's the way that the
hormone system works.

01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:02.830
If you take thyroid hormone,
you won't make thyroid hormone,

01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:04.100
at least in the long run.

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.500
If you take testosterone,

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.550
you will shut down your own
production of testosterone.

01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:12.960
If you take estrogen, the
system's a little more resilient

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.190
but eventually you will shut down

01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:15.720
your production of estrogen.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.060
And the same is true for growth hormone.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.440
So a decision to go that
route of taking something

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:25.170
is often not always a
decision to do it forever.

01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:27.690
However, if you're willing
to sustain a period

01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:30.010
of being without a given hormone,

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:33.480
some people can do things
and then stop taking them,

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.470
and then wait out the period

01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:38.040
in which they're not making testosterone,

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.070
estrogen or growth hormone,

01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:40.210
and then it will come back,

01:37:40.210 --> 01:37:41.963
sometimes and sometimes it won't.

01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:46.100
There's a kind of new
area that's developing now

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.210
that I think deserves our attention,

01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:51.360
not because I'm encouraging it,
but because it is happening.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:55.040
And in keeping with the
science and in keeping

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.950
with trying to keep things
modern, it's worth us discussing.

01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:00.470
And those are peptides.

01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:03.000
So these days you hear
a lot about peptides.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.120
I'd like to clarify a little
bit about what peptides are.

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.860
Peptides is a really huge
category of biological compounds.

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:13.970
Peptides are just strings
of amino acids, right?

01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:16.420
So we've talked about
L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.280
Those are amino acids.

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.810
Those are individual amino acids.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:23.010
And those are put together
into little small peptides

01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:25.250
or they're what are called polypeptides,

01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:27.063
which are just longer peptides.

01:38:28.245 --> 01:38:31.360
It turns out that for any
substance like growth hormone

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.970
or growth hormone-releasing hormone,

01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:34.560
it's made up of different amino acids

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.580
in different sequences,

01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.710
just like your genes
are made up of As and Gs

01:38:38.710 --> 01:38:41.070
and Cs and Ts, nucleotides
in different sequences.

01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:42.323
It's like a recipe.

01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:48.130
Peptides tend to be short
sequences of amino acids

01:38:48.130 --> 01:38:51.590
that resemble a hormone enough or resemble

01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:54.300
some other peptide enough that it can lead

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.140
to the similar same effects
when you inject them.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:01.360
So for example, we make growth
hormone-releasing hormone

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.260
from our brain which
stimulates growth hormone

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:04.093
from the pituitary.

01:39:04.093 --> 01:39:07.090
You're probably getting tired
of me saying that by now.

01:39:07.090 --> 01:39:11.660
But people now will take
things like sermorelin,

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:16.660
S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:19.570
which is not the entire peptide sequence

01:39:19.570 --> 01:39:21.510
of growth hormone-releasing hormone

01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:23.090
but it's a subset of those.

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.210
And when people inject it

01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:25.520
before they go to sleep at night

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.650
is typically how it's
done on an empty stomach.

01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:30.210
Then that stimulates the
release of growth hormone

01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:31.330
from the pituitary.

01:39:31.330 --> 01:39:33.560
So this is not taking growth hormone,

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:36.060
this is taking the stimulating hormone

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:40.210
or what's often called a
secretagogue or a mimic, all right?

01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:44.050
It causes a secretion of
the hormone that one wants.

01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:45.760
People will do this for
thyroid hormone, too.

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.290
Some people are doing this

01:39:47.290 --> 01:39:49.280
by prescription with a real medical need.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:52.150
Other people are doing it
for just longevity reasons,

01:39:52.150 --> 01:39:54.100
which kind of falls into that gray zone

01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:55.810
of they wouldn't die without it,

01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:58.640
but they want to enhance their
life and so they're doing that

01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.473
because they believe

01:39:59.473 --> 01:40:01.750
it's the right thing
for them, prescription.

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:03.110
Sermorelin is prescription.

01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:03.990
Do they work?

01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:05.520
Yes.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.030
Do they shut down your natural production

01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:10.770
of growth hormone-releasing hormone?

01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:13.340
Well, there, the answer is yes

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.400
but some of these peptides
actually have the effect

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.410
of changing gene expression.

01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:19.690
Remember, way back to the beginning

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:21.020
when I was talking about hormones,

01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:22.760
they can actually change gene expression

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.630
and they can actually
set pathways in motion

01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:27.580
for continued production of a hormone

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.920
even if you stop taking the compound.

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:31.770
Now, that can be good or that can be bad

01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:33.793
because as you recall, growth hormone,

01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:37.040
big increases in growth
hormone that are short-lived

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.320
like sauna, or, you know,
I should say exercise

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:43.723
or arginine or sauna, it seems
like has these huge effects.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.480
Or early nights, you
know, first phase of sleep

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.920
early in the night, these sorts of things.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.740
Those are transient.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:56.300
But when one is injecting over
and over at constant level,

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:59.320
you can put into action
gene expression programs

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.440
that can be long lived.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.450
And let's say, you have a
particular tumor in the body.

01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:05.570
Tumors will grow when
they see growth hormone

01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:08.350
even if that tumor is
unhealthy for you, right?

01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:10.120
You've got growth of
tissues all over the body.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.440
So again, I'm not saying whether or not

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.120
people should do these
things or not doing them.

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.740
One thing I do know is that
they are in very prominent use

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:17.820
in the movie industry.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.700
People who want to peel
off body fat quickly,

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:21.800
they do increase recovery time.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.950
They increase healing rates.

01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:26.190
People are also injecting
things like gastric peptides.

01:41:26.190 --> 01:41:28.240
They're actually stomach peptides

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.080
that we talked about in
the previous episode,

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.730
things related to the ghrelin pathway

01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:35.810
and other things from the
liver that can improve

01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:37.620
the rate of tissue and wound healing.

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.960
You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics,

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.470
lot of people are using
peptides and compounds

01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:44.840
and I'm not pointing fingers
at anyone in particular.

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:47.320
It's just this is separate
from hormone augmentation

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.040
of like injecting GH or
injecting testosterone.

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.710
People are now working
further up the pathways.

01:41:52.710 --> 01:41:54.410
Other names of some of
the peptides are things

01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:58.970
like ipamorelin, tesamorelin.

01:41:58.970 --> 01:42:00.870
Some of these have clinical uses.

01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:03.630
Others have just been made as compounds

01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:06.820
for people in the kind of longevity field

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.650
or the self-augmentation
field, if you will.

01:42:09.650 --> 01:42:11.290
So again, not promoting their use

01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:12.260
but they're definitely out there.

01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:14.170
And so now if you hear about them

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:15.650
or if someone's talking to you about them,

01:42:15.650 --> 01:42:17.210
now hopefully you have
a better understanding

01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:18.620
about their underlying biology.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:20.070
And you can think rationally

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:23.820
about whether or not they are
the right decision for you.

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:28.120
Okay, once again, covered an
enormous amount of material.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.380
Hopefully, now you
understand thyroid hormone

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.780
and what it does and a little
bit about its mechanism

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:35.350
or maybe a lot and growth
hormone and what it does

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:38.960
and how both of them take
care of our metabolism.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.500
They dictate how many nutrients
we can eat and make use of.

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.670
They can pull from body fat stores,

01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:46.510
repair muscle, repair cartilage.

01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:48.550
They really are incredible compounds.

01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:50.070
And they're actionable.

01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:51.010
They're things that we can do,

01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:53.510
like getting that early phase of sleep,

01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:56.660
perhaps supplementing
with arginine, maybe not,

01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:59.100
hopefully getting adequate exercise,

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.820
warming up properly, not
making the exercise too long

01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:05.330
or too intense will help,
maybe sauna or things like it.

01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:08.290
You know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,

01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:11.670
with the emphasis on safe,
might be things that are of use.

01:43:11.670 --> 01:43:13.210
Regardless, even if you're not interested

01:43:13.210 --> 01:43:16.060
in the thyroid or the
growth hormone pathways,

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.280
this brings to a close
our month on hormones.

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.150
And so now hopefully you understand

01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:21.670
not just thyroid and growth hormone

01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:24.370
but the logic that
underlies thyroid hormone,

01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:27.710
growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, why we eat,

01:43:27.710 --> 01:43:31.200
why we stop eating,
cholecystokinin, ghrelin.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.070
If these names don't mean anything to you,

01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:35.150
then perhaps go back and
listen to those episodes.

01:43:35.150 --> 01:43:37.080
But regardless, I hope that you come away

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.530
from this with a deeper
understanding about these hormones

01:43:40.530 --> 01:43:42.830
which are so powerful in controlling

01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:44.230
the way our brain functions

01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:46.680
and the interplay between
the brain and hormones

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:50.110
because it is really a
bidirectional conversation.

01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:52.210
The brain is telling body
what hormones to make.

01:43:52.210 --> 01:43:54.480
The hormones are influencing
all the tissues of the body

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.780
but also telling the brain

01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:57.500
whether or not to eat more or grow more

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.960
or think more, et cetera.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:02.820

We release episodes every Monday,

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.840
but sometimes we also really
short clips in between.

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.690

please check out the
sponsors we talk about

01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:53.330
at the beginning of the podcast episode,

01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.730
that really helps us.

01:44:54.730 --> 01:44:56.500
We also have a Patreon account.

01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:59.870
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:01.330
There, you can support the podcast

01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:03.610
at any level that you like.

01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:06.350
And I mentioned supplements this episode.

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:07.860
I often mention supplements.

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.450
They are certainly not necessary,

01:45:09.450 --> 01:45:11.330
but for those of you
interested in supplements,

01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:14.660
we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E

01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.220
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:19.170
in terms of the quality of the ingredients

01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:22.490
and the amount of the
ingredients in each capsule,

01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:24.660
tablet, powder, et cetera.

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.970
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:45:26.970 --> 01:45:28.890
as well as get a discount on any of those

01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:31.230
or any of the supplements
that Thorne makes,

01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:36.230
it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
dot com slash the letter U,

01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:37.640
slash Huberman.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.290
And you can get 20% off any
of the supplements they make.

01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:43.160
I should mention Thorne
works with the Mayo Clinic.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.110
They partnered with them.

01:45:44.110 --> 01:45:45.930
They worked with all
the major sports teams.

01:45:45.930 --> 01:45:48.010
So really the highest
levels of stringency.

01:45:48.010 --> 01:45:50.240
We're quite happy to be working with them.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.510
And last but not least, I thank you

01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:54.560
for your time and attention and above all,

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.198
for your interest in science.
