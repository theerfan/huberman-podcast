00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.248
for everyday life.

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:09.250
[bright guitar music]

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.900
I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.960
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.080
Today we are talking
about time perception.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.960
Our perception of time is
perhaps the most important factor

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.070
in how we gauge our life,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.010
that is whether or not we
think we are being successful,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.540
whether or not we are failing,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.310
whether or not we live in fear,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.470
whether or not we live
in relation to things

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.440
in a way that's positive,
and the reason for that

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.390
is that our perception of
time is directly linked

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.230
to the neurochemical
states that control mood,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.070
stress, happiness, excitement,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130
and of course it frames the way

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.720
in which we evaluate our past,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.670
so whether or not we think of our past

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.470
as successful or unsuccessful.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.670
It frames our present,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.430
whether or not we think we
are on track or off track.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.880
And it frames our sense of the future,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.530
whether or not we think
we have a bright future,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.450
a dim future,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.290
or whether or not the future
is very uncertain or not.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.900
Today, we're going to
talk about the science

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.170
of time perception and we
are going to talk about tools

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.030
and protocols that you can use
that can enhance your ability

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.060
to dilate and contract time.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.970
What do we mean by
dilate and contract time?

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.500
We can control the speed at
which we experience life.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.270
We can slow things down

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.920
or we can speed our experience of life up.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.010
And we can do that in a
very direct and dynamic way.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.490
It's actually not that hard

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.680
once you understand how
time perception works.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.560
So that's where we're headed.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.730
I think you're going to come
away from today's episode

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.660
with a lot of new knowledge
and certainly with many tools

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.330
that you can try in your daily life,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.800
whether or not that's work, sport,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.440
relational, emotional, and so on.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.460
Before we begin our discussion
about time perception,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.000
I'd like to answer some
questions that I received

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.130
related to the episode on fasting

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.890
and time-restricted feeding.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.130
If you haven't seen that episode,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.870
this information should
still be of use to you.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.050
Time-restricted feeding involves eating

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.560
for a particular period of time

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.730
in each 24-hour cycle
that's fairly regular.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.220
So this would be an eight-hour most often

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.290
or a 10-hour block.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.720
Some people do shorter feeding
windows, but regardless,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.100
that feeding window is supposed to fall

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.840
at more or less the same
period within each 24-hour day.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.840
This has a number of positive
effects on gene expression

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.510
that regulate a number of positive effects

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.180
on the different tissues of
the body, and for some people,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.960
not all, but for some people
makes weight loss easier

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.070
because of the way that
they are not eating

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.860
for large periods of each 24-hour cycle.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.490
In any event, one of the
major questions I got

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.040
after that episode was do
supplements break a fast?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.970
And during that episode,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.300
I talked about what breaks
a fast is highly contextual.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.480
It basically boils down

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.260
to whether or not something you ingest,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.570
whether it be liquid or food,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.500
increases your resting blood glucose,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.010
how much it increases that
resting blood glucose,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.800
and how long that increase lasts.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.010
So you can check out the episode

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.500
for more about what breaks a fast,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.220
but to address this
issue about supplements

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.950
and whether or not supplements
in particular break a fast,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.590
many of the questions were
about Athletic Greens.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.530
Athletic Greens is a
sponsor of this podcast.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.070
It is also a terrific
supplement that I'd been taking

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.000
for more than a decade
before this podcast launched.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.390
And many people have been using

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.880
and continue to use Athletic Greens.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.960
Does Athletic Greens break a fast?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.260
Well, that will somewhat depend

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.430
on whether or not your
resting blood glucose

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.080
tends to run high or
low, but for most people,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.170
including me, because I've measured it,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.610
ingesting Athletic Greens
does not break a fast

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.210
and if it happens to break a fast,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.840
it would be a very
transient break in fast.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.580
So without knowing your
resting blood glucose levels

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.090
on an individual basis, there's
no way I can say for sure

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.920
that it doesn't break a fast,
but chances are it does not

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.420
because it doesn't contain
much carbohydrate or sugar

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.720
and it doesn't tend to therefore pull you

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.340
out of the molecular mill you associated

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.280
with low blood glucose states.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.240
The other question I get
is whether or not things

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.600
like fish oil break a
fast, and once again,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.010
this will be contextual,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.930
but because fish oil is
a fat, an essential fat,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.853
mainly essential fatty acids,
in particular EPA and DHA,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.920
those don't tend to raise
blood glucose very much.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.790
In my case, having measured

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.940
using a continuous glucose
monitor my resting blood glucose,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.750
fish oil does not in any way change

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.680
my resting blood glucose.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.190
Chances are it won't do that
for most people as well.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.230
So does fish oil break a
fast? Chances are it does not.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.870
And of course people wanted to know

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.890
about pill-type supplements, you know,

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.010
caffeine and things that raise dopamine

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.490
and their vitamins and minerals.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.270
In general, if something
doesn't contain sugar

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.330
or much carbohydrate of any kind,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.540
it's not going to raise
blood glucose very much.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.530
Now, of course, protein
can raise blood glucose

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.280
and fat can too as well,
although to a lesser extent.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.030
So again, this is all contextual,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.130
but at least by the logic
that I just spelled out,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.820
Athletic Greens, fish oil,
and most forms of supplements,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.740
provided they don't have any
sugar or protein content,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.740
should not quote unquote break a fast.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.560
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.810
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.570
and research roles at Stanford.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.840
It is however part of my desire and effort

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.237
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:25.040
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.070
In keeping with that theme,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.900
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.180
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.030
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.660
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.080
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.080
and one of the key things
about our visual system

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.020
is that it's designed so
that when you move into areas

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.670
where it's sunny or
where there are shadows,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.860
you can still see things
with crystal clarity.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.030
Many sunglasses out there have the problem

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.670
that you have to keep taking them off

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.520
and putting them back on

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.640
depending on the overall
so-called ambient environment

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.510
that you're in.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.380
ROKA sunglasses have solved this problem

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.860
and their eyeglasses
also have super clarity

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.530
regardless of overall
ambient lighting, as we say.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.400
In other words, you see
everything very clearly

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.510
no matter where you are.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.250
They also come in a number
of different styles.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.620
The aesthetics are really terrific.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.333
So unlike a lot of
performance glasses out there

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.360
that make people look like cyborgs,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.193
you can wear them anywhere.

00:06:18.193 --> 00:06:19.080
You can wear them to dinner.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.370
You can wear them to school or work

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.290
or in social engagements and
you can wear them running

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.180
and cycling and out doing
your various activities.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.610
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.320
you can go to ROKA that's R-O-K-A, .com

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.740
and enter the code Huberman

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.300
to save 20% off your first order.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.230
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.690
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.160
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.170
I started using Athletic
Greens way back in 2012

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.830
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.740
The reason that I started
using Athletic Greens

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.270
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.890
once or twice every day is that it covers

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.070
all of my foundational needs for vitamins,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.810
minerals, and probiotics.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.390
In fact, when people ask me

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.410
what supplements they should take,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.170
if I were going to recommend
just one supplement,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.920
it would be Athletic Greens
because of the enormous number

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.770
of biological factors that
it impacts in a positive way.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.630
It has, as I mentioned,
vitamins and minerals.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.610
The probiotics are really
important for the gut microbiome

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.430
and gut health which is
important for the immune system

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.230
and for brain health and for mood

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.150
and a number of other important factors

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.960
including hormones and so on.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.420
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.330
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.860
to claim their special offer.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.510
They'll give you five free travel packs

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.480
which make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.270
while you're on the road or in the car.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.800
And they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.510
Vitamin D3 and K2 have been
shown to be really important

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.770
for a number of important
aspects of your immediate

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.360
and long-term health
including blood lipid profiles

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.620
and a number of other things.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.450
Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.600
to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.660
and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.368
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:07:57.368 --> 00:07:59.820
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.210
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.770
to help you better understand your body

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.880
and help you reach your health goals.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.340
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.840
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.650
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.310
can only be analyzed
from a quality blood test

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.080
and it's for that reason
that I get my blood work done

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.900
once every four to six months.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.480
Might seem like a lot,
but it has been vital

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.930
in order to keep my health where I want it

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.340
and to ensure that my
health trajectory is heading

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.050
in the direction that I'd like it to go

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.940
with each passing year.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.830
The other thing about InsideTracker
is they have DNA tests

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.750
which can tell you about the
specific makeup of your genes

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.120
that can impact your particular nutrition,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.480
lifestyle, and supplementation regimes.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.520
They can also help you
steer your immediate

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.310
and long-term health in the
direction that you want to go.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.550
They make the whole thing very, very easy.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.210
You can have the blood test taken at home

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.000
or you can go to a local clinic.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.160
Then the results come back
and the wonderful thing is

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.550
the platform, the dashboard that they use

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.410
walks you through your data

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.430
and points to specific
things related to nutrition.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.850
Maybe you should be eating
more of certain things,

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.710
eating less of others, supplementing
in certain ways or not.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.040
And lifestyle factors like exercise

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.000
in order to bring the
numbers into the ranges

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.570
that are right for your
immediate and long-term health.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.020

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.070
So let's talk about time perception

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.560
and the most fundamental
aspect of time perception

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.740
is something called entrainment.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.630
Entrainment is the way in
which your internal processes,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.080
your biology and your psychology,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.340
are linked to some external thing.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.440
And the most basic form of entrainment

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.710
that we are all a slave to all year round

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.710
for our entire life are
so-called circannual rhythms.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.450
We have neurons, nerve cells
in our eye, in our brain,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.280
and in our body that are
marking off the passage of time

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.420
throughout the year,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.190
literally a calendar system
in your brain and body.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.983
And the way this works
is beautifully simple.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.320
Light seen by your eyes
inhibits, meaning it reduces,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.470
the amount of a hormone released

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.390
in your brain called melatonin.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.910
Melatonin has two major functions.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.170
One function is to make
you sleepy at night

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.290
and the other is to regulate
some of the other hormones

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.940
of the body, in particular
testosterone and estrogen.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.090
When we view light,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.100
we reduce the amount
of melatonin released.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.930
In fact, if you wake up in
the middle of the night,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.470
when melatonin typically is
pretty high in your brain

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.620
and body and you flip on a
bright light in the bathroom,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.660
your melatonin levels crash down

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.550
to almost zero and stay there.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.860
Light is a very powerful
modulator of melatonin

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.993
and light inhibits melatonin.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.050
Throughout the year,
depending on where you live,

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.100
day length varies, and as a consequence,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.860
the amount of light from the sun

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.320
that is available to you varies.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.970
So when days are long,
the amount of melatonin

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.420
in your brain and body that's
released tends to be less.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.950
There's less of it and it's released

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.400
for shorter amounts of time, okay?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.500
Because light inhibits melatonin.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.460
When days are very short,
the amount of melatonin

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.650
that's released and the duration
that that melatonin exists

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.360
in your brain and body
tends to be much longer.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.813
So melatonin correlates with day length.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.360
And if we are viewing more
light, we have less melatonin.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.473
We view less light, we
have more melatonin.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.480
You see different
amounts of light each day

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.930
but we have a process
in our brain and body

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.300
that averages the amount
of light that you're seeing

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.840
both from artificial
sources and from sunlight

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.680
and measures that off, and
it's so exquisitely precise

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.250
that for a given, say,
eight-hour day in the spring,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.670
'cause spring in the Northern
Hemisphere or elsewhere,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.370
you know, days are getting longer,

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.180
that means that the amount of melatonin

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.430
is getting progressively less and less

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.700
and that signal is
conveyed to all the systems

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.070
of your brain and body.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.900
And this is why most people, not all,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.280
but most people feel like
they have more energy

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.900
in the spring.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.860
Conversely, when you
have an eight-hour day

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.170
in the winter, the amount of melatonin

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.700
that corresponds to that eight-hour day

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.510
is getting progressively
greater and greater because why?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.660
Days are getting shorter
so melatonin is increasing

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.520
from day to day to day.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.910
Every cell and system of your
body pays attention to this,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.680
and as a consequence,
most people, not all,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.970
but most people feel
they have a little less

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.620
or sometimes a lot less energy

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.520
and a slightly lower mood
in the winter months.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.830
Now, there are exceptions
to this, of course,

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.670
but the melatonin signal is the way

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.260
in which your internal state, your mood,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.910
your sense of energy, even
your appetite is entrained,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.210
is matched to some external event.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.470
In this case, the event is the rotation

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.380
of the Earth around the sun.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.600
There are other forms of entrainment,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.070
meaning the matching
of your brain and body

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.840
to things that are happening
in your external environment.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.880
One particularly
interesting example of this

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.010
was published last year by
Parikh et al. in "Cell Reports,"

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.000
Cell Press journal, excellent journal,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.770
showing that across the calendar year,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.320
the amount of testosterone and estrogen

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.780
that human beings make varies

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.870
such that in longer days,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.310
they tend to make more
testosterone and estrogen

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.470
than in shorter days.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.230
And this was correlated
with things like desire

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.130
to seek out romantic partners
or have romantic interactions

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.260
with their existing
partners, even aggression,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.870
although not violent aggression,

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.020
but sense of kind of willingness to argue

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.200
and to get into kind of combative states

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.370
and overall energy and mood.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.610
This is something that had been
hypothesized for a long time

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.980
but it had never really
been cleanly demonstrated.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.690
And what they showed was
that it's actually the skin

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.010
that's taking information
about the amount of light

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.990
and converting it into these increases

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.730
in testosterone and estrogen.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.530
Light exposure to the skin,
turns out about two hours a day,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.410
this was sunlight, in this
case, to the upper body,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.110
these people weren't naked,
they were wearing clothes

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.010
but their arms were exposed,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.180
their upper back and neck
and face were exposed,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.880
they were not wearing hats,
resulted in large increases,

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.720
significant increases in
testosterone and estrogen.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.630
Now you could probably export
a tool from that if you liked.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.290
That's not really what
this podcast is about

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.720
but it's very clear that
because the skin is acting

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.930
as an endocrine orman, organ, excuse me,

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.160
as kind of a hormone-influencing organ,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.130
that getting light on the
skin, not just to the eyes,

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.610
can influence our sense of wellbeing

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.620
by these hormone pathways,
and the threshold there again

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.010
seemed to be about two hours a day.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.690
It doesn't have to be very bright outside.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.350
There can be cloud cover and so on.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.800
Many people will probably ask

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.640
will sunscreen inhibit this effect?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.640
And it doesn't appear that it does.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.990
Obviously prioritize skin
health and avoiding skin cancer.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.232
Sunscreen is kind of a
controversial topic nowadays,

00:15:12.232 --> 00:15:16.370
maybe the topic for another
podcast episode at some point,

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.510
but nonetheless, what the
Parikh et al. study shows

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.400
and that's most relevant
to today's podcast

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.650
is that we are entrained, we are matched

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.450
to the external light-dark cycle

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.650
and as the day length
changes, our hormones change.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.130
And we can override that with
exposure to bright lights.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.420
You know, people go sit on tanning beds.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.480
That's not a practice I
particularly myself engage in,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.600
but, you know, there are
a number of different ways

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.760
that people can override these processes.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.280
But the point is very simple.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.220
The point is that our perception
of time is both conscious,

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.110
you know, it's waiting,
watching the clock tick down,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.740
and there are these slower,
what we call oscillatory,

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.260
meaning up and down repeatedly,
slower oscillatory events

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.310
related to day length that
are influencing our hormones

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.210
like melatonin,
testosterone, and estrogen,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.440
and therefore our mood, our
outlook, and even our behavior.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.633
The next level of time or
bin of time, as we say,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.950
that we are all entrained or matched to

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.640
is the so-called circadian time cycle,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.090
which is 24-hour rhythm.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.610
This is perhaps the most powerful rhythm

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.883
that we all contain and that
none of us can escape from.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.930
We all have this circadian clock

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.800
that resides over the roof of our mouth.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.650
The cells in that circadian clock fire,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.990
meaning they release chemicals
into our brain and body

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.340
on a very regular rhythm.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.080
So across the 24-hour cycle,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.360
they will be very active at some periods

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.253
and less active at others.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.270
Not surprisingly, there are
periods of every 24-hour cycle

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.790
when we are very active
and we tend to be alert

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.070
and others when we are asleep.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.840
Now, I've talked a lot
about circadian rhythms

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.120
and sleep on this podcast previously

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.330
and so I don't want to repeat
too much of that information

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.150
in detail, but I'm just
going to give a summary

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.170
of how circadian entrainment works

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.060
because I haven't really covered that

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.760
in the context of time perception.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.030
We have the circadian
clock. It oscillates.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.830
It goes up and down once every
24 hours and then repeats.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.860
Every cell of our body
has a 24-hour oscillation

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.850
in the expression of various genes.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.750
How that works is actually really simple,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.200
elegant, and interesting.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.200
DNA, genes, make RNA. RNA
is converted into proteins.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.920
Every cell in our body has
this beautiful 24-hour timer

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.150
where a gene is expressed.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.650
And the important thing to
understand about a given gene

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.260
in this context is that
that gene is inhibited,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.770
meaning it's reduced,
by a particular protein,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.850
by a little biological
molecule in that cell.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.440
So the gene gets expressed
when there's very little

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.370
of that other molecule around.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.510
DNA then becomes RNA.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.570
RNA is translated into a protein

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.730
and that protein goes way, way
up and the gene shuts down.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.430
But as that protein gets used up

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.660
and its levels eventually
drop low, low, low, low, low

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.307
to zero, the gene cycle kicks in again

00:18:17.307 --> 00:18:18.570
and the gene gets expressed.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.310
The RNA gets expressed
in the protein again.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.620
This all happens on a 24-hour cycle.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.110
So it's a little built-in timer

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.640
in each and every one of our cells.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.920
And I didn't list off the genes,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.290
but for the aficionados out there,

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.980
they go by names like
PER for period, BMAL,

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.160
CLOCK, and all these different things.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.610
We call them the clock genes
and those clock genes regulate

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.590
a number of different functions.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.400
So every cell in our
body has a 24-hour cycle

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.520
of gene and protein expression

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.860
and the Earth rotates once every 24 hours

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.810
and the processes that are happening

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.740
in every cell of our body are linked.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.550
They are entrained, as we say,

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.180
to the outside light-dark cycle

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.180
because morning sunlight,
evening sunlight,

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.240
and the lack of light in
the middle of the night

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.200
make sure that the changes,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.970
these oscillations that are occurring

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.870
within the cells of our
brain and body are matched

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.220
to the outside light-dark cycle.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.700
Don't want to go into all the
details of how that happens

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.170
but there's some very simple
tools that one can use

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.650
to ensure that your entrainment,

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.620
your circadian entrainment, is precise.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.700
And I cannot emphasize
enough how important it is

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.150
that your circadian
entrainment be precise, why?

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.870
Because disruptions in
circadian entrainment

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.300
cause huge health problems.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.490
They increase cancer risk.
They increase obesity.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.850
They increase mental health issues.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.240
They decrease wound healing.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.480
They decrease physical
and mental performance.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.800
They disrupt hormones.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.660
You want your cells to be
linked to the circadian cycle

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.170
that's outside you and the
circadian cycle outside you

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.030
mainly consists of when there's sunlight

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.960
and when there is not.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.940
And that's why the simple protocols

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.180
to fall out of this whole discussion

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.730
about circadian entrainment
are the following.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.500
View 10 to 30 minutes of bright light,

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.440
ideally sunlight, within an hour of waking

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.650
assuming that you're waking
early in the day especially.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.880
You wake up early in the day,
get outside, see sunlight.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.010
Do that again in the
afternoon or around evening,

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.040
10 to 30 minutes, depending
on how bright it is outside.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.090
Artificial lights throughout the day,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.970
or if you want to be awake
and you wake up early

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.590
and there's no sunlight outside,

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.420
you can of course turn
on artificial lights

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.000
if you want to be awake
but basically you want

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.314
as much bright light,
ideally from sunlight,

00:20:29.314 --> 00:20:31.690
coming in through your
eyes throughout the day.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.990
And then in the evening,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.340
you want as little bright light
coming in through your eyes.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.770
I've said this over and over
and over again on this podcast.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.270
There's always a lot of negotiations,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.970
but I want to make a few things clear.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.300
Try not to wear sunglasses
if you can do it safely.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.380
Fine to wear eye glasses or contacts.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.880
That's not going be a problem.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.240
The light viewing that you
do and the avoidance of light

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.240
at night set the fundamental
layer of your time perception.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.480
One of the best ways to
disrupt your perception of time

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.950
in the ways that we're going to talk about

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.280
in the subsequent portions of the podcast

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.010
is to disrupt your circadian clock

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.490
and that is not a good thing

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.440
for a number of different reasons.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.273
There are other ways

00:21:12.273 --> 00:21:14.330
to so-called entrain your circadian clock.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.360
One of the best ways
to do that is to engage

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.710
in physical activity at
fairly regular times of day.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.760
You don't have to do it every day

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.390
but if you're going to exercise,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.020
try and exercise at a fairly
consistent time of day.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.080
Probably better to exercise
than to not exercise,

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.410
even if you have to move that time of day,

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.740
but light activity and,
we'll talk about the third

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.970
in a minute, food, are the major ways

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.180
that you entrain your
internal perception of time

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.680
to the external events of the world,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.560
meaning the turning of the Earth

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.730
and therefore the exposure
to sunlight or not.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.860
So in addition to sunlight
viewing in the morning

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.420
and throughout the day
and avoiding bright light

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.770
at night of any kind, not just blue light,

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.010
trying to get your activity,

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.120
your exercise at fairly regular,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.030
within plus or minus two hours,
from each day to the next

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.920
is going to have a very positive effect

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.140
on so-called circadian entrainment,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.790
and also eating at fairly regular times.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.240
However, this is exciting.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.720
The data mainly point to the
fact that you need to eat

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.910
within more or less the
same time window each day,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.930
not that you always need to eat your meals

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.770
at exactly the same time.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.040
So you don't necessarily
have to eat lunch at noon

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.390
and a snack at four and dinner at eight

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.690
in order to keep your
circadian entrainment

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.480
aligned or sharp.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.560
You could for instance
have a small snack at noon

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.670
and then eat at two and
then have dinner at six

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.790
and then a small snack at eight.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.510
It doesn't so much matter
when the exact meals fall

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.100
so much as that they fall more or less

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.593
within a consistent period or
phase of each 24-hour cycle.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.230
What happens when this circadian clock

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.370
starts getting disrupted?

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.190
I mean, this is after all an
episode about time perception.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.380
It's not an episode about
circadian rhythms and entrainment.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:05.380
Well, there's a classic
study by Aschoff done in 1985

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.640
that's now been repeated many times

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.130
where they had people go into environments

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.510
where they didn't have clocks
and they didn't have windows

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.050
and they didn't have watches

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.790
and they were sometimes
even in constant dark

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.990
or constant light, and they evaluated

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.530
how well people perceive
the passage of time

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.240
on shorter timescales

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.790
and what they found
was really interesting.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.190
What they found is that
people underestimate

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.210
how long they were in these
isolated environments.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.340
So after 42 days or so, they'd ask people

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.500
how long do you think you've been in here?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.180
And people would say 28 days or 36 days.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.170
They generally underestimated
how long they had been

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.400
in this very odd
environment with no clocks

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.910
or watches or exposure to sunlight

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.340
or regular rhythms of artificial light.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.780
In addition, they found
that their perception

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.430
of shorter time intervals
was also really disrupted.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.071
So if they ask them to
measure off two minutes,

00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:59.750
normally people are pretty good

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.760
at measuring off two minutes.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.070
People come within, you know,
5 to 15 seconds at most.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.500
If you'd kind of have to
sit there and just wait,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.117
you have a pretty good idea
of when two minutes is up.

00:24:09.117 --> 00:24:10.650
You say two minutes is up.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.140
Well, when people's circadian clocks

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.110
or circadian entrainment, I
should say, was disrupted,

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:20.800
their perception of time
measurement on shorter timescales

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.210
of minutes or even seconds
was greatly disrupted.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.750
And as we'll see in a couple of minutes,

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.420
that actually causes great problems

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.280
for how you contend with work,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.100
how you contend with
challenges of different kinds.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.920
You want your circadian
entrainment to be pretty locked in

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.900
or pretty entrained to the
outside light-dark cycle

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.050
so that your perception of time

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.210
on shorter time intervals can be precise

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.910
because the ability to
perceive time accurately

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.250
for the given task or given thing

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.910
that you're involved in turns out

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.120
to be one of the most
fundamental ways that predicts

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.630
how well or poorly you
perform that thing or task.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.490
So we've talked about
circannual entrainment,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.650
the matching of the cells and
tissues and organs of our body

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.460
to the 365-day journey
that the Earth takes

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.350
around the sun each year

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.870
and we talked about circadian entrainment,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.230
the way that the 24-hour
genetic and protein clocks

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.990
of each and every one
of our cells is matched

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.740
to the rotation of the Earth on its axis

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.200
and the exposure or lack
of exposure to the sun

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.000
because of that rotation on its axis.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.825
Next I'd like to talk about
so-called ultradian entrainment.

00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:38.930
Ultradian rhythms are rhythms
of about 90 minutes or so

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.670
and all of our existence is broken up

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.230
into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.470
When you go to sleep at night,

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.240
whether or not you sleep
six hours or four hours

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.080
or eight hours or 10 hours,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.740
that entire period of sleep is broken up

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.290
into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.290
Early in the night, you tend
to have more slow-wave sleep.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.350
Later in the night, you
tend to have more REM sleep.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.740
But nonetheless, your sleep is broken up

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.440
into these 90-minute cycles.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.690
However, when you wake up in the morning,

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.810
many of the things that
you do are governed

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.963
by these ultradian rhythms.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.150
For instance, if you were to work,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.320
meaning do math or try
and learn a language

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.773
or do physical work of
any kind or work out,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.820
the 90-minute time block
seems to be the one

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.210
in which the brain can
enter a state of focus

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.680
and alertness and do hard
work and focus, focus, focus

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.380
and then at about 90 minutes,
there's a significant drop

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.090
in your ability to engage in
this mental or physical work.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.450
Now, everybody from, you
know, the self-help literature

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.420
to the business literature to
the pop psychology literature

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.060
has tried to leverage
these ultradian cycles

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.750
by saying if you're going
to do something hard

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.140
and you want to focus on it,
limit it to 90 minutes or less.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.190
And I am one of those people

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.880
who's also joined that conversation

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.130
and indeed I use 90-minute work cycles,

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.730
and I think they are extremely powerful.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:01.780
One should never expect

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.190
that you're going to drop immediately

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.710
into a state of high
focus at the beginning

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.640
and then remain there for 90 minutes.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.910
We all struggle to varying
degrees to achieve focus

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.640
and motivation and drive
within those 90-minute cycles.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.540
But it is true, meaning
there is ample literature

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.760
to support the idea that
after about 90 minutes,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.480
we tend to go into a state
of less ability to focus.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.950
So while this isn't
time perception per se,

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.810
it is again an example of entrainment.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.220
What are we entraining to, right?

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.060
Just because we can focus for 90 minutes

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.600
and then not so well at
100 minutes or 120 minutes,

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.690
what are we entraining to?

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.490
Well, what you're
entraining to is the release

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.921
of particular neurochemicals,

00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:47.230
in this case, acetylcholine and dopamine

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.170
that allow your brain to focus

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.280
for particular periods of
time, 90 minutes or so,

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.540
and after about 90 minutes or so,

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.660
the amount of those chemicals
that can be released

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.630
tends to drop very low,

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.810
which is why your ability
to focus becomes diminished.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.640
If one would like to explore
more about the kind of backbone

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.720
and basis of these ultradian rhythms,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.920
it goes by a different name.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.990
This was originally called
the basic rest-activity cycle.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.660
This was proposed many years
ago by Nathaniel Kleitman.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.680
It was established to be true

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.930
within sleep states as I mentioned before.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.470
Then it was debated for a long time

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:27.030
whether or not these
90-minute cycles also control

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.040
our ability to focus and
perform work in wakeful states

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.060
and it turns out that they do.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.860
Now there's a lot of
literature to support that.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.470
I always get the question how do you know

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.190
when the 90 minute cycle begins?

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.240
In other words, let's
say you wake up at 8 AM

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.370
and you just finished a
90-minute sleep cycle.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.130
Does that mean that your
next 90-minute cycle

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.720
where you could do work
begins right at 8:01?

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.730
No, the interesting thing

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.760
about these basic rest-activity cycles,

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.060
these ultradian rhythms,

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.140
is that you can initiate
them whenever you want.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.860
This is not like a circadian rhythm

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:02.860
which is a hardwired
unerring signal of 24 hours.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.680
The ultradian rhythms that occur

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.870
during sleep are hardwired, unerring.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.280
You don't get the option
of making your sleep cycles

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.510
120 minutes or five minutes.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.810
You don't get that option.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.630
But if you decide that you
want to apply ultradian rhythms

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.440
to work and performance,
you can set a clock

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.270
and decide, okay, now the focus begins.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.490
Now the work begins and this
90-minute cycle is the period

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.690
in which I'm going to do work.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.260
And I actually do this, you know,

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.040
mid morning and sometimes twice a day,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.760
I do a 90-minute cycle where
I limit all distraction

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.370
as much as possible, put away my phone,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.800
often turn off the internet as well.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.570
I talked about this in an episode

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.560
on kind of an optimal
workday, at least for me,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.730
just to give an example
of how this might work.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.910
But I want to emphasize again

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.090
that these ultradian rhythms
are ones that you set.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.650
So you decide I'm going
to work for 90 minutes.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.680
What you can't negotiate, however,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.800
is that at about 100
minutes or 120 minutes,

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.770
no matter who you are,

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.720
you're going to see a
diminishment in performance.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.940
You're not going to focus as well.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.310
And that's again because of the way

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:10.050
that these 90-minute cycles
are linked to the ability

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.750
of the neurons that release
acetylcholine and dopamine

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.110
and to some extent norepinephrine,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.630
the things that give us narrow focus,

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.360
motivation, and drive, the way

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.950
that these 90-minute cycles
are involved in those circuits.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.080
After about 90 minutes,

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.700
those circuits are far
less willing to engage

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.600
and therefore it's much harder to continue

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.690
to focus to a high degree.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.010
Some people like to do
multiple 90-minute cycles

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:33.880
per day of focus.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.620
In that case, you need
to separate them out.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.270
You can't do one 90-minute cycle,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.060
then go right into
another 90-minute cycle,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.190
then another 90-minutes cycle.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.260
You can't cheat these circuits
related to acetylcholine

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.290
and dopamine and
norepinephrine unfortunately.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.220
I suggest that people
do no more than three

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.020
and ideally it would be two

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.380
or just one of these 90-minute cycles.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.620
Why did I say ideally?
Well, they are very taxing.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.370
You are in a very narrow tunnel of focus.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.040
So for me, I can do one mid morning.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.270
I can probably do another
one in the afternoon.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.410
This is not the kind of work
that's like checking email

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.880
or text messaging or social media.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.759
This is very focused hard work,

00:31:09.759 --> 00:31:12.730
working on hard problems of various kinds,

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.770
and this will be different for everybody.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.270
So I recommend that they be spaced

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.650
by at least two to four hours

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.690
and most people probably won't be able

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.580
to handle more than two per day.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.280
There are probably some mutants out there

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.280
that could do three or four,
but that's exceedingly rare.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.230
I think even one a day is going to feel

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.500
like a significant mental investment,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.870
and afterwards you're
going to feel pretty taxed.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.810
So now we've talked about circannual,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.070
circadian, and ultradian rhythms,

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.410
but we haven't really talked
about time perception per se.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.410
We've mainly talked

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:47.050
about the subconscious
slow oscillatory ways

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.790
in which we are entrained
or matched to the year

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.880
or to the day and these ultradian cycles

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.410
that we can impose on our work

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:59.103
and that we can leverage
toward more focus if we like.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.050
But what about the actual
perception of time?

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.530
What actually controls how fast

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.300
or how slowly we perceive time going by?

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.090
There are basically three
forms of time perception

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.820
that we should all be aware of.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.760
One is our perception of the
passage of time in the present,

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.530
how quickly or slowly things
seem to be happening for us.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.660
This is kind of like an
interval timer ticking off time.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.380
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.360
It's either fine-slicing like that,

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.850
or tick, tick, tick.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.460
We have interval timers.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.750
I'll discuss the basis
of those interval timers.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.460
We also engage in what's
called prospective timing

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.820
which is like a stopwatch
measuring off things

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.260
as they go forward.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.190
That might sound a little bit
like what I just described

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.270
but it's actually a little bit different.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.900
For instance, if I told
you to start measuring off

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.840
a two-minute time
interval into the future,

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.853
you could do that pretty well.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.010
But if I told you you had to measure

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.410
a five-minute time
interval into the future

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.300
and you couldn't use any clocks or watches

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.270
or your phone or anything like that,

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.360
you would have to set the tick marks.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.280
You'd have to decide how many
times you were going to count off

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.980
during that five-minute time block.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.100
There's also retrospective time

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.720
which is how you measure
off time in the past.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.440
So if I say, you know, last week,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.780
I know you went to the park,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.300
you did some things
with friends, you know,

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.360
you went out in the evening.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.060
How long was it between lunch

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.340
and when you went to dinner with friends?

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.490
You'd probably think, okay, well,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:31.940
I remember I went to dinner at seven

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.880
and we had lunch right around two.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.980
You're using memory to
reconstruct certain sets of events

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.980
in the past and get a sense
of their relative positioning

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.380
within time, okay?

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.800
So we have retrospective,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.330
current time interval measurements,

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.313
and then prospective time
measurement into the future.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.710
The beauty of time perception
in the human nervous system

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:59.180
is that it boils down to a
couple of simple molecules

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.200
that govern whether or not
we are fine-slicing time

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.393
or whether or not we are
batching time in larger bins.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.990
Those molecules go by names
that maybe you've heard,

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.117
things like dopamine and norepinephrine,

00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:14.300
neuromodulators, called neuromodulators

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.873
because they modulate, they change the way

00:34:15.873 --> 00:34:17.743
that other neural circuits work.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.260
Also things like serotonin.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.260
Serotonin is released
from a different site

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.920
in the brain than
dopamine or epinephrin is

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.110
and has a different
effect on time perception.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.160
So just to give you an example
of how things like dopamine

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.370
and serotonin can modulate
our perception of time,

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.960
want to focus on a
little bit of literature

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.980
that now has been done
fortunately in animals and humans

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.230
and which essentially shows
that the more dopamine

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.470
that's released into our brain,

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:52.600
the more we tend to
overestimate the amount of time

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.210
that has just passed.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.090
Let me repeat that.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.470
The more dopamine that is
released into our brain,

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:02.050
the more we tend to overestimate
how much time has passed.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.180
These experiments are very
straight, straightforward,

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.020
excuse me, and they're very
objective, which is really nice,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.580
which is you can give
people or an animal a drug

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.820
that increases the amount of dopamine

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.270
and then ask them to measure off

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.460
without any measurement
device like a watch or a clock

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.900
when one minute has passed.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.560
As dopamine levels rise in the brain,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.560
people tend to think that the
minute is up before a minute.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.230
So they, at the 38-second
mark, they'll say,

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.190
okay, I think a minute is up.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.000
So they've overestimated how
much time has passed, okay?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.600
The higher the level of dopamine,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.720
the more people tend to overestimate.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.180
Now, it's also true that norepinephrine,

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.440
also called noradrenaline, plays a role

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.010
and its role is very
similar to that of dopamine

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.350
and that's because norepinephrine

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.070
and dopamine are close cousins,

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.870
as some of you may recall

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.450
that they are actually manufactured
from one another, okay?

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.580
So dopamine can actually make epinephrin

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.150
and norepinephrine biochemically.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.770
There's a cascade in
which dopamine can be made

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.000
into norepinephrine and
epinephrin, which is remarkable.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.040
How does having elevated
levels of dopamine

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.740
and norepinephrine cause
one to overestimate

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.580
how much time has passed?

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.850
Well, it does it because of the way

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:21.400
that it causes fine-slicing
of your time bins.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.440
So fine-slicing of time bins

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.250
is like increasing the frame
rate on your camera, right?

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:31.300
Slow motion is achieved in movies

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.440
and elsewhere by
increasing the frame rate.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.230
So if you take a movie at 30
frames per second and watch it,

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.190
it will appear to have
a certain speed, right?

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.890
'Cause those are just
snapshots, 30 frames per second.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.250
In contrast, if you took that same movie

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.550
at 4,000 frames per second,
you are fine-slicing

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.840
and you're going to
see every little detail

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.810
and as you play each one of those frames,

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:57.010
it's going to look like
it moved slower, okay?

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.590
Whatever, so the kind of
jump shot in basketball

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.100
that's done slowly, any slow motion

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.840
is the consequence of higher frame rate.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.380
So dopamine and norepinephrine
increase frame rate,

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.470
and as a consequence, they tend to lead us

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.553
to overestimate the amount
of time that's passed.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.140
Conversely, the neuromodulator
serotonin causes people

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.600
to underestimate the amount
of time that's passed.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.270
So they've done these experiments.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.650
They actually have done
these experiments using,

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.870
in humans, with drugs
that increase serotonin.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.660
They've also done them with cannabis

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.840
which increases serotonin
among other things

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.000
including the cannabinoid
receptor activation.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.260
And when people have
elevated levels of 5-HT

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.010
or whether or not they've
ingested cannabis,

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.570
they tend to underestimate
how much time has passed.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.700
You do the equivalent experiment.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.100
You tell people that they have to guess

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.410
or tell you when five minutes,
for instance, has passed.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.540
Just use five minutes
as an example this time.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.510
And generally they will
miss the five-minute mark.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.930
They will think, they'll
let six minutes pass

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.420
and they'll think it was five minutes

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.190
when they've underestimated
how much time has passed.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.860
And that's because serotonin

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.250
and some of the related
molecules in the brain

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:15.360
tend to lead to slower frame rates, right?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.920
They take the frame rate in
the example I used before

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.620
from 4,000 frames per second down

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.340
to, say, 20 frames per second.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.373
So this is very interesting.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.430
It's interesting in terms of
how pharmacology can be used

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.210
to adjust time perception
but it's also interesting

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:34.290
in the context of that circadian rhythm.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.910
There's some emerging evidence

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.410
that throughout the 24-hour cycle,

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.030
there are robust changes
in the amount of dopamine,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.720
norepinephrine, and
serotonin that are present

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.720
in the brain and bloodstream and body

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.720
depending on time of day
within the circadian cycle.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.740
Now, I'm not talking about during sleep.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.670
During sleep, there are
definitely variations

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.750
in things like dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.090
I talked about that in
the episodes on sleep.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.410
Here I'm just talking about
the role of these molecules

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.950
in time perception during wakefulness.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.140
So much of the evidence points to the fact

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.060
that in the first half of the day,

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.980
approximate first half of the day,

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.630
dopamine and norepinephrine
are elevated in the brain,

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.940
body, and bloodstream much
more than is serotonin

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.470
and that in the second half of the day

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.130
and in particular towards
evening and nighttime,

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.540
serotonin levels are going up.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.840
I think that's fairly
well-established now.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.470
What that means based on
what we just discussed

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.810
about the role of dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.300
in setting the frame
rate of time perception

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.980
is that our perception
of the passage of time

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.390
will be very different in
the early part of the day

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.400
and in the latter half of the day.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.010
And there's starting to be some evidence

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.020
to support this, that early in the day,

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.110
people tend to overestimate
how much time has passed

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:51.943
and later in the day,

00:39:51.943 --> 00:39:54.040
they tend to underestimate
how much time has passed.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.240
And this is independent of
taking any kind of substance

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.250
that would increase or
decrease dopamine or serotonin.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.320
Now, this is important in terms

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.190
of how one thinks about
structuring their day,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.520
because I know many people are thinking

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.050
about the various tasks
that they need to do

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:08.800
throughout their day.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.010
Many, or I should say
all of the literature,

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.670
at least that I can find on productivity

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.870
and things of that sort point to the idea

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.900
that we should be doing the hardest task,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.500
the thing that we want to do the least

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.490
or the most important
task early in the day

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.830
as a kind of a psychological
tool for getting it done

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.720
and feeling as if we
accomplished something

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.800
and I think that's an
excellent protocol, frankly,

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.570
but I'm not sure it's
an excellent protocol

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:37.380
because of the way that
we sense accomplishment

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.810
or at least it's not only
an excellent protocol

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.070
because of the way that
we sense accomplishment.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.930
Another reason to move
something that's very hard

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.930
into the early part of the day

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:50.247
is that if indeed the dopaminergic

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:54.620
and noradrenergic circuits
are more active at that time,

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.930
we are actually in a
better position cognitively

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.670
to parse that hard
problem because of the way

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:04.760
that we are able to fine-slice
our perception of time

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.890
and fine-slice all the
perceptual events outside us.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.010
So what I'm really saying
is that early in the day,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.100
you are a much more
high resolution camera,

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.700
so to speak, than you
are later in the day.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.880
Now, different types of tasks
and different types of things

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.040
require different frame rates

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.150
or different ways of perceiving time,

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.010
and indeed, this also
lends itself to a tool

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.510
whereby for activities that involve

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.960
more kind of creative thinking
that aren't as constrained

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.500
by particular answers or outcomes

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.160
and in which we need to kind
of blend different aspects

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.750
of our memory, different
aspects of task utilization,

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.040
in other words, for creative
works, for brainstorming,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.940
for things that are a bit
more fluid, so to speak,

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.450
the more serotonergic
second half of the day,

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.780
and because of the way the
serotonergic second half

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.470
of the day lends itself
to our time perception,

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.550
may actually be more beneficial
for those sorts of tasks.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.750
And I'll put a reference
to a couple of the studies

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.290
that point to this idea

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.380
that in these higher dopaminergic states,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.630
we are better at doing
certain sorts of tasks

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.570
and in these more serotonergic states,

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.840
we're better at doing other sorts of tasks

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.960
and how the dopamine tends
to be earlier in the day

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.240
and the serotonin later
in the day, so to speak.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.840
These are broad, I'm painting
with broad strokes here,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.290
but I think these lend themselves

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:26.770
to some really excellent tools

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.070
because I think we all
understand the value

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.310
of doing something that's hard

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:31.790
or challenging early in the day,

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.620
but we should ask ourselves
hard or challenging how?

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.000
What does that task
actually really require

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.650
in terms of time perception?

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.270
Some people might appreciate some examples

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.400
of how this might work.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.810
Basically what I'm saying
is if you are doing work

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.040
that involves adhering
to some rigid rules,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.820
so math or a recipe or
execution of musical scales

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.450
or physical skills or accounting

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.600
or something that requires
a lot of precision

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.000
where there's a right and
wrong answer and it's hard,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.140
I would suggest that you do that

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.170
in the early part of the
day because of the way

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:08.430
that dopamine and norepinephrine
impact time perception.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.710
You are literally better
at slicing up time,

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.827
you are a higher resolution
brain during those times,

00:43:14.827 --> 00:43:18.840
and so that's going to lend
itself better to events

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.790
and demands that require high resolution,

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.650
whereas in the afternoon

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.220
in this more what I'm
calling serotonergic state,

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.400
that's when you're going to
be better at brainstorming

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.170
and creative works where
there's some flexibility

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.260
in terms of how you're batching
time and perceiving time

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.250
and there isn't so much rigid oversight

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.940
of a right or wrong answer.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.310
And as an aside to support what I said

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.120
but also to take us back

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.100
to this critical role
of the circadian rhythm,

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.890
there is a lot of evidence

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.280
that when one's sleep is disrupted,

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.050
when sleep is either too
short or is fragmented

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.330
or is not of high enough
quality for enough days,

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.410
one of the first things to happen

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.720
is that there is a dysregulation

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.280
of these dopaminergic, noradrenergic,

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.050
and serotonergic states
throughout the day.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:07.790
They get kind of mish-mashed up.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.500
It's not that they're a total mess

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.330
but they aren't as cleanly defined.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.020
And I think this is one of the reasons why

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.120
when we haven't slept well
or we haven't slept enough,

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.730
we tend to feel a little off,
like we can't concentrate.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.370
Part of that lack of concentration
is due to other things

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.290
but part of that concentration
could be due to the fact

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.230
that our sense of the
passage of time is disrupted.

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.470
So there seems to be some value in keeping

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:33.010
the dopaminergic noradrenergic
state kind of limited

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.260
to the early part of the day

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.143
and this serotonergic
state, as we're calling it,

00:44:36.143 --> 00:44:38.880
kind of pushed towards the
second half of the day.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.860
Now, there is a version of how
dopamine and norepinephrine

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.490
can impact our perception
of the passage of time

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:49.020
in ways that can be very
disruptive or even maladaptive

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.010
and the best example that
I'm aware of is trauma.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.680
Many people who have been in car accidents

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.010
or who have experienced some
other form of major trauma

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.692
do what's called overclocking.

00:45:02.692 --> 00:45:07.500
Overclocking is when levels
of dopamine and norepinephrine

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.463
increase so much during
a particular event,

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.930
our level of alertness
is increased so much

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:18.120
during a given event that we fine-slice.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.890
In other words, the frame
rate is increased so much so

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:26.010
that we perceive things as
happening in ultra slow motion.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:30.150
Now, that might not seem
like a bad thing overall

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.830
but the problem with
overclocking is the way

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.010
in which that information
gets stamped down

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.700
into the memory system.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.790
So the memory system, which
involves areas of the brain

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.580
like the hippocampus
but also the neocortex,

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.460
is basically a space-time recorder.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.160
What do I mean by space-time recorder?

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.450
Well, your nervous system, of course,

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:53.010
is housed in the darkness of your skull.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.490
It doesn't have a whole lot of information

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.350
about the outside world
except light coming in

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.608
through the eyes and whatever
happens to hit our ears

00:45:58.608 --> 00:46:02.320
in terms of sound waves
and skin and so forth

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.260
so it has to take all those neural signals

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.440
and it has to create a
record of what happened.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.670
Now, it doesn't create a record
of everything that happened

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.990
but car accidents and trauma

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.510
and things of that sort
oftentimes are stamped down

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.330
into our record of what happened.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.750
And what gets stamped down,

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.280
what we actually mean by
the phrase stamped down

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.800
is that the precise firing
of the sequence of neurons

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.060
that reflected some events,

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.940
so let's say I'm in a car accident,

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.290
certain neurons are firing
because of the flipping

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:35.360
of the car or their
screams or there's blood,

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.420
or, you know, things of that sort,

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:42.270
all of that neural activity gets repeated

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:45.580
in the hippocampus and then the sequence

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.910
of the firing of those
neurons is also remembered.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.810
So it's not just that
neuron one, two, three, four

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:51.930
fired in that sequence.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.970
It's also that neuron
one, two, three, four

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.460
fired at a particular rate.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.750
So it would be one, two, three, four

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.550
during the actual event and
then the memory is stored

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.410
as firing of those neurons as
one, two, three, four, right?

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:05.070
If during the event, it
was one, two, three, four

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.860
at that rate, the storage of the memory

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.913
is not going to be one,

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.530
two, three, four, okay?

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.700
In other words, there's both
a space code, as we say,

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.670
meaning the particular neurons
that fire is important,

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.240
and there's a rate code, how
quickly those neurons fire

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.920
or the relative firing,
the timing of the firing

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.910
of those neurons is
also part of the memory.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.330
This affords our memory
system tremendous flexibility.

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.800
What it means is that you can
take the same set of neurons

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.610
in the hippocampus and stamp
down many, many more memories

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:39.276
because all you have to do is use a match

00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:41.850
of the different rates
of the different neurons

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.593
that were firing in order
to set that code, right?

00:47:44.593 --> 00:47:46.900
Otherwise, if you needed
a different set of neurons

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.040
for every memory, you'd need
an enormous hippocampus.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.210
You'd need an enormous head.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.511
So I think you get the basic idea.

00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:56.980
Overclocking is a case in
which the frame rate is so high

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.180
that a memory gets stamped down

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.367
and people have a very hard
time shaking that memory

00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:03.910
and the emotions associated
with that memory.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.090
And it's not the topic
of today's conversation

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:09.120
but we will cover trauma in
a future episode in detail,

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.310
but many of the treatments for trauma,

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.870
EMDR, nowadays there's
a lot of excitement also

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:18.670
about ketamine therapies,
exposure therapies,

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.790
you know, like cognitive
behavioral therapies

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.930
involve not just trying to
reduce the amount of emotion

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.360
associated with a memory, but
also a deliberate speeding up

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.400
or slowing down of that memory.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.910
In other words, trying to allow the person

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.810
who experienced the trauma to take control

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:38.240
of the rate of the
experience in their memory,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.090
not just whether or not
the memory happened at all.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.410
In fact, you know, one of the first things

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:44.690
that trauma victims learn

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:47.370
is that they aren't going
to forget what happened.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:49.500
What's eventually going to happen ideally

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.670
with good treatment is
that the emotional weight

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:56.080
of the experience will
eventually be divorced

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.020
from the memory of the experience.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.400
And that's done again by trying to reduce

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.270
the amount of emotional activation

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:03.930
during the recall of that experience

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.640
and one of the best ways to do that

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.060
is to alter the rate
of the memory playback.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.060
In other words, taking
that firing of neurons

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.290
that might've been one, two, three, four,

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.920
again, it would be much more complicated,

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.750
but one, two, three,
four for the car crash

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:20.400
and getting the memory
to play back at a rate

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.170
of one, two, three, four,

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.830
or even one, two, three, four,

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.400
one, two, three, four.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.950
In other words, allowing the person

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.680
or instructing the person to take control

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.890
of the rate of the
playback, and in that way,

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.610
there seems to be still
yet unknown mechanism

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:41.730
by which people can uncouple
some of the emotional weight

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.520
that's associated with that memory.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.440
So overclocking is a
kind of extreme example

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.150
of where the dopaminergic
and the neurogenetic system

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:54.320
is ramped up so high
that people have this,

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.700
unfortunately, what
seems like indelible mark

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.430
in their brain of a particular event.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:00.030
But again, trauma treatment is designed

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.590
to uncouple the emotional
load of that event.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:05.930
Some of you are probably saying
why dopamine during trauma?

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.340
I thought dopamine was
the feel-good molecule.

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.500
Well, in reality,

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.170
dopamine is not necessarily
a molecule of reward.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.110
It's a molecule of motivation,
pursuit, and drive.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:17.830
And because of the close relationship

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.580
between dopamine and norepinephrine,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.590
oftentimes they are co-released.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:25.050
So whether or not dopamine is
released during car crashes

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.180
or other forms of trauma, we don't know

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.447
but what we do know is that
both the dopamine system

00:50:29.447 --> 00:50:32.250
and noradrenergic system,
when we say noradrenergic,

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.240
we mean norepinephrine, those
systems are greatly increased

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.640
anytime there's a
heightened state of arousal.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.930
And arousal can have negative valence,

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:43.200
like meaning associated with
an event that we really hate,

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.110
that we would prefer
not to be involved in,

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.690
or can positive valence, but
dopamine and norepinephrine

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.730
are kind of the common hallmark

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.460
of all things of elevated arousal.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.440
And so that's why we see
evidence for dopamine

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.240
being associated with these
changes in time perception

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.060
both for positive events
and for negative events.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.650
There's a very interesting
relationship between arousal,

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.980
dopamine, time perception, and blinking,

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.410
and this is all supported by
a really interesting paper,

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.780
first author, Terhune is the
last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.410
It's published in "Current Biology."

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.290
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal.

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:21.123
The title of the paper is

00:51:21.123 --> 00:51:24.130
"Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking."

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:25.940
So heightened states of
arousal are associated

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.250
with heightened levels of dopamine.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.220
You now know that dopamine leads

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.460
to a kind of fine-slicing of time

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.280
and one of the ways that we
fine-slice time is by blinking.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.810
You know, we think of
blinking as just a thing

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:39.760
to lubricate our eyes or to limit

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.490
the amount of light coming into our eyes,

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:44.070
but it's a shutter on our experience.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.470
So much of the information
coming into the brain

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.020
through our eyes impacts our attention.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.540
I've said it before on this podcast,

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.800
that cognitive attention
follows visual attention,

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.730
at least for sighted individuals.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.330
Well, it turns out that dopamine

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.710
and increases in dopamine are associated

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:01.350
with increases in spontaneous blink rate.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:05.050
So the more aroused we
are, the more awake we are,

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:05.883
there are a number of effects.

00:52:05.883 --> 00:52:08.100
Pupils dilate, heart rate
increases, et cetera,

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.020
but also blink rate increases.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:13.273
And every time we blink,
this study cleanly shows,

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:17.030
we shift our perception
of time, leading to,

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:20.320
as I mentioned before,
overestimations of time.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.550
So it seems as though in some way,

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.440
blink rate is actually
related to frame rate.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.700
So this is very, very interesting

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.190
and the way that you could
think about leveraging this

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:34.000
would be if you wanted
to actually slow down

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.910
your perception of time,
you would blink less.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.500
And if you want to speed
up your perception of time,

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.450
you would blink more.

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:42.220
Now, you'd have to think of a scenario

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.900
in which that would be useful to you.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.130
Obviously if you're going to blink,

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:46.950
you're going to miss things as well.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:49.800
But I think it's a very
interesting parameter

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.180
of our visual attention as it
relates to time perception,

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.750
because what it really speaks to

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.720
is that these
neuromodulators like dopamine

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.830
or serotonin that adjust frame rate,

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:01.340
they're not doing it through
some magical mechanism.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.530
In fact, there's no single brain area

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:06.180
that we can say controls time perception.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.920
I haven't said today, oh,
you know, it's the striatum.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.720
Well, it involves the striatum
but I'm not going to say,

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.370
for instance, oh, it's the cerebellum.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.990
The cerebellum is definitely involved

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:18.650
in timing of movement,
something for a future podcast,

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:20.900
but time perception is what we call

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.400
a distributed phenomenon.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.450
It's a network of areas in
the brain working together.

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:28.120
But dopamine and the way that it relates

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.980
to the shuttering of your eyes

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.410
seems to be controlling the
frame rate on your experience.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:35.840
Numerous times on this podcast,

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.520
I've talked about cold exposure

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.270
and nowadays there's a lot of interest

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.430
in things like cold showers, ice baths,

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.180
immersion in cold water tanks

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.920
and lakes and oceans
and things of that sort.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.810
There are a lot of
different positive effects

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.550
of cold exposure provided
it's done properly.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:55.190
It can lead to increases in
metabolism, brown fat stores,

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.840
which are the good fat
stores that you want.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.530
They're sort of like a furnace

00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:59.740
that allow you to heat yourself up,

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.780
stay warm in cold environments,
to reduce inflammation,

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.580
to increase resilience and so forth.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:07.880
There's a study published

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.340
in the "European Journal of Physiology"

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.430
showing that cold exposure can increase

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:15.837
our baseline levels of
dopamine robustly, 2.5x,

00:54:15.837 --> 00:54:18.100
and it's a long-lasting
increase in dopamine

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.340
and appears to be a healthy one,

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.980
meaning it doesn't seem to be addictive.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.570
I'm sure there are some
people out there addicted

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:24.970
to ice baths, but, you know,
when you think about the range

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.450
of dopamine-inducing
behaviors that are addictive,

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.900
it seems to be more on
the health-promoting side.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.670
What's interesting is that
because cold water exposure

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.940
increases dopamine, it will also change

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.620
your perception of time
and if you've ever done

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.997
one of these cold water exposures,
you've experienced this.

00:54:39.997 --> 00:54:43.400
You've experienced getting
in and feeling like, wow,

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.930
making it three minutes is
a really, really long time,

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:47.620
and you are fine-slicing time.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.050
Your frame rate is going up.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.440
Part of that, just at a
kind of a coarse level

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.750
is you're thinking, this is painful.

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.450
I don't like this. I
want to get out, right?

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.930
But part of it is also
that your dopamine levels

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:02.320
are going up very quickly
and therefore your perception

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.210
of that discomfort is
also being fine-sliced.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.850
And so you could leverage
a tool, for instance,

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:10.080
where you try and entrain your thinking

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.020
to something other than your
immediate experience, right?

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.800
This is a kind of a
controversy, if you will,

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.450
in the cold exposure world.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.390
The question is do you try
and lean into the experience

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.640
and really feel it, or do you
try and distract yourself,

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.550
you know, sing a song or count off,

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.487
you know, from one to a hundred.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.690
Just know that whatever tactic you use

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.970
to get through the cold exposure

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:37.770
that the dopamine level
that's now increased

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:41.320
in your system is going
to cause you to fine-slice

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.100
or experience that at slow motion.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.360
So a minute is going to
seem like a lot longer

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.010
than a minute in reality.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.420
So you could, for instance,

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:55.100
decide to pay attention
to some external cue.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:59.560
Maybe it's a metronome that
ticks once every 10 seconds.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.360
You could decide to think
about something else.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.360
You could decide to
sing a song in your head

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.810
or sing a song out loud.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.380
All of that will divorce
you from the sensation

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.560
that you experience somewhat,

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.880
but more so it will divorce you

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.450
from the perception of
your experience as governed

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:17.690
by that dopamine increase in frame rate.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:19.840
If that isn't clear, just know this.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.980
When you're in the ice bath,
your dopamine levels are high.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.720
When your dopamine levels are high,

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.090
your experience of the discomfort

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:28.260
of that ice bath is at higher resolution.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.220
Now, up until now, I've been
talking about how dopamine,

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.780
and to some extent, serotonin

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.340
can differentially impact
your perception of how fast

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.330
or how slowly things are
happening in the moment.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.860
But remember, we have prospective time,

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.150
we have our experience
of time in the moment,

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.410
and we have retrospective time

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:51.210
and there are beautiful
studies that have showed

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:56.090
that the dopaminergic
state changes the way

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:58.420
not just that we experience things now,

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:02.390
but that it changes the way
in which we remember things

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:05.600
in the past and the rate at
which those things occurred.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.130
And those are in opposite direction.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.740
So to make this very simple,

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.560
if something that you
experience is fun or varied,

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.640
meaning it has a lot of
different components in it

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.700
and is, in other words, is associated

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:23.113
with an increase in
dopamine in your brain,

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:29.240
you will experience that
as going by very fast.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.810
Now, this is different than the ice bath

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.030
which I just said you experienced
as going by very slowly,

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:34.970
but here I'm talking
about something that's fun

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:36.700
and varied that you really like

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.830
and you feel like it
goes by very, very fast.

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:42.330
Imagine an amazing day for
a kid at an amusement park.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.320
They can do a ton of things. It's all new.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.210
They're very excited and they'll feel

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:48.410
like it goes by very fast,

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:52.280
but later they will
remember that experience

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.610
as being very long,

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.590
that it was a long day
full of many, many events.

00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:00.380
And so there's this
paradoxical relationship

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.470
between how we perceive
fun, exciting, varied events

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:06.250
in the present and how we
remember them in the past.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.370
For those of you who've gone on vacation,

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.870
if you've had an amazing day
on vacation, it'll seem like,

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.310
or an amazing vacation overall,

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.230
it will seem like it goes by very fast.

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:15.850
The last day of vacation,
you sort of go, whoa,

00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:18.720
it went by so fast 'cause
there's so much happening.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.840
But in memory six to eight
months later, you remember, wow,

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.980
that just went, you know,
that was a long, long thing.

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.350
We had this. Then we had that.

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:29.610
Then we did this. Then we had that.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.740
It tends to spool out in a longer memory

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.770
than the actual experience.

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.970
Conversely, if you are
bored with something

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:40.320
or it's something you really don't like,

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.720
it's going to seem like
it takes a long time

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.210
to go through that
experience in the moment,

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.090
but retroactively, looking back,

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.300
it will seem like that
moment was very short.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.980
So the other day I was
waiting in the waiting room

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.830
for the dentist, it was pretty boring.

00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:55.980
I was just kind of sitting there.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.780
There wasn't much going on.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.090
And it did seem like it was
going on an awfully long time,

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.050
but indeed, looking back,
it just seems like, okay,

00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:04.030
I sat in that room, not much happened.

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:05.670
And so it seems like
a very short time bin.

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.420
This seems to be an efficiency

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.283
of how the brain stores information,

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.360
dopamine being associated, of course,

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.410
with fun and varied experiences

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:16.230
and low dopamine being associated

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.510
with kind of empty, boring,

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:22.060
or what at the time seem
like long experiences.

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.470
And this whole thing has been stamped down

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:27.650
into the scientific literature
by those earlier experiments

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:29.510
where they take human
beings and isolate them

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:30.670
in certain environments.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:33.410
You know, take away all their
clocks and watches and cues

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.460
and about what time of day it is

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:39.010
and what time of night it is
and allow people to have a life

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:42.220
where they can either read
and work and do things

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.160
or where they have very little to do.

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.570
When people are isolated
in very boring environments

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:51.450
and they don't have access
to time cues, time dilates.

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:55.910
They tend to assume that time
has gone on very, very long.

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.240
And so the reason I bring this
up is we aren't just driven

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.720
by these circadian clocks
and these circannual clocks

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.740
and these ultradian clocks.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:07.700
We are driven by these timers that vary

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.690
depending on our level of excitement

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.520
and they vary depending
on our level of excitement

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.130
because of these neuromodulators,
dopamine and serotonin.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:17.660
So the way I like to think about it

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.780
is that you have two
clocks, two stopwatches.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.240
One is a dopaminergic stopwatch

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.240
that fine-slices really closely.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.030
It's like, counts off milliseconds
and it's grabbing a movie

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:30.270
of your experience at
very high resolution.

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:33.280
And in the other hand,
you have a stopwatch

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.900
that's gathering big time bins,

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.470
big ticks along the, you know,

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:39.860
the hand is moving at bigger intervals,

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.480
you know, marking off time.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.580
And depending on whether
or not you're excited

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.730
or whether or not you're bored,

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:48.790
you're using different stopwatches on time

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:52.030
and therefore you're perceiving
your experience differently.

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.040
One very interesting aspect to the way

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.750
that neuromodulators like
dopamine and novelty interact

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.780
with time perception and memory

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:05.673
is how we perceive our
relationship to places and people.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:08.760
So really interesting literature showing

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.593
that the more novel
experiences we have in a place,

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.590
the more we feel we know
that place, obviously,

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.460
but the longer we feel we've been there.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.880
So here's the kind of
gedanken or thought experiment

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.320
that illustrates what's in the literature.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.940
Let's say I were to move to New York City.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.230
I happen to really like New York City.

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.590
I've never lived there, but
let's say I lived there.

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.360
I lived in a given apartment for a year

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.420
and I would have a number
of different experiences

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.710
in this mental experiment.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.710
Let's say I had 100 different
exciting and new experiences.

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:45.490
I would at the end of that
year feel as if I lived there

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:46.940
a certain period of time, one year.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.590
I would actually know
I lived there one year.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:50.580
If however I lived in
three different places

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.300
in New York City and I met
three times as many people

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.290
and I had three times as
many novel experiences,

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:59.840
I would actually feel as if
I had been there much longer

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.010
than had I only lived in one location.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.620
This is also true for social interactions.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.490
When we move to multiple

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:11.200
or several novel environments
with somebody else,

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.520
we tend to feel as if we
know that person much better

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.910
and that they know us much better.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:16.790
Now, of course, we get the
opportunity to interact

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:18.230
with those people in different contexts

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:21.190
and so indeed we do get the
opportunity to see them,

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.140
for instance, at the coffee
shop, how they order coffee.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.360
You maybe go to a sports
event, how they act there.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.150
Maybe how they interact with your family.

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:32.070
You're getting a sense of
them in different contexts.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.720
That's certainly playing a role,

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.800
but it seems as if the
more novelty you experience

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.080
with somebody, not only the
more familiar they are to you,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.450
but the more time you feel
you've spent with them,

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:45.050
even though the total amount of time

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:46.560
can be exactly the same.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.650
And so that's a very interesting aspect

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.210
of how our perception of time
and these neuromodulators

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:55.080
and novelty can shape the
way not just that we perceive

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.930
a given event in our
world, but how we relate

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.970
to a place or relate to a person.

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:02.890
So we've talked a lot about
the different neurochemicals

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.770
and how those neurochemicals can influence

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:06.060
our perception of time.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.150
We haven't talked a lot
about the neural circuits

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:11.260
and the various areas of the
brain that underlie this.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.360
I do want to touch on that

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.350
by highlighting a really wonderful study.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:16.990
This was a study published in "Neuron,"

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:19.470
also a Cell Press journal,
excellent journal.

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:22.430
The title of the paper is
"Behavioral, Physiological,

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:24.800
and Neural Signatures of Surprise

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.060
During Naturalistic Sports Viewing."

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.120
This experiment is really cool.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.320
They did brain imaging on individuals

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.840
who are watching basketball games.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.200
These were basketball games

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.830
that actually took
place that were recorded

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:41.470
and the subjects watching
these basketball games

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.870
in some cases, not all, had some interest

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:46.810
in who would win or lose,
and in some cases, not all,

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:49.780
the subjects in these studies
had some prior knowledge

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.810
of which team they thought was better,

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.310
which team was likely to
win or not likely to win.

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:57.030
The basic findings of the study

01:03:57.030 --> 01:04:00.140
were that they could measure surprise

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.430
by the release of dopamine
in two areas of the brain,

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:07.470
part of what are called,
is called, excuse me,

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:09.330
the mesolimbic reward pathway.

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:10.900
So the two areas of the
brain that are important here

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.380
are the nucleus accumbens and the VTA,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.620
the ventral tegmental area.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.520
These are areas that release dopamine

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.360
as kind of a token of reward

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.660
any time something is surprising

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.270
or a positive expectation is met, okay?

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.650
So if I predict that my
team dribbling down court

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:30.450
is going to score on this drive

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.980
and they get the ball in the basket,

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.300
a little bit of dopamine is released.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.240
These two brain areas light up

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.382
in the functional imaging so-called FSRI,

01:04:38.382 --> 01:04:40.300
functional magnetic resonance imaging

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.750
that they used in this study.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.880
What's really interesting about this study

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.640
is not just that dopamine
was released any time

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.120
that something the subject
wanted to see happened, right,

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.800
any time they wanted to see
their team score, they scored,

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.670
but also during surprise.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.790
So if they thought for instance,

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:01.100
and they would hit a button to predict

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.410
that their team was going to
score in this particular drive

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:07.170
and they didn't, well, then
dopamine could also be released

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.060
in response to that surprise.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.330
So this speaks again to
dopamine being something

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:14.100
that's important not
just for positive events,

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.110
but for unexpected events.

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:19.120
Now, that's all very interesting
and speaks to the fact

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.460
that dopamine is a kind of
flexible currency in the brain.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.570
It's doled out, if you will, or released

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:29.090
when something that one
hopes will happen happens

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.900
and it's released when there's a surprise,

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.010
even if it's a kind of
a negative surprise.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:37.260
It's not something that the
subject wanted to happen.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.090
But the more interesting thing

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:42.250
is how that relates to time perception.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.060
What they found was
regardless of what caused

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:49.370
the dopamine release, the
frequency of dopamine release

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:53.480
predicted how the subjects
parsed the time bins

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.720
of the game they were watching.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.700
What do I mean by that?

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.370
Well, when you watch a basketball game

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:01.050
or you watch anything,
children playing or talking

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:04.780
to your spouse or whatever,
you're batching time.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.550
How are you batching time?

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.620
Well, you could batch a
meal by the, I don't know,

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.240
the appetizer, the main
course, and the dessert,

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.680
but it turns out that's
not what you're doing.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.890
You're batching time according

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.480
to the frequency of dopamine pulses,

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.250
the frequency of dopamine release.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.060
And that's what they saw in this study.

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.280
If they evaluated people's perceptions

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.550
of the passage of time,

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.310
what they found is that that matched

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:30.290
not whether or not the, you know,

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:32.590
it was a particular
time point in the game,

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:34.940
not whether or not their
team was going down court

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.730
or running back up court to play defense,

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:42.360
but the dopamine released
served as markers

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.270
which would predict the frame rate

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.000
of their perception of the experience.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.100
And if that sounds complicated,
what I mean is how often

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.340
and when you release
dopamine is actually setting

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.840
the frame rate on the entire
perception of everything,

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.790
not just for positive
events or negative events.

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:01.340
So what this means is as
you're going through life,

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:07.830
dopamine and the release of
dopamine is saying that's over

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.140
and now you're in a new phase of your life

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.620
even if it's very short, right?

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.127
So if I get up in the morning

01:07:13.127 --> 01:07:16.030
and I really need a cup of
coffee, as you probably all know,

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:20.030
I wait 90 minutes to 120 minutes
before I drink my coffee,

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:20.980
but then I get my coffee

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.970
and surely there's a dopamine
hit there, I promise you,

01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:27.960
I actually am starting to carve up my day

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.643
according to dopamine hits.

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:32.753
Consciously or subconsciously,

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.040
I'm actually carving up my experience

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.870
according to when I'm getting
dopamine throughout my day.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:43.470
This governance over
our perception of time

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:47.080
that dopamine has points to a very clear,

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.550
very actionable, and very powerful tool.

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:53.350
And that is a tool that many
people have talked about before

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:54.693
which are habits.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:58.730
People have discussed habits
in a variety of contexts

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:03.670
but in the context of dopamine reward

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:06.560
and time perception, what this means

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.850
is that placing specific habitual routines

01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:13.680
at particular intervals
throughout your day

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.940
is a very, not just convenient,

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.000
but a very good way to
incorporate the dopamine system

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.350
so that you divide your day into a series

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.150
of what I would call functional units.

01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:26.220
What would this look like?

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.560
It would mean waking up and
having one specific habit

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.560
that you always engage in that
causes a release of dopamine.

01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:35.690
You can say, well, great.

01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:38.320
That'll make me feel
good. And I would agree.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.320
Dopamine released generally
makes us feel motivated

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.670
But it would have an
additional effect of marking

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:47.980
that time of day as the beginning
of a particular time bin.

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.990
Then inserting another habit,
perhaps the beginning of,

01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:53.060
I don't know, your breakfast or something,

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.810
but recognizing that that's a habit

01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:57.820
and being fairly habitual, you
don't have to be, you know,

01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.100
obsessively precise about the timing,

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:04.500
but that regular sequencing of things

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.090
is going to lead not
just to dopamine release

01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:10.010
as it relates to reward and
motivation and feeling good,

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.620
but it actually becomes the way

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:15.320
in which we carve up our
entire experience of our day.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.930
And this is almost a circular argument.

01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:19.120
You could say, well, of course, you know,

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.580
I do one thing, then I do the next,

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.690
then I do the next, and
that's how I perceive my day.

01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:25.330
That's my day. It's my list.

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:27.240
It's my to-do list, et cetera.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.040
But what I'm saying is that
on the basis of this study,

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.150
I should mention the first
author, his last name is Antony.

01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:35.450
It was Antony et al. It
was published in 2020.

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:39.950
The study on basketball
viewing, what it points to

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.830
is that by engaging in specific habits

01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:45.070
that we know we can perform well,

01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:48.370
we are actually setting
the frame rate on our day.

01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:50.590
And so I think there will soon come a time

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:52.940
where human beings are not
just thinking of, okay,

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.650
my morning routine and
my afternoon routine,

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:57.730
I think that can be useful, and in fact,

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.700
I used or mentioned a structure

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.560
of that sort earlier in the episode,

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.950
but rather thinking about
what's actually going on

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:07.260
at the level of our biology,

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.910
which is that dopamine is marking time.

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:11.780
Habits are a very clear way

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.240
in which we can invoke dopamine release

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.470
and therefore provide time
markers, and what this means

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:19.600
is that, for instance,
during your morning,

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.330
you might insert habit one and habit two

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:25.200
at, say, I don't know, 8 AM and 10 AM,

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.830
and in doing that, that marks an epoch,

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.640
a little batch of time
in your morning routine

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.540
that's distinct from the
second half of your morning.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.550
In other words, habits serve as flankers

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:40.910
or markers for the passage of your day.

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.770
Now, if that seems kind of hyper-neurotic

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:45.040
or why would I want to
structure my life like that,

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.590
I would say that many people would do well

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:50.440
to structure their life like
that and to utilize habits

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.840
not just for the sake of
what you do during the habit,

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.140
but because of the fact that
the habits serve as a marker

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.980
because of the way they
can evoke dopamine release.

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.550
And in doing that, you are
able to segment your day

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.330
into a bunch of smaller, if
you want them to be smaller,

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:07.433
or larger functional units.

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:10.890
If anyone wants to experiment with this,

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:12.900
the Huberman Lab Podcast
puts out a newsletter.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.420
It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.490
You can sign up for it at hubermanlab.com.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.490
We put it out each month.

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.060
You can see the previous newsletters.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.400
There's zero cost. We have
our privacy statement there.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.120
We don't share your email or anything.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.300
And there you'll find the, you know,

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:30.050
12 steps to improving
sleep was the first one.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.710
There's another, the second newsletter

01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:33.090
was all about neuroplasticity

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:34.880
and using scientific literature

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.050
to improve learning and teaching,
and in the next newsletter

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:41.780
I intend to include an example protocol

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.030
of how one could use
habits and the relationship

01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:47.650
between habits and dopamine,
dopamine and time perception,

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:50.230
to structure your day
according to performance

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.110
of particular types of tasks.

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:54.240
Today we covered a lot
about time perception.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.380
We certainly didn't cover
everything about time perception

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.970
but we covered things like entrainment,

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:01.210
the role of dopamine,
habits and various routines

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:03.440
that can adjust your sense of time

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440
for sake of particular goals.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.480
If you're interested in learning
more about time perception,

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.930
I'd like to point you to
a really excellent book

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:12.807
called "Your Brain Is a Time Machine:

01:12:12.807 --> 01:12:15.300
"The Neuroscience and Physics of Time."

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.130
The book was written by
Professor Dr. Dean Buonomano

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:20.880
who's a professor at
UCLA and a world expert

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.480
in the neuroscience and physics of time.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.630
I do hope to get Dean on the podcast

01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:27.450
in the not too distant future.

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.970

and tools and protocols.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.450
I cover recent papers,

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:02.250
many of which are not
included on the podcast.

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:06.700

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.370
Not so much today but on
many previous episodes

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:15.050
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we discuss supplements,

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:17.960
and while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.250
many people derive great
benefit from supplements

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.880
for sleep, for focus, and so forth.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.780
One issue with supplements,
however, is that what's listed

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.160
on the bottle of various supplements

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.160
isn't always what's included in the bottle

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.750
and the quality of ingredients
varies tremendously

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:34.030
across different supplement manufacturers.

01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:36.270
For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.930
that's T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.080
because Thorne supplements
have the highest levels

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.270
of stringency of any
supplement company out there

01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:43.410
that we are aware of.

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:45.540
They work with all the major sports teams.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.660
They work with the Mayo Clinic.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.400
And so we're delighted that
we partnered with them.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.300
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.730
you can go to Thorne,
that's T-H-O-R-N-E, .com

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.820
slash the letter U slash Huberman

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.180
to see the supplements that I take

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.920
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.270
If you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:04.960
you can also get 20% off
any of the supplements

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.200
that Thorne makes.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.200
Thank you for your time
and attention today,

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.410
and last but certainly not least,

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.318
thank you for your interest in science.
