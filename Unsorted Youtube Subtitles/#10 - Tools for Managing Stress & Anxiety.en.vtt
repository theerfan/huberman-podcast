00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.920
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.700
where we discuss science

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.890
and science-based tools for everyday life

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.190
I'm Andrew Huberman.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.410
And I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.350
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.540
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.930
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.090
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.110
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.470
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.680
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.900
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.567
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.960
InsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.920
to give you an accurate assessment

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.950
of your health and your biological age.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.540
There are many things about our health

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.750
that can only be analyzed
from blood and DNA tests.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.420
I've been getting my blood
assessed for many years now.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.490
And about a year ago, I
switched to InsideTracker.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.130
What I like about InsideTracker

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.410
is that you get all this information back

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.960
about metabolic factors,
endocrine factors, et cetera,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.780
that are really important to your health.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.440
But unlike a lot of blood tests

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.170
where you just get all the
numbers back and it tells you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.940
whether or not things
are high, normal, or low,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.160
InsideTracker also has this really useful

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.530
and really easy-to-use dashboard

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.610
that takes the information
for your blood and DNA tests

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.440
and points you toward particular
behavioral, nutritional,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.180
and other sorts of
protocols that you can use

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.720
to get the numbers where you
want them for your health.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.800
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.040
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.350
and they will give you 25%
off any of their programs.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.600
Again, their programs allow
you to assess your health

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.900
from the inside,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.600
things that you could just never assess

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.090
from any kind of test that
didn't involve blood and DNA.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.540
And it also has this
really interesting feature

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.130
that it can measure your inner age,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.730
which is based on biology.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.420
Your chronological age, of
course, is very informative

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.170
about your health and
where you ought to be

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.890
in terms of health
metrics, but people vary.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.890
We know people, of course,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.580
that are in their late
90s who are doing well.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.000
We know people that are in
their 50s who are struggling

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.190
or even in their 20s.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.860
So, blood and DNA are the
way to analyze your health.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.693
That's my belief.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.430
That's why I use InsideTracker.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.220
So, go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.090
to get 25% off any of their products

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.730
and use "Huberman" at checkout.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.010
Our second sponsor of today's
episode is Helix Sleep.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.520
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.950
that are ideally suited to your needs

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550
for the best night's sleep possible.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.800
I switched to using a Helix
mattress and Helix pillow

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.920
this last year

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.620
and I'm sleeping better
than I ever have before.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.670
The way that Helix mattresses work

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.760
and the reason they're different,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.340
is that they are tailored to
your individual sleep style.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.240
Your sleep style can be assessed
by going to their website,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.210
you take a brief two-minute
questionnaire quiz.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.260
Asks you questions like,
do you sleep on your back

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.520
or your side or your stomach?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.353
Maybe you don't know

00:02:51.353 --> 00:02:53.600
or maybe you move around
a lot during the night.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.540
It also asks you questions
such as do you tend to run hot

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.350
or wake up cold, things of that sort.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.020
And then they tailor a particular mattress

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.400
to your sleep needs.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.600
For me, I matched to the
so-called Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.500
And I love it.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.060
I sleep better than ever.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.100
And right now, if you
want to try Helix Sleep

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.230
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.460
And if you do that, you'll
get $200 off your order

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.210
plus two free pillows.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.300
They also have a great warranty.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.700
They have a 10-year warranty
on their mattresses.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.860
If you don't like the
mattress for any reason,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.644
they'll pick it up for
free from your home.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:31.630
And they just make the whole
thing really easy to try

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.240
and determine whether or
not it's right for you.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.040
So again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman
to get $200 off

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.110
and two free pillows on your first order.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.950
Some of you have asked how you
can help support the podcast

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.540
in yet other ways, besides
just checking out our sponsors.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.130
We really appreciate the question

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.160
and we've set up a Patreon account

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.760
at patreon.com/AndrewHuberman

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.090
which allows you to donate to the podcast

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.920
at a variety of different levels.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.920
We have, for instance, the 5-HTP,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.320
which is in honor of a serotonin.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.750
5-HTP is the name for serotonin

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.640
that it allows you to donate $5 per month.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.620
We have the circadian,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.350
which as many of you, of course,
will know is 24-hour day.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.930
So, you can donate $24
a month if you like.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.830
You can also pick any value that you want.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.810
We even have the Costello,
which is $10 a month

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.550
which allows you to support the podcast

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.910
in honor of Costello.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.690
The fact that he's 10 years old,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.420
that he eats 10 pounds of food a day,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.930
and the fact that he takes
10 one-hour naps per day

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.940
on average.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.150
So again, that's
patreon.com/AndrewHuberman

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.450
if you'd like to support
the podcast that way.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.680
Today's episode is going to be all about

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.610
the science of emotions.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.020
The first month of the podcast,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.470
we talked about sleep and wakefulness.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.630
Last month, we were talking
about neuroplasticity,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.770
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.990
And this month we're going to talk

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.010
about these things that we call emotions.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.960
We're going to decipher what
they are, how they work,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.550
how we can control them

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.783
when we might not want to control them.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.330
There are going to be
four episodes on emotions.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.430
And today, we're going
to talk in particular

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.563
about something that most
often is called stress.

00:05:22.563 --> 00:05:26.150
Now, you might be thinking,
"Wait, stress isn't an emotion."

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.690
But stress really lies at
the heart of whether or not

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.280
our internal experience
is matched well or not

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.690
to our external experience
where the events

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.240
that are happening to us and around us.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.260
And as you'll soon, see
those converge or combine

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.390
to create what we call emotions.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.780
Now, I want to be very clear

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.010
that we're going to talk
about the biology of emotions,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.130
we're going to talk a little bit

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.170
about some psychological
concepts related to emotion,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.870
and we are definitely going to talk

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.310
about tools to control what we call stress

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.840
or commonly think of as stress.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.610
We're also going to clean up
some common myths about stress.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.550
For instance, that stress
impairs your immune system.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.310
That's true in certain contexts.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.600
And in other contexts,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.530
stress actually enhances
your immune system

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.510
and makes it function better.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.480
There is going to be a lot of discussion

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.100
about whether or not our internal state,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.560
whether or not we are alert
or calm is good or bad,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.400
depending on the circumstances.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.710
So, where we're headed here

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.750
is I'd like you to come
away from today's episode

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.670
with what I call an organizational logic,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.490
a framework for thinking
about these things

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.740
that typically we just call happy or sad

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.418
or depressed or anxious.

00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:44.500
And I'm going to make
sure that you have tools

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.280
that are grounded in
physiology and neuroscience

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.190
that will allow you to navigate
this otherwise complex space

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.760
that we call emotions

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.820
that will allow you to
ground yourself better

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.500
when you're feeling like
life is weighing on you,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.590
where you're kind of being
pulled by the currents of life

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.800
as well as to support other people

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.044
whether or not that's in
a psychological practice

00:07:07.044 --> 00:07:11.470
if you're a practitioner, or
you have clients or children

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.410
or spouses, really, to be
able to support other people

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.470
in your environment better.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.220
And the tools that I'm
going to focus on today

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.260
range from behavioral tools.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.040
We will talk about some
of the more valuable

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.560
supplementation tools that are out there.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.530
And we're going to talk a little bit

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.923
about things like depression, PTSD,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.810
but we will be devoting entire episodes

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.610
to things like depression,
PTSD, and even attention deficit

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.130
and obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.910
which believe it or not,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.120
although this might not
surprise many of you,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.410
have a very strong emotional component.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.650
It's just not just about
compulsive behaviors

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.560
and intrusive thoughts.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.270
It's also about the emotional
load of being in that state.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.620
So, I promise that today
we're going to clean up

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.820
a lot of misunderstanding.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.160
We're going to give you a lot of tools

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.040
and you're going to learn a lot

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.540
about the biology of how your
body and brain work together.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.910
Because if ever there was a topic

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.440
that brought together the brain and body

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.070
or mind-body relationship,
it's stress and emotions.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.480
It's also the positive emotions.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.130
When we feel something,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.190
whether or not we're super happy

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.010
or just feeling kind of pleasant

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.950
or we are feeling stressed,
anxious, and overwhelmed,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.230
it isn't just in our head.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.410
It's also in our body.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.530
And as you may recall, the nervous system,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.440
which includes the brain and
the eyes and the spinal cord,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.750
but also all the connections
with the organs of the body

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.530
includes the brain and body.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.010
And those organs of the body,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.930
your gut, and your liver, and your spleen,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.190
they're also communicating with the brain.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.040
So, I look forward to a day, in fact,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.710
when we no longer think about neuroscience

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:57.597
as just the brain.

00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:59.120
And many neuroscientists now

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.777
also think about the body, of course.

00:09:00.777 --> 00:09:02.280
And the brain controls the body,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.240
but the body is also
having a very profound

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.150
and concrete influence on the brain.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.610
I think up until recently,
people would hear

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.240
about kind of brain-body and
always think about mindfulness.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.090
We're actually not going to talk

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.360
that much about mindfulness at all today.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.440
Mindfulness is kind of a
vague concept, in fact.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.860
When you think about mindfulness,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.180
it's good to take the opposite.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.510
What's the opposite of mindfulness?

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.590
Would be mindlessness.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.570
Well, all of a sudden we're into territory

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.500
that isn't really easy for one person

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.030
to describe their experience

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.190
or to help others with their experience.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.898
Today, we're going to
talk about objective tools

00:09:36.898 --> 00:09:40.030
that match the brain-body experience

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.790
or separate the brain-body experience

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.400
in ways that leverage your
ability to lean into life better,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.990
to feel better, literally
to just feel better

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.640
about what you're experiencing,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.210
and believe it or not, to be
able to control your emotions

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.380
when that's appropriate.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.260
This isn't about becoming robotic.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.710
This isn't about trying not to feel human.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.000
This is actually about being
able to lean into life better

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.100
as a consequence of being able to control

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.170
some of your inner real estate.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.440
This nervous system that
includes the brain and body

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.900
and how that nervous system is interacting

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.900
with the outside world.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.550
So, it's to place you in a
greater position of power.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.220
And so, let's get started in
deciphering what is stress,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.210
what are emotions, and why did
I batch stress and emotions

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.730
into one discussion today?

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.563
Okay.

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:28.396
So, what is stress?

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.730
We hear all the time that stress is bad.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.090
We hear people saying
they're really stressed out.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.730
What is stress?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.410
You've all presumably heard
the arguments or the framework

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.580
that stress is this horrible
ancient carryover over

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.410
from times in which humans
were pursued by animals

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.125
or other human predators

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:52.830
and that whenever we
feel what we call stress

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.220
or feel stressed out,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.560
that it's just this unfortunate
invasion of something

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.030
that we no longer need in modern life,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.850
that this was designed for
when we were being attacked

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.960
by bears or tigers or
lions or whatever it is.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.470
And gosh, what an unfortunate thing.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.180
And we have so many
creature comforts nowadays,

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.830
but we have not eliminated this stress.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.380
Almost as if it was like an
organ or a system in our body

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.020
that was bad for us, that we're stuck with

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.500
just because of the species that we are.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.080
But first of all, all
species experience stress.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.750
And I think that it's fair to say

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.400
even though I wasn't there,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.860
that yes, in fact, throughout
our evolutionary history,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.670
we were vulnerable to animal attack

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.000
and other human attacks on a regular basis

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.120
up until a point where we
started developing weapons

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.830
and structures and fire and other things

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.660
that allow us to protect ourselves better

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.910
from those animals and
invaders of various kinds.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.370
But it is entirely naive for us to think

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.563
that in ancient times,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.080
ancient times being kind of loose term

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.210
for previous on medieval times,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.110
100 years ago, 1000 years
ago, 10,000 years ago,

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.980
of course, there were infidelities, right?

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.740
Partners cheated.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.580
People died.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.870
In fact, before the advent of phones,

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.620
which we're going to talk about today,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.600
you can imagine that someone
might head off on a hunt

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.780
or to go visit a relative
and never come back

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.040
and you would never know why.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.450
That would be very stressful.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.390
So, there was psychosocial stress.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.410
There was the stress of losing loved ones.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.160
There was the stress of cold, of famine.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
There was the stress
probably also of just worry.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.610
This idea that ancient versions of humans

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.930
1000 years ago, 100
years ago didn't worry,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.540
I think that is entirely inconsistent

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.080
with everything we know
about the structure

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.240
of the human brain 100
years, 1000 years ago.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.270
So, all the problems that
we're struggling with

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.923
existed forever.

00:12:53.364 --> 00:12:58.090
It's just that stress at its
core is a generalized system.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.180
It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.560
or people attacking us.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.790
It's a system to mobilize
other systems in the brain

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.860
and body.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.050
That's what stress really is.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.830
It's designed to be generic.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.420
And that's the most important thing

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.630
that I'd like you to understand today,

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.310
is that the system that
governs what we call stress

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.940
is generic.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.363
It wasn't designed for one thing.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.810
And that gives it a certain advantage

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.270
in taking over the state
of our brain and body,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.070
but it also gives you, all of us

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.280
an advantage in controlling it

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.610
because it's based on
hard-wired biological mechanisms

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.060
and there are hard-wired
biological mechanisms,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.950
meaning cells and chemicals
and pathways and tissues

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.820
that exist in you right now
that require no neuroplasticity

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.030
that allow you to put a brake on stress.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.090
And so, we're going to talk about those.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.730
So, you have a system for stress

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.780
and you have a system for
distress that are baked into you.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.450
They were genetically encoded.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.880
And you were born with them
and you still have them now.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.960
So, if you're alive and listening,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.570
you have the capacity
to control your stress.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.440
And today, I'm going to talk about ways

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.930
that you can control your stress,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.360
not just by doing some
offline practice of meditation

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.870
or breath work or something like that,

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.630
but real-time tools.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.180
Tools that allow you
to push back on stress

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.600
when stress hits in real time.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.970
This is something that
my lab works actively on

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.610
in developing and testing these tools

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.540
and evolving these tools.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.000
And there are other laboratories
that do this as well.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.150
So, let's talk about the stress response.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.560
And by doing that, you
will understand exactly why

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.430
the tools I'm going to give you work.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.797
For those of you that are saying,

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:41.950
"Wait, I just want the tools.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.890
Just give me a summary,"

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.960
trust me, if you understand mechanism,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.050
you are going to be in
a far better position

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.980
to incorporate these tools, to
teach these tools to others,

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.490
and to modify them as your
life circumstances change.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.000
If you'd like the cheat sheet

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.870
or you just want the one-page PDF,

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.450
eventually we'll get
that stuff out to people,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.450
but it's really important to understand

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.410
the underlying mechanism.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.243
Okay.

00:15:04.243 --> 00:15:05.320
So, what is stress?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.020
Well, let's just distinguish
between stressors,

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.680
which are the things that stress us out,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.130
and stress, which is the psychological

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.230
and physiological response to stressors.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.690
I'm mainly going to talk about stress,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.290
which is your response to things.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.520
Let's be clear about what we already know,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.570
which is that stressors
can be psychological

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.280
or they can be physical.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.113
Okay?

00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:34.190
If I put you outside on a
cold day without a jacket

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.310
for a very long time,

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.090
that is stressful.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.720
If I have you prepare for
too many exams at once

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.020
and you can't balance it
all with your sleep schedule

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.430
and your other needs for
comfort and wellbeing,

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.700
like food, rest, sleep,
and social connection,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.723
that is stressful.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.640
So, stress, and as I
mentioned before, is generic.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.200
It doesn't distinguish

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.260
between physical and emotional stress.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.400
So, what happens when
the stress response hits?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.100
Let's talk about the immediate

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.750
or what we call the acute stress response.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.870
We could also think of
this as short-term stress.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.030
So, you have a collection of neurons.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.000
They have a name.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.050
It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.940
And it has nothing to do with sympathy.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.090
Sympa means together.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.290
And there's a group of neurons

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.270
that start right about at your neck

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.400
and run down to about your
navel, a little bit lower,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.820
and those are called the
sympathetic chain ganglia.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.490
You don't need to memorize that name.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.960
There will not be a quiz.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.620
But it's important to know that
in the middle of your body,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.120
you have a chain of neurons

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.380
that when something stresses us out,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.530
either in our mind

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.670
or because something
enters our environment

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.270
and we see something that stresses us out,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.480
that we don't like heights
if you're afraid of heights,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.633
somebody you dislike walks
into the room, et cetera,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.880
that chain of neurons becomes activated

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.110
like a bunch of dominoes
falling on all at once.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.783
It's very fast.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.510
When that happens,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.140
those neurons release a
neuromodulator neurochemical

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.920
that I've talked about
before on this podcast

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.520
called acetylcholine.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.390
They release that at various
sites within the body.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.320
Now, this is important because normally,

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.010
acetylcholine would be
used to move muscles.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.680
Actually, every time we move a muscle,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.509
pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen,

00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.050
walk down the street,

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.230
it's spinal neurons connecting to muscle

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.450
and releasing acetylcholine.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.320
So, in the brain it's involved in focus

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.290
and it muscles is involved
in making muscles twitch.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.470
But if we were stressed,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.570
we wouldn't want all our
muscles to contract at once

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.470
because we would just be kind
of like paralyzed like this

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.320
in what tonic activation, as it's called.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.410
We wouldn't want that.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.613
Something called tetanus,
believe it or not.

00:17:40.613 --> 00:17:43.550
because the tetanus toxin
will cause that kind of rigor

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.050
of the entire body.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.100
You do not want that.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.540
When those neurons are activated,
acetylcholine is released,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.060
but there are some other neurons

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.100
for the aficionados out there.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.130
They're called the postganglionic neurons.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.470
Those ones respond to that acetylcholine

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.900
and then they release epinephrine,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.590
which is the equivalent to adrenaline.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.410
So, we have this system
where it's very fast

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.610
whenever we're stressed,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:08.820
the core of our body,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.290
these neurons down the middle of our body

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.080
release these chemicals

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.300
and then there's adrenaline or epinephrine

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.940
released at particular organs
and acts in particular ways.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.230
We're going down into the weeds here.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.730
So just stay with me because
it's going to make a lot of sense

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.400
and you will appreciate
having this knowledge in hand.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.283
That epinephrine acts
in two different ways.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.280
Some things like the muscles
of your legs and your heart

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.270
and other things that need to be active

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.830
when you're stressed,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.450
they have a certain kind of receptor

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.570
which is called the beta receptor.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.770
And that beta receptor
responds to epinephrine

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.960
and blood vessels dilate.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.020
They get bigger and blood
rushes in to our legs.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.030
The heart rate speeds up.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.350
Lots of things happen that get activated.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.070
And at the same time,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.930
that epinephrine activates other receptors

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.780
on certain tissues that we don't need.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.240
The ones involved in
digestion, reproduction,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.130
and things of that sort that are luxuries

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.720
for when things are going well,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.370
not things to pay attention
to when we're stressed.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.640
And that binds to other receptors

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.840
that contract the blood vessels.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.940
So, basically the stress response,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.070
this is the key phrase here,

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.390
the stress response A, is
generic, I said that before,

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.390
and B, it basically pushes
certain systems to be activated

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.210
and other systems to not be activated.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.370
So, the stress response is two-pronged.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.280
It's a yes for certain things

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.200
and it's a no, you may not
right now for other things.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.660
So, that's the key thing to understand

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.680
about the stress response.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.030
That's why your heart speeds up.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.910
That's why you feel
blood in certain organs

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.130
and tissues of your
body, but not in others.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.090
That's why your throat goes dry

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.830
because it turns out that
when you get stressed,

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.660
the salivary glands are shut down.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.420
There's a lot less blood flow

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.250
to the neurons that control salivation.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.770
And so, you're going to start swallowing.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.620
You feel like your throat is getting dry.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.780
There are a lot of different effects.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.270
I'm not going to list them
all off, but basically,

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.290
you are activated in ways
that support you moving.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.190
So, that's the third thing.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.640
It's first of all, it's generic.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.690
Second of all, the stress
response, activate certain things

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.760
and shuts down other features of our body.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.330
And then it's a sense of agitation

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.890
that makes you want to move.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.160
And that's because fundamentally,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.330
the stress response is
just this generic thing

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.650
that says do something.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.050
And movement in this case
can either be the bias

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.410
to move in terms of action,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.570
or it can be the bias to say something.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.920
When we are stressed, we are
more likely to say something

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.660
that probably we shouldn't say.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.140
We are more likely to move.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.590
And if you're trying to suppress movement,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.620
you'll feel that as a tremor.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.880
You're going to feel agitated

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.350
and that's because it
was designed to move you.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.730
So, this is important because
if you want to control stress,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.233
you need to learn how to
work with that agitation.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.390
I'd like to give you a tool at this point,

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.080
because I think if we go any further

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.230
with a lot more science,

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.970
people are going to begin to
wonder if this is just going to be

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.600
a kind of standard university lecture

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.840
about the stress response.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.440
I'm going to give you more
signs about the stress response,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.810
but I want to take what
we now already know

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.700
about the stress response

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.020
and use that as a framework
for thinking about

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.370
how one might reduce or even
eliminate the stress response

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.140
quickly in real time, should
it arise when we don't want it.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.410
So, we're taking the podium

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.920
or we're sitting down at a Zoom call,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.615
and all of a sudden we're feeling flushed.

00:21:39.615 --> 00:21:41.680
We're feeling like our heart is racing.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.240
We're feeling a little too alert.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.483
We're feeling a little worked
up and we want to calm down.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.513
As far as I am aware of,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.300
the best tools to reduce stress quickly,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.430
so-called real-time tools
are going to be tools

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.630
that have a direct line

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.800
to the so-called autonomic nervous system.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.070
The autonomic nervous
system is a name given

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.700
to the kind of general
features of alertness

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.053
or calmness in the body.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.260
Typically, it means automatic.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.800
Although we do have some control over it

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.070
at certain what so-called
leavers are entry points.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.700
Here's what doesn't
work to control stress.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.460
Telling yourself to calm down.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.190
In fact, that tends to
just exacerbate stress.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.510
Telling someone else to calm down

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.513
also tends to exacerbate their stress.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.350
If you want to reduce the
magnitude of the stress response,

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.570
the best thing you can do is activate

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.050
the other system in the body

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.730
which is designed for
calming and relaxation.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.520
And that system is called

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.770
the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.110
Because as I mentioned before,

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.450
the neurons that control stress

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.730
run from about your neck to your navel.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.580
The parasympathetic neurons,
para just means near,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.720
exist in, they're some
of the cranial nerves.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.460
So, it's kind of left
neck and lower brainstem.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.490
Kind of back of the brain and in the neck

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.570
and in the pelvic area.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.650
And the parasympathetic nervous
system is really interesting

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.830
because especially the cranial nerves,

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.890
the ones that are up in the
brainstem and in the neck area,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.220
those have a direct line to
various features of your face,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.030
in particular, the eyes.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.500
They control things like eye
movements, pupil dilation,

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.710
things of that sort,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.840
as well as the tongue, the
facial muscles, et cetera.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.400
The parasympathetic nervous system,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.890
many people don't realize this,

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.430
is the system by which we
control the face and the eyes,

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.763
and to some extent, our
airway, the trachea.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.470
And it's these neurons that
reside within the pelvic area.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.160
Now, the neurons within the pelvic area

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.240
are involved in control of
the genitals, the bladder,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.490
and the rectum.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.470
And those don't have a direct line.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.770
You don't have a direct
way to control those.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.700
It actually has to go
from brain to spinal cord

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.170
and then out to those organs.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.690
Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.830
has certain entry points
or what I'll call leavers

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.420
that will allow you to push
back on the stress response

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.510
in real time and diminish it

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.320
and feel more relaxed really quickly.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.550
So, I'm going to teach
you the first tool now,

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.870
so I don't overwhelm you with
all this academic knowledge

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.970
without giving you something useful.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.970
And the tool that at least to
my knowledge is the fastest

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.510
and most thoroughly grounded
in physiology and neuroscience

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.430
for calming down in a self-directed way

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.280
is what's called the
physiological sigh, S-I-G-H.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.240
Now, some of you might've
heard me talk about this

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.270
on previous podcasts,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.960
but I'm going to explain
this in the context

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.920
of how respiration in general
is used to calm us down.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.660
And turns out you're all
doing this all the time,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.060
but you are doing it involuntarily.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.220
And when you stress, you tend to forget

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.470
that you can also activate
these systems voluntarily.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.030
This is an extremely
powerful set of techniques

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.540
that we know from scientific studies

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.360
that are being done in my lab,
Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA,

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.450
and others now that are very, very useful

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.310
for reducing your stress
response in real time.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.520
And here's how they work.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.010
These days, there seems
to be a lot of interest

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.210
in breath work.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.170
Breath work typically, is
when you go and you sit down

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.460
or you lie down and you
deliberately breathe

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.000
in a particular way
for a series of minutes

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.670
in order to shift your
physiology, access some states.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.390
And it does have some utility
that we're going to talk about,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.054
that is not what I'm talking about now.

00:25:28.054 --> 00:25:30.950
What I'm talking about when I
refer to physiological sighs,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.900
is the very real medical
school textbook relationship

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.610
between the brain, the body,

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.060
and the body as it relates
to the breathing apparati,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.340
meaning the diaphragm
and lungs and the heart.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.630
Let's take the hallmark
of the stress response.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.230
The heart starts beating faster.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.030
Blood is shuttled to the
big muscles of the body

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.490
to move you away from
whatever it is the stressor is

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.760
or just make you feel like
you need to move or talk.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.070
Your face goes flushed, et cetera.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.290
Heart rate, many of us
feel is involuntary.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.620
Just kind of functions whether
or not we're moving fast

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.453
or moving slow.

00:26:06.453 --> 00:26:09.570
If you think about it, it's
not really purely autonomic

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.980
because you can speed up
your heart rate by running

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.830
or you can slow it down
by slowing down your run.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.780
You can move to a walk or lie down.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.840
But that's indirect control.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.210
There is however, a way
in which you can breathe

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.370
that directly controls your heart rate

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.180
through the interactions
between the sympathetic

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.630
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.390
Here's how it works.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.470
When you inhale,

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.010
so whether or not it's through the nose

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.840
or through the mouth,

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.150
this skeletal muscle
that's inside your body

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.340
called the diaphragm, it moves down.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.950
And that's because the lungs expand,

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.190
the diaphragm moves down.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.050
Your heart actually
gets a little bit bigger

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.450
in that expanded space.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.840
There's more space for the heart.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.080
So, not your emotional
heart getting bigger.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.980
I'm talking about your
actual physical heart

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.890
getting a little bit bigger.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:57.950
The volume grows.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.940
And as a consequence,
whatever blood is in there

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:05.460
is now at a lower volume or
moving a little bit more slowly

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.260
in that larger volume than
it was before you inhaled.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.214
Okay?

00:27:11.214 --> 00:27:12.100
So more space, heart gets bigger.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.360
Blood moves more slowly.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.070
And there's a little group of neurons

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:20.070
called the sinoatrial node
in the heart that registers,

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.903
believe it or not,

00:27:20.903 --> 00:27:22.230
those neurons pay attention

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.181
to the rate of blood
flow through the heart

00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:27.300
and send a signal up to the brain

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.670
that blood is moving more
slowly through the heart.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.390
The brain then sends a
signal back to the heart

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.230
to speed the heart up.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.240
So, what this means is

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.860
if you want your heart to beat faster,

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.860
inhale longer, inhale more
vigorously than your exhales.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.600
Now, there are a variety of
ways that one could do that,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.180
but it doesn't matter
if it's through the nose

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.013
or through the mouth.

00:27:51.013 --> 00:27:52.830
If your inhales are
longer than your exhales,

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.870
you're speeding up your heart.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.250
If your inhales are more vigorous,

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.620
so even if your inhales are
shorter than your exhales,

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.970
you are speeding up your heart rate.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.470
Now, the opposite is also true.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.400
If you want to slow your heart rate down,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.010
so stress response hits,

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.283
you want to slow your heart rate down,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.820
what you want to do is again,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.600
capitalize on this
relationship between the body,

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.800
meaning the diaphragm and
the heart and the brain.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.633
Here's how it works.

00:28:16.633 --> 00:28:20.480
When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.780
which makes the heart
a little bit smaller.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.280
It actually gets a little more compact.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.610
Blood flows more quickly
through that compact space

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.660
sort of like just a pipe getting smaller.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.270
The sinoatrial node registers

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.660
that blood is going more quickly,

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.130
sends a signal up to the brain.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.320
And the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.980
some neurons in your
brain stem send a signal

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.210
back to the heart to slow the heart down.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.730
So, if you want to calm down quickly,

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.860
you need to make your exhales longer

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.240
and or more vigorous than your inhales.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.280
Now, the reason this is so attractive

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.670
as a tool for controlling stress

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.440
is that it works in real time.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.720
This doesn't involve a
practice that you have to go

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.360
and sit there and do
anything separate from life.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.240
And we are going to get to emotion.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.000
Emotions and stress happen in real time.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.750
And so, while it's wonderful
to have a breath work practice

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.040
or to have the opportunity
to get a massage

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.340
or sit in a sauna or do
whatever it is that you do

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.640
in order to set your stress
controls in the right direction,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.970
having tools that you
can reach to in real time

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.410
that require no learning,

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.830
I mean, I had to teach it to
you, you had to learn that,

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.330
but it doesn't require any plasticy

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.700
to activate these pathways.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.240
So, if you're feeling stressed,

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.890
you still need to inhale, of course,

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.623
but you need to lengthen your exhales.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.200
Now, there's a tool
that capitalizes on this

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.010
in a kind of unique
way, a kind of a twist,

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.700
which is the physiological sigh.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.230
The physiological sigh was
discovered in the '30s.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.347
It's now been explored at
the neuro-biological level

00:29:50.347 --> 00:29:52.740
and mechanistically in far more detail

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.130
by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.860
Also Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.140
And the physiological sigh
is something that humans

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.683
and animals do anytime they
are about to fall asleep.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.110
You also do it throughout
sleep from time to time

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.340
when carbon dioxide,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.300
which we'll talk about in a moment,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.310
builds up too much in your system.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.009
And the physiological sigh is something

00:30:14.009 --> 00:30:17.170
that people naturally start
doing when they've been crying

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.220
and they're trying to
recover some air or calm down

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.110
when they've been sobbing very hard

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.470
or when they are in
claustrophobic environments.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.530
However, the amazing
thing about this thing

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.410
that we call the diaphragm,
the skeletal muscle,

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.820
is that it's an internal organ

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.350
that you can control voluntarily,

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:36.230
unlike your spleen or your
heart or your pancreas

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.320
where you can't just say, "Oh,
I want to make my pancreas

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.700
turn out a little more insulin right now.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.730
I'm just going to do that
with my mind directly."

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.563
You can't do that.

00:30:42.563 --> 00:30:44.460
You can do that by smelling
a really good donut

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.293
or something,

00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:46.770
but you can't just do it directly.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.680
You can move your diaphragm
intentionally, right?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.920
You can do it anytime you want.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.050
And it'll run in the background

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:54.970
if you're not thinking about it.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.650
So, this incredible pathway

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.200
that goes from brain to diaphragm

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.780
through what's called the
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.613
Phrenic.

00:31:03.613 --> 00:31:05.930
The phrenic nerve
innervates the diaphragm.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.390
You can control anytime you want.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.830
You can double up your inhales
or triple up your inhales.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.010
You can exhale more than your inhales.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.630
Whatever you want to do.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.850
Such an incredible organ.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.670
And the physiological sigh is something

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.760
that we do spontaneously.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.700
But when you're feeling stressed,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.377
you can do a double
inhale, [inhales deeply]

00:31:25.377 --> 00:31:28.450
[exhales] long exhale.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:29.940
Now, I just told you a minute ago

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.940
that if you inhale more than you exhale,

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.630
you're going to speed the heart rate up,

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.150
which would promote more
stress and activation.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.440
Now I'm telling you to
do a double inhale-exhale

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.090
in order to calm down.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.020
And the reason is the double inhale-exhale

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.810
which is the physiological sigh

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.010
takes advantage of the fact
that when we do a double inhale,

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.810
even if the second inhale is sneaking in

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:51.743
just a tiny bit more air,

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:54.750
because it's kind of hard to get
to deep inhales back to back,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.583
you do big deep inhale

00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:57.860
and then another little
ones sneaking it in,

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.650
the little sacks in your lungs.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.710
If you only have the lungs.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.110
Your lungs are just two big bags,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.820
but you've got millions of little sacks

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.540
throughout the lungs that
actually make the surface area

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.680
of your lungs as big as a tennis court.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.130
It's amazing if we were
to just spread out.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.210
Those tend to collapse as we get stressed.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.370
And carbon dioxide builds
up in our bloodstream

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.380
and that's one of the reasons
we feel agitated as well.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.810
So, and it makes us very jittery.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.630
I mean, there's some other
effects of carbon dioxide

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:25.750
I don't want to get into,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.010
but when you do the double inhale-exhale,

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.750
the double inhale reinflates

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.160
those little sacks of the lungs.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.810
And then when you do the long exhale,

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.950
that long exhale is
now much more effective

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:40.320
at reading your body and
bloodstream of carbon dioxide,

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.600
which relaxes you very quickly.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.160
My lab in collaboration
with David Spiegel's lab,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.130
David's the Associate Chair
of Psychiatry at Stanford,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.580
are doing a study right now

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.050
exploring how physiological sighs

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.660
and other patterns of
breathing done deliberately

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.380
can modulate the stress response

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.270
and other things related to emotionality.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.670
Those work are ongoing.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.740
I want to be clear those
studies aren't done.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.230
But it's very clear from work in our labs,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.040
from work in Jack
Feldman's lab and others,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.590
that the physiological sigh
is the fastest, hardwired way

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.940
for us to eliminate this
stressful response in our body

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.570
quickly in real time.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.330
And so, I'm excited to give you this tool

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.380
because I think most people
have heard that mindfulness

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.420
and meditation is good,
exercise is good for us,

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.600
we all need to be getting
enough sleep, et cetera,

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.970
but life happens.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.260
And when you find yourself in a position

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.210
where you are more alert and activated

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.280
than you would like to be,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.040
regardless of whether or not the stressor

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.040
is relationship-based or it's
financial or it's physical

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.020
or anything like that,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.900
you can look to the physiological sigh

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.310
because it bypasses a
very important feature

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.143
of how we function,

00:33:51.143 --> 00:33:53.940
which is that it's very
hard to control the mind

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.830
with the mind,

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:59.440
especially when we are in
heightened states of activation.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.770
When you're very alert or very sleepy,

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.110
it is very hard to use these
so-called top-down mechanisms

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.840
of intention and gratitude
and all these things

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.880
that are really powerful
tools when we are not

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.340
super activated and
stressed or not super tired.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.840
But when we are anywhere in the range

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.610
of very alert and stressed to very sleepy,

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.840
physiological sighs are a powerful way

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.900
of bringing our level of
so-called autonomic activation,

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.140
which just means our
level of alertness down.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.030
And so, whether or not
it's in line at the bank

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.480
or whether or not you're
wearing a mask nowadays

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.450
or you're not,

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:36.210
whatever the conditions
may be where you're at

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.350
and your needs,

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.350
when you're feeling stressed,

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.923
the physiological sigh done
just one to three times,

00:34:41.923 --> 00:34:43.720
it will be double inhale, exhale,

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.090
double inhale, exhale maybe just two times

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.850
will bring down your level
of stress very, very fast.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:51.690
And as far as I know,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.210
it's the fastest way to accomplish that.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.320
An important note about
the physiological sigh

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.450
or exhale-emphasized breathing

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.623
for lowering the stress response.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.600
Many people worry that their heart rate

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.653
does not come down fast enough.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.990
I want to tell you you do
not want your heart rate

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.610
to reduce very fast.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.250
There's actually something
called the vasovagal response,

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.370
where people will stand up

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:18.380
or they'll get up in
the middle of the night

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.720
to use the bathroom and
then all of a sudden,

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.383
they'll collapse, they'll faint.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.860
That's because the heart
rate was reduced too much.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.140
Some people will see blood

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.680
or they'll see something
really troubling and stressful

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.840
and they'll pass out.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.420
That's an over-activation

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.560
or an acceleration of
the calming response.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.490
They're not so stressed

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.180
that they kind of fall
off the cliff of stress.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.420
They get so stressed

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.570
that the rebound mechanism
for calming themselves down

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.630
goes too high, too fast.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.400
They calmed down too fast
and they collapse and faint.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.190
And so, be aware that if you're going

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.700
to use the physiological sigh

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.530
or exhale-emphasized
breathing to calm down,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.450
that your heart rate will
take about 20 to 30 seconds

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.320
to come down to baseline.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.460
And you may need to repeat
the physiological sigh

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.300
a few times.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.170
So, that's an important note
about the use of breathing

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.180
to control levels of stress.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.180
The other thing is that when
you decide to look to the body

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.560
to control the mind,

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.620
it does something else
that's very powerful.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.870
When you are stressed
in your mind and body,

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.100
so you're feeling really
agitated, activated, and worried,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.070
and you use a tool like
the physiological sigh

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.100
or exhale-emphasized breathing,

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.850
you will notice that then
your brain and your mind

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.800
becomes more available for
controlling the stress response

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.870
and reacting to it.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:38.660
Which is great because the
sweet spot in life is to be,

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.950
provided you're not trying to sleep,

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.670
is to be alert and calm.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.503
And so, that's the idea.

00:36:42.503 --> 00:36:43.367
Is to be alert and calm

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:47.483
and to bring you back into that
sort of plane of alertness.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.460
For those of you that
have trouble sleeping

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.500
or just relaxing through the day,

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.730
the physiological sigh can be repeated

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.400
for 10, 15 cycles if you like.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.970
Some people find that it
actually puts them to sleep.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.880
So, if they lie down and they're reading

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.040
and they do too many of these,

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.300
that actually can put them to sleep.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.270
And what you'll find is that
most breath work protocols,

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.670
the kind of stuff that's
done away from real life,

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.010
that you set aside time

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.530
and decide to do quote
unquote, breath work,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.550
most of that works such
that if you're doing inhales

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.300
that are longer and more
vigorous than exhales,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.050
it tends to be activating and alert you.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.270
If you're doing exhales that are longer

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.410
and more vigorous than the inhales,

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.410
it tends to put you to sleep.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.600
And many of the protocols
that are out there

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.940
from laboratories and
that populate the internet

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.610
and wellness sites and whatnot,

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.150
if it's exhale-emphasized breathing,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.940
oftentimes has been used as a tool

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.030
for trying to teach people to fall asleep.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.500
Physiological sigh is a little different.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.790
It's designed to be used in real time.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.170
Just think of it is just
kind of in your kit of things

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.200
that you can do as life happens

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.370
and as you need to react to life.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.000
A note about nasal versus mouth breathing,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.260
there's a plethora of
information out there now

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.557
because of James Nestor's book,

00:37:54.557 --> 00:37:57.410
"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:58.620
which came out this last year.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.490
Excellent book.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:03.250
As well as "Jaws" which is
from Sandra Kahn, Paul Ehrlich

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:07.650
with a foreword by Jared
Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.650
So, a collection of people from Stanford.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.010
Jared Diamond is not at
Stanford, but the rest are.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.960
And some heavy hitters on that book,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.610
which is about the benefits
of nasal breathing.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.090
And in many cases, nasal
breathing is more advantageous

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.810
than mouth breathing
for all sorts of things.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.100
Cosmetic features of the
face, especially in kids,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.450
warding off infection, et cetera.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.830
With the physiological
sigh, the best way to do it

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.760
would be double inhale through the nose,

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.680
exhale through the mouth.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.513
But if you can't,

00:38:32.513 --> 00:38:33.930
and you can only do
that through your mouth,

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:34.910
just do it through your mouth.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.350
If want to do all through your
nose, do it through your nose.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.070
This anchors back to
some underlying neurology

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.340
or neuroscience.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.760
So, for those of you that want to know,

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.100
you have two breathing centers.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.970
One that's involved in rhythmic breathing

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.420
for inhales followed by exhales,

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.890
followed by inhales followed by exhales.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.460
The so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.040
named after a bottle of wine

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.070
and discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.560
and a nearby nucleus called
the parafacial nucleus

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.650
also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.930
And the parafacial nucleus is involved

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.670
in any time you double up the inhales

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.880
or double up the exhales.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.790
It was designed so that you could breathe

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.920
while you're speaking

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.620
because you can't always
go inhale, exhale,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.170
inhale, exhale when you're speaking.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.040
So, I tell you this, not to
overwhelm you with knowledge,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.320
but just know that when
you double up your inhales

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.153
or you double up your exhales,

00:39:20.153 --> 00:39:22.730
you are activating this
parafacial nucleus.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.070
And it has other cool effects.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.530
Because it's located near the
neurons that control the face,

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.780
it also has a tendency to relax the jaw.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.220
There's some interplay between the neurons

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.700
that control the speaking stuff

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.880
and the stuff for your tongue.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.220
So, all of a sudden, when we
do this physiological sigh,

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.780
we tap into neural
circuitry that allows us

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.650
to speak more clearly,

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.780
to control the muscles
of the face and jaw.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.440
Maybe that means not saying certain things

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.960
when we're stressed,

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.140
and just generally to relax.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.560
And so, this brings us
back to the neuroscience

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.620
of this parasympathetic nervous system.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:00.000
This calming system that's been
genetically encoded into us

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.600
that we all have, regardless
of who our parents are,

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.090
which is that the neurons
that control all this stuff,

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.180
the face, the eyes, et cetera,

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.500
are all working together.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.070
And that's why when we get stressed,

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.977
it's hard for us to speak
or we tend to jitter

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:14.100
and these kinds of things.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.030
Just like all the
neurons that cause stress

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.770
in the center of the spinal
cord are working together

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.780
to get our body activated.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.010
Okay, lot of science today.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.270
You've now got the
physiological sigh as a tool.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.830
You know the exhale-emphasized breathing

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.486
will slow your heart down

00:40:26.486 --> 00:40:31.320
and inhale-emphasized breathing
will speed your heart up.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.700
So, let's think about something now.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.340
Let's think about stress
from not whether or not

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.730
it's acute or chronic,

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.250
whether or not it's good
for us or bad for us,

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.410
but on three different timescales.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:46.320
Because then we can arrive
at what this is all about

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.670
as it relates to emotions.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:51.300
Because trust me, this has
everything to do with emotions

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.770
and whether or not you're
functioning well emotionally

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.420
or you're not functioning
well emotionally,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.450
whether or not you're
coping or not coping.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.600
So, those are typically
psychological terms

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.980
and psychological discussions.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.640
We are entering this through
the portal of physiology.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.210
The stuff of medical textbooks.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.400
And we will arrive at the psychology soon,

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.150
but I really want you to
understand the difference

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.010
between the three kinds of stress

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.480
on three different timescales,

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.010
short-term, medium-term, and long-term,

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.960
and what it's good for
and what it's bad for.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.220
I think we've all heard
that stress is bad for us.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.490
We've seen these pictures
intended to frighten us.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.650
And indeed they are frightening.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.740
You see the nice really
plump brain on the left.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.190
It says healthy or control.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.840
And then you see the
brain that says stressed

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.510
above it on the right
and it's like withered,

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.120
where we see that the hippocampus

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.510
and area involved in memory is smaller.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.860
People that are stressed.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.360
We see that the Alzheimer's
brain is made worse by stress.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.450
That people who have a
predisposition to schizophrenia,

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:49.283
when they get stressed,

00:41:49.283 --> 00:41:52.400
higher incidence of
schizophrenia episodes.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.600
You hear that addicts will
relapse when they're stressed.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.600
I mean, okay, we get it.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.500
And it's very important,

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.010
but I think we've all
heard now so many times

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.510
that stress is bad.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.220
But in that conversation, unfortunately,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.000
it's eclipsed some of the
really positive things

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.980
that stress does for us in the short-term.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.730
So, stress can be short-term,
medium-term, or long-term.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.740
Long-term stress is indeed bad

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.510
for all the reasons I just
mentioned and many others.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.000
But what's never actually been discussed

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.910
is what stress is so terrific for,

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.240
positive for in the short-term.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.010
And I think we tend to overlook
the important question,

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.720
which is what is short-term
and what is long-term?

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.850
No one ever bothers to
tell us what is chronic,

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:35.930
what is acute.

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:36.763
Right?

00:42:36.763 --> 00:42:37.596
Is it five minutes?

00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:38.429
Is it five days?

00:42:38.429 --> 00:42:39.841
Is it for the duration of final exams?

00:42:39.841 --> 00:42:43.847
Or is it for the duration of
a senior thesis in college?

00:42:43.847 --> 00:42:46.340
No one actually draws
boundaries around this stuff

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.090
or even general guidelines.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:52.020
And so, it's become a
bit of a mess, frankly,

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.530
to try and decipher this
whole space around stress.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.220
So, I'm going to try and
clean some of this up for you

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.570
based on what we know
from the scientific data.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.310
First of all, acute stress,

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:04.780
when the stress response hits,

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.050
that is good for your immune system.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.790
I know that might be a
tough pill to swallow,

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.900
but it's absolutely true.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.470
In fact, stress often comes
in the form of bacterial

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.330
or viral infection.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.740
And the stress response
is in part organized

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.710
to combat bacterial and viral infection.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.760
There are pathways from
the same brain centers

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.990
that activate these
neurons in your spinal cord

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.990
to make you feel like you want to move.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.063
There are other neurons in your brain

00:43:35.063 --> 00:43:37.580
that activate things like your spleen,

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.100
which will deploy killer cells to go out

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.860
and scavenge for incoming
bacteria and viruses

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.560
and try and eat them up and kill them.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.890
So, short-term stress

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.470
and the release of adrenaline
in particular or epinephrine,

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.330
same thing, adrenaline and epinephrine,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.980
is good for combating infection.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.280
And this to me is just
not discussed enough.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.000
So, that's why I'm discussing it here.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.860
And it relates to a particular tool

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.970
that many of you ask about,

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.860
but I don't often get the
opportunity to talk about

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.960
in such an appropriate context.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.980
It's not that it's ever
inappropriate to talk about,

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.800
but what I'm about to talk
about now is the use of,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.293
again, respiration breathing

00:44:18.293 --> 00:44:23.293
to somewhat artificially
activate the stress response.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.860
And that will accomplish two things.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.693
Okay?

00:44:26.693 --> 00:44:28.040
I'll return to medium
and long-term stress,

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.580
but I want to say
short-term stress is good

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.020
because the dilation of the pupils,

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.660
the changes in the optics of the eyes,

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.200
the quickening of the heart rate,

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.890
the sharpening of your cognition.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.710
And in fact that short-term stress

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.580
brings certain elements
of the brain online

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.170
that allow you to focus.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.330
Now, it narrows your focus.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.690
You're not good at seeing
the so-called big picture,

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.010
but it narrows your focus.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.730
It allows you to do these,

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.230
what I call duration path
outcome types of analysis.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.780
It allows you to evaluate
your environment,

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.480
evaluate what you need to do.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.500
It primes your whole system
for better cognition.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.220
It primes your immune
system to combat infection.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.840
And that all makes sense when you think

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.563
about that the fact that famine, thirst,

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.690
bacterial infections,
viral infections, invaders,

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.370
all of this stuff liberates
a response in the body

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.280
that's designed to get you to fight back

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.540
against whatever stressor
that happens to be.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.610
Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.400
Again, the stress response is generic.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.370
The tool takes advantage of the fact

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:31.910
that when adrenaline
is released in the body

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.430
from the adrenals,

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.590
it has the effect of also liberating

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.180
a lot of these killer cells
from the immune organs,

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.480
in particular from the spleen,

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.160
but from elsewhere as well,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.620
and interactions with the lymphatic system

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.303
that combat infection.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.530
The way this works in the
real world is best captured

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.490
by a study that can be mapped back

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.000
to so-called Wim Hof breathing.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.220
Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.190
after the so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.700
Wim Hof, of course, being this Dutch.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.280
He, I think he has self-titled Daredevil.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.770
And indeed he has many, many
Guinness Book of World Records

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.000
for things like swimming under icebergs

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.440
and going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.440
and crossing the desert
without water, et cetera.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.720
Things that are quite dangerous

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.750
if you don't know what you're doing.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.820
And Wim obviously survived or
I'm telling you he survived.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.540
But there are two components
to a sort of breathing protocol

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.640
that he developed that was based also

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.230
on what's called Tummo
breathing, T-U-M-M-O.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.200
So, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.220
And many people call this now
super oxygenation breathing.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.440
Although the breath work
aficionados will probably say,

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.970
well, it's not super oxygenation

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.870
because you're also blowing an
awful lot of carbon dioxide.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.640
What I'm talking about here,

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.320
regardless of whether or not
it's called Wim Hof, Tummo,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.780
or super oxygenation, is
rapid deliberate breathing.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.813
So, it's deliberate hyperventilation.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.950
Why would somebody want to do this?

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:11.350
Well, deliberate hyperventilation
done for maybe 25 cycles.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:14.170
So inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.610
Typically, it's done in through the nose

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:16.443
out through the mouth.

00:47:16.443 --> 00:47:18.710
Although sometimes it's
just through the mouth.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:23.630
If you do that for 15 breaths,
20 breaths, 25 breaths,

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:24.970
you will feel very alert.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.810
People who have anxiety will feel anxious.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.360
They might even have an anxiety attack.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.620
However, we need to ask

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.280
why that kind of breathing feels that way.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.040
And it's because that
pattern of breathing,

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.740
rapid movements of the diaphragm

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.310
will liberate adrenaline
from the adrenals.

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.470
So, it's the release of adrenaline.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.780
I mentioned that Wim is
also called "The Iceman."

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.330
Well, that's because
he actually discovered

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.403
this pattern of breathing, somewhat.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:55.810
And again, it maps back to Tummo breathing

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.300
by going into cold water.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.720
When you go into cold water,
that too is a stressor

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.860
and you liberate adrenaline
in response to cold water.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.060
So, if you get into an
ice bath or a cold shower,

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.033
you will immediately release
adrenaline from your adrenals.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.670
Now, there are all sorts
of things related to this

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.040
about psychological control

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.180
and stress thresholds
that we'll talk about,

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.720
but I really want people to understand

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.670
that when adrenaline is
released in the body,

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:22.820
you are in a better position
to combat infections.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.320
And so, whether or not
you breathe very quickly

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.710
in these cycles of 25 breaths

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.130
and regardless of what you
call it, doesn't matter,

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:31.310
adrenaline is released.

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:33.870
If you take a cold shower,
adrenaline is released.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.650
If you go into an ice bath deliberately,

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.690
and even if you do it non-deliberately,

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:40.860
adrenaline is released.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.080
You are mimicking the stress response.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.060
And that adrenaline serves to suppress

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.820
or combat incoming infections.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.650
And this was beautifully shown in a study

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.700
that was published in a very fine journal,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.700
the "Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.140
for the US."

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.397
It's literally called

00:48:58.397 --> 00:49:00.660
"Proceedings of the
National Academy of USA"

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.590
to distinguish it from other proceedings

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.940
of other national academies
in other countries.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.170
The way the experiment went
is that people were injected

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:15.410
with endotoxin or in some
cases they were injected

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:19.290
with a bacterial wall
that mimics infection.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.290
It gives you a fever.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.340
It makes you feel nauseous.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.173
It makes you feel sick.

00:49:22.173 --> 00:49:24.050
It is not pleasant.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:27.210
Half of the people did a
particular pattern of breathing

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.180
that looked very much like
the pattern of breathing

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:33.180
I described a moment ago
of doing 25 deep inhales

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.270
and exhales followed by an
exhale holding their breath.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.430
Then repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding their breath.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.680
So, this would look something like this,

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.513
or if you're listening,

00:49:41.513 --> 00:49:42.747
it sounds like [inhaling and exhaling].

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.960
25, 30 times, you'll
start feeling heated up.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.570
You'll start feeling
the adrenaline response.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.050
You're liberating adrenaline in your body.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.680
Then exhale, hold your
breath for 15 seconds

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.760
and then repeat.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.500
And then typically, after doing three

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.410
or four rounds of that,

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.670
they would inhale very
deeply and hold their breath.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:02.380
Now, I want to emphasize
never ever, ever do this

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.770
anywhere near water.

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.620
People have passed out.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.090
So-called shallow water blackout.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:07.923
People have died.

00:50:07.923 --> 00:50:08.756
Don't do it in the bathtub.

00:50:08.756 --> 00:50:09.589
Don't do it the hot tub.

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:10.670
Don't do it before swimming.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.040
Please don't do it anywhere near water.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.140
Please don't do it at all,

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.400
unless you get clearance
to do it from your doctor

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.470
because there are some
pulmonary effects and whatnot.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:19.340
And the breath holds should
definitely not be done

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.580
by anyone that has glaucoma
pressure concerns for the eyes.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.520
But these repeated cycles of breathing

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.320
that liberate adrenaline

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.280
allowed the group that did that protocol

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.660
to essentially experience zero symptoms

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:37.720
from the ejection of this E.
coli, which is remarkable.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.760
They had much reduced or no symptoms.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.050
They didn't feel feverish.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.930
They didn't feel sick.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.580
They weren't vomiting, no
diarrhea, which is remarkable,

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.280
but makes total sense when
you think about the fact

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.330
that the short-term stress response there,

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.100
what's typically called
the acute stress response,

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.430
it's designed to combat all stressors.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:58.380
In fact, were you to
cut yourself very deeply

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.400
while out on a hike in the woods,

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.920
the other thing that would happen

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.370
is that there would be a
rapid inflammation response.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.380
And we always hear inflammation is bad.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.050
Inflammation gives us Alzheimer's.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.570
Inflammation is the worst thing.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.940
But the swelling is associated,

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.720
the inflammation is associated
with the recruitment

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.020
of things like macrophages

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.730
or microglia if it's a neural tissue.

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:23.760
Cells in our brain and body

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.290
whose job is to act like little ambulances

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.110
and rush to that site and clean it up.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.580
And indeed the inflammation
response looks horrible,

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.790
it sounds horrible,

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.790
but it's a great thing in the short-term.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:38.790
You want to have that
tissue marked as in trouble

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.770
and you want the body
and brain to react to it.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.690
So, if you're getting peaks in stress

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.260
from time to time throughout your day

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.140
or throughout your week,

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.670
you are in a better position
to combat infection.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.690
You are any better position
to heal your wounds,

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:54.220
physical wounds.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.150
Many great things happen
in the stress response.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:58.590
Now, of course, the stress response

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.200
isn't always super intense.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.750
Sometimes it's milder.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.073
Sometimes it allows us to
just focus on something

00:52:03.073 --> 00:52:04.620
because we have a deadline.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.460
That can feel stressful,

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.030
but that's one of the reasons
you procrastinators out there,

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.800
people are always asking me

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.110
what can be done for procrastination?

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:13.520
What can be done for procrastination

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.710
is you can understand what's happening,

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.770
which is that you are self-imposing stress

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.780
because stress acts like a drug.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.630
It is a powerful nootropic.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.130
I get asked about nootropics.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.480
The most powerful nootropic
or smart drug is stress.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.310
It's the concern of failure.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.090
It's the desire to do well.

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:32.600
It's the impending deadline.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.760
It's the, "Oh my gosh, I
have to do this thing now

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.593
or I'm going to fail."

00:52:35.593 --> 00:52:38.220
That is the best nootropic
you will ever find.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.910
That combined with a good night's sleep,

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.000
which we'll talk about.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.210
But we spent a whole month on sleep.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.370
So, I don't want to backtrack too much.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.203
Okay.

00:52:45.203 --> 00:52:47.540
So, short-term stress, great.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.620
The key is to be able to
turn the stress response off

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.050
when you're done, when
you don't want that.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.360
In fact, let's just really tamp down

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.860
the relationship between the short-term

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.160
or acute stress response and infection.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.880
Many of us are familiar
with the experience

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.100
of work, work, work, work, work,

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.690
or taking care of a loved one,

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.070
or stress, stress, stress,
stress, then we finally relax.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.640
Maybe we even go on vacation.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.360
Like, "Oh, now I'm finally
going to get the break."

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.790
And then we get sick.

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:15.480
And that's because the
adrenaline response crashed

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.380
and your immune system crashed with it.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.780
So, please understand this.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.860
Now, many of you might
say, "Well, how long?

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:23.810
Is it two hours?

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:24.643
Is it three hours?"

00:53:24.643 --> 00:53:26.380
A lot of you out there that
really like specificity,

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.143
it will vary for everybody.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.810
I would just kind of use a rule of thumb.

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.780
When you are no longer
able to achieve good sleep,

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.350
what good sleep means to you,

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:38.060
and please see the episodes on sleep

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.430
if you want more about tools to sleep,

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.690
when you are no longer
able to achieve good sleep,

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.330
you are now moving from acute
stress to chronic stress.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.490
You need to be able to turn
the stress response off.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:50.950
If I have one wish,

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.490
well, I have many wishes
for this lifetime,

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:56.600
but if I have one wish today
that I hope will permeate

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.020
and spread out there,

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.650
is this idea that we
need from a young age,

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:03.140
but even as adults and forever,

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.610
we need to learn how to turn
off our stress response.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.180
Physiological sigh is one.

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.600
If we're going to activate our
stress response intentionally

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.900
by ice baths, cold showers,

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.030
cyclic hyperoxygenated
breathing, aka Tummo breathing

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.400
or Wim Hof breathing,

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.750
we also need to learn
how to press the brake.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:21.583
Okay?

00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:23.110
So, let's think about the stress system.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:25.180
It knows how to activate itself.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.800
Now we're talking about a way

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.550
of deliberately activating
your stress system

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:30.830
in order to combat infection.

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:31.960
I do this from time to time.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.470
I might feel a tickle in my throat

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.620
or like I'm getting kind of run down,

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.570
I will do this kind of breathing.

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:38.403
I do.

00:54:38.403 --> 00:54:40.380
I will take 25 or 30 breaths.

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.177
Exhale, hold my breath.

00:54:42.177 --> 00:54:44.180
25, 30 breaths again,

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.820
exhale, hold my breath
for about 15 seconds.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.240
25, 30 breaths again,

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.290
exhale, hold my breath
for 25 or 30 seconds.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.290
Then a big inhale.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:54.350
And I hold my breath until I
feel the impulse to breathe.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:56.400
Again, I feel it's safe for me.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.270
I've run it by my doctor, so it's fine.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:00.810
You should not do this
unless it's right for you.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:01.643
But I do this.

00:55:01.643 --> 00:55:03.560
Some people like the ice bath.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.360
I rarely do the ice bath.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.600
Some people like cold showers.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.100
I like hot showers.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.210
So, I take hot showers, but
I do this kind of breathing.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:14.250
Again, they are all having
more or less the same effect

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:16.090
of increasing adrenaline,

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:19.410
which allows you to combat the infection

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.430
because you're activating
the immune response.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:22.520
Okay.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.490
So, now let's talk about
medium-term stress.

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:26.600
Medium-term stress is going to be stress

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:31.360
that lasts anywhere from
several days to several weeks.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.314
Okay.

00:55:32.314 --> 00:55:33.420
We might think of that
as long-term stress.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.840
There are times in life when
we are just dealing with a lot.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.673
Okay?

00:55:37.673 --> 00:55:38.506
This particular quarter,

00:55:38.506 --> 00:55:40.930
I happened to be directing
a course, I'm doing the lab,

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:42.120
I'm doing this.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.060
I enjoy all these things immensely,

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.670
but I'm kind of near my threshold.

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:49.490
I'm near the point where
any additional thing,

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.200
like I couldn't log onto
a website the other day

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.110
and it felt like the most
intense thing in the world

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:54.943
at that moment.

00:55:54.943 --> 00:55:55.940
And I kind of laughed at myself.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.280
Fortunately, I caught it.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.120
But that typically wouldn't be my response

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.210
under conditions where I
wasn't pushed to threshold.

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.900
What is this medium-term stress?

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.270
What is stress threshold?

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:09.770
Well, stress threshold
is actually our ability

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:14.060
to cognitive re-regulate
what's going on in our body.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.960
So, we all hear so much about
we need to unify our mind

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:18.793
and body.

00:56:18.793 --> 00:56:21.720
We need to be at one with our
mind and body or whatever.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.450
Now I realize I'm kind of poking fun

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.650
at some of the new agey language,

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.090
but the reason I poke fun

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:27.540
is not because I don't think it has value,

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.200
but it has no specificity.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.033
What does that mean?

00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:31.970
I mean, I think I'm always in my body.

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:33.920
I've never fortunately
looked across the room

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.370
and seen my arm over there
or my leg over there.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.050
I'm connected to my body.

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:41.080
There actually is a syndrome
where people feel disconnected

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.913
from their limbs.

00:56:41.913 --> 00:56:43.530
This is a real clinical condition.

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.800
These people actually
will seek out amputation.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.090
They will try and convince doctors

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:49.260
to amputate certain
portions of their body.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.763
It's a really terrible
thing for people to have.

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:56.360
And it relates to a change
in central maps in the brain,

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.230
believe it or not.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:00.560
Most of us want to keep our limbs,

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.030
whichever ones we happen to have.

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:04.740
And most of us feel one in mind and body

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.240
so much so that when stress hits,

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.980
we feel it in our mind and body.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.910
A lot of stress inoculation,

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.833
a lot of managing medium-term stress

00:57:13.833 --> 00:57:17.680
on the timescale of weeks or
maybe even a couple months,

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.830
so we're not talking
about years of stress,

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.470
a lot of that has to do with
raising our stress threshold.

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.610
It's about capacity.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:29.860
And there are very simple
tools, excellent tools

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.230
that will allow us to modulate
our capacity for stress.

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.830
And they look a lot like
the tools I just described.

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:40.780
They involve placing oneself deliberately

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.560
into a situation where our
adrenaline is increased somewhat

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.390
not to the extreme.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:49.423
And then when we feel
flooded with adrenaline,

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:52.460
and normally we would panic,

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.240
it's about cognitively,
mentally, emotionally

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.680
calming ourselves and being comfortable

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.530
with that response in our body.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:03.190
So, unlike trying to
unify the mind and body

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:05.470
and make it all calm or make it all alert,

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.190
this is about dissociating
mind and body in a healthy way.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.970
And what would this look like?

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:13.090
Well, this is something I
actually do as a practice

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:15.000
because I mentioned before,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.894
you can use physiological
sighs in real time,

00:58:16.894 --> 00:58:21.070
you can use the cyclic
hyperoxygenation breathing

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:24.390
to combat infection if you're
feeling kind of run down.

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.320
And there's also a way

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.340
in which you can use
things like cold showers,

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.840
or if you exercise

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.580
and you bring your
heart rate up very high,

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.750
you kind of go into that
high-intensity realm

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:37.040
where your heart is
beating a little bit harder

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:41.000
than you're comfortable with
and that you're just you feel,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.410
some people think it's lactic acid.

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.110
No one can agree on this what the burn is,

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:46.360
whether or not it's lactic acids

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.210
or it's buildup of hydrogen or whatever.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:49.850
I don't want to get into
that, but we're all familiar

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:52.750
with the intense feeling of
your muscles kind of burning

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.200
because you're working
very hard physically.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:00.160
The key in those moments is
to learn to relax the mind

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.340
while the body is very activated.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.280
And what that tends to do,

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.770
there's a limited amount
of research on this,

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:08.850
but what that tends to do is
it tends to create a situation

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:13.460
where what once felt like
a lot feels manageable.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.380
Okay?

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.540
That you've raised your stress threshold

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.240
or your stress capacity.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.760
One way that you can do this,

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.600
and this is kind of fun,

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.980
if it's approved by your physician

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.240
and you're able to do this,

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.640
you can bring your heart rate up.

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.900
You can do this through an
ice bath if that's your thing

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.570
or a cold shower or cyclic
oxygenation breathing

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.400
or you could sprint or you
could go hard on the bike,

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.610
whenever it is that
brings your heart rate up.

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.330
And then what you want to do

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.710
is you want to actually
try and calm the mind

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:41.540
while your body is in this
heightened state of activation.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.450
And the best way that
I'm aware to do that,

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:47.583
again goes back to
physiology, not psychology.

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.140
When we are stressed, our pupils dilate.

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.380
The effect of that pupil dilation

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.800
is to create tunnel vision.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.970
It literally narrows our
view of the visual world.

00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:59.180
We no longer see in Panorama.

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.640
And there's some other effects as well.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.100
But that's because the visual system

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.740
through this cranial nerve
system that I described before

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.120
is tethered and is part of
this autonomic nervous system.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.930
By deliberately dilating your gaze,

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.780
meaning not moving your
head and eyes around,

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.080
but by deliberately
going from tunnel vision

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.310
to broader panoramic vision,

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:22.920
literally seeing more of
your environment all at once.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.680
You don't have to do what I'm
doing, which is not blinking.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.230
You're welcome to blink.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.560
But it means deliberately
dilating your gaze

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.820
so that you can see yourself
in the environment you're in.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.720
It creates a calming effect on the mind

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.310
because it releases a particular
circuit in the brainstem

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:40.140
that's associated with
alertness, aka stress.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.930
Now, this is very powerful.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.700
If you're running, for instance,
and you're at max capacity

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.880
or close to it,

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.060
or you're kind of hitting like
80, 90% of maximum on the bike

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.610
and you dilate your gaze,

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.290
what you'll find is the mind can relax

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.410
while the body is in full output.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:58.810
And this relates to work
that in various communities,

01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:00.860
people are working with this
in the sports community,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.430
military community, et cetera.

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:05.820
But it's a form, not really
of stress inoculation,

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.330
it's more about raising stress threshold

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.860
so that the body is going to continue

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.320
to be in a high alertness,
high reactivity mode,

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.020
high output, but the mind is calm.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.550
And so, this isn't about
unifying mind and body.

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:22.230
This is actually about using body

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:24.070
to bring up your level of activation,

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:25.630
then dissociating,

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:28.930
not the clinical dissociation
kind of disorders,

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.040
but dissociating the mental
or emotional response

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.190
from what's going on in your body.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.410
And over time, so if you
do this a couple of times,

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.000
you don't have to do this every workout,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.480
but if you do this every
maybe once a week or so,

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.080
you start being comfortable

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.980
at these higher activation states.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.920
What once felt overwhelming
and like a lot of work,

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.460
now is manageable.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.540
It feels tolerable.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.580
So, that's for navigating
medium-term stress.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.970
Now, there are other tools as well,

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:56.940
but we don't want to go over 90 minutes

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.770
because 90 minutes is
one old trading cycle.

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:00.960
I was trying to keep these
podcasts to one on trading cycle,

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.100
in case you haven't noticed,

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.040
so you can derive
maximum benefit from them

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.830
based on all trading and
cycle principles of learning.

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.620
So, I don't want to go into
every little bit of this.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.020
And I want to make sure
we get to emotions.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.390
But I want to emphasize that
these medium-term stressors,

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:19.860
of, "Oh, it's been a hard
month, or hard week."

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.970
Stanford's on the quarter system.

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.270
So 10 weeks or semester.

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:27.450
That becomes more manageable
when we train ourselves

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:31.860
to be calm of mind when
our body is activated.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.880
And if you haven't noticed,

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.530
most of the tools I'm describing today

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.310
are nothing like the sort of,
okay, sit and do meditation.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:41.510
I'm actively avoiding
saying the words NSDR,

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:42.500
non-sleep deep rest.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.150
I talked a lot about those tools

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:47.130
during the months on
sleep and neuroplasticity.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.040
And of course, they are wonderful

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.610
for replenishing your
ability to lean into effort,

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:53.210
to learn to focus.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:56.150
Please do try and check out NSDR protocol.

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:57.150
See if they're right for you.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:59.020
The margins for safety,
I think are enormous.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.180
You're basically just
listening to a script.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.270
We have links to them
in previous captions.

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.810
I've talked on them on
various podcasts before.

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:06.330
We can provide them again.

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.350
But today I'm really talking about tools,

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.840
so you can learn to dance with stress.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.450
To in the short-term,
reduce that stress response

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:16.280
a little bit if you feel
it's too uncomfortable.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.210
In the medium-term,

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.460
to be comfortable with these
heightened levels of activation

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.637
because life is going to
continue to come at you.

01:03:21.637 --> 01:03:24.300
And we can't pick the stressors,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.450
but we need to be able to function

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.740
at a higher capacity often.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.680
And then there's long-term stress.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.740
Now, long-term stress is bad.

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:35.410
You do not want adrenaline
up in your system

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.760
for a very long time.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.280
In fact, you ideally, you
would have your stress go up

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.950
various times throughout the day,

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:44.740
but it would never stay elevated

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.690
and it would never prevent you

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:46.940
from getting a good night's sleep.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.260
Now, that isn't realistic.

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.093
Okay?

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:53.310
I would say for me, three,
four nights out of the month,

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.610
no matter what I do, I take on too much

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:57.820
or something happens in life is life

01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.563
and I don't get the best night's sleep

01:03:59.563 --> 01:04:01.260
that I would like to get.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.890
For many of you, it's 30 nights per month.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.990
For some of you, it's
zero nights per month.

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:09.210
And congratulations to you
zero nights per month people.

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:11.410
If you are managing your
sleep really well every night,

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.150
that is fantastic.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:16.000
You really want to be able
to fall asleep at night,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.230
stay asleep for most of the night.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.590
And if you get up, go back to sleep

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.440
for as long as you need to
in order to feel rested.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.650
That's what I define as a
healthy relationship to sleep.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:25.050
Check out the episodes on sleep

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:26.947
if you want tools to be
able to accomplish that.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:28.390
And we can all accomplish that.

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:29.630
It can be done.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:30.800
And there are tools to do it.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.240
Zero-cost tools.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.490
Okay, so let's talk
about long-term stress.

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:38.130
Earlier, I talked about how breathing

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.700
can modulate heart rate through this loop

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.537
that includes the brain

01:04:42.537 --> 01:04:44.960
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.030
I don't think I mentioned this,

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:47.690
and I want to make sure that I mentioned

01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:50.270
that breathing controlling heart rate

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.890
through the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:57.083
is the basis of what's called
HRV, heart rate variability.

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:01.190
And we know that heart
rate variability is good.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.210
You don't want your heart
rate chronically elevated

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:05.703
or chronically low.

01:05:05.703 --> 01:05:06.536
A lot of people think,

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.020
"Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate."

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.650
And indeed, if you're in shape,

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:13.250
the stroke volume of your
heart will be greater

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:16.710
and you can have a nice slow heart rate.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.680
Years ago when I was running regularly,

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.910
I think my heart rate
was down to like 50 or 60

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.060
or something like that.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:23.893
That's great.

01:05:23.893 --> 01:05:26.050
But, and now it's higher than that

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:27.350
because I'm running a little bit less.

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:30.750
But everyone needs to determine
what's right for them.

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.470
But you don't really want your heart rate

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.010
to be chronically low or chronically high.

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:35.843
Both are bad.

01:05:35.843 --> 01:05:38.900
We know that chronic
stress, elevated stress

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.570
and especially in the
so-called type A personalities

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.100
creates heart disease,

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.290
the leading killer of for
in most, every country,

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.920
but in particular in the US.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.280
Because of the way that adrenaline

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.957
impacts those blood vessels
or constricting some

01:05:56.065 --> 01:05:57.200
and dilating others,

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.240
it's just that kind of hypertension,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.260
chronic hypertension is just bad.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.790
And so, chronic stress truly is bad.

01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:05.630
I want to really make that clear

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:07.480
because I emphasized a lot

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.490
of what some of the
positive effects of stress.

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.130
But you want to be able

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:14.060
to tamp down your stress in real time.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.377
You also want to be able
to modulate your stress

01:06:16.377 --> 01:06:18.890
and your emotional relationship
to stress in the body

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.220
in the medium-term,

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.420
but by no means do you
want to be stressed out

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.100
all the time, chronically for
months and months and months

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.233
and years on end.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.500
The best tools, the best mechanisms

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.080
that we know to modulate long-term stress

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.680
might surprise you a little bit.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.420
First of all, there are
going to be the things

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.253
that don't surprise you,

01:06:40.253 --> 01:06:42.630
which is everyone knows
getting regular exercise,

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.850
getting good sleep, using real-time tools

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.300
to try and tamp down the
stress response, et cetera,

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.093
that's all going to be really useful.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.090
The data really points to the
fact that social connection

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:59.320
and certain types of social
connection in particular

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.030
are what are going to mitigate
or reduce long-term stress.

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.960
And this is a particularly
important issue nowadays

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.440
where we have all these proxies

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.900
or surrogates for social connection.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.100
We're online and texting
with people a lot,

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.484
so we can feel connected.

01:07:15.484 --> 01:07:17.210
Like the plane's about to take off

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:19.200
and everyone's texting each other

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.233
whether or not they have
fear of flying or not.

01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:22.050
They're like, "Okay, see you.

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:22.883
Love you.

01:07:22.883 --> 01:07:23.716
Hate you."

01:07:23.716 --> 01:07:25.953
Whatever it is that they're
trying to communicate to people.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.567
Then plane lands, every phone's out,

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:30.400
"See you.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.431
Love you.

01:07:31.431 --> 01:07:32.264
Hate you."

01:07:32.264 --> 01:07:33.097
Let's hope it's fewer hate yous.

01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:34.420
But everyone has this kind of need

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.760
to stay connected to one another.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.390
Humans are incredibly social creatures.

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:39.810
Now, there is a way to look

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:41.990
at this whole business
of social connection,

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:45.880
not from just the kind of
wishy-washy new agey perspective.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.530
And I want to point out
that sometimes I'll say

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.130
wishy-washy new agey.

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:51.180
I have nothing against that.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:55.620
I just, my goal here is
always to put scientific data

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.820
and some neurochemistry on
things so that for those of you

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.960
that are into wishy-washy new agey stuff,

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.480
you also can arm yourself
with some arguments

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.990
for those of the members of
your family and your life

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.890
that maybe aren't so tuned
into the typical language

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:13.890
around those practices like,
"Oh, connection is really key.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.060
We all get oxytocin."

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:18.060
Actually, did you know that
connection between individuals

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.350
rarely causes the release of oxytocin?

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:23.430
Oxytocin is released in very
particular circumstances

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:28.430
like post-orgasm, baby
and mother milk let down.

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.710
It's associated with
kind of really intense

01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:34.220
kinds of pair bonding
things of mother and child.

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.310
Also father and child, but
especially mother and child,

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.760
because its relationship
to the lactation system.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.830
Couples post-sex.

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:44.520
These kinds of things that reflect deep

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.970
kind of layers of our biology.

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:50.930
And oxytocin is not just
released when we walk in

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:52.320
and pat the dog on the head

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.927
or we see somebody and
we give them a hug and,

01:08:53.927 --> 01:08:56.270
"Hi, great to see you," fist bump.

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.940
That's not a situation for oxytocin.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.570
The way to think about social connection

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:02.570
and how it can mitigate

01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:04.780
some of the long-term effects of stress

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.920
is really through the
systems of neuromodulation

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.700
like serotonin,

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:13.770
and through blocking certain things

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:16.640
that are really bad for us
when we feel socially isolated.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.850
Things like Taqi Kynan.

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:18.820
So, let me explain what these are.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.080
Serotonin again, is a neuromodulator.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.640
Neuromodulators are a little bit

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.870
like playlists in the brain.

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:26.500
They tend to amplify
or bias the likelihood

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.350
that certain brain
circuits and body circuits

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:31.730
are going to be activated
and that others will not.

01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.370
Serotonin generally,

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:36.090
and I realize I'm speaking
very generally here,

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:38.170
but it generally gives
us feelings of wellbeing.

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:39.050
At very high levels,

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:42.060
it makes us feel blissed
and it tends to make us feel

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.680
like we have enough in
our immediate environment.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.470
This is why some of the side
effects of antidepressants

01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:48.570
that elevate serotonin,

01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:49.860
and actually can help a lot of people

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.290
with depressive symptoms.

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:54.250
But the side effects associated with drugs

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:57.750
that increase serotonin
tend to be reduced affect.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.120
They tend to kind of blunt affect

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.060
or make people feel like
their libido is lower.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:07.020
Desire goes down because the
body has so much serotonin

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.170
and the brain has so much serotonin,

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.340
that one feels like they have enough.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:13.330
But serotonin, pharmacology aside

01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:18.150
or taking antidepressants
aside a topic for another time,

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:20.080
serotonin tends to make us feel good.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.430
When we see somebody that
we recognize and trust,

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.290
serotonin is released in the brain.

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:29.180
And that has certain positive
effects on the immune system

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.900
and on other systems of
neural repair and synopsis

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.500
and things that really reinforce
connections in the brain

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.440
and prevent that long-term
withering of connections.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.640
So, serotonin is tied
to social connection.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.660
Now, social connection
can take many forms.

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:46.620
As many of you know, I am
very attached to my dog.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.340
I hope he's attached to me.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.430
He's asleep most of the time.

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:50.263
So, I don't know.

01:10:50.263 --> 01:10:51.350
And even if he was awake,

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:52.610
I don't really know what I would ask him.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:56.970
But he seems more or less to
be attached to me as well.

01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:00.220
And there's no scientific evidence

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.740
that it has to be human-human attachment.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.020
I do have attachments to humans as well.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.240
But you can have
attachments to other people.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.160
Some of those can be romantic attachments.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.120
They could be familial
attachments that are non-romantic,

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.300
friendship, pets, even
attachments to things

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.800
that just delight us.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.230
One of the things that really can mitigate

01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:23.870
against the long-term negative effects

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:27.660
of chronic long-term stress
isn't just having fun.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.210
We hear all this stuff, "You
need to play and have fun."

01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:31.840
That can be a little
bit of a tough concept,

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.290
especially for the hard driving people

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.610
or people that are stressed,

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.820
but having a sense of delight,

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:39.760
a sense of really enjoying
something that you see

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.870
and engage in, witness, or participate in,

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:46.150
that is associated with
the serotonin system.

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:48.010
And certainly, play is
one of those things.

01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:49.520
Social connection of various forms.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.220
Those are things to invest in.

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.360
Some people might say, "Well,
nobody wants to be my friend,"

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.510
or, "Nobody wants to
engage socially anymore."

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.050
I'll be the first to admit,
social connection and friendship

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.760
and relationships of all
kinds to animals or humans

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.810
or inanimate objects takes work.

01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:06.810
It takes investment.

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.130
It takes time in not needing everything

01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:11.610
to be exactly the way you want it to be.

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:13.660
I have a friend who struggles with this

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.680
and oftentimes the
conversations just circle back

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.330
to the fact that when you
want social connection,

01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:21.410
you often have to be more flexible.

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:22.980
You have to eat on other
people's schedules.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:23.920
Sometimes you have to eat things

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.150
you don't necessarily want to
eat the most in that moment

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:28.500
or stay up a little later
or wake up a little earlier.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.610
Social connection is
something that we work for,

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:33.100
but it is incredibly powerful.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.833
I want to, of course, tip my heart to,

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.042
it's only appropriate to call
him the great Robert Sapolsky,

01:12:39.042 --> 01:12:43.070
my colleague who I'm
unfortunate to know at Stanford.

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:44.680
Of course, he has talked
about this quite a lot.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.490
So, I want to acknowledge
Robert's incredible work

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:48.970
and discussions around this.

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:50.680
You can look up those materials online

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.160
and his wonderful books.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.380
But primates, and we are
primates, we are social species.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.810
And as Robert has said many times before,

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:02.840
never before in any primate history,

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.260
but in particular in human history

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.340
have we interacted with so
many strangers at a distance

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.710
when we are not really connected to them.

01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:14.010
So, finding just a few
people, even one or an animal

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.320
or something that you delight in,

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.530
believe it or not, has
very positive effects

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.370
on mitigating this long-term stress

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:24.680
on improving various aspects of our life

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.943
as it relates to stress and emotionality.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.500
So, that's the social connection part.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.880
The other thing is the social
isolation that goes too long

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.260
is associated in everything
from flies, believe it or not,

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.570
to mice and humans with
this molecule of Taqi Kynan.

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:44.410
Taqi Kynan is a molecule
that makes us more fearful,

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:48.240
paranoid, and impairs our immune system.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.900
And so, Taqi Kynan is like this
internal punishment signal.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.897
It's like our body and
our brain telling us,

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.310
"You're not spending enough time

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:56.600
with people that you really trust.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.130
You're not spending time doing things

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.550
that you really enjoy."

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.810
And I often think about
Taqi Kynan for myself

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:03.040
because I'm pretty hard driving.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:03.930
I have a lot of pursuits.

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.750
I also have a lot of wonderful people

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:08.930
and an incredibly wonderful
bulldog in my life,

01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:11.650
but there are times when
I can be so goal-directed

01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:14.470
and so in motion and trying
to accomplish everything,

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:18.280
that I sometimes forget about Taqi Kynan.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.740
And I like to remind myself so much so

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.940
that I actually have a
little post-it above my desk

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.560
that says, "Taqi Kynan," to
remind me that Taqi Kynan

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.930
is this very sinister molecule
that starts being secreted

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:31.150
when we are not socially connected enough.

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:34.550
And this is why long meals
with friends or family

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:35.819
where there are,

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:36.652
we'll talk about phones in a moment,

01:14:36.652 --> 01:14:37.820
but where there's no intrusions,

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:40.840
or even if there are, just
feeling like we are connected

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.050
suppresses Taqi Kynan.

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:45.940
And Taqi Kynan is something
you really want to avoid

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:50.600
because chronic isolation,
chronically high Taqi Kynan

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.400
that's associated with long-term stress

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.030
really depletes so many good
functions of our brain and body

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:59.330
and promote so many bad
ones including irritability,

01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:01.710
paranoia, fear, et cetera.

01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:03.450
That is really something to avoid.

01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:05.020
And so, I want to highlight Taqi Kynan

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.350
as something to avoid.

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:09.470
I don't want to completely
disregard oxytocin.

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:12.210
It's just, the oxytocin has
been built up a lot in the media

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:15.590
and really serotonin works
on much faster timescales.

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:17.370
Now, how do you know if
you're making serotonin?

01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:18.950
And you don't know in the moment,

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:21.060
but you can learn if you pay attention

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.190
to kind of recognize these feelings

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.610
of comfort, trust, bliss, delight.

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:28.500
And those are not weak terms.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.332
Those are not associated just
with psychological terms.

01:15:31.332 --> 01:15:34.760
They are every bit as physiological

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.330
as the movement of your muscles

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:38.090
or the secretion of adrenaline.

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:41.450
And many people focus now on gratitude.

01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:43.330
Gratitude is a little bit subjective.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.410
And here we're moving from some objective

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:46.550
to kind of subjective things,

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:48.630
but recognizing, and in particular,

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.530
writing down things that
you're thankful for,

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.940
however small, they may seem,

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.800
does seem to have a positive
effect on the serotonin system.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.330
Now, there are a plethora of things

01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:00.920
that will also impact wellbeing

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.950
and allow you to modulate
your long-term stress.

01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:06.610
Reduce the likelihood that you'll engage

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:07.890
in long-term stress.

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:09.240
And we don't have time
to go into all these,

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.150
but of course, finding
the diet and nutrition

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:11.983
that's right for you,

01:16:11.983 --> 01:16:13.430
the exercise schedule
that's right for you,

01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:15.260
the sleep schedule, all that.

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.880
But do not underemphasize

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.170
the social connection part, please.

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.240
As well, there are some compounds

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.370
that are not antidepressants.

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:26.990
Although if you need antidepressants,

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:28.600
then a clinician prescribes them to you.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.300
Please follow their advice if
that's what is right for you.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:35.500
There are compounds that are
not prescription compounds

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.340
that can modulate the stress system.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.650
And sometimes because
of the way that life is,

01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:43.790
we just don't have the
opportunity to control life

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:45.840
and to control our response to stress.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.260
And at least for myself,

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.960
I can only talk about my own experience,

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.760
I found it useful in
times of chronic stress

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.960
to start modulating some
of the neurochemistry

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.080
related to the stress
response in order to help.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.750
Now, if a doctor prescribes you prednisone

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:03.380
or prescribes you some
other hormone or something,

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.213
that's important,

01:17:04.213 --> 01:17:07.530
but what I'm talking about now
are non-prescription things.

01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:10.240
You should check out examine.com,

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.160
this free website which will allow you

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.620
to put in any supplement
and evaluate that supplement

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:17.870
with they provide links in the
so-called human effect matrix

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:18.920
to PubMed.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.220
It tells you the exact
subjects they were done in.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.460
It was a post-menopausal women.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.500
Was it kids?

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.590
Was it normal adults?

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:27.320
Was it people with autism, et cetera.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.520
Check out that site for
any and all supplements

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.800
you're considering or taking.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.030
I highly recommend it.

01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:33.730
I've no relationship to them.

01:17:33.730 --> 01:17:35.040
I just think it's a wonderful site

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.490
that's curated all this
important information.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:41.360
But some of these compounds
are effective enough.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.290
They can kind of take the edge off.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:46.070
And I'll use them periodically myself.

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:47.330
And so, I just thought I'd mentioned them

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.770
since there a number of you
that are interested in them.

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.000
The three I want to focus on

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.590
and one that I think you
need to be cautious about

01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:54.290
that I've mentioned before,

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.780
include ashwagandha, funny name,

01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.950
but that's what's it's called,

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:03.350
L-theanine or theanine it's
often called, and melatonin.

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.730
Let's talk about melatonin first.

01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:06.910
Melatonin I talked about
during the month on sleep.

01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:10.100
Melatonin is a hormone
secreted from the pineal

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.780
in direct relationship to
how much darkness you are in.

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.200
Not emotional darkness.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.450
But light suppresses melatonin.

01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:17.850
Melatonin helps you fall asleep.

01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:19.210
It doesn't help you stay asleep.

01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:23.770
I personally do not recommend
supplementing melatonin

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:27.363
because it's supplemented
typically at very high levels.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:30.470
One to three milligrams or even more

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.680
that is an outrageously high dose.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.480
It's super, super physiological

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.060
compared to what you normally would make.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.260
It also has a number of
potentially negative effects

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.900
on the reproductive
access and hormones there.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.450
Some people can take it without problems.

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:46.530
If you like it and
that's your thing, fine.

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:48.510
I just want to cue to the
fact that there can be issues.

01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:49.900
You should check on examine.com.

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.810
Talk to your doctor, especially in kids,

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.330
because melatonin suppresses
the puberty response

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:55.950
in a number of species.

01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:57.660
Enough about the negative
things in melatonin

01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:01.603
except that people who take
too much melatonin chronically,

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.790
oftentimes when they're taking it to sleep

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:05.940
or for whatever reason,

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.490
yes, it can reduce anxiety and stress,

01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:11.300
but it also can reduce
the output of the adrenals

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.170
to the point where it
can become problematic.

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:16.600
Now, a note about adrenal burnout.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.380
There is actually no such
thing as adrenal burnout

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.720
under normal conditions.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.780
The adrenals have enough adrenaline

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:28.110
to support 200 years of
stress for better, for worse.

01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:31.410
The concept of adrenal burnout has origins

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:34.710
in the work of Nobel
Prize winner, Hans Selye,

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:36.290
who actually discovered

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:38.140
what he called the general
adaptation syndrome.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.940
He discovered a lot of
things about stress.

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.010
He did some phenomenal work
that turned out to be true.

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:44.720
That we have stressors.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.090
There's something called distress.

01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:47.760
He talked about eustress,
which is positive stress.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.666
Eustress has never really caught on

01:19:49.666 --> 01:19:52.660
in the kind of more general discussion.

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:56.340
But he had this theory that
if stress went on long enough,

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.560
that you would eventually reach
a phase called exhaustion.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.473
And that turned out to be wrong.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.860
Although many of you may feel exhausted

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.870
after chronic stress,

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:08.720
there isn't really a physiological
exhaustion that happens.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.760
And that eventually got picked up

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.650
and ran with the general public.

01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:14.160
And they talk about adrenal burnout.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.730
Too much coffee, adrenal burnout.

01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:16.740
You hear all this stuff.

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.260
There is no such thing as adrenal burnout.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.130
The adrenals don't burn out.

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.190
There is something, however,

01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:23.210
called adrenal insufficiency syndrome,

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:25.600
which is a real physiological problem

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.160
where some people have
very impaired adrenals

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.490
and they can't produce adrenaline.

01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.210
And melatonin taken at very high levels

01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:34.030
for periods of time that are too long

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.060
can cause suppression of the cortisol

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.660
and epinephrine released from the adrenals

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.900
and can create a kind of pseudo

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.520
adrenal insufficiency syndrome.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.690
So, be aware of melatonin for that reason.

01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:49.250
Please, I'm trying,

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:52.930
I alone can't get rid of
the phrase adrenal burnout.

01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:55.300
I'm not trying to give a hard time

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.640
to anyone who feels
burnt out or exhausted,

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.180
but it is for other reasons.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.280
It is not because of the
adrenals are burnt out.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.720
Unless you happen to have
adrenal insufficiency syndrome.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.680
So, I'm not a fan of melatonin
for a lot of reasons.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.513
Now I've mentioned several.

01:21:07.513 --> 01:21:08.580
The other is L-theanine.

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.240
I've talked about L-theanine,

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.640
which provided it's safe for you,

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.240
can be taken 100 milligrams
or 200 milligrams

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.250
about 30 minutes or 60
minutes before sleep.

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.170
It can enhance the transition to sleep

01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:20.920
and depth of sleep for many people.

01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:23.050
It increases GABA,

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:24.700
this inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain.

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:27.420
It tends to turn off our
forebrain a little bit

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.840
or reduce the activity of
our kind of thinking systems

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.660
and ruminating systems
help people fall asleep.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:33.600
That's for sleep.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.840
But theanine has also been shown

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.290
for people that are chronically anxious

01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:38.950
or chronically stressed to,

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:40.293
if you look at the studies,

01:21:40.293 --> 01:21:41.520
I have a large collection of studies

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.570
in front of me right now,

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.920
if you want to see those links,

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.860
I know if you want
those, go to examine.com,

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:46.960
put in theanine.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.610
They linked, for instance, it is known

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.400
to significantly increase relaxation.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.840
There are four studies listed
there with PubMed links.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.180
It is known to have a
minor effect on anxiety,

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.830
but eight studies have shown that.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.460
Which I think is a fairly
large set of studies.

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.620
Some of them in great journals.

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.950
It also can reduce task
completion anxiety.

01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:08.020
So, anxiety related to task completion.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.740
Not good for the procrastinators perhaps,

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.480
but for those of you that
are chronically stressed.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.740
It can increase attention a little bit,

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.490
it can reduce blood pressure a little bit,

01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:17.070
improve sleep quality, et cetera.

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:19.040
It definitely has a
notable effect on stress,

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.280
two studies in particular,

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.170
that it can notably reduce
the effects of stress.

01:22:24.170 --> 01:22:26.120
So, there's a lot there.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.010
It also has effects on insomnia,

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:29.590
on some blood lipid profiles.

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:32.270
And so, go to examine.com
and check it out.

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:35.290
But this is one reason why I
supplement theanine for sleep.

01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:37.830
But if I'm feeling like I've
been under a lot of stress

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:41.030
and I'm not managing my stress
very well with the short-term

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:43.160
and medium-term tools that
I talked about earlier,

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.900
I might start taking a
little bit of theanine

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.170
especially in the late afternoon,

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.520
which is when I tend to start to feel

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.190
like I haven't gotten enough done

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:52.050
and the day is kind of carrying on.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.810
And so, you can blunt the
response to stress a little bit,

01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:56.820
which is why a lot of companies

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.280
are now putting theanine
into energy drinks.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.650
I am not a big fan of most energy drinks.

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:04.300
Most of them have taurine,

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:05.647
which I know some of you
wrote to me and said,

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.720
"Oh, taurine is great
for all these reasons."

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.520
Taurine also has effects
on the microvasculature

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.150
that at least for me, were not good.

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:13.780
It cause bursting of
microvasculature in my sclera,

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:17.230
in my eyes, which is why I'm
not a fan of any energy drink

01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:20.350
that has taurine or taurine generally.

01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:21.183
But that's just me.

01:23:21.183 --> 01:23:22.200
You have to decide for you.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.300
I'm sure in the comment section,

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.410
there'll be a couple of
taurinesters out there

01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:26.540
that will say, "But I love taurine."

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.710
Great.

01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:29.110
Keep the taurine companies in business.

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.230
But it's not for me.

01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:31.440
And I'd like people to know

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.980
that it may or may not be for them.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:37.540
The other supplement that can
be very useful is ashwagandha.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.340
Ashwagandha is known to
lower anxiety and cortisol.

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:45.090
There is six, there are,
excuse me, six studies

01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:47.640
that collectively show
reductions in cortisol,

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.600
which is cortisol is typically associated

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.410
with waking up in the
morning, which is good.

01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:54.200
That's a healthy, brief
cortisol bump that goes away

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.830
provided you're getting your
light at the right time of days

01:23:56.830 --> 01:24:00.220
at correct times of day,
like morning and evening.

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.270
But you don't want cortisol
chronically elevated.

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:05.450
That's associated with all
the bad stuff about stress.

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:09.350
There's a very strong
effect of ashwagandha.

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:12.120
You can find dosages at examine.com.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.120
They report in across six
studies, 14.5 to 27.9 reduction

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.520
in cortisol in otherwise healthy,
but stressed individuals.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.810
Now, I don't know about kids.

01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:26.800
You have to look at what it
says on various supplements.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.810
Most things here are being done in adults.

01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:30.280
So, please check carefully.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.450
But this is great.

01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:33.500
I mean, the opportunity for me anyway,

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.240
to be able to take something

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.660
that can help me reduce my cortisol

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.563
so that I don't get some of the
long-term effects of stress.

01:24:39.563 --> 01:24:41.930
And I'm not going to take
ashwagandha year round.

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:43.230
I would only do this if I was feeling

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:46.360
like I wasn't managing my short
and medium-term stress well.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.790
So, I don't take it on a regular basis.

01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:50.310
I do take it when I'm in these times

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.690
when things are particularly stressful.

01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:57.470
It has their five other studies
that show reduced stress.

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:59.200
So, that's not cortisol measurements,

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.493
but things like fatigue,
cognitive impairment, et cetera.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.660
It does lower total cholesterol,

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.770
which may or may not be good
or bad for you up to 10%.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:11.740
So, some people don't want
their cholesterol lowered.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.140
Some people might.

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.110
Cholesterol, we'll talk about
this in a month on hormones,

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:18.810
but cholesterol is the molecule
from which testosterone

01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:21.770
and estrogen and cortisol for
that matter are synthesized.

01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:23.780
So, you don't want to get
your cholesterol so low,

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.650
then there are all sorts
of negative effects,

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:27.850
but you don't want it too high either.

01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:29.645
Mild effects in good clinical studies

01:25:29.645 --> 01:25:31.720
on reducing depression,

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.420
probably associated with
the effects on stress

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.920
and some other things as well.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:39.080
So, ashwagandha is something
I use from time to time.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.430
It's kind of interesting.

01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:44.880
L-theanine, I rarely will
use those during the daytime,

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.990
except under conditions

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:47.470
where I'm feeling chronically stressed.

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:50.320
So, check out the human
effect matrix on examine.com.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320
Again, a phenomenal website.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.870
I think I've sent them
a few emails before.

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:56.930
That's the only exchanges
I've ever had with them.

01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:57.990
But I just think it's wonderful

01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:59.340
that they put together this resource.

01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.470
Otherwise we'd be stuck mining PubMed.

01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:04.820
They've collated the papers from PubMed

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.850
with links to PubMed.

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:07.670
So, terrific resource.

01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:10.550
So, social connection
and some supplementation.

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:14.090
Of course, diet, exercise,
sleep for long-term stress.

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:18.070
And now we're finally in
a position to talk about

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:21.270
what we have set out to
do from the beginning,

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:24.210
which is spend the month on emotions.

01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:27.100
It was very important
that we discuss stress

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.390
and we discuss in the
context of short, medium,

01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:30.640
and long-term stress.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.930
That we discuss tools for
short-term, medium-term,

01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:36.010
and long-term control.

01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:38.080
I don't really want to
say mitigation of stress.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.110
Stress is going to happen.

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:43.220
But our ability to modulate
and control stress in real time

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:46.550
offline using tools such as respiration,

01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.360
using tools such as dilation of gaze,

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.910
using tools like social
connection, maybe some supplements,

01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:53.280
certainly take care of your sleep

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.193
and nutrition and exercise.

01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:58.190
Again, tons of resources

01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:00.310
and information in the sleep episodes.

01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:01.143
So, you can look there.

01:27:01.143 --> 01:27:05.170
We will do a month on hormones,
on exercise, et cetera.

01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:06.760
But let's talk about emotions

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.880
because in subsequent episodes,

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.650
we're going to talk about OCD,

01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:13.040
we're going to talk about depression,

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.970
we're going to talk about mania,

01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:16.660
we're going to be talking about dopamine

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:17.580
and all sorts of things.

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:22.380
But at the core of
emotions is this question,

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:23.800
what is an emotion?

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.950
Well, it's complex.

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.340
There isn't a single brain area
for any one of these things

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.020
that we call emotions.

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.770
My framework, and I
think the modern science,

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:36.770
both psychology and neuroscience
is pretty well-aligned

01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:41.590
with what Lisa Feldman
Barrett has taught about.

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:43.240
Now, Lisa's at Northeastern University.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.410
She runs a big lab there.

01:27:44.410 --> 01:27:46.580
She's a world expert in emotion.

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.540
She's written two books
that are really wonderful.

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.390
One is "How Emotions Are Made,"
which was her first book.

01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:55.712
The second one is "Seven and
a Half Facts About the Brain."

01:27:55.712 --> 01:27:56.850
It's a wonderful book as well.

01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.180
It came out more recently.

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:00.230
I hosted Lisa on an Instagram live once.

01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:03.470
Maybe we'll get her here on
the podcast if we're lucky.

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:05.080
We don't agree on everything

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.390
about the neuroscience of emotions,

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:09.150
but I subscribed to most everything

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:11.060
that I've heard Lisa say.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:15.160
In particular, the fact that
emotions are context-dependent.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.550
There's a cultural dependence, et cetera.

01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:18.600
I look at things mainly

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.337
through the lens of
physiology and neuroscience

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:23.120
and kind of low-level circuitry.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.780
And one way to think about emotions

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.200
that I think is consistent

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.910
and I think Lisa would generally approve,

01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:29.743
I can't speak for her,

01:28:29.743 --> 01:28:31.060
but I would hope she
would generally approve

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:31.893
of this description,

01:28:31.893 --> 01:28:36.440
is that when our internal
state of stress or calm

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.020
matches the demands on us

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.300
or is mismatched from the demands on us,

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.540
we tend to interpret those as good or bad.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.330
Let me give you an example.

01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:51.330
If I am feeling very anxious,
very stressed inside,

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.580
and I have a lot to do,

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:58.160
that doesn't feel good, but
it's really no different

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.260
than if I'm very tired
and I have a lot to do

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.460
because there's this mismatch.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:04.400
I'm not in the right internal state,

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.330
my internal state is incorrect rather,

01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:08.870
to meet the demands that
are being placed upon me.

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:10.940
So, in both cases, whether I'm too tired

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.510
or I'm too stressed to
do what I need to do,

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.410
the valence, meaning the
value that I assigned to that

01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:18.340
is I don't feel good.

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:20.910
It's not a good situation
and I don't feel good.

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:23.070
Now, I might call it stressed,
I might call it anxious,

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:25.960
I might call it worried, I might
call it a number of things,

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.793
but it's not good.

01:29:26.793 --> 01:29:31.180
However, when I'm tired
and I want to fall asleep,

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.540
well then I feel good because
that's what the demand is.

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.100
I need to go to sleep and I'm tired.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.640
If I'm wide awake and
I need to fall asleep,

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.680
then that's not good.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.230
And then the brain tends
to go down the direction

01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.550
of interpreting the
situation as a bad one.

01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:48.310
So, while the discussion around
emotions is far more nuanced

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:50.460
and more elaborate than this,

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.820
one way to think about your
relationship to emotions

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.670
is whether or not your internal state

01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:57.570
is matching the demands that are upon you.

01:29:57.570 --> 01:30:01.410
So, in that way, we don't
really place so much value

01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:03.840
on whether or not we're
feeling alert or sleepy.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.820
We only place value on
whether or not that alertness

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.070
whether or not it's
full-blown stress or not

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.520
or our sleepiness, whether
or not we're falling asleep

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.020
or just a little bit drowsy,

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.600
whether or not that matches
the conditions that we face.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.410
And it's a useful framework to have.

01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:20.040
And it's the reason in part

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.970
why I spent this last
hour and a half or so

01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:25.830
talking about stress and
how to control stress.

01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:26.887
One reason we did that is

01:30:26.887 --> 01:30:28.530
because I think it's
a valuable opportunity

01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:30.690
to learn some tools and understand stress

01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:32.600
and really learn how to
take control of stress,

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.730
which I think we could all benefit

01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:36.010
from doing regardless of age.

01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:38.240
The other reason is that
when you start to understand

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.690
that you have this kind of
see-saw system in your body,

01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:42.710
this autonomic nervous
system that takes you

01:30:42.710 --> 01:30:46.930
from alert and calm to
stressed to full-blown panic,

01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:48.260
it has that capacity,

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:53.260
or from sleepy and drowsy
to passing out tired

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.350
to God forbid, let's hope
never, but a coma, right?

01:30:57.350 --> 01:31:00.620
That you're basically on
this see-saw all the time.

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:03.870
And where you are on that
see-saw of alertness or calmness

01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:08.083
positions you to be in better reaction

01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:10.790
to the demands that you face.

01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:12.230
Whether or not the thing that you face

01:31:12.230 --> 01:31:15.230
is a need to fall asleep or to
listen quietly and not react.

01:31:15.230 --> 01:31:16.950
You now know, for instance,

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:19.860
that if your job is to take feedback,

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.680
when maybe you're going
in for a job evaluation

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.420
or you're in a relationship

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.340
where there was a call for a discussion

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:28.270
and somebody needs to talk
to you about something

01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:29.540
and we need to talk about something,

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.373
you're going to there you're like,

01:31:30.373 --> 01:31:33.070
"Goodness, this is going to be rough."

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:35.320
Learning to reduce that
stress response a little bit

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.830
so that you are in a position to hear

01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:39.970
the information better,

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:41.420
and remember, from a previous episode,

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.253
if you close your eyes,

01:31:42.253 --> 01:31:44.830
you'll be able to actually
focus on the information better.

01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:46.730
There's your permission to
not look someone directly

01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:47.660
in the eye when they talk to you

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.950
if you really want to hear
what they have to say.

01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:53.370
You will be able to modulate
that stress response

01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:55.110
and lean into life better.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:59.060
You will be able to react to
things in a more effective way

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.070
and to not be reactive.

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:04.840
And this is really one of the
important things to me anyway,

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.740
is that so much of the
language around psychology,

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.390
which I think is a wonderful field,

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.360
but pop psychology in
particular is be responsive,

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.230
not reactive.

01:32:13.230 --> 01:32:14.110
Well, great.

01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:15.130
But then how does one do that?

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:15.963
Well, one does that

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:19.170
by modulating their short-term
stress response in real time.

01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:21.330
Not by saying, "Hold
on, I need to meditate.

01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:22.590
Hold on, I need a massage

01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:23.740
and then I can have this conversation."

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:27.050
By modulating the reactivity in real time.

01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:30.400
How does one, for instance, be mindful?

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.010
Which is a beautiful concept,
but how are you mindful?

01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:34.940
Well, I don't know, when
I'm moving through my day,

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.410
a lot of times I'm just
trying to get things done.

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:40.940
And as soon as I start monitoring
and seeing what I'm doing

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:43.070
and kind of third-personing
what I'm doing,

01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:44.780
it actually takes me
out of the effectiveness

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:45.870
and experience of what I'm doing.

01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:47.900
So for me, sometimes that mindfulness,

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:49.480
that observer, as they call it,

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.060
is something that doesn't help me.

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.240
It actually hinders me.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.580
What's important to me is
to be able to work and focus

01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:56.580
and then to be able to disengage.

01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.620
To be able to do a non-sleep depressed

01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.990
or to be able to still fall asleep

01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:02.430
even though I've been
working hard until 9:30

01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:03.790
to put my head down at 10 o'clock

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:08.070
and be out cold sleeping by 10:02.

01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:09.630
That's possible if you can learn

01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:12.050
to control this stress response.

01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:14.730
And to do that, we can't
use the mind to control.

01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:16.090
The mind, we need tools.

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:19.630
And so, a lot of the people being grumpy

01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.810
or anxious or depressed,

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.200
a lot of that,

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.830
provided it's not for some
underlying neurochemical reason

01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:26.663
that's chronic,

01:33:26.663 --> 01:33:29.540
a lot of that come from
being poorly rested,

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.160
from overworked, from
feeling like the world

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.180
is bearing down on us.

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:36.650
And so, rather than take
a subjective view of this,

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:39.120
I take the view of objective physiology.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.570
What can we do that's anchored
to these neuronal systems

01:33:42.570 --> 01:33:44.470
in our body, in our brain, in our eyes,

01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:45.820
in our diaphragm, et cetera,

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.870
and look to those as tools leavers

01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:49.450
that we can pull on and push

01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:51.240
and maneuver through life in a way

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.100
where we start to feel
like we have some agency.

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.450
We actually have some real control

01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:57.010
because we're controlling
the internal landscape.

01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:59.640
So, I think that ought to set the stage

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.730
for where we're headed next,

01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.350
which is to talk about all the things

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:05.170
that you normally think of
when you think of emotions,

01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:07.270
like happiness, like awe, like joy.

01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:09.040
And we will get into some of that.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.140
But all of that rests
firmly on the foundation

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.310
of this thing we call the
autonomic nervous system.

01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:16.800
This stress modulation.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.580
This calming modulation system.

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.490
And again, whether or not
you're activated or you're calm

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.850
is not good or bad, it
depends on the situation.

01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:27.140
Certainly, when you want to fall asleep,

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.260
being activated isn't good.

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.860
When you have work to do,
being activated is great.

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:34.290
So, I hope today you were able to take

01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:37.820
a slightly different view of
this thing that we call stress.

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.110
Not just see it as evil,
but see it as powerful

01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:41.910
and useful in certain contexts.

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:43.770
Great for us in certain contexts

01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:45.572
and problematic in other contexts.

01:34:45.572 --> 01:34:47.930
And as well to think
about the various tools

01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:51.320
that I've presented that
can allow you to adjust

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.060
and modulate your internal
levels of alertness or calmness

01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.450
so that you can lean more
effectively into life,

01:34:57.450 --> 01:35:00.110
which includes sleep and social connection

01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:01.820
and the work you have to do.

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:05.440
And of course, acknowledges
that the events in the world

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.870
are beyond our control.

01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:08.920
What's in our control
is how we react to them.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.810
Something that's commonly said
in the wellness and self-help

01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:13.800
and psychology world,

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.080
but for which there often
aren't as many concrete tools

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.120
that we can really look
to and trust in real time.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.940
And of course, there are
other tools out there.

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:25.830
As always, I'll say it,
I strive to be accurate,

01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:27.450
but I'll never be exhaustive.

01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:28.860
I might have exhausted you.

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:32.350
I might've cured your insomnia
with this discussion today,

01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:33.580
but in all seriousness,

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.990
my goal is to bring you
tools and information

01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:38.620
so that you can manage
better through life.

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:40.300
So, thanks so much.

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:41.870
I very much want to thank all of you

01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:43.860
for your support for the podcast.

01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.800
It's really been wonderful.

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.530
If you've subscribed to the podcast

01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:49.830
on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,

01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:51.320
or maybe even all three, terrific.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.430
If you haven't, please do subscribe

01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:56.480
on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,
or maybe even all three,

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.060
which would be wonderful.

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:00.590
On Apple, you can leave a five-star review

01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:01.850
if you think we deserve that

01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:05.030
as well as a comment reviewing us.

01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:06.620
If you have suggestions,

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:10.180
if you have questions regarding
the content of the podcast

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.840
or things that you'd like
us to cover in the future,

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.470
please put those in the comment
section on YouTube as well.

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:19.050
If you could recommend
the podcast to friends,

01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:21.350
family members, coworkers,
that you think would benefit

01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.183
from the information,

01:36:22.183 --> 01:36:24.640
maybe even send them
the links if you like,

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.740
that's tremendously helpful.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:30.400
Today, as in previous episodes,
I've touched on some things

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.230
as they relate to supplementation.

01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:34.080
As always, I always cover a lot of tools

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.810
that are zero-cost tools

01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:38.240
that don't involve
ingesting anything at all,

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.740
behavioral tools.

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:41.370
But I mentioned some supplements

01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:43.163
that I particularly find useful.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.520
With supplements, it's
a complicated landscape,

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.240
often because many supplement companies

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.340
don't put in the bottle

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:54.670
what they say is in
the particular product.

01:36:54.670 --> 01:36:58.360
We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.710
because Thorne is a supplement company

01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:03.180
that we know to have the
highest levels of stringency.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.070
It's used by the Mayo Clinic.

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:07.390
It's used by all the
major sports organizations

01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:08.500
for that particular reason

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.400
and because their quality
standards are exceptionally high.

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.600
If you'd like to try any supplements

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.649
and see the ones that I
take, you can go to Thorne,

01:37:16.649 --> 01:37:21.649
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.840
And if you do that,

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.030
you'll get 20% off anything
that's listed there on my page

01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:30.330
as well as any of the
supplements that Thorne sells.

01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:35.190
So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:40.570
to get 20% off anything that Thorne sells.

01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:43.040

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.240
we're there @hubermanlab or

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.380
I also do some content on "Huberman Lab,"

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:49.620
a little neuroscience posts.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.550
Some are reposts of
clips from the podcast.

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:53.680
Others are unique content

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.480
that you won't find on the podcast.

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.600

And most of all, and as always,

01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:07.270
really appreciate your
time and attention today.

01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:09.170
I hope you practice some of the tools

01:38:09.170 --> 01:38:10.090
if they're right for you.

01:38:10.090 --> 01:38:12.130
I hope you think hard about stress

01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:14.990
and how you can control your stress.

01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:17.750
And above all, as always,

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:19.073
thank you for your interest in science.

01:38:19.073 --> 01:38:21.740
