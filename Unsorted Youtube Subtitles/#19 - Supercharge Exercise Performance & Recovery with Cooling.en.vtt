00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.370
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.973
for everyday life.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.360
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.880
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.030
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.480
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.660
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.780
to bring you zero cost
to consumer information

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.890
about science and science related tools

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.570
to the general public.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.710
And keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.780
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.520
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.140
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.640
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.340
to help you better understand your body

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.810
and help you reach your health goals.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.980
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood tests

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.710
and the simple reason for that

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.280
is that so many of the factors

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.980
that impact our immediate and
longterm health and wellbeing

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.230
can only be analyzed from blood.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.580
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.820
you can get additional
layers of information

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.500
that can really support your understanding

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
about what's going on deep
under the hood, so to speak

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.337
inside your body and brain
and what to do about it.

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.290
And I think that's really
where InsideTracker

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.680
sets itself apart from
other similar tests.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.340
What InsideTracker
offers is, first of all,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.900
they make the tests very easy.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.240
They can come to your home to
take your blood and DNA test

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.310
or you can go to a
testing center nearby you.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.880
Then you get the information back

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670
and rather than just getting information

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.560
about whether or not the
levels of various things

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.270
are high or low,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.230
you also get to find
out what to do about it.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.880
So it offers directives
related to nutrition,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.210
to exercise and so forth.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.900
It's really allow you to be in control

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.320
of your overall health,
both where you are now

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.850
and its long-term trajectory.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.490
With InsideTracker, they
also have something which is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.640
it can give you a readout
of your inner age.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.240
They have something
called the inner age test

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.500
that really compares your biological age

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.660
to your chronological age,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.880
something that's of extreme
importance and interest

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.340
because it has to do with
lifespan or predicted lifespan.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.850
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.650

and use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.620
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.310
Helix Sleep is a company that
makes mattresses and pillows

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.800
ideally suited to your sleep needs.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.470
I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.940
for the last six months,
and I can honestly say

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.410
it's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.490
Helix Sleep has a quiz that can match you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.870
to the ideal mattress and pillows for you.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140
It's a quiz that takes
just about two minutes,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.620
asks you questions like do
you tend to sleep on your side

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.620
or your back on your stomach?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.620
Or maybe you don't know,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.760
whether or not you tend to wake up

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.660
feeling too warm or too cold?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.450
Various questions about your sleep habits.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.290
At the end of that quiz,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.370
it matches you to a specific mattress

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.200
that's perfect for your sleep needs.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.270
For me, it matched me to the dusk, D-U-S-K

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.280
because I wanted a mattress

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.960
that wasn't too firm nor too soft

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.240
and I really love the mattress.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.370
As I mentioned, I've been
sleeping terrifically well

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.330
ever since I got that mattress.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.020
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.610
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.150
take their two minutes sleep quiz

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.010
and they'll match you
to a customized mattress

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.220
and then you'll get up to
$200 off all mattresses

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.610
and you'll get two free pillows.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.950
They have a 10 year warranty.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.390
You get to try it out for a
hundred nights, risk-free,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.470
if you don't like it, they'll
even pick it up for free,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.840
take it away but I really think you will,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.160
I certainly love mine.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.100
Again, if you're interested,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.820
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.670
and two free pillows.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.100
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Theragun.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.240
Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.700
that releases deep muscle tension.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.880
I first learned about
Theragun on a lab expedition.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.830
We're actually headed out to ocean

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.340
where we were doing diving
with great white sharks,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.290
filming those for our VR fear
experiments in the laboratory

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.760
and it was very long days
of carrying Pelican cases,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.120
those are cases these hard
plastic cases with equipment,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.000
it was diving, we were all
sore and tired all the time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.817
And someone had brought along a Theragun.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.670
It was the first time I had seen one

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.510
and pretty soon that thing
was getting passed along

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.150
and became one of the more
coveted devices on board.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.060
Everyone wanted time with this
thing because it was great,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.060
you could give yourself
a really terrific massage

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.810
and get deep into the
tissue and relieve soreness.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.470
When I got back, I got a Theragun

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.770
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.000
Whether or not you want
to treat your muscles

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.510
because they're tense from working out

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.100
or whether or not you just
want to release stress,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.840
it's a terrific tool.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.070
Many of you are familiar probably
with professional massages

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.170
but Theragun is
interesting because you can

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.370
basically give yourself
a deep tissue massage,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.280
anytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.060
If you want to try Theragun,
you can try it for 30 days.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.250
They start at only $199.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.680
You can go to
theragun.com/huberman right now

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680
and you can get your gen
fourth Theragun today,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.930
that's the one that I use or
another one of their models.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.630
That's Theragun.com/huberman
to try Theragun.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.500
This episode marks the
beginning of a new topic

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.850
for the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.830
As many of you already know,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.400
we go deep into a
particular topic over four,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.410
sometimes even five episodes.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.320
We just closed out the
episodes on hormones.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.520
Now we are going to talk

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.160
about how to optimize physical performance

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.720
and skill learning.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.080
We're going to look deep
at the science behind this

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.570
as well as specific practices.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.450
In fact, today, you're going
to hear about specific tools

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.170
that you can use to improve
endurance and strength by up to,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.220
I'm not making this up,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.250
three or four times your current capacity.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.750
This is based on studies
that were done at Stanford

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.180
and are currently in use

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.683
by collegiate and professional teams.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.470
If you're not a professional
athlete or a serious athlete,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.303
that's okay.

00:05:56.303 --> 00:05:57.370
The topics, this month

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.300
and all the information
we are going to cover

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.133
are going to make you

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.803
a better recreational exerciser as well.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.950
If you're not an exerciser

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.380
and you're thinking
about getting into that

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.100
or if you live in the Northern hemisphere

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.510
and you're just thinking
about the beach this summer

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.670
or fat loss, muscle
building, that sort of thing,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.400
this month we're going to
cover all of that as well.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.130
There's so much confusion out there

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.230
about how to optimize fat
loss, muscle building,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.320
improvements in flexibility, for instance,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.430
or skill learning.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.110
I know many of you, aren't so focused

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.230
on the cosmetic aspects
of physical exercise

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.410
but are interested in
actual skill learning,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.160
we're going to talk about that too.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.740
I want to just take a moment

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.590
to reflect on something
that came up last episode.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.350
If you didn't see that episode,
that's quite all right.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.810
But last episode, we were talking

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.150
about the hormones,
adrenaline, and cortisol

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.800
and how to leverage those
towards attention and learning

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.420
and there was a little bit of confusion

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.840
that I want to clarify.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.380
I mentioned an optimal
protocol for learning

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.060
that involves leveraging
adrenaline also called epinephrin

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.350
and it involved four steps.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.380
The four steps that I spelled out

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.990
were to be calm and focused

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.700
while one is trying to acquire
or learn the new skill,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.520
cognitive skill or motor skill,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.520
then to have a spike in adrenaline.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.060
I mentioned ways to do that,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.060
using cold or breathing or other tools,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.730
immediately after the learning episode

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.050
then to incorporate what I
call non sleep deep rest,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.050
a 20 minute episode of a shallow
nap or some other protocol

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.190
like NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.120
of which we always provide
links in the captions.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.350
And then to try and optimize
sleep later that night

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.830
and the subsequent night.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.440
Some of you heard this
and it sunk in right away

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.650
and it was straight forward.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.330
Others said, wait, I thought
from a previous episode

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.820
even before that, you said you're supposed

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.060
to do non sleep deep rest
immediately after learning, no.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.930
We added another step,
the logic still follows

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.090
that you want to be calm
and focused during learning,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.000
then you want to spike
adrenaline at the end.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.370
Most people get that backward,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.640
they're drinking too much coffee

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.260
or even taking nootropics and things,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.180
trying to be really
focused while learning.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.700
Some people are taking
Adderall recreationally

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.080
something I don't recommend,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.200
that's actually getting
the whole process backwards

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.070
if you look at the data in the physiology.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.360
You want to spike adrenaline at the end

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.090
or immediately after a learning episode

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.750
and then non sleep deep rest
and then sleep itself, okay?

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.010
Four steps, hope that
clarifies things for you,

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.390
if you have any additional questions

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.320
please put them in the
comment section below.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.930
Okay, so let's talk about
physical performance.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.950
There are so many variables
to physical performance

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.720
and we can manage physical
performance and skill learning

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.860
from a variety of contexts.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.640
I made just a short list
of some of the things

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.950
that come to mind that
can powerfully impact

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.290
physical performance and skill learning.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.210
Some of them are what I
would consider foundational.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.720
They allow you to show
up your current ability

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.740
and if you were to disrupt those,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.580
you would perform less well.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.390
So things like getting
a good night's sleep,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.000
things like being properly hydrated,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.110
things like being well nourished,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.210
whatever that means to you.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.160
I know some of you like
to exercise fasted,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.680
some of you prefer to
have food in your stomach

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.583
or have eaten a couple hours before.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.260
There are supplements, there are drugs,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.770
there are different ways to breathe,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.340
there are so many tools related
to mindset, visualization,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.460
there are machines and devices,
it's just a vast space,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.360
but it's not infinite.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.920
And there are a few things
in the list of things

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.480
that can impact and even
optimize physical performance

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.080
and skill learning that
have an outsized effect

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.440
that any of you can use.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.890
Many of them, most of them
are low to zero costs.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.770
So today we are going to
focus on what I believe to be

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.490
one of the most powerful tools

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.730
to improve physical performance

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.540
and skill learning and recovery

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.430
and we'll talk about why that's important

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.580
and that's temperature.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.810
Now many of you might think,
oh, well that's kind of boring,

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.420
I want to know about the
magic pill that I can take

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.100
that's going to allow
me to dunk a basketball

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.120
if I currently can't or I
want to know about the thing

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.820
that's going to let me
run further and faster

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.250
is going to shed fat.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.900
Believe it or not, temperature
is the most powerful variable

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.210
for improving physical
performance and for recovery.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.880
I would argue it's even
more important than sleep

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.610
because temperature itself
is going to dictate how well

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.623
and when you sleep and the
depth of your total recovery.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.190
There are two aspects to
temperature of course,

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.830
there's heat and there's cold.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.670
We are mainly going to focus on cold

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.020
as a way to buffer heat.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.000
In a previous podcast episode,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.820
I talked all about growth hormone.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.220
You can find that episode about
fibroid and growth hormone

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.530
and how heat can be a powerful stimulus

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.550
for increasing growth hormone

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.990
which is involved in
tissue repair and et cetera

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.740
and burn fat and improve
metabolism in various ways.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.720
However, cold I would argue

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.570
is even more powerful than heat as a tool

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.630
and I'm not just talking
about putting ice packs

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.400
on sore muscles or slightly
sprained limbs and ankles

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.820
and things of that sort.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.230
We're going to talk about cold

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.870
from the standpoint of thermal physiology.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.710
This is a literature that's
rich in scientific information

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.720
that goes back very deep
into the last century

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.580
where physiologists and
neuroscientists figured out

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.360
that there are different
compartments in your body

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.490
that heat and cool you differently

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.630
and that you can leverage
those in order to double

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.463
and as I mentioned before

00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:41.760
even triple or quadruple your work output

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.870
both strength, repetitions, and endurance.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.420
So this is not weak sauces that they say,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.820
this is the stuff that can

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.720
really shift the needle quite a bit

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.700
and it's not just about well once,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.090
it's about being able to
perform well and recover

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.520
from that performance so
that you do even better

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.110
when you're not incorporating these tools

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.670
on days where for instance,
you can't access cold

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.290
or an ice pack or an ice bath
or things of that sort, okay?

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.530
So we're going to cover cold,
we're going to talk a little bit

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.340
about the physiology of cold
and heat and how they work

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.170
because as you've probably
heard me say before

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.260
if you can understand some mechanism,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.340
if you can just push yourself

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.780
through a little bit of new knowledge,

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.520
into understanding a
little bit of mechanism

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.100
about how you work, you'll
be in a far better position

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.510
to implement the tools in the
best and most flexible ways

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.810
for your needs.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.250
This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.330
I never ever do a just list of the things

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.350
that you should do.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.630
I don't believe in that,
just tell me what to do.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.880
First, I tell you why
you should do something.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.240
What's the logical framework
that it's grounded in

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.680
and then we distill that
down to specific protocols.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.360
For those of you that are
too impatient for that,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.490
there are millions, if not billions

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.260
of other resources out
there that will take you

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.670
into the cul-de-sac of one
protocol that will work

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.300
and then stop working or might
work for you indefinitely,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.970
that's not how we work here.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.620
This is about really
understanding the mechanism

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.320
so that you can tweak
things and modify things,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.450
adjust the timing and the dosage of things

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.150
and really get the most out
of these tools and protocols.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.450
Everything I'm going to talk about

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.050
pertains to both endurance exercise

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.600
and strength and speed type exercise.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.600
So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.140
and to some extent, flexibility

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.090
but we're going to cover
flexibility in depth

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.400
as well as another feature
that's not often talked about

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.320
which is suppleness or
smoothness of movement

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.963
over different ranges of
movement in a subsequent episode.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.010
Let's start by talking about temperature.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.740
What is temperature?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.380
How does temperature impact the body

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.370
and its ability to perform,
including learn new skills?

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.590
So everyone probably remembers,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.300
or has at least heard of
the word homeostasis, right?

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.130
That the body wants to remain

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.770
in a particular range of temperatures,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.690
that it doesn't like to
be too hot or too cold.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.270
And I want to emphasize from the outset

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.130
that there are many mechanisms
that are installed into us

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.830
by way of our evolutionary
design and our genome

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.680
meaning we were just born
with this stuff ready

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.763
to keep our body temperature
in a particular narrow range.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.420
Heating up too much is just plain bad.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.280
It's not just bad for
physical performance,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.680
it's bad for all tissue health.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.010
If your brain heats up too
much, neurons start dying

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.830
and those neurons don't come back, okay?

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.490
You may have heard about neurogenesis,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.080
the ability for the brain
to regenerate itself

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.670
or generate new neurons and adulthood,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.420
there's very little neurogenesis
excuse me, in adulthood,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.910
even after anytime after puberty really

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.620
and you don't want to lose neurons

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.920
in the central nervous system.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.700
If you get too hot, that'll happen.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.700
It's called hyperthermia, you
want to avoid hyperthermia

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.300
and you have many mechanisms

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.850
that are built into you to
avoid becoming hyperthermic.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.610
The other thing that
happens when we get too warm

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.810
is that we have in all of our cells,

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.746
what are called enzymes.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.620
You generally know if
something's an enzyme

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.970
because it ends in the
letters, A-S-E, right?

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.970
So lipase is an enzyme
that exists to digest fats.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.950
You have proteases that are
there to digest proteins, right?

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.950
So anytime you see A-S-E
chances are it's an enzyme.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.160
Enzymes are proteins, and they
have a particular structure

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.140
and their structure becomes
modified when heat increases

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.470
and that's not good.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.370
You want their structure
to be of a particular type.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.610
Imagine a car with four wheels,

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.060
let's just say the car is the enzyme.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.510
If it gets too hot, it's like
two of the wheels fall off

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.880
and that thing can't function.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.010
So one of the reasons
why the body and nature

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.830
goes through so much effort
to build in mechanisms

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.990
to make sure that we don't become too warm

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.040
is because when we get to warm,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.500
these enzymes don't function,
cells stop functioning,

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.760
they stop being able to generate energy,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.430
they stop being able to digest things,

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.320
you stop being able to think

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.520
and eventually those cells
start dying off entirely.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.640
So keeping temperature in a
particular range is really good,

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.490
you don't want to get too hot.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.820
We have much more flexibility
in terms of getting cold.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.100
Now you don't want to
become hypothermic either.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.500
You can die from hypothermia

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.170
just like you can die from hyperthermia.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:44.170
However that you have a
lot more range to be cold

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.980
than you do to be too warm, okay?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.670
And in general, the idea is
to keep the body and brain

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.943
in a particular range but
anytime we do anything,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.880
our body temperature can shift.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.020
So for instance, if you were
to stand next to a campfire

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.100
or you were outside on a hot day,

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.990
various things would happen
to dump heat from your body.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.620
If you were outside on a cold day

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.760
or you were to get into a
cold shower or a cold lake,

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.860
various things would happen

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.440
to insulate heat within your body.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.070
This is all pretty straightforward
and obvious I realize.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.670
Now, what are those things?

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.220
Well, there are a huge category of them.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.030
When you get into cold water,
you secrete adrenaline.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.250
On a hot day, if it's really
hot or in a very hot sauna

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.083
or in the hot desert,

00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:30.480
you will generate what are
called heat shock proteins

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.560
which will set off other sets of cascades,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.283
metabolic cascades, biological cascades.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.060
But the simplest way to think
about this process is that

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.360
when we get cold, we
tend to vasoconstrict.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.680
Our blood vessels tend to constrict

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.150
and we tend to push energy
toward the core of our body

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.340
to preserve our core organs, okay?

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.170
So our periphery, our hands
and our feet and our toes

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.950
and our legs become colder

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.660
and our core therefore can
maintain blood to that area

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.563
and we are insulating our core.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.910
Conversely, when we heat up
our blood vessels vasodilate,

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.060
they expand a bit and more
blood flows to our periphery

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.260
and more blood can move
throughout the body generally

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.580
and we will perspire, we will
sweat, water will actually

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.150
get pulled out of the
blood to some extent,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.660
moved up through sweat glands

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.220
and will be brought to the skin surface

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.840
so that it can be dumped,
we are dumping heat.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.650
Animals, as you know vary
in their capacity to sweat.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.370
Some animals like camels
won't start sweating at first

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.560
if they heat up, what
they'll do is they'll spit,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.260
they'll dump heat by spitting, okay?

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.350
Dogs pant, Castilla is
off to my left here,

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.880
he pants when he gets
too warm, he can't sweat

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.720
or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.700
But we can sweat and
you've probably noticed

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.350
that on a humid hot day,
you'll feel much warmer

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.830
just walking or running than you would

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.610
with the equivalent exercise or movement

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.110
than you would on a cold day.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.400
And some of you probably
know this, but if you don't

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.340
the reason is you sweat on a cold day,

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.700
but because the air is dry typically,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.810
you will bring that sweat to the surface

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.810
and provided you're wearing clothes

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.750
that allow some air to get
out away from the body,

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.170
so you're not wearing,
you know, really tight,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.253
you know spandex type clothing
or something like that,

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:32.750
or, you know seal type
saran wrap type clothing

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.470
that sweat will evaporate
off into the dry atmosphere.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.180
Whereas on a humid day,
the reason you see people

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.690
in New York and Florida
on a humid summer day

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.410
and they're like moving
their shirts off themselves

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.280
and you see people with, you know

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.340
big sweat stains and back sweat stains

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.020
and all this kind of stuff
is because they're sweating

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.340
as they normally would, but it's humid

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.320
and so there is the humidity,
the air doesn't allow transfer

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.370
of that sweat into the
atmosphere as readily

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.680
and so you're hot, okay?

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.520
So without the evaporation,
you're going to be warmer.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.440
So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.740
and we vasodilate when
we want to dump heat.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.700
When we want to maintain
heat, we vasoconstrict

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.640
and we tend to not sweat.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.510
The other thing that happens
is you'll get goosebumps.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.990
So-called goose pimples
they're sometimes called.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.330
Those are a throwback to the time

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.800
where we had fur over
most, not all of our body.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.840
All mammals in the cold have a process

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.930
whereby adrenaline is
released at low levels

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.160
typically into the body,
that adrenaline activates

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.650
what are called sympathetic fibers,

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.330
they have nothing to do with sympathy,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.430
those little fibers, which are neurons,

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.860
those fibers that what I'm
saying are fibers are neurons,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.470
not clothing fibers,
reach up into the skin

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.980
so your whole body is covered
with these little tiny neurons

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.830
that reach up into the
skin and when we are cold,

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.900
they actually mechanically
take the hair follicle

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.630
and bend it up, it's a
process called pilo erection,

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.360
P-I-L-O erection, okay?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.560
So on a hot day, you
want to dump heat, okay?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.960
So on a hot day, what would happen is

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.480
you'd actually not see those goose pimples

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.510
because you want the hairs lying down

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.860
which actually you would think
that might insulate you more

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.050
but we'll actually let
more heat dissipate out

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.380
through the skin.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.660
On a cold day, you get these
goose pimples or goosebumps

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.890
which are really just
an ancient carry over

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.060
from the body's attempt to
make hair stand up on end.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.230
And when hair step stand up on end

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.170
and they're very close together

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.810
that traps air in between
them and actually creates

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.570
a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.570
If you've ever seen an animal
like a a Malamute or a Husky,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.320
you might think, oh that
poor thing on a hot day,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.300
what does it do?

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.140
You know, with all that hair?

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.960
Well, it can be warm so the
animal will typically pant

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.020
and its hair will lay down,
which you might think would act

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.360
as more of a blanket, but on a cold day

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.440
what'll happen is they'll
become very puffy.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.330
Their hair will stand up on end

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.660
and that's actually trapping
heat between the hairs

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.680
and they're actually quite well insulated.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.300
So it's very important that
if you want to understand

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.550
how you can leverage temperature
for physical performance,

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.860
you have to understand

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.910
that you have vasoconstriction
to conserve heat,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.580
vasodilation to dump heat,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.210
that you are sweating to dump heat,

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.700
and you have conservation of fluids

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.523
in order to preserve heat.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.520
That's the most important thing

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.500
in terms of understanding the mechanisms

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.400
of maintaining and dumping heat.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.480
And now the most important
thing to understand is that

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.530
if you get too hot, not only
do those enzymes stop working

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:45.240
but your ability to contract
your muscles stops, okay?

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.040
I'm going to repeat this
because it's vitally important.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.600
ATP is involved in the process

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.330
of generating muscle contractions,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.960
it doesn't matter if
you're running a marathon,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.520
doesn't matter if you're
doing a yoga class,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.230
doesn't matter if you're
going for a 700 pound squat,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.970
the range of temperatures
within which ATP can function

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.920
and muscles can contract is very narrow.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.540
Somewhere around 39 or 40
degrees Celsius, it drops off

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.300
and you will not be able to
generate more contractions.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.680
Now that's pretty hot,
but that temperature

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.100
can be generated locally really fast.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.500
Now, if you're too cold,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.650
it's true it's hard to
generate muscle contractions.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.450
I got into doing some cold water
swimming a little while ago

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.500
and we would joke that, you
know, you come out of the water,

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.220
we do no wetsuits,

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.070
I'm not recommending
people do this necessarily

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.020
unless you're with certainly

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.150
with somebody else who's skilled
at doing it, which I was.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.230
And you come out

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.290
and you feel like you
have claws for hands.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.330
You can, you know, you
could never text on a phone

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.250
for the first few minutes,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.220
I mean, the water was very, very cold

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.690
and you can't even move your face

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.840
and so muscles will become rigid

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.220
but heating up muscles causes
them to fail to be able

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.380
to generate more contractions.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.410
Put simply if you get too
hot, you stop exercising.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.760
You may not even realize it

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.400
but your will to exercise further,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.930
your ability to push harder

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.900
is entirely dependent on
the heat of the muscle

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.780
both locally and your whole system.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.330
So let's talk about your whole system

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.130
because I just described heat
dumping and heat maintaining.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.730
I told you that increasing heat

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.770
makes it hard for muscles to contract.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.630
It will stop you from being
able to run further and faster,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.490
it will stop you from being
able to lift more weights,

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.530
more sets, more repetitions.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.810
If you can keep temperature
in range however,

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.840
in a proper range, you will
be able to do more work,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.600
you will be able to create greater output,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.170
you'll be able to lift more
weight, more sets, more reps

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.590
and you'll be able to run further.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.441
Now, there are data that I'm going to talk

00:24:49.441 --> 00:24:51.910
about in a little bit that
are absolutely striking

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.210
that underscore that statement.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.260
There are data from my
colleague Craig Heller's lab

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.280
in the department of biology at Stanford

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.870
and there are data that
are now being implemented.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.170
They were first implemented
in a grant funded by DARPA

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.140
but now in professional sports teams.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.060
Many, if not all the NFL teams
are now using this technology

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.740
as well as military uses it

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.220
and not just for sports
performance, but also firefighters,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.000
construction workers, other professions

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.670
where elevated heat becomes
a barrier to performance

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.910
and you can leverage this to
really improve your workouts.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.060
And when I say really
improve, it is striking.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.630
I'm going to give away a
little hint of this now

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.790
and then I'm going to
tell you a little bit more

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.363
of the data later after
I tell you the protocols.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.690
Proper cooling of the body,

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.550
which has to be done
in a very specific way,

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.090
has allowed recreational athletes,

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.090
college students and typical adults

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.130
as well as professional athletes

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.300
to go from doing their usual output.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.390
In this case what comes to mind best

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.640
would be a particular
professional athletes

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.120
that a member of the 49ers at the time

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.640
was able to do 40 dips on
his first set, 30, 20, 20,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.860
basically to 10 sets of dips
unassisted with anything else.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.240
That's an impressive

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.920
especially since he's a really large guy,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.450
40 dips is as a respectable,

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.703
these are strict, full, full range dips.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.160
And then by the 10th set,
there's a steep drop-off.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.780
Using proper cooling of
particular body compartments,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.300
he was able to triple that
within less than a week

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.380
and maintain that performance

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.830
even without the cooling approach.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.900
So it was actually a
conditioning effect, all right?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.440
I'll get back to this in a little bit

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.410
but there are other
fantastic leaps of effort

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.830
and leaps of performance
that were demonstrated

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.623
including endurance running.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.120
Before I continue any, I
just want to underscore again

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.040
that overheating is terrible.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.500
There's a famous example of this.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.500
This was about 10, 15 years ago

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.650
when a number of dietary supplements

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.780
that included things like
epinephrin which is a stimulant,

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.390
it's a beta adrenergic stimulant,
drugs like Clenbuterol,

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.380
which were then banned from the Olympics,

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.420
which are still out there
have been in recreational use

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.910
which were beta adrenergic
agonist so these are drugs

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.820
that sort of mimic epinephrin
adrenaline to some extent,

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.400
I know I'm oversimplifying this here.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.610
They improve flat loss because
of the effects on metabolism

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.220
but they heat up the body.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.720
And what happened was, this
hit the press very widely

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.610
is high school football players

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.880
and various professional
athletes were dropping dead

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.840
because they were overheating

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.870
during practice or in competition.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.760
So much so that Clenbuterol was banned.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.700
Although every once in a while,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.710
somebody gets in trouble for using this,

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.050
there was an incidence of this recently

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.210
in professional boxing which
was attributed to a bad meat

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.890
that had contained the Clenbuterol.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.540
I don't know what the source was,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.620
I don't have any commentary about that,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.880
but it still is in use,

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.790
but these drugs increased
body temperature,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.970
increased fat loss, but
carry is severe danger

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.600
and that's the danger of hyperthermia.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.790
In fact, I would argue and I
think in talking to some folks

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.970
at in various professional
fighting organizations

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.420
it's very clear that a lot
of the deaths that one sees

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.250
in professional combat
sports may have to do

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.090
as much with dehydration and overheating

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.500
as it does with getting hit in
the head, which is also bad,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.840
but that things can compound

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.970
that can have a synergistic effect.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.680
And just a note about
that and hyperthermia

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.530
and it's dangerous as well.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.310
My first project ever in science

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.320
was to evaluate the thermogenic
effects of MDMA or ecstasy.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.660
That was my senior thesis
in college actually.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.670
And what we found was that indeed drugs

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.950
that remove your understanding
of how warm you are

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.600
cause you to not take on
the appropriate behaviors

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.280
to cool yourself, right?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.720
So your vasoconstriction
and you're sweating,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.860
those are autonomic,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.340
those are going to happen no matter what

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.470
unless you happen to take
something that blocks that effect.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.700
However, there are a lot of things

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.100
that we as humans do to prevent
ourselves from overheating

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.120
and the main one is stop.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.010
When we are running in the desert

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.220
or when we're running very
hard and suddenly we stop,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.070
oftentimes that's because
the muscles are overheating,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.490
it's a subconscious thing.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.950
We won't often think, oh,
I'm really much too warm,

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.650
it's just that we stop

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.800
and it's a self-preservation mechanisms.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.360
Sometimes it kicks into early,
sometimes it kicks into late.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.440
Kicks in too late, you can die.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.420
There's an instance in the 1984 Olympics

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.140
where there was the first year I believe

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.400
that there was a women's marathon,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.610
I think that's correct.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.030
And one of the front runners
or top picks for winning

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.490
was heading into the stadium

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.270
and all of a sudden, it
seemed as if she was lost,

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.660
she was kind of wandering around

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.150
not knowing where she should go

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.190
and in fact, she was in a position to win

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.770
or at least take second
place, at least take silver,

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.060
got totally disoriented and
did miserably in the race

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.740
and she was hyperthermic,

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.710
she was running against
that reflex to stop.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.640
So dumping heat is key.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.517
So how do you dump heat in
order to perform longer safely?

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.190
Well, in order to understand
that you have to understand

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.700
that the body has three main compartments

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.620
for regulating temperature, okay?

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.720
We don't just have a
center and a periphery,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.410
we have three main compartments

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.640
and there's one compartment in particular

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.450
that all of you or most all
of you, I have to assume have

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.400
and if you can understand how that works,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.910
you can do tremendous
things for your performance

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.660
and for your recovery.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.900
So what I'm about to tell you

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.770
will allow you to perform
better in all forms of exercise

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.810
and it is not commonly known,

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.780
unfortunately, I'm here
to try and change that.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.110
You have three compartments

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.990
for increasing or dumping
heat in your body.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.190
One is your core, we
already talked about that.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.390
Your core organs, your heart,

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.970
your lungs, your pancreas, your liver,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.050
this is the core of your body.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:58.120
The other is your periphery,
which are obviously your arms

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.310
and your legs and your
feet and your hands.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.820
But then there's a third component

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.120
which has their three
locations on your body

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.930
that are far better at
passing heat out of the body

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.800
and bringing cool into the body

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.950
such that you can heat up

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.300
or cool your body everywhere very quickly.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.300
Those three areas are your
face, the palms of your hands

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.720
and the bottoms of your feet.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.810
Now, the skin on your hands
and on the bottoms of your feet

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.330
and to some extent on your
face are called glaborous skin.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:38.330
That's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S glaborous skin.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.350
And what's special about
those areas of your body

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.550
and the glaborous skin
is that the arrangement

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.740
of vasculature, of blood
vessels, capillaries and arteries

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.410
that serve those regions is very different

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.890
than it is elsewhere in your body.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.380
Now, this has ancient roots.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.720
Typically, if you were
another mammal, like a bear

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.970
or some sort of ape, you would
have hair all over your body.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.850
Now we all know some pretty hairy people.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.100
I presume you've heard that
there are these hairy people,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.290
I know a few excessively hairy people

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.750
and Castilla is excessively hairy

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.930
but he's not a person obviously

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.930
but all mammals have hair
on their bodies, too.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.303
Some people have very light
hair or very fine hair.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.910
We don't have hair on these
glaborous skin regions.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.080
Now, of course you can have
beard or facial hair growth

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.160
but there are still
regions like the cheeks

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.510
and other areas that maintain
this special vasculature.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.230
Okay, so technically the hands and feet

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.900
are real glaborous skin

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.860
and the face is not always
quite classified as glaborous

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.090
but these three locations
face, palms of hands

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:54.090
not tops and bottoms of feet
are very good at dumping heat

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.280
and bringing in cool.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.280
And the reason is there's
a rule in vascular biology

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.900
that blood moves from
arteries to capillaries

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.010
and then to veins, and then
back to the heart, okay?

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.030
So arteries which are
the big ones obviously,

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.150
capillaries which are the little fine ones

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.440
where oxygen and carbon
dioxide are exchanged

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.940
and veins which then bring
blood back to the heart

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.393
and other tissues of course.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.960
In these three regions
of your hands, your face

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.790
and the bottoms of your feet,

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.080
we have what are called AVAs.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.450
AVAs are a very special
pattern of vasculature.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.940
AVAs are described in
the medical textbooks.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.410
You can find them in Grey's anatomy

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.770
not the television show

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.280
but the actual Grey's anatomy textbook

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.190
which is a real thing that exists

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.660
and in all medical textbooks, okay?

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.450
So let's talk about AVAs and what they are

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.020
and why they allow these
three regions of the body

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.333
to heat or cool ourselves more readily.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.770
So what are AVAs?

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.600
AVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.180
So if you want to look that up

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.620
you can just look up
AVAs veins, capillaries,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.563
arteries if you like, but
I'll spell it for you.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.870
A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio
venous, V-E-N-O-U-S,

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:27.540
arterio-venous anastomosis,
A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.570
Arterio-venous anastomosis, okay?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.690
You want to know about
Arterio-venous anastomosis, trust me

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.160
and you want to remember
that they are in your hands,

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.380
the bottoms of your feet and on your face,

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.370
and in particular on
the palms of your hands,

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:44.770
not the tops of your hands.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.810
Now, before I said blood flows typically

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.850
from arteries to capillaries, to veins,

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.430
and then back to the heart.

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.650
But AVAs are direct connections

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.660
between the small arteries
and the small veins.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.080
They bypass the
capillaries to some extent.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.400
They are little short vessel segments,

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.140
they have a big, large inner diameter

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.290
and they have this very
thick, muscular wall.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:12.250
And they get input from what
are called adrenergic neurons.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.860
They get input from neurons

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.360
that release norepinephrine
and epinephrine,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.060
which allows them to contract or dilate.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.460
Now there's some rules of physics

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.530
that talk about how the radius of a pipe

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.360
and small changes in the radius of a pipe

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.360
leads to massive increases in
the rate and amount of stuff

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:34.823
that can flow through that pipe, okay?

00:35:34.823 --> 00:35:37.260
There's a rule of physics
that says essentially

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.890
that the radius is proportional
to the amount of stuff

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:44.470
that can flow through
something to the fourth power.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.970
We're not going to make
this a physics class,

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.020
but if you want to look that up, you can,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.470
you can just look up how
does the radius of a tube

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.160
or pipe relate to how quickly

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.890
or how much stuff can flow through it?

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.380
What you need to know,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.250
even if you don't want to know
any of the underlying physics

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.150
is that these AVAs allow more heat

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.970
to leave the body more quickly

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.390
and more cool to enter
the body more quickly

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.390
than other venous arterial capillary beds

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.773
throughout the body.

00:36:13.773 --> 00:36:17.630
In other words, you can heat
up best at the face, the palms

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.820
and the bottoms of the feet,
and you can cool down best

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.650
at the face, the palms and
the bottoms of the feet

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.710
than you can anywhere else on your body.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.170
And when I say heat up or cool down,

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.250
I mean actually heat or cool
the core end your brain.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.210
Okay, so this is vitally important.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.220
I realize we're getting down

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.070
into the mechanistic weeds
here, but you need to know

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.530
that these three
compartments of your body,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.740
palms, bottoms of feet and face

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.150
are your best leverage points
for manipulating temperature

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:50.340
to vastly improve physical
performance, okay?

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.110
I also want to point out

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.300
that the work that I'm
going to tell you about

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.970
is not work from my laboratory.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.470
It's the work of, as I mentioned,

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.220
my colleague Craig Heller's
laboratory at Stanford

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.400
and we're going to have
Craig on as a guest

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.690
to talk more about these discoveries,

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.280
they are his and his
colleagues discoveries

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.740
and how you can leverage them.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.193
They're building out
some amazing technology.

00:37:12.193 --> 00:37:14.530
I had a conversation with Craig yesterday

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.130
as a prelude to this episode

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.280
and to the future conversation with him

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.760
so you're getting the
very latest on this topic.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.700
So what Craig and his colleagues did

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.450
really illustrates perfectly

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.593
what these body surfaces can do and why.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:35.730
They were studying overheating
in athletes and in military

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.020
and in construction workers
and trying to prevent it.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.700
And they did a bunch of experiments,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.350
I won't go into all of them now

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.190
but what they essentially found
was that cooling the palms,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:51.960
palmer cooling allowed people, athletes,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.030
and recreational athletes
to run much further,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.730
to lift more weight and
to do more sets and reps

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.823
to a absolutely staggering degree.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:09.210
Let's talk for a second, a
bit more about why we stop,

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.660
why we shut off effort when we get too hot

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.310
because in doing so,
you'll really understand

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.960
how and why the best protocols exist

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.060
for being able to do more work,

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.800
to be able to exercise longer

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.440
and actually to feel good doing it.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.110
You actually can make
a doubling of your dips

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.920
or believe it or not a
tripling or quadrupling or more

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.593
of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.043
I mentioned before that
when muscle heats up,

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.930
enzymes start getting disrupted

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.880
and ATP and muscles can't work so well

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.680
and those muscles can't contract.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.470
Let's get a little more
specific about that.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.510
The enzyme that's involved here

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.710
is something called pyruvate kinase.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.390
You don't need to know
about pyruvate kinase

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.700
but what you do need to
know is that it ends A-S-E

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.480
which means it's an
enzyme and pyruvate kinase

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.930
is essentially a rate limiting step.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.150
It's a critical step that you can't bypass

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.530
if you want muscles to contract

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.473
and it's very temperature sensitive.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.320
Therefore, if you can
keep temperature lower,

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.130
you can do more work per unit time,

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.780
you can do more pull-ups

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.891
and that actually was done by Craig

00:39:22.891 --> 00:39:24.520
and his colleagues, excuse me.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.030
The pull-ups weren't
actually done by Craig,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.410
I don't know how many
pull-ups Craig can do,

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.990
I'll ask him next time,
both cooled and uncooled,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.680
how many pullups he can do.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.330
But what they essentially did

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.080
is they brought someone
into their laboratory

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.430
who could do 10 pull ups on the first set

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.170
and they were able to get 10,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.100
rest two or three minutes get another 10,

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.030
rest or three minutes and
if you've ever tried this,

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.460
what you find is that you start dropping

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.350
to eight, seven, six, et cetera.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.920
Now, the person might not necessarily feel

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.380
like they're overheating,
but the muscle is heating up.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.290
Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:04.290
that these that these portals
in the palms are a great way

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.410
to both heat the body, but also
to dump heat from the body,

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.120
they used the device

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.160
and I'll talk about
what you can do at home

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.640
but a device where they had people hold on

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.440
to what was essentially a cold tube.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.350
Now this is crucial, the
tube can't be so cold

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.400
that it causes vasoconstriction

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.310
because then the cold
won't pass from the tube

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.093
to the hand and to the core.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.180
But if it's the right temperature,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.850
it's neither too hot nor too cold,

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:39.850
that cool from the cold
tube passes into the hand,

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.400
these so-called palmer regions
and then cools the core

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.080
and in theory by lowering body temperature

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.350
would allow the person or
the athlete to do more work

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.950
and indeed that's what they saw.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.800
The actual data, the specific data showed

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.210
that subjects could do,

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.690
at least the subjects they worked with,

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.310
on their first day with no
cooling about a hundred pull-ups

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.650
across the timeframe that they had, okay?

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.040
So it might've taken
anywhere from 10 to 15

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.160
or maybe more sets depending
on how skilled that person was

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.943
but in a fixed amount of time.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.330
Then they came back and did the cooling.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.680
They did it the very next day

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.920
which if you've ever trained a muscle,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.740
the very next day typically

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.010
you wouldn't do as well in its training

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.960
if it took any damage
from the previous session

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.120
or you at least do as well,

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.190
but you probably wouldn't
do what they then observed,

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.750
which was, they started
after every other set,

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.200
the person would just hold the cold tube,

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.710
cool down the body after every other set,

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.110
rest everything else was kept the same

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.570
and they found that they
went to 180 pull-ups,

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:48.130
which is incredible, it's a near doubling.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.010
And by doing this repeatedly
over several sessions,

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:55.070
over several weeks, they quickly
went in the cooling group

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.860
from a maximum of somewhere
between 180 and 200 as I recall,

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.240
I'm sort of estimating now,

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.570
to 600 pull-ups in the
equivalent amount of time

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.120
which is absolutely incredible.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.560
They then repeated this in
a study on the bench press

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.720
and actually the bench press
study was pretty interesting

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.670
because they actually had a control group

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:16.950
that was admittedly
taking specific amounts

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:17.990
of anabolic steroids,

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.630
the antibiotic steroid
was testosterone cypionate

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.430
which is essentially testosterone,

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.430
and indeed the testosterone cypionate,

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.653
the steroid group improved at
a rate of about 1% per week.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.520
There were differences
and the cooling group

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.450
basically left all other
groups in the dust,

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:38.710
it was just remarkable.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.630
So cooling the core, I
want to be very clear

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.930
that it's not cooling the muscle,

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.760
wasn't about cooling the chest alone

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.410
or just cooling the palms,

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.740
it was about allowing cold
to pass through the palms

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:54.440
because of the unique vasculature
that's there, these AVAs

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.630
allowed the subjects to do
far more work per unit time.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.320
And the important thing is that

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.370
if they were to come back
after doing 600 pull-ups

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.220
or 500 pull-ups, you might say,

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.450
well, wow that's going
to create a situation

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.640
where recovery is going to
be absolutely impossible.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.680
They could come back, not use the cooling

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.220
and they still saw a
highly significant increase

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.080
in the amount or the
number of pull-ups or dips

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.900
or bench press weight
that they could do, okay?

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.900
So what that meant is that

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.167
it was both an excellent performance

00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:27.150
and an excellent training stimulus

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.860
that they were able to recover from, okay?

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.410
I don't know if all of
you are following this

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.720
but these are the sorts of increases

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.180
in exercise output that
are absolutely staggering

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.940
and that's why professional
teams and the military

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.350
and others capitalized on them
very quickly and use these.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:49.350
Okay, now you may be asking
what about endurance, right?

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.480
Not everyone wants to be
able to bench press a lot

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.113
for multiple reps and sets.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.910
And I should just mention
for the bench pressing,

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.140
it was, I believe they were

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.510
they found people that
could bench press two 25,

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.870
so that's two 45 pound plates

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.000
on the 45 pound standard Olympic bar

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.940
for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.100
and then they had them do the same thing.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.410
They did a set, they'd
rest two or three minutes,

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.530
sometimes up to four minutes,

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.580
then do another set,
repeat, repeat, repeat,

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.080
and with cooling, they were able

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.450
to increase the amount of work,

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.130
the number of reps with the same weight.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.380
Sometimes they did have to increase sets

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.280
to approximately double,
so it was pretty fantastic.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.910
So with endurance, similar
increases have been shown

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:32.320
and the way that they do those tests

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.430
are a little bit different

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.190
and they also point to a
really important mechanism

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.350
of why we stopped doing work at all

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:42.310
when we perceive that we are
putting in too much effort.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.480
So it gets right to the
heart of the relationship

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.960
between temperature in
muscle and your willpower,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.370
those are directly related.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.910
Your body heat and your willpower

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.040
are linked in a physiological way.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.320
So I'm not talking about the kind of stuff

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.220
that you see as kind of like
clickbait on the internet,

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.760
or like increase willpower
now or become resilient now,

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.060
or never do this again if you
want to be mentally strong,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.610
I'm talking about a
physiological mechanism

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.030
that exists in the body and
brain that causes you to stop

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.910
or that will allow you to
continue to go harder and further

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.420
than you normally would.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.820
Okay, so let's talk
about willpower and heat

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.260
and how heat shuts you down.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.990
In other words, if you are cool,

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.610
if your body temperature
is in a particular range,

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.400
not only can you go further,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.123
but you will go further if you want to.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:34.440
Said differently, if you heat up too much,

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.280
you will stop or you will die.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.810
Typically people stop, there
are individuals who will push

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.320
to the point where they black out and die,

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.483
in the same way that, and
please don't do this experiment,

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.570
there are people who can
sit down face to face

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.080
and say, let's hold our breath

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.693
and whoever breathes first loses.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.660
Some people will just
go until it's painful

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.170
and then they'll gasp
and take a big breath.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:59.410
There are always those individuals

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.200
who can override that reflex

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.760
and they will go until
they pass out, okay?

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.560
And if you do that in water,
you can very easily die,

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.120
so please don't do that experiment.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.600
But there's a reflex that
relates the body to the brain

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.260
and the brain to the body
that shuts off our effort

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.970
when we get too hot.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.960
So what Craig and his colleagues
and now others have done

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.560
is to do a test in the laboratory

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.510
where rather than ask
people to run outside

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:29.670
until they absolutely
don't want to run anymore,

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.660
you put them on a treadmill
and you set the speed, okay?

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.600
So they have to keep up with the treadmill

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.623
and at some point they quit.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.240
And you take groups and you do those

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.300
in different temperature environments.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:48.390
So some people are running
in a nice chilly laboratory,

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.440
they get their heart rate up.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.000
So maybe their heart rate goes from,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.330
you know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate,

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.130
maybe it gets up to 80 or a hundred

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.810
and then they keep the rate of
the treadmill going the same

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:00.840
and they'll just plateau.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.540
So they're getting into a
steady state cadence or rhythm

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.650
and their heart is beating it
more or less a steady state.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.270
Eventually they'll probably stop

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:08.910
'cause they have something else to do

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:13.910
but people will continue
at that temperature

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.820
and at that heart rate,

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.860
unless you start turning up
the temperature in the room

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.000
and at some point they will stop

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.070
and they'll stop much
earlier when it gets hot

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.090
because of something
called cardiac drift, okay?

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.710
So let's say I'm running

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:31.330
and I'm running at a steady
cadence on this treadmill

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.250
and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.720
or a hundred beats per
minute, doesn't matter,

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.480
let's say a hundred just
for sake of example.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.680
Well, just making the room hotter

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.430
is going to increase
my heart rate further,

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.690
even though I'm at the same output

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:48.230
and the brain does a computation,

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:51.640
it somehow figures out that
there's a heat component

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.870
that's increasing heart rate

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.190
and there's an effort
component from running

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:56.750
that's driving heart rate.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:00.150
And if the heat component
and the heart rate output

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.500
from the effort, get to hit
a certain threshold, I stop.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.010
Okay, ad some of you may think,

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.450
well there are people who just run

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:11.370
and run and run and never stop,
eventually everyone stops.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:12.650
Maybe it's because of the race ended,

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.100
maybe it's because, you
know, everyone else quit.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.900
I actually saw some stuff online,

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.010
there are these races where people

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.840
just will continuously do the same loop

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.290
until everyone else drops out

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.410
and then one guy or girl
keeps going past everybody.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.540
But typically it stops
because the race is over

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.190
or because people quit.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.610
Increasing temperature
increases the rate of quitting

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.740
in part, not entirely, but in part

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.200
because of this thing called cardiac drift

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.130
which you've probably experienced

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.240
if you've been out on a hot
day and you're walking uphill

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.180
you might stop to take a breath.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.750
If you sit in a sauna, your
heart rate will increase.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:51.060
Heat increases heart rate,
effort increases heart rate.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.300
At a steady effort, you'll
have a steady heart rate.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.150
If you increase the
heat in the environment

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.910
that you're engaging in
that steady heart rate,

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:01.860
your heart rate will now
go up due to cardiac drift

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.030
and you will quit, okay?

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:07.230
So Heller and colleagues
have done experiments

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.960
where they do palmer cooling
under these environments.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.290
And that's wonderful because
not only does it enable people

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:20.290
to go further and faster for much longer

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.720
that's been shown statistically
significant every time

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.110
but it also protects the brain and body

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.660
against hyperthermia,
overheating, coma, nerve injury,

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.337
nerve death, and actual death, okay?

00:49:32.337 --> 00:49:35.730
So you can see why this
is such a valuable tool.

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:37.730
So what are they doing?

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.860
Well, in this case too they're
having them cool their hands

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.410
and they're cooling the palms.

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.700
Cooling the bottoms of the
feet is a little trickier

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.987
but cooling the face could
actually work as well.

00:49:47.987 --> 00:49:49.680
And we're going to talk
about cooling the face

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.220
and how to incorporate this.

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.540
So at this point, I've just really wanted

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:58.540
to impress upon you not impress
you, but impress upon you

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.190
the fact that you have these
three surfaces of your body

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:04.310
that are very good at
passing cold into the body,

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:06.550
such that it cools the
core body temperature

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.870
and that's a good thing
for health and safety

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:13.300
and in order to maintain work output

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.090
over longer periods of time,
or actually just do more work.

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.150
I mean to me the result
is just so staggering

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:21.440
is the hundred to 180
pull-ups in the controls

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.000
and then 600 pull-ups in the
cooled individuals, right?

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.610
They actually also feel mentally

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.160
as if they can do more work.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.590
It's not just that they can,

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:34.710
their willpower is adjusted somehow

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.860
by these shifts in temperature.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.000
Now, before we continue
and get to the exact ways

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.570
that any number of us can
start to use this information,

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:47.150
I want to talk about the
opposite thing, which is heating.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.460
And you have to remember
that these surfaces,

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:52.433
the palms and the bottoms
of the feet and the face

00:50:52.433 --> 00:50:55.810
will not just a range with these AVAs,

00:50:55.810 --> 00:51:00.810
these special ways to pass
blood from arteries to veins

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.360
in order to cool us for
better athletic performance

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.250
or to heat us for on cold days
but for both of those things.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:12.900
Now Heller and colleagues
and others have also explored

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.140
how these can be used to heat up the core.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.280
There are times when we
want to heat up our core.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.950
Typically we hear that most of the heat

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.250
escapes through our heads,

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.780
so we'll put on a hat when we go outside,

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.910
that's actually not true.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.520
Most of your heat escapes
through your face,

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.360
the palms of your hands and
the bottoms of your feet.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.403
Now you should know why that's the case.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.850
What this means is that
for post-surgery patients

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:43.280
or for people that are hypothermic,

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.570
indeed you want to heat the core, right?

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.850
But actually I was on a swim recently

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:50.040
where a friend became hypothermic.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.080
He was kind of slurring his words

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.250
and kind of staggering around

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.950
when we got him back on the beach,

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:56.950
we brought him over to
the lifeguard station,

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:57.930
he turned out to be fine.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.640
Again, this is why cold water swims

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.500
are something that you
really need to do in groups,

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.160
not alone and you really have
to know what you're doing.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.020
There were reasons for why
this happened that day,

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.900
but, you know we were basically

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.020
people thought we were a little strange

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.550
until they realized what was happening.

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:14.770
We were walking down the beach
basically sandwiching him

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.550
between at our chest
because we were still warmer

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:20.247
than the ambient environment,
the environment around us.

00:52:20.247 --> 00:52:23.160
And we were pushing our chest against him

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.540
to try and warm him up
to warm up his core.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.220
In retrospect, that was
the wrong thing to do.

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.900
In talking with Craig and
talking to other colleagues

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.380
that work on thermogenesis.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.280
What we should have done was warm,

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.410
hit the palms of his hands,
the bottoms of his feet

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:41.680
and his face because that
would insulate the heat loss.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.900
Now he was very cold

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.420
so presumably there was vasoconstriction

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.920
of the veins at these locations.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.730
And so it's not clear

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.810
that that would have been
the only strategy to use

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:56.150
but they have explored how to
heat up post-surgery patients

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.560
and one of the best ways to do that

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.100
is to get warm socks on
the bottoms of the feet,

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.420
get gloves on the hands

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.610
and if it can be done
safely to warm the face.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.540
Now, of course you don't
want to obstruct respiration

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.970
and things of that sort.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:11.390
But again the ability to
pass heat into the body

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:12.930
or to remove heat to the body

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.440
is best done through these three surfaces.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.330
I can't emphasize that enough.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.860
So I mentioned before that
you want to cool the palms

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.950
or the bottoms of the feet

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:23.700
although that's a little
harder to do or the face

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:28.030
but not so much that the
blood vessels constrict

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:30.420
because then you won't be able
to pass cool into the body

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.700
because those pipes got smaller

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.790
and therefore you can't
pass cool into the body.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.700
So how can you start to incorporate this?

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.420
Well, Craig and colleagues have a company

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.130
that they've spun out through Stanford.

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:45.220
We'll talk about that when
we sit down with Craig

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.320
that has made engineered devices
that are optimal for this

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.680
that are going to keep
those passages open,

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.690
keep the size of the, those
veins correct to pass cool

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.370
into the body quickly for sake
of elite sports performance

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.210
and even recreational sports performance

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.770
but you can actually
start to incorporate this.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:05.770
First of all, I always get asked

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.180
how cold should the water be?

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.610
Should it be ice water?

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.810
Should it be very cold water?

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.043
The answer is no.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.770
If you want to experience
some of this effect

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.710
without a device, one thing you could do

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:20.110
would be for instance to do, I dunno,

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:22.830
I'll use the, the, the gym or
the treadmill as an example.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.580
You could do your maximum
number of pull-ups, stop

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.980
and then you could actually
put your hands into

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.970
or on the surface of a sink
that is presumably stopped up

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:37.280
with cool water.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:42.160
So not ice water, not
freezing cold, but cool water,

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.440
slightly cooler than body temperature

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.000
before you started training
would be a good place to start.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.148
You do that for 10 to 30 seconds.

00:54:51.148 --> 00:54:54.210
Then you could go back
and do your next set.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:55.720
You would repeat the cooling,

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.030
you would want to extend the
amount of cooling somewhat

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:00.700
so you might want to do that
for 30 seconds to a minute.

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.830
This is not going to be perfect,

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:04.660
you're going to have to play
with how cold to make it

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.640
in order to get the optimal effect

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.490
but you ought to see
an effect nonetheless.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:12.900
The same is true if you're
running and you're fatiguing,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.350
obviously you don't want
to become hyperthermic,

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.880
cooling the hands or the
bottoms of your feet or the face

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.670
would be the ideal way to dump heat

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.790
in order to be able to
generate more output.

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.260
Now, the face is something

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.650
that we haven't talked a lot about.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:29.660
Everything I've told you
up until now also says

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.870
that if you are somebody
who tends to get cold

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.170
when you are outside, say in
the winter or even in the fall,

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.180
you tend to run cold, warming your face

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.610
is going to be the most important thing

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:40.870
that you can do.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.280
Now, it's kind of hard to do
that without looking strange

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.330
like wearing a ski mask
or something like that

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.350
but that is going to be more effective

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:50.530
than covering and warming
any other part of your body

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.960
although it'd be quite strange
if you only had a ski mask on

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.930
and you weren't wearing clothes
anywhere else on your body,

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.970
I don't recommend doing that outside,

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:59.250
that will get you into all
sorts of other kinds of trouble.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.970
That wouldn't be good for anybody.

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:04.540
But now you understand the
principle and the locations

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.670
at which to deliver heat and cold.

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:09.750
So let's say that you are out for a run

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.420
and you want to incorporate
this cooling mechanism,

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.500
I talked to Craig about this,

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.750
I said, what would be the
kind of poor person's approach

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:19.230
to this before this devices
commercially available?

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:24.230
And he said, well, you, you
could take a frozen juice can,

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.040
if you have one of those
or a very cold can of soda

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.000
and you would want to
pass it back and forth

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.680
between your two hands.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.360
The reason the passing back
and forth is really important

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.430
is because you, again you
don't want it to be so cold

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:40.280
that you constrict those veins portals

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.330
that it will allow cold
to go into the body.

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.630
Now, there are certainly people

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.360
that are working on bike handles,

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.770
and that can actually cool the hands.

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.400
You can expect with
the Olympics coming up,

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.990
people are aware of these data

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:55.580
and are starting to incorporate
it into a number of things.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.490
Here's what you don't want to
do and there are sports teams

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:00.110
that I won't mention by name or brand

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:02.953
that have made this mistake
and it costs them dearly.

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:06.350
You don't want to cool the core

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.260
if you want to cool the body, right?

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.700
If it's very hot day and
you're going to train,

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:16.510
getting into an ice bath first,
sure it will cool you down,

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.080
but it's not going to be as
effective as cooling the palms,

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.930
the bottoms of the feet and the face.

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.470
I have a friend who does some
important work in this space

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.170
with people in various,
let's just say cultures

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.050
where heat is generated quite a lot

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:34.470
and they need to dump heat,
ice packs delivered to the face

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.190
are something that they actually use

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:38.050
in order to dump heat quickly.

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.440
Now, again, you don't want

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.930
to keep the ice pack on your face.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.760
These are people that are
very high work output, right?

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.500
Firefighters and similar,
at very high work output

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.770
and then they'll put this essentially,

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:53.090
it's like a cool face mask on their face.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:54.717
It allow their core body
temperature come down

00:57:54.717 --> 00:57:55.720
and then they remove it,

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.120
they're not keeping it on there so long

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.830
that they're getting the
vasoconstriction, okay?

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:02.100
So there are a number of
ways that you could do this.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.770
And again, I'm not giving
specific temperatures

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.260
because it depends on how hot that day

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.670
and how hot your body temperature is.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.170
So you can see why there's a
need to create more devices

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:15.170
for this, but you can see
a considerable improvement

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:20.140
in endurance, in strength
and in all kinds of explosive

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:23.300
and sort of, you know,
explosive power type output

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:27.250
in athletics by using
these surfaces of the hands

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.040
and bottoms of the feet and face.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.560
The one that I've tried

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.920
because in anticipation of
this episode was the dips

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.520
where then I would cool my hands,

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.874
I actually decided to cool the
bottoms of my feet as well,

00:58:39.874 --> 00:58:40.707
because it just feels good

00:58:40.707 --> 00:58:41.780
and it's particularly hot out lately,

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.840
so no shoes or socks on,

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.680
put my feet into the bottoms of my feet

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.150
just kind of hovering
about a centimeter or two

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.360
below the surface of a bucket of water

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.330
that was just slightly, it felt cool,

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.840
slightly cooler than
body temperature or so.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.640
It just basically what
came out of the spigot

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.610
after I let it run for a little bit.

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:03.780
And indeed I saw a 60% increase

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.010
in the number of dips I
can do in a single session.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.560
So it's actually a
quite significant effect

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.260
and you don't have to be perfectly precise

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.610
in order to do it.

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:14.130
And of course, if you want to
heat up for whatever reason,

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:17.610
like you're camping or you're
lost in the environment,

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:19.320
remember these three surfaces

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.400
are going to be the best
way to heat your as well.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.400
So up until now, we've been
talking about how to use cold

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.460
during a workout in order
to improve performance

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:30.500
and indeed cold applied

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.970
to the appropriate parts of
the body, the appropriate times

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.547
can vastly improve our performance

00:59:36.547 --> 00:59:38.063
and endurance and strength.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.210
Now, I want to talk about
the use of temperature

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:44.642
in particular cold to improve the speed

00:59:44.642 --> 00:59:47.910
and the depth of recovery.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.480
Recovery is obviously vital, right?

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.910
During a weight training session

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:53.610
or during an endurance session,

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:56.460
that's just the stimulus for
getting better the next time

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.910
and if you don't recover, you
not only won't get better,

00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:59.993
but you'll get worse.

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:04.440
There's a lot of interest
in the use of cold

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.430
in order to improve
recovery in the short term.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.890
We see this and probably
the best example of this

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.240
would be fighters in combat sports

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.250
between rounds or athletes during

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.230
in between quarters or halftime,

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:20.670
that's one form of recovery.

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.730
The ability to go back
into the sport very soon

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:26.310
on an order of minutes,
anywhere from like one minute

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:28.850
in between rounds and
typical combat sports

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.373
or several minutes and
a half time, et cetera.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:37.410
Typically what we see is
people cooling their core,

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.030
cooling the back of their neck,

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.070
cooling the top of their heads.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.910
So it might be, you know,
a sponge with cold water

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:44.050
over the top of the head

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.010
or an ice pack on the back of the neck,

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:49.527
or in some cases even
wearing cold ice vests,

01:00:49.527 --> 01:00:51.620
that's actually been done.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.760
That's going to be a very inefficient way

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.120
to improve recovery of that kind.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.030
Far better would be to cool the face,

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.860
the palms of the hands
or the bottoms the feet

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.223
for the reasons that I
described up until now.

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.493
Submerging the body in an ice
bath, or taking a cold shower,

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.410
say up to the neck or up to the chest

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:14.060
or getting under cold water
or jumping in a cold lake

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.220
or something of that sort,
or in the locker room,

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.920
getting under the cold shower
also would be a terrible way

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.910
to cool off the body quickly

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:24.440
compared to the ways that I described

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.530
through the palms of the
hands, the bottoms of the feet

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.350
or the face for the following reason.

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.350
First of all, it's not optimizing
those portals of the face,

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.130
palms the hands and the feet

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:38.020
and in addition, if it's
very cold and you submerge

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.720
or you cover a lot of
the body with that cold,

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.700
you're going to cause constriction

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.120
of the very vessels and pathways

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.220
that allow the body to
efficiently dump heat.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.760
So again, the key thing
is to cool these one

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.810
or two or three of these surfaces

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:59.899
but not so cold that you
cause the vasoconstriction.

01:01:59.899 --> 01:02:01.449
So what does this mean for you?

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.990
It means that getting in an
ice bath or a cold shower

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.490
or putting an ice pack
on the back of your neck

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.770
in most cases is not going to be as good

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.580
as splashing cold water on your face

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.130
or even just holding your
face in a damp cool cloth

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.703
or something of that sort.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.410
It seems kind of counterintuitive,

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.630
you think, oh if I just
jump into an ice bath,

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.370
I'm going to cool down much faster
than if I just cooled these,

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.070
you know one or two or three

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:28.410
of these select regions of the body

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.270
but that's actually not the case.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.103
And then of course

01:02:31.103 --> 01:02:33.780
there's recovery that occurs
from session to session.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.747
So outside of the game or the
match or the exercise session

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:43.770
and many people are now relying
on things like cryotherapy

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.520
which requires a lot
of expensive equipment,

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.850
big, you know liquid
nitrogen driven machine.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.690
Those aren't so common for most people

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.680
or accessible for most
people, but a lot of people

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.840
are using cold baths or
ice baths or cold showers.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.980
And again, that's not
going to optimize recovery.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.350
In fact, it's going to
have an additional effect

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:06.240
that is going to potentially
block the training stimulus.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.490
When you get into an ice
bath indeed, there are,

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:11.920
provided it's not very, very cold,

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.920
if you get into a cold shower,

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.300
provided is not very, very cold,

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.740
you are indeed blocking
some of the inflammation

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.290
that occurs because of
the training session.

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:24.080
But in doing so you also
are blocking pathways,

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.616
such as mTOR, mammalian
target of rapamycin,

01:03:27.616 --> 01:03:29.530
which are involved in the adaptation

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:32.100
for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.270
Put simply, covering the body in cold

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.980
or immersing the body
in cold after training

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:41.540
can short circuit or
prevent the hypertrophy

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.540
or muscle growth response.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.040
It has other effects that
can be positive, right?

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.360
It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera,

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.670
it can reduce inflammation

01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:53.740
but it can prevent some of the
positive effects of exercise.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.960
Now, it hasn't been examined
so much for endurance work

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.080
but let's say you come back
from around of endurance work

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.080
or run or a bike or a swim,
getting into a cool bath

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:08.520
or cooling the palms, the
bottoms of the feet or the face,

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.440
in my opinion, based on
the science would be better

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.250
than completely immersing
the body in the ice bath

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:16.570
or the cold shower.

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:18.210
There is a time and a place

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:20.420
for the use of the ice
bath or the cold shower

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.410
or the cold plunge, those tend to be

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:24.660
when you want to deliberately

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.180
increase brown fat thermogenesis

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.740
or when you want to deliberately
work on mental resilience.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.790
And in a subsequent episode on fat loss

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.080
I'm going to talk about how
to optimize the use of cold

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.090
specifically for increasing
metabolism and fat loss.

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:43.290
But for now, since we're
talking about the use of cold

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.340
for improving performance and recovery,

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.760
the suggestion that I'm going
to provide is based on the work

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.880
of Craig Heller and colleagues
that I've been talking about

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.920
as well as a excellent book
I mainly rely on textbooks

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.410
and special volume books which
are collections of papers

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:00.960
from experts in a particular area

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.880
that go beyond standard kind
of college level textbooks.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.960
The one that I've been relying on

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.520
is called "Thermoregulation
in Human Performance,

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.400
Physiological and Biological
Aspects" by Effie Marino.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.860
I don't know the publisher,
I don't know the author.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.180
I do recognize some of the names

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.560
of the particular papers there,
but I just want to be clear

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.320
there's no sort of business
relationship or deal with them

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.410
but it's an excellent text,

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:23.390
it's called "Thermoregulation
in Human Performance".

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:25.110
You can find it online

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:26.940
if you want to go really deep into this

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.500
but basically what they show is that

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.810
if you can cool the body back
to its resting temperature,

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:35.470
for and by resting temperature, I mean

01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.070
within the range that you would see

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:40.570
at any time of waking
day, but not in exercise.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.670
So just bringing that the body
temperature down to baseline.

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:45.680
If you can do that,

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.820
the sooner you can do
that after a workout,

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.490
the sooner that the muscle will recover,

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.790
that the tendons will recover

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.350
and that the person you

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.560
can get back into more endurance training,

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.160
more weight training, et cetera.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.080
So cold actually can be a very
powerful tool for recovery

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.803
but to maximize return to
baseline levels of temperature,

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:08.350
it's my belief based on the studies

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.800
that are published in this book

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.210
as well as my discussions with
my colleague, Craig Heller

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.980
and in reviewing the literature overall

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.980
that just simply cooling the entire body

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.060
by jumping into an ice
bath or a cold shower

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.530
is not the best way to go.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.140
You really want to rely
on one of these three

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.618
glaborous skin portals of the palms,

01:06:24.618 --> 01:06:27.050
the bottoms of the feet or the face.

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.430
So now you probably know more
than you ever wanted to know

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.270
about how we regulate body temperature

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:34.850
and how it can be applied to exercise

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.150
both during the exercise session

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.653
and afterward to optimize recovery.

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.680
Many of us, all of us, presumably

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.290
are also eating and drinking
things and taking things

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:49.670
at various times that
can impact this process.

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:53.070
And so, because of that, we should ask

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:56.690
whether or not those things
are impacting body temperature.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:59.410
And when we do that, we find
that there are certain things

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.400
that many of us are doing

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.420
that are actually
impairing our performance.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.610
So for instance, if you are
taking a pre-workout drink

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:09.990
or you're ingesting a lot of
caffeine or other substance

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:13.640
to bring your body temperature
up before exercise,

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.743
you are limiting the amount
of exercise that you can do.

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:19.640
I can recall a time in college

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.270
when I would drink a lot of espresso

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.890
back then ephedrine was
sold over the counter,

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:27.000
I remember taking it,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.340
it will really energize you for workouts.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.090
You can generate a lot of energy

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.210
and get extremely focused
taking those things.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:37.860
They do increase heart rate,
they can be quite dangerous,

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.210
I don't recommend people take them.

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:41.680
In fact, I think ephedrine
is now off the shelves

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.710
as a non prescription compound

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:46.550
because various people died from taking it

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:49.260
who were sensitive to
it or exercised in heat.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.760
But looking back at that,

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.140
I realized it was a foolish approach.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.340
It was increasing core thermogenesis.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.860
Sure I might've burned a few more calories

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.270
but actually when I look at the data

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.980
that are coming from specific cooling

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.560
and how that can so
increase in performance

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.040
if done properly and then I
compare that to the effects

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.070
of taking some sort of thermogenic
compound, whatever it is

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:17.190
some pre-workout or some pill
or high levels of caffeine,

01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:20.370
it's very clear that
increasing body temperature

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:22.960
prior to working out is
the exact wrong thing

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.390
that one would want to do.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:25.960
You don't want to stay so cold

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.010
that you can't generate
good muscle contractions.

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:31.400
You don't want to be like I am
coming out of the cold ocean,

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.140
you know, with claws for hands

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:36.620
but one wants to have your
body temperature in a range

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.053
that still allows you to
work hard and perform well.

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:45.430
Now, in terms of recovery,
things like alcohol,

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:46.960
we know our vasodilator.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.470
So those are going to cause
people to drop body temperature.

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.637
So you might think, oh, well
that sounds great for recovery

01:08:52.637 --> 01:08:55.090
and I don't think people
should be drinking who are

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:57.270
you know, have problems
with alcohol intake,

01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:58.420
you know, alcoholics

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.400
or they're not of drinking age, et cetera.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.350
I'm not a drinker, but
I do have a good friend

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:04.200
who's a quite accomplished athlete

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.510
who basically drinks a beer or two

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:10.830
after his long runs or cycling
and you know, his argument

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:13.710
is well, I'm dumping body
heat and I like a beer

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:16.520
and he's probably right, it's
probably a really good tool

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.450
provided you don't have
issues with alcohol

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.160
that would preclude that as a tool

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.683
or you're not of drinking age.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:26.340
But anything that you
ingest after exercise

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.080
that would increase body temperature

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.010
is going to impede recovery.

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:32.240
Anything that you do that
lowers body temperature

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.830
provides it's in safe ranges

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.120
is going to accelerate recovery.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.900
And that brings us to the
whole host of compounds

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:44.340
that people take that can
increase body temperature.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.950
And many people are taking these things

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:49.220
in order to increase fat
burning and increase metabolism

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.450
but in my opinion

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:53.430
it's impeding their
ability to perform well.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.640
And especially if the performance

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.420
is something that you're focused on

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.660
aside from body recomposition,
losing fat building muscle.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.050
But even if you're focused on
losing fat, building muscle

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:07.160
you have to ask yourself, is
the body temperature increase

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.210
that I'm getting from these
compounds really worth it

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:14.250
given that it can block
or prevent my performance

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.440
from being as good as it could?

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.370
In other words, is it
worth taking something

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:20.420
that makes you feel very
energized to go work out

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.570
but then you now know that
you are stopping earlier

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:25.760
and you're performing
less well, fewer reps,

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.070
fewer steps overall, is it worth it?

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:30.660
If you had not taken that thing

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.730
then you could perform much longer

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.083
and at much higher capacity.

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:39.290
Some of you are probably
saying, well, that's ridiculous

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:42.010
because when I drink a quadruple espresso

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:45.460
and I pop a whatever pre-workout
or drink a pre-workout

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.700
then I know I can go much further.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.390
Ah, that might be true but
the increase in temperature

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:54.000
is also costing you on the recovery side.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.150
And unless you're doing other things

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:58.730
to improve your recovery and
I know many people that are,

01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:00.930
I don't judge but many people
who are doing those things

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:02.380
are also augmenting their recovery

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.880
through hormone augmentation

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.380
and other performance enhancing tools,

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:09.730
then for the typical
person who's not doing that

01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:11.740
it's probably shooting
yourself in the foot.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.120
So let's take a look at what
some of those compounds are

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.660
and what they and just briefly review

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.420
whether or not they would be a
good or a bad idea to include

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.680
if your main goals are performance

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.610
or your main goals are
body recomposition or both.

01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:26.630
So let's just briefly discuss stimulants.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.660
This could be caffeine,

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.260
this could be any other kind of stimulant

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.270
that are typically in a pre-workout drink

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:36.400
or anything that might get you
revved up before exercising.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.150
This could even be very strong tea,

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:40.200
I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.340
I like a yerba mate, I love that stuff

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.033
and I also drink caffeine.

01:11:45.033 --> 01:11:46.990
I drink love coffee of various kinds

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:49.540
mushroom coffee, black
coffee, espresso, et cetera.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:54.380
I'm a chronic caffeine user,
I don't think I'm an addict

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.040
but I'm a chronic caffeine user.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.860
Meaning when I drink caffeine

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.050
my heart rate doesn't increase so much

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:03.680
that it feels like a shock to my system.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.710
Some people are not caffeine adapted

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.760
or they're very caffeine sensitive.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.930
Here's the straightforward rule.

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:14.190
Caffeine for somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine very much

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:15.980
will constrict the blood vessels

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.840
and will increase retention of body heat

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.760
and it's probably a bad
idea before exercise.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.410
For somebody who's caffeine adapted

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:26.620
and is used to drinking caffeine,

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.640
it won't have that
vasoconstriction effect,

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.210
that's what the data point
too, because I'm adapted to it

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.540
but it will cause vasodilation

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.990
and will allow me to dump body heat.

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:38.430
So for me, I use it before I train

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:39.840
or do any kind of exercise

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.240
because I tend to do
that early in the day,

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.740
it won't prevent me from sleeping

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.860
and it causes vasodilation.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.550
And then afterwards I'm aware

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:48.240
that it causes vasoconstriction

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.060
after the caffeine wears off.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.490
So for somebody who drinks two or three

01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:55.380
or more cups of coffee
a day or mate a day,

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.320
so we're talking intake

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.170
of anywhere from a hundred to
400 milligrams of caffeine,

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.820
what you want to do is
you want to make sure

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.150
that you would do that before exercise

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.580
and probably not after exercise,

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.400
not just makes logical sense

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.290
given what we know about
thermal regulation.

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:14.700
And if you're somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine,

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.660
drinking caffeine before a workout

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.853
is going to be about the worst thing

01:13:17.853 --> 01:13:19.000
that you could possibly do

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.130
because it's going to
increase core body temperature

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.790
through its thermogenic effects

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:25.260
and it's going to constrict
your blood vessels

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.370
and make it even harder to dump heat.

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:31.240
So I don't suggest that
people drink caffeine or not,

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.230
I just suggest that you think about

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.670
whether or not your
caffeine adapted or not,

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:37.930
and decide whether or not
you want to drink caffeine.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:41.320
In general, you're going to be
better not drinking any caffeine

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.430
than you are drinking caffeine

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.930
unless you're a heavy
caffeine user or abuser.

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.830
In which case not drinking caffeine

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:49.430
is going to give you vicious headaches

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:51.850
and is going to make it
very hard to get motivated

01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:53.120
because you're just not used to it.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.050
It takes about three weeks
to get used to no caffeine.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:00.000
It's brutal, I've done it
before, I've done caffeine fast,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.380
I don't know that I ever
want to do it again,

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.990
that's how painful it was.

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.440
But you get headaches

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.460
because of the effects on
vasodilation and constriction.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.000
If you like caffeine
use in moderate amounts

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.020
and use it before your not after.

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.260
If you don't like caffeine or
you don't use it very often,

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.460
stay away from it
anywhere close to exercise

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.870
before or after for that matter.

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.930
One of the more commonly used compounds

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.440
that's sold over the counter

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.270
are non-steroid anti-inflammatories

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:29.030
so things like Tylenol and
Advil and other trade names

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:31.150
and Neproxin sodium things of that sort,

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:36.110
almost all of those drop body
temperature to some extent.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:38.640
And that's why it's often recommended

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.660
that people take them
when they have a fever

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.500
although the whole business

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.330
of dropping body temperature artificially

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:47.400
when you have a fever is itself
an interesting discussion

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.340
whether or not that's the most
adaptive or best thing to do

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:51.950
certainly you don't want
fever to go too high,

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:53.960
can be very dangerous, can kill you

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.190
but artificially dropping body temperature

01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:59.570
with these compounds can be tricky.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:02.810
Now, a number of athletes
especially endurance athletes

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:06.240
will rely on these non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.290
specifically to keep
body temperature lower

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:11.580
during long bouts of exertion.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.610
This is a little bit of
a pharmacologic version

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:18.440
of dumping heat instead
of using palmer cooling

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:22.670
or you know, face ice pack cooling,

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:24.150
they're relying on pharmacology

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.440
to drop their core body temperature.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.000
That has certain obvious advantages,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.040
those advantages should be obvious

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.840
and the reasons for them should be obvious

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.760
based on everything we've
talked about up until now

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.640
lower temperature allows
you to go further harder

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.713
with more intensity.

01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:42.500
However, they do have effects on the liver

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.060
and they can also have
effects on the kidneys

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.840
and during long bouts of exercise

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.070
or even short bouts of exercise,

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:51.500
water balance and salt balance
are also going to be vital

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.400
to maintain in order to perform well,

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.150
generate the best muscle
contraction, stay mentally alert

01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.500
and also to stay alive.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.240
We will do an episode on
salt electrolytes and water

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.120
and water balance but you
probably want to think carefully

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.350
about whether or not

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:10.500
you want to use non-steroid
anti-inflammatories

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.450
before any training session

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:15.440
just for the performance
augmentation effect

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.320
unless you're working
carefully with a coach

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.490
whether or not you've
done that in practices

01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:24.320
and of course, whether or
not you are in a situation

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.900
where monitoring your
body temperature carefully

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.870
is going to be important.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:29.180
You might ask, well, when would that be?

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:34.150
Well, desert races, summer
training and races, winter rides,

01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:36.350
you certainly don't want
to get too cool either.

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:41.290
So alcohol, caffeine and
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:42.950
because of their effects on temperature

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:45.230
will impact performance and recovery

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.520
but you want to be cautious
about how you approach them.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.230
I personally am more a
fan of using caffeine

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:54.060
in moderate doses for the
reasons I described before

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.700
as well to use the cooling of the palms,

01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.140
cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:03.920
by placing them into a
bucket or into a cool bath

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.230
after training or cooling
the face after training

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:08.900
or sometimes even during training.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.680
It just seems like
there's more of a margin

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.730
to play with the variables,
to heat up the water

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:17.080
or cool it down a little
bit to include one palm

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.250
or the other palm.

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:21.900
There's all sorts of good parameter space

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.700
as we call it in science
that you can play with

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.840
and work with to find what works for you

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.570
whereas when you pop a pill,
sure you can adjust the dose

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:31.030
and you can adjust it next time

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:32.440
but once it's in you, it's in you

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.110
and there's going to
be some period of time

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:35.950
before you can modulate it.

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:37.720
What I've offered today

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.970
are ways in which you can use temperature

01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:42.760
to powerfully improve performance.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.630
And if you think about it,

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:45.410
you can vary that from set to set,

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:48.020
you could do your pull ups or your sprints

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.750
and then cool your palms,

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.710
and then try and go with
colder water the next round

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.380
or warmer water the next round

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.420
or do both feet and palms and face.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.630
I mean, you can do all sorts
of things moment to moment

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.800
and see what works for you again

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.920
essentially zero cost or no cost.

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.280
Whereas when you pop
something, you take a pill,

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.410
you're basically in that regimen

01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:10.510
for the next hour or two or more.

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.020
You can always take more, but
you can't really take less.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.200
You can't really extract it
from your body in real time

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.120
so it doesn't give you
a lot of opportunity

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.690
to play scientists, which
is what I like to do

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:21.220
because what I'm always trying to do

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.970
is trying to dial in the
best protocols possible

01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:25.570
based on the mechanisms and data.

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:26.960
And if you can do that moment to moment

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.260
that places you in a position of power.

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.920
Once again, we covered a lot of material.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.020
By now, after seeing this episode

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:37.210
or listening to this episode,
you should understand a lot

01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:39.960
about how your body heats and cools itself

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.270
and the value of that
for physical performance.

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:44.520
I hope you'll also appreciate

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.460
that you have tools at your disposal

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.520
to vastly improve your
physical performance.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.230
And should you try those,
please let us know how it goes.

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:55.700
If you decide to do palmer
cooling during your runs

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:58.780
or after your runs, during
your weight workouts,

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.290
during your yoga sessions,
whatever it is, let us know,

01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:03.420
please place that in the comments.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.810
I've given you specific
protocols and some direction,

01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:09.000
but I've also left it slightly vague

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.030
because it, as I mentioned earlier

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.800
I don't know all the
environmental conditions,

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.850
I don't know how hot your yoga studio is

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.550
or how cool your gym happens to be

01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:19.380
or your body temperature or time of day.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.120
Remember your temperature will vary

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.270
according to the time of day,

01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:24.740
we did a whole episode
about that related to sleep.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.840
Typically your body temperature
is rising early in the day

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.850
and is coming down as you
approach the late evening

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.150
and late night hours for sleep,
in the middle of the night

01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:34.760
your temperature is very low

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.770
at its absolute lowest

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.460
something we call the temperature minimum.

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:40.130
So we don't know exactly where you're at.

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.890
You need to take the information
that you receive today

01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:45.130
and should you try and incorporate it

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:46.420
try and do it intelligently.

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:49.710
Don't cool yourself off
so much that you know

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:52.550
become cryogenic and please
don't warm yourself up.

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:55.560
In fact, we didn't talk at
all about warming yourself up

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.030
because warming yourself up too
much can be quite dangerous.

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.550
You never, ever, ever
want to be hypothermic,

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.800
that's what your body and your
brain are trying to avoid.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.720
We talked a little bit about supplements

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.590
but not the standard sorts of supplements

01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:11.570
I usually list off on these episodes.

01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:14.050
Rather, we talked about caffeine,

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:15.900
non-steroid anti-inflammatories

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.190
and how those can impact temperature,

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:19.097
how alcohol can impact temperature.

01:20:19.097 --> 01:20:21.120
And I should just mention in closing

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.410
that every time we eat, we
also increased temperature.

01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:26.020
There's a eating induced
thermogenic effect

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.900
but that's a minor one,
that's a small one.

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.770
So you wouldn't worry about
eating before training

01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:33.260
because of its effects on temperature

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.010
because it tends to be really minor.

01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:38.470
Going forward, we're going to
talk more about temperature

01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:41.830
and other ways to improve
physical performance

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:42.680
and skill learning.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.660
We're going to talk about specific ways

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:48.780
to accelerate fat loss,
to improve muscle growth,

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:52.420
to improve suppleness and flexibility.

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:56.590
These approaches and
mechanisms are anchored deeply

01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:59.340
in neuroscience and physiology
and the relationship

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:02.620
between our peripheral
organs, which include our skin

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.670
and our brain and all
the organs in between.

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.730
So it's really a pleasure for
me because I'm able to look

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.120
to the textbook literature that exists

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.450
and really came out over the
last 50 to a hundred years

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:16.420
and unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.370
which are still sort of mystical,

01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:20.220
like consciousness and dreaming,

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.410
of which we understand a little bit

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:24.620
about these core mechanisms
of temperature and physiology

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:29.110
which are so powerful,
involve very concrete studies

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:31.763
that as you learn today
are very actionable.

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:34.260

but from time to time, we
also release shorter content

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.610
and we will be releasing
additional content

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:00.510
in between episodes from time to time.

and to leave us feedback.

01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:14.120
They have a comment section there,

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.470
it's really a feedback section

01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:17.980
where you can rate and
describe the podcast

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.620
as you experience it.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:22.600

the podcast in other ways,

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.900
please check out our sponsors.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.390
That's a terrific way to support us.

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:27.430
We also have a Patreon, you can find it

01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:30.760
at patreon.com/andrewhuberman

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.600
that allows you to support the podcast

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.680
at any level that you like.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.730
Today we didn't focus so
heavily on supplements,

01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:38.310
but in other episodes I have,

01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:40.160
and there are certainly supplements

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.790
that are beneficial for sleep,

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.040
for performance, for learning,

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.890
immunity and so forth.

01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:50.890
We've partnered with
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com,

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:52.930
because Thorne supplements

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.950
we believe to be the most stringent

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:57.870
in terms of what they put on the bottle

01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:00.340
is actually what's in the bottle,
so the amounts are precise

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.570
and the quality of the
ingredients is very precise.

01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:04.170
They partner with the Mayo Clinic,

01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:05.360
all the major sports teams

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.180
so we're delighted that
we're partnered with Thorne.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.120
If you want to see the
supplements that I take

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.880
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.500
and you can see the
supplements that I take,

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.180
you could get 20% off
any of those supplements

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.450
should you choose to order them

01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:21.910
as well as 20% off any other supplements

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:23.540
that Thorne happens to make.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:28.540
That's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:33.260
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:34.480
And last but not least,

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.860
I want to thank you for
your time and attention.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.990
I realize this is a lot of information,

01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:40.710
I hope you'll find some
of it to be actionable

01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:43.130
and useful for you and
for people that you know

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:46.011
and as always thank you for
your interest in science.

01:23:46.011 --> 01:23:48.594
