00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.720
where we discuss science

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.107
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:09.530
(energetic music)

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.550
I'm Andrew Huberman

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.480
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.740
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.767
Today's podcast episode
is all about sleep,

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.650
and we're also going to talk about

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.860
the mirror image of sleep,
which is wakefulness.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.580
Now, these two phases of our life,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.220
sleep and wakefulness,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.600
govern everything about our
mental and physical health,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.200
and we're not just gonna talk about

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.190
what's useful about sleep,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.170
we're also gonna talk about
how to get better at sleeping,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.870
and that will include how to
get better at falling asleep,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.950
timing your sleep, and
accessing better sleep quality.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.670
In doing so, we're also gonna discuss

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.820
how to get more focused
and alert in wakefulness,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.660
so because sleep and
wakefulness are related,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.610
we really can't have a
conversation about one

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.100
without the other.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.750
Now, in keeping with this theme,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.040
you may catch a few
snores in the background.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.020
Unlike me, my bulldog, Costello,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.950
can fall asleep anywhere, anytime,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.220
and he happens to be sleeping
over there in the corner,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.360
so if you hear snoring,
that's what that's about.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.740
As always, I wanna just
mention that this podcast

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.920
is part of my effort to bring

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.540
zero-cost-to-consumer public education

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.300
about science and science-related tools,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.870
it is unrelated to my
teaching and research roles

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.220
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.280
Today's podcast is brought
to us by Helix mattresses,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280
having the proper sleep environment,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.000
both the environment you're sleeping in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.870
and the object you're sleeping on,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.650
is critically important to
getting a good night's sleep.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.140
Helix mattresses are a
little different than most

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.060
because they're matched to
your specific sleep needs,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.360
as well as whether or not
you tend to run hot or cold

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.660
as you sleep through the night,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.900
what position you sleep in, and so forth,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.520
so if you go to their website,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.810
they have a quiz that you can take

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.760
that matches you to
the particular mattress

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.120
that's gonna be best for your sleep needs.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.950
I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.710
I'm one of these people
that can fall asleep easily,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.740
but then I wake up

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.780
and I have a hard time
getting back to sleep,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.880
and once I switched to a Helix mattress

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.383
that was precisely
matched to my sleep needs,

00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:06.770
I found I could sleep through the night,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.060
which has made a tremendous
difference for me.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.700
If you wanna try Helix mattresses,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.420
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.500
and that will give you up to
$200 off on a mattress order,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.780
as well as two pillows free
with your mattress order,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.670
and of course, having the proper pillows

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.820
is just as important as
having the proper mattress.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.900
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.610
Headspace is a meditation app

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.920
that teaches you how to meditate.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.130
It's fair to say that now there's

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.360
a ton of research out there
in peer-reviewed journals

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.600
supporting the fact that
mindfulness meditation

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.630
can support mental and physical health,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.650
but many people find it hard to meditate,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.310
in fact, I'm one of these people.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.780
I started meditating in my teens,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.010
but then I would drop
it every few weeks or so

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.260
and then I'd get back to it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.200
maybe the following week or every year,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.920
I just was not very regular
about my meditation practice,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.590
and then a few years ago I
was flying a lot for work

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.040
and I was on JetBlue flights,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.993
and they have Headspace as
part of the choice of things

00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:06.140
that you can watch on the TV screen,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.820
and as I started
meditating more regularly,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.910
what I found is my sleep was better,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.050
I would arrive feeling more rested,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.730
it was just a tremendous effects

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.060
on my work performance and
other aspects of my life.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.490
If you wanna try Headspace,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.223
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.340
if you do that, you'll get one month

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.140
of all of Headspace's
meditations for free,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.800
that's the best offer right now,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.773
so if interested, go to
headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.230
So let's talk about sleep,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.020
sleep is this incredible
period of our lives

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.360
where we are not conscious.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.510
We might dream, we might
twitch, we might even wake up,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.230
but in sleep, we are only in relation

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.910
to things that are happening
within our brain and body.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.910
Outside sensory experience, in most cases,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.860
can't really impact us,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.130
and yet, sleep is this tremendously
important period of life

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.210
because it resets our ability

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.290
to be focused, alert,
and emotionally stable

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.240
in the wakeful period,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.550
so we can't really talk
about wakefulness, focus,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.610
motivation, mood, wellbeing

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.160
without thinking about sleep,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.180
and that's why we're
devoting this entire month

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.853
to the discussion about sleep.

00:04:17.853 --> 00:04:20.730
Now, we also can't talk about
sleep and think about sleep

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.380
without thinking about wakefulness

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.947
because it turns out that
the period that we call sleep

00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:27.790
and the period we call wakefulness

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.690
are tethered to one another.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.500
What we do in the waking state

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.030
determines when we fall asleep,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.920
how quickly we fall asleep,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.750
whether or not we stay asleep,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.560
and how we feel when we
wake up the next day,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.170
and today, we're going to talk mostly

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.870
about how to get better at sleeping,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.490
and the reason for starting
the conversation that way

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.500
as opposed to just diving into
a lot of biology about sleep,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.360
is because first of all,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.330
there's a lot of information
out there already

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.380
about the biology of sleep.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.800
We're gonna touch on a little bit of this,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.800
things like stages of
sleep and sleep spindles,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.410
melatonin, and dreaming,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.490
but I think that by now,
most people are aware

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.410
that getting a really good night's sleep

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.590
on a consistent basis
is critically important,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.110
but most people don't know how to do that.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.390
In fact, I'm guessing that
very few of you out there

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.220
are consistently getting
seven to nine hours

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.090
of really terrific sleep,
waking up feeling rested

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.627
and like you're ready to attack the day,

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.260
and being able to go through the day

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.030
feeling focused and alert

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.600
without dips in energy or focus,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.920
so if you're like most
people, which includes me,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.760
you have some challenges with sleep

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.110
at least every third or fifth night or so

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.720
and maybe even more often,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.600
so we're really gonna go tool-heavy today

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.040
and talk about tools that
can help you fall asleep,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.690
sleep better, and emerge from
sleep feeling more rested,

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.170
and we're gonna do that by
grounding our discussion of tools

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.440
in peer-reviewed studies,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.360
mostly from the last 10 years,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.690
although some even more recent than that,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.120
and we're gonna start by
discussing what is sleep

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.370
and what governs the timing
of the onset of sleep,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.590
in other words, what makes you get sleepy

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.540
at a particular time of day.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.090
So what determines how well we sleep

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.230
and the quality of our wakeful state?

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.720
Turns out that's governed by two forces,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.370
the first force is a chemical force,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.630
it's called adenosine.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.900
Adenosine is a molecule in
our nervous system and body

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.790
that builds up the longer we are awake,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.640
so if you've just slept for 8, or 9,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.440
or 10 really deep, restful hours,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.920
adenosine is gonna be very
low in your brain and body.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.990
If, however, you've been awake
for 10, 15, or more hours,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.730
adenosine levels are
going to be much higher.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.580
Adenosine creates a sort of
sleep drive or a sleep hunger,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.020
and actually, hunger is
the appropriate word here

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.910
because for most of what
we're gonna discuss today,

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.410
we can think of it in an
analogous way to nutrition.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.400
Your nutrition and how well you feel

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.380
after you eat certain foods,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.370
your overall level of fitness

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.160
and your cellular health
and your heart health

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.130
isn't governed by any one food item

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.630
that you might eat or not eat,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.450
it's governed by a number
of different factors,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.440
how often you eat, how much you eat,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.410
which items you eat, et cetera,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.460
and what works best for you.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.180
In the same way, your
sleep and your wakefulness

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.910
are the product of kind of the average

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.740
of a number of different behaviors,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.750
how long you've been awake is a key one

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.330
because of this molecule, adenosine.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.970
So the reason you get sleepy
when you've been up for a while

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.860
is because adenosine
is creeping up steadily

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.630
the longer you've been awake,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.920
and a good way to remember
this and think about adenosine

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.380
is to think about caffeine.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.280
Caffeine, for most people,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.400
except a very small percentage of people,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.070
wakes them up, it makes
them feel more alert,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.780
in fact, some people are
so sensitive to caffeine

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.240
that they feel jittery if they drink it

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.670
even in small amounts,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.820
other people can drink
large amounts of caffeine

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.763
and not feel jittery at all.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.310
Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.260
what that means is that
when you ingest caffeine,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.430
whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.150
or in any other form,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.750
it binds to the adenosine receptor,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.760
it sort of parks there just like a car

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.520
would park in a given parking slot,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.950
and therefore, adenosine
can't park in that slot.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.253
Now, when caffeine parks in
the adenosine receptor slot,

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.150
nothing really happens
downstream of that receptor,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.600
the receptor can't engage

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.297
the normal cellular
functions of making that cell

00:08:39.297 --> 00:08:41.570
and you feel sleepy.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.380
So the reason caffeine wakes you up

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.120
is because it blocks
the sleepiness receptor,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.840
it blocks the sleepy signal,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.550
and this is why when
that caffeine wears off,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.620
adenosine will bind to that receptor,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.570
sometimes with even greater,
what we call affinity,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.110
and you feel the crash,
you feel especially tired.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.437
Now, I'm not here to demonize
caffeine, I love caffeine,

00:09:04.437 --> 00:09:05.810
and I drink it in the morning

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.550
and I drink it in the afternoon,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.610
but I'm one of these people

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.970
that, either because of my tolerance

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.270
or because of some genetic variations

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.730
that exist among people

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.400
in terms of their adenosine receptors,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.410
I can drink caffeine

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.470
as late as 4:00 or 5:00
p.m. in the evening

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.750
and still fall asleep just fine.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.400
Some people can't have any caffeine at all

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.760
or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.030
or else their sleep is totally disrupted.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.810
All of this has to do
with the relationship

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.860
between adenosine and
these adenosine receptors,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.050
genetic variation,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.230
things that are very hard to
find out except experimentally,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.160
meaning each of you needs to decide

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.860
and figure out for yourselves

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.670
whether or not you can tolerate caffeine

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.320
and at what times of day
you can tolerate caffeine

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.320
in order to still fall asleep
easily and get good sleep,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.900
so rather than demonize caffeine,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.800
or say that everyone can
drink caffeine until late,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.360
you need to figure out
what's right for you.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.220
Caffeine has a lot of health benefits,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.630
it also, for some people,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.320
can be problematic for health,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.430
it can raise blood pressure, et cetera,

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.720
caffeine increases this molecule

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.260
that's a neuromodulator
that we call dopamine,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.190
we discussed this in episode one,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.620
which tends to make us
feel good, motivated,

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.230
and give us energy

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.410
because, as you may have
learned in episode one,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.300
dopamine is related to
another neuromodulator

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.420
called epinephrine, which gives us energy,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.880
in fact, epinephrine
is made from dopamine.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.160
So let's just take a step back

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.900
and think about what we're talking about

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.670
when we're talking about sleepiness,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.920
sleepiness is driven by
increases in adenosine

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.483
that happen naturally,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.700
caffeine prevents the adenosine

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.300
from having its action of making us sleepy

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.010
by blocking that receptor,

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.510
so it gives us energy and it
increases our dopamine levels,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.550
but some people can't
tolerate caffeine very well,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.680
other people can tolerate it just fine,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.320
so you need to determine
that experimentally.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.890
All the data say there's
tremendous variation,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.060
and right now, the only
way that I'm aware of

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.250
for you to decide whether or not

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.820
caffeine is a good or a bad thing for you,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.590
and whether or not you should ingest it

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.050
at a given time of day or at all

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.730
is really to figure that out on your own,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.850
in fact, there's a small subset of people

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.440
that can drink caffeine until very late

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.110
and they have no trouble falling asleep

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.430
because they actually have a mutant form

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.090
of the adenosine receptor,

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.410
so in keeping with the theme

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.550
of science and science-related tools,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.570
this is one of those cases

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.960
where I can't give you a
one-size-fits-all prescription

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.700
except to say you need to
experiment with caffeine

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.280
in a way that's safe for you

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.430
and explore that and figure
out what works for you,

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.200
and then stick with that.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.570
Okay, so adenosine is
driving this sleep hunger,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.000
when adenosine is low,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.580
it's like we're well-fed,
we're not very hungry,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.570
and when adenosine is high,

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.210
it's like we're fasted for a long time

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.870
and we tend to be very hungry,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.270
so that when adenosine is high,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.550
we really wanna fall asleep.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.880
If you want, I'm not suggesting
you do this experiment,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.850
but you can do it,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.350
you can stay up for four more hours

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.590
than you're used to staying up

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.250
and you'll find that
you're very, very sleepy.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.900
That's because adenosine is building up

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.620
at levels higher and higher

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.830
because you've been awake
for those extra four hours.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.320
However, if you've ever
pulled an all-nighter,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.200
you'll notice something interesting,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.870
as morning rolls around,

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.590
you'll suddenly feel an increase

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.500
in your energy and alertness again,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.300
even though adenosine has been building up

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.600
for the entire night.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.150
Now, why is that?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.700
The reason that is is because
there's a second force

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.800
which is governing when you
sleep and when you're awake,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.740
and that force is a
so-called circadian force,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.440
circadian means about a
day or about 24 hours,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.170
and inside all of us is a clock

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.590
that exists in your brain and my brain,

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.910
and the brain of every
animal that we're aware of,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.970
that determines when we want to be sleepy

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.010
and when we want to be awake.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.843
Just think about it,

00:12:58.843 --> 00:12:59.820
we don't go through the day

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.950
wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.270
and then feeling like we're wide awake,

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.260
our sleep and our period of sleepiness

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.700
tends to be condensed into one block,

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.180
typically one 6- to 10-hour block,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.850
although there's also variation

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.860
in terms of how much people want to sleep,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.060
and we're going to discuss

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.370
how you can diagnose
your absolute sleep need

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.820
as well as how to recover
sleep that you've lost.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.490
That block of sleep

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.690
and when it falls within
each 24-hour cycle

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.970
is governed by a number
of different things,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.090
but the most powerful thing

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.100
that's governing when
you want to be asleep

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.810
and when you want to be awake is light,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.197
and in particular, it's
governed by sunlight,

00:13:41.197 --> 00:13:43.020
and I can't emphasize enough

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.760
how important and how
actionable this relationship is

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.573
between light and when you want to sleep.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.440
It's quite simple on the face of it

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.090
and it's quite simple to resolve,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.950
but people tend to make a big mess

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.510
of this whole circadian
literature, frankly,

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.290
so let's just break it
down from the standpoint

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.210
of what's going on in your brain and body

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.420
as you go through one 24-hour day.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.850
Let's start with waking,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.970
so regardless of how
well you slept at night

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.150
or whether or not you were up all night,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.630
most people tend to wake up

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.240
sometime around when the sun rises,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.620
maybe not right at sunrise,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.733
but within an hour or two
or maybe three of sunrise.

00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:25.930
Now, I realize there
are night-shift workers

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.780
and there are people traveling
and experiencing jet lag

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.440
where this is not going to be the case,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.160
we are gonna deal with
jet lag and shift work

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.070
at the end of this podcast,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.880
but for most people, we tend to wake up

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.450
about the time that the
sun is rising or so,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.570
and as we do that,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.820
adenosine levels tend to
be low if we've been asleep

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.160
for reasons that you now understand,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.420
and our system generates
an internal signal

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.440
that is in the form of a hormone.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.520
Now, I've talked a lot about

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.500
neuromodulators and neurotransmitters,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.510
I haven't talked a lot about
hormones yet on this podcast.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.250
The definition of a hormone
is it's a substance,

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.100
a chemical that's released
from one organ in your body

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.800
that goes and acts on other
organs elsewhere in your body,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.010
including your nervous system.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.740
When you wake up in the morning,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.390
you wake up because a particular
hormone called cortisol

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.710
is released from your adrenal glands,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.830
your adrenal glands sit
right above your kidneys,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.030
and there's a little pulse of cortisol.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.250
There's also a pulse of some,

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.150
and when I say a pulse,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.440
I just mean the release of a little bit,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.050
there's also a pulse of
epinephrine, which is adrenaline,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.750
from your adrenals and also in your brain,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.650
and you feel awake.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.980
Now, that pulse of cortisol
and adrenaline and epinephrine

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.550
might come from your alarm clock,

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.210
it might come from you
naturally waking up,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.480
but it tends to alert your
whole system in your body

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.080
that it's time to
increase your heart rate,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.610
it's time to start tensing your muscles,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.000
it's time to start moving about.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.070
It's very important
that that cortisol pulse

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.140
come early in the day,

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.930
or at least, early in your
period of wakefulness,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.770
I say that because some people
are waking up at 8:00 p.m.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.240
and are sleeping all day,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.280
but it's very important
that that pulse of cortisol

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.160
occur early in the day and
that it happens all at once,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.130
it sort of sets a rising tide
of cortisol in your system.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.510
Now, many of you have
probably heard about cortisol

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.930
in relation to stress,

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.870
and indeed, as we go through
our day and our life,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.150
different stressors, different
events happen in our life

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.210
that make us feel more alert.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.480
Some of the more stressful ones

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.470
might be looking at your credit card bill

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.740
and seeing what seems to
be a fraudulent charge,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.040
or looking at your phone

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.970
and suddenly seeing a text that something

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.490
you thought was gonna
happen at a particular time

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.360
is not gonna happen,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.630
or you're running late,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.030
those will tend to increase norepinephrine

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.970
and epinephrine and
adrenaline in your system,

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.550
and if they're severe enough,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.030
you'll start getting
some pulses of cortisol

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.440
released from your adrenals
throughout the day,

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.280
but there's this normal,
healthy rising tide of cortisol

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.600
that happens early in the day,

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.940
and I say healthy because it wakes you up,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.773
it makes you feel alert,

00:17:05.773 --> 00:17:08.790
and it makes you feel able
to move and wanting to move

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.440
and to go about your day
for work, for exercise,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.720
for school, for social
relations, et cetera.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.640
So when you wake up in the morning

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.770
is when that cortisol pulse takes off,

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.030
and something else important happens,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.890
a timer is set in your body
and in your nervous system

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.870
that dictates when a different
hormone called melatonin,

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.950
which makes you sleepy,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.740
will be secreted from a
particular brain region,

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.700
so let's talk about that.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.840
When you wake up in the morning

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.020
and you experience that rise in cortisol,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.610
there's a timer that starts going,

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.090
and these are cellular timers

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.780
and they're dictated by the relation

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.670
between different organs in your body,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.230
that says to your brain and body

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.110
that in about 12 to 14 hours,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.370
a different hormone, this
hormone we're calling melatonin,

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.320
will be released from your pineal gland.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.710
So there's two mechanisms here,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.430
a wakefulness signal
and a sleepiness signal,

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.230
and the wakefulness signal
triggers the onset of the timer

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.340
for the sleepiness signal.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.610
Now, that sleepiness signal
that we call melatonin

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.490
that's released from the pineal

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.950
comes only from the pineal.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.180
Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin,

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.180
you're supplementing with melatonin,

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.910
the only source of melatonin in your body

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.950
is going to be this pineal gland,

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.540
so let's talk about the
pineal gland for a second.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.250
The pineal gland is a gland

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.740
that sits kind of in the
little structure near,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.500
for the aficionados out there,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.590
it's kind of near the fourth ventricle,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.430
it's about the size of a pea,

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.430
Descartes, the philosopher,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.330
said that the pineal was
the seat of the soul,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.680
he said that because it's

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.480
one of the few structures
in the human brain

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.530
that there's only one of them,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.363
you know, most structures,

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.150
there's one on either side of the brain,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.490
so-called bihemispheric,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.420
but the pineal, there's only one.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.100
I don't know anything about souls, really,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.830
certainly not the science of souls,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.340
but I think it's very unlikely

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.890
that the pineal is the seat of the soul,

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.220
but it is a very interesting organ

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.550
because it's the only organ in our body

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.400
that releases melatonin,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.200
and that melatonin makes us
sleepy and lets us fall asleep.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.317
Now, I'm guessing that many
of you are probably asking,

00:19:21.317 --> 00:19:23.500
"Should I take melatonin?"

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:28.500
My personal bias on this is,
except in rare cases, no,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.070
for the following reason,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.240
melatonin has a second function,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.510
which is that melatonin

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.940
also suppresses the onset of puberty.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.820
In kids, and especially in babies,

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.430
melatonin isn't just
released in the evening

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.250
12 to 16 hours after we wake,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.860
melatonin is released
chronically, or tonically,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.650
throughout the day and night,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.380
and that chronic or tonic
release of melatonin

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.750
is known to suppress some
of the other hormones

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.170
in other regions of the brain

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.280
that trigger the onset of puberty.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.550
Now, if you or your child
has been taking melatonin,

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.900
don't freak out,

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.750
as always, any kind of supplement

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.940
or anything that you're going
to take or think about taking,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.970
you really need to
consult with your doctor,

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.830
I've said this many times on this podcast

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.670
and it's in the show notes, et cetera,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.390
but before you remove anything

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.000
or add anything to what
you're already doing,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.490
please do consult with a
healthcare professional.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.160
However, melatonin is known

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.760
to suppress the onset of puberty,

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.420
so much so that regular, cyclic,

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.070
cycled periods of melatonin
release from the pineal

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.300
really correlate with the onset of puberty

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.050
and early adulthood,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.810
meaning as we start secreting
melatonin only at night,

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.790
that's also when we tend to
transition out of puberty.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.210
Now, there are a lot of
things that correlate

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.090
in our nervous system,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.160
so that doesn't necessarily
mean it controls it,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.750
but in this case we know,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.090
based on lots of data,
endocrinology and so forth,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.200
that melatonin suppresses
the onset of puberty,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.810
so supplementing melatonin
could be problematic

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.400
for that reason,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.130
but if you've already
gone through puberty,

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.430
it could also have some impact

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.540
on other hormone systems in your body,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.970
so that's why I personally

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.080
don't like to use
melatonin to fall asleep.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.913
There's another reason,

00:21:12.913 --> 00:21:14.880
which is that melatonin
will help you fall asleep

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.720
but it won't help you stay asleep,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.230
and many people who take melatonin

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.770
find that they wake up
three to five hours later

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.780
unable to fall back asleep.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.180
Part of the reason for that might be

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.790
that melatonin purchased at,

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.880
you can buy it over the counter

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.420
in most areas of the world
even though it's a hormone,

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.300
which is a little unusual,

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.670
you can't just go into a
pharmacy, at least in the US,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.420
and buy testosterone or
cortisol or estrogen,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.420
you need a prescription,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.580
but you can go buy melatonin
for whatever reason,

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.780
I don't know the reasons
for that legality,

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.950
but it's been shown many times,

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.440
and now I'm borrowing from some items

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.120
that were in Matt Walker's
book, "Why We Sleep,"

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.820
where he stated there is evidence

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.230
that, in commercially available melatonin,

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.520
the amount of melatonin has
been tested for various brands,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.330
it can range anywhere from being

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.610
15% of what's listed on the bottle,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.220
okay, so if they list
this as 100 milligrams,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.960
it would be a tremendously high dose,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.150
it turns out it's only 15 milligrams

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.470
in that particular pill or capsule,

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.010
or up to 400 times more than
what's listed on the bottle,

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.860
so it's completely unregulated,

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.050
and so for those of you taking melatonin,

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.740
I will discuss at the end of the podcast

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.810
some other potential alternatives
that are probably safer

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.630
and don't have these issues.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.990
So should you take melatonin?

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.410
My personal bias is no,

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.520
but for many people, they
find that it does help them,

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.040
and so if you do find it helps you,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.800
then just consider what I'm saying

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.210
in light of the other
practices that you're doing

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.150
and talk to your healthcare professional.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.490
Okay, so the rhythm of
cortisol and melatonin

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.110
is what we call endogenous,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.190
it's happening in us all the time

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.080
without any external input,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.450
in fact, if we were in complete darkness,

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.540
living in a cave with no
artificial lights whatsoever,

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.260
or we were in complete brightness

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.150
where we never experienced any darkness,

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.270
these rhythms of cortisol
and melatonin would continue,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.070
you would have a bump in
cortisol, or a pulse in cortisol,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.530
that would drop off with time,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:23.300
and then melatonin would come
up about 12 to 14 hours later,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.390
but these endogenous systems of our body,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.650
which are both hormonal and neural,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.930
were set so that external things

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.900
could govern when they happen.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.140
Now, this takes us back to
episode one of the podcast

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.730
that if you haven't listened to already,

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.740
you might wanna listen to,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.360
where we talked about sensation
and perception and all that,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.280
I'm not gonna review it again here,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.090
but there's one particular sensory event,

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.000
one particular influence
on your nervous system

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.740
that determines when that cortisol

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.360
is going to start to rise,

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.530
so if you were in complete darkness,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.640
it would happen once per 24-hour cycle,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.320
but it would be somewhat
later and later each day,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.590
whereas under normal circumstances,

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.870
what happens is you wake up,

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.690
and what happens when you wake up?

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.020
You open your eyes.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.440
When your open your eyes,
light comes into your eyes.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.190
Now, the way this system works

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.850
is that you have a particular
set of neurons in your eye,

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.490
they're called retinal ganglion cells,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.810
you don't have to remember
that if you don't want to,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.410
but these retinal ganglion
cells are brain neurons,

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.140
again, the retina is just
the one piece of your brain,

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.890
actually, two pieces because
most of you have two retinas,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.930
that resides outside the skull, per se.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.610
When light comes into the eye,

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.630
there's a particular group
of retinal ganglion cells,

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.950
or type of retinal ganglion cells,

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.790
that perceives a particular type of light

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.220
and communicates that to this clock

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.050
that resides right above
the roof of your mouth

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.400
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.000
So I know this can get
a little complicated,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.460
but these retinal ganglion cells,

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.447
when you open your eyes, light comes in,

00:25:05.447 --> 00:25:08.860
and an electrical signal is
sent to this central clock

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.150
we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.230
and the suprachiasmatic
nucleus has connections

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.850
with essentially every cell
and organ of your body.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.580
Now, it's vitally important

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.910
that we get light communicated
to this central clock

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.320
in order to time the cortisol
and melatonin properly,

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.800
and when I say properly, I
can say that with confidence

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.310
because we know based on a lot of evidence

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.860
that if you don't get

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.030
your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right,

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:43.030
there are tremendously
broad and bad effects

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.840
on cardiovascular health,
dementia, metabolic effects,

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.550
learning, depression, dementia,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.250
in fact, there're so many negative effects

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.630
associated with getting this wrong

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.360
that I don't wanna get
into it in too much detail,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.260
in fact, I feel like we've been bombarded

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.540
with all this information about
how we're not sleeping well,

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.730
we're not sleeping at the right times,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.920
we're not sleeping enough,

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.780
to the point where people
now have sleep anxiety,

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.700
if they can't sleep well for a night,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.250
they're feeling overwhelmed by that

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.570
and it's sort of now they're stressed

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.740
about not being able to sleep

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.170
which is making it harder
to sleep, et cetera.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.570
I really wanna focus on what we can do

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.930
to anchor these systems properly,

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.190
so let's think about what
happens when we do this correctly

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.610
and how to do it correctly.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.890
When we wake up, our eyes open,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.280
now, if we're in a dark room,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.350
there isn't enough light to
trigger the correct timing

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.373
of this cortisol-melatonin
thing, these rhythms.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.460
You might say, "Well, why
won't any light do it?"

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.700
Well, it turns out that
these neurons in our eye

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.360
that set the circadian clock

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.340
and then allow our circadian
clock to set all the clocks

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.010
of all the cells and organs
and tissues of our body

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.470
responds best to a
particular quality of light

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.763
and amount of light,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.260
and those are the qualities
of light and amount of light

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.420
that come from sunlight,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:07.110
so these neurons, what
they're really looking for,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.080
although they don't have
a mind of their own,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.510
is the sun at what we
call low solar angle,

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.620
the eye and the nervous system

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.940
don't know anything about
sunrises or sunsets,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.360
it only knows the quality of light

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.000
that comes in when the
sun is low in the sky,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.910
the system evolved so that
when the sun is low in the sky,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.010
there's a particular contrast
between yellows and blues

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.510
that triggers the
activation of these cells,

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.110
so if you wake up and
you look at your phone

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.943
or your computer,

00:27:33.943 --> 00:27:36.040
or you flip on a bunch
of artificial lights,

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.990
will these cells be activated?

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.650
And the answer is, sort of,

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.000
they'll be activated but
not in the optimal way.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.590
What you want to do is
get sunlight in your eyes

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.960
as close to waking as possible.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.420
Now, I wanna be really clear about this

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.300
because I've talked about it

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.770
on other podcasts when I was a guest

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.940
and I talked about it
on my Instagram feed,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.350
and there seemed to be the same questions

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.250
coming up again and again,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.140
these neurons don't know sunlight, per se,

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.450
they don't know sunrise or
sunset, for that matter,

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.580
they don't know artificial
light from sunlight,

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.480
what they respond best to,

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.590
however, is the quality
and amount of light

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.180
that comes in when the
sun is low in the sky,

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.570
that means that if you can
watch the sunrise, great,

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.020
that's perfect for triggering
activation of these cells,

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.210
however, if you wake up a
few hours after the sunrise,

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.150
which I tend to most days, personally,

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.850
you still wanna get
outside and view sunlight,

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.130
you don't need the sunlight

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.820
beaming you directly in the eyes,

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.190
there's a lot of photons, light energy,

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.790
that's scattered from
sunlight at this time,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.520
but the key is to get that light energy,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.090
from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.097
Now, I know many of
you are already asking,

00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:51.740
"Well, I live in Scandinavia,"

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.937
or, "I can't get sunlight,

00:28:52.937 --> 00:28:54.690
"there's buildings around me," et cetera,

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.740
we will get to all of that,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.050
but it's critically important

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.510
that you get outside to get this light.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.380
I had a discussion with
a colleague of mine,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.730
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in
the Department of Psychiatry

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.500
and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.530
a world expert in this,

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.530
and he tells me that it's
50 times less effective

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.570
to view this sunlight through a window,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.230
through a car windshield,

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.190
or through the side window of a car

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:26.210
than it is to just get
outside with no sunglasses

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.780
and view light early in the day.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.760
Now, if you can't see the sunrise,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.920
like I said, you can see this

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.530
within an hour or two of sunrise,

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.150
but it has to be low solar angle,

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.590
once the sun is overhead,
the quality of light shifts

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.660
so that you miss this opportunity

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.510
to time the cortisol pulse,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.000
and that turns out to
be a bad thing to do,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.180
you really wanna time that
cortisol pulse properly

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.360
because, we'll get into this
a little bit more later,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.510
but a late-shifted cortisol pulse,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.570
in particular, a 9:00 p.m. or
8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:04.570
is one of the consequences,
and maybe one of the causes,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.540
of a lot of anxiety
disorders and depression,

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.660
so it's kind of a chicken-egg thing,

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.640
we don't know whether or
not it's correlated with,

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.600
it's the cause, or the effect,

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.880
but it's a signature of
depression and anxiety disorder.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.720
Bringing that cortisol pulse
earlier in your wakeful period,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.540
earlier in your day,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.360
has positive benefits
ranging from blood pressure

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.530
to mental health, et cetera,

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.560
not gonna list them all off

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.240
because there's just so many of them,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.450
but many, many positive things happen

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.630
when you are getting the
cortisol early in the day

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.400
far away from your melatonin pulse.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.090
Okay, so how long should you be outside?

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.300
Well, this is gonna vary tremendously

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.870
because some people live in environments

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:44.710
where it's very bright,

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.560
so let's say it's Colorado
in the middle of winter,

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.327
there's a snowfield,
there's no cloud cover,

00:30:50.327 --> 00:30:52.030
and you walk outside,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.230
there's going to be so
much photon light energy

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.700
arriving on your retina

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.860
that it probably only
takes 30 to 60 seconds

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.480
to trigger the central clock

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.120
and set your cortisol and
melatonin rhythms properly

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.163
and get everything lined up nicely,

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.000
whereas if you're in Scandinavia
in the depths of winter

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.977
and you wake up at 5:00 a.m.

00:31:10.977 --> 00:31:13.770
and the sun is just barely
creeping across the horizon

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.210
and then goes back down
again a few hours later,

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.930
you probably are not
getting enough sunlight

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.270
in order to set these rhythms,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.540
so many people find that they need to use

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.070
sunlight simulators in the
form of particular lights

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.840
that were designed to simulate sunlight,

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.090
however, and I'm not out to attack

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.900
the companies that produce those,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.793
there's another solution to that,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.100
you can simply go outside for longer,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.270
even if there's a lot
of dense cloud cover,

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:47.270
you're probably getting anywhere
from 10,000 to 50,000 lux,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.520
L-U-X, which is just a
measure of light energy,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.163
and that should be sufficient
to set the circadian clock.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.377
You could say, "Well, the
lights in my house or my phone

00:31:58.377 --> 00:31:59.887
"are really, really bright, right?

00:31:59.887 --> 00:32:01.657
"Everyone's telling us to
stay off our phones at night

00:32:01.657 --> 00:32:03.290
"because they're really bright,"

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:06.370
but guess what, it turns
out that early in the day,

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.270
your retina is not very sensitive,

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.160
which means you need a lot of photons,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.570
ideally coming from sunlight,

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.320
to set these clock mechanisms,

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.600
so looking at your phone or
artificial lights is fine

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.890
if you wake up before sunrise,

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.200
but it's not going to work to
set these clock mechanisms,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.700
and this is supported by
dozens, if not hundreds,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.140
of quality peer-reviewed studies,

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.710
so you wanna use sunlight,

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.850
if you can't see sunlight
because of your environment,

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.150
then you are going to have
to opt for artificial light,

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.680
and in that case, you're going
to want an artificial light

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.090
that either simulates sunlight
or has a lot of blue light.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.830
Now, without going off course here,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.857
you might be saying,

00:32:46.857 --> 00:32:48.930
"Wait, I've heard blue
light is bad for me."

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.850
Actually, blue light is
great for this mechanism

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.763
during the day,

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.070
we can talk about blue
light and blue blockers,

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.160
but you really want a lot
of blue and yellow light

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.040
arriving on the retina early in the day.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.870
Let me be clear about something,

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.320
you never ever want to look at any light,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.270
sunlight or artificial light,

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.030
that is painful to look at.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.790
If you find that your eyes are watering

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.490
or you're having challenges maintaining,

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.180
you know, looking at
this thing for a while

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.180
because it's painful,

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.180
that light is too bright

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.050
and you do not wanna damage your retina,

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:24.090
so you don't wanna gaze at
the sun refusing to blink

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.110
and burn your retina, that's
actually possible to do,

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.383
you don't wanna do that.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.100
You have a proper blink reflex
installed in you since birth,

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.787
and if you feel like
something's too bright

00:33:34.787 --> 00:33:35.710
and you need to blink,

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.830
it means you need to blink,
that it's too much light,

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.870
so please don't beam your
eyes with really bright light,

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.810
but blue light,

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.460
in particular, blue light and yellow light

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.030
coming from sunlight is ideal,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.100
if you're going to get
it from artificial light

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.650
because you can't get enough sunlight,

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.180
well, then, artificial lights

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.710
that are rich in blue, blue wavelengths,

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.870
are going to be ideal for
setting this mechanism.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.447
A lot of people will say, "Oh, I should be

00:33:59.447 --> 00:34:01.270
"wearing blue blockers
throughout the day."

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:04.020
No, that's the exact wrong thing,

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.710
if you're going to use blue blockers,

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.600
we can talk about that,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.410
that should be reserved
for late in the evening

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:12.703
because light suppresses melatonin.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.900
I've been asked many times
before about this pineal gland

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.440
and there are a lot of ancient practices

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.090
that map to some of the
things that I'm saying,

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.817
and people will always say,
"Oh, I heard that sunlight

00:34:22.817 --> 00:34:24.720
"is great for the pineal."

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.410
Well, perhaps, but we have
to careful about that phrase,

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:31.180
sunlight inhibits the pineal,

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.300
it prevents it from releasing melatonin,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.210
darkness allows the pineal
to release melatonin,

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.990
so the pineal is not the gland
or the organ of sunlight,

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.900
it is the gland of darkness,

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.230
in fact, melatonin can be
thought of as a sleepiness signal

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.980
that's correlated with darkness,

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.070
so get up each morning,
try and get outside,

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.720
I know that can be challenging for people,

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.120
but anywhere from 2 to 10
minutes of sunlight exposure

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.880
is going to work well for most people,

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.740
and you wanna do this on a regular basis

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.620
and you don't have to do
it exactly at sunrise,

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.230
I realize I'm repeating myself,

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.360
but somehow, despite
barking at people about this

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.000
for a couple years now,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.430
I keep getting the same questions,

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.693
and somehow, it hasn't been sinking in,

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.860
which could be related to
some circadian disorder,

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.640
I'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in,

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.210
it's probably that I'm not being effective

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.680
in communicating the information,

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.640
but get that bright light
early in the day from sunlight,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.860
and if you can't get it from sunlight,

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.220
get it from artificial light.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.000
What kinds of artificial lights will work?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.150
Well, there are these sunrise simulators,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:37.280
but the ring lights that
people use for selfies

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.800
and this sort of thing,
for posting on Instagram,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.100
those generate a lot of blue light.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.090
If wanna get experimental about this,

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.690
there's a free app, I have
no relationship to the app,

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.840
but it's a great app called Light Meter

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.630
that you can use your phone

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.070
and you can measure the
amount of photon energy

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.000
in your environment,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.400
and it's kind of a fun experiment to do,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.640
you can go outside in the morning

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.190
and you'll see that
there's 10,000, 20,000 lux,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.100
even though it might
seem like it's kinda dim

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.740
or there's tree cover or cloud cover,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.940
you go inside and you
shine an artificial light

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.773
at your phone,

00:36:07.773 --> 00:36:09.150
press the button on Light Meter

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.990
and you'll find that it's
only 500 or 1,000 lux,

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.350
and you realize that even
though it seems really bright,

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.890
the artificial light is very condensed,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.410
whereas the outside light is
scattered in the atmosphere,

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.450
and so you can think that
you're not getting much sunlight

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.080
but you're actually
getting much more outside,

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.300
so get outside, get that
sunlight early in the day,

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.230
and try and do it on a consistent basis.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.410
If you can't do it every day

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.780
or you sleep through this
period of the early day,

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.740
low solar angle,

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.230
don't worry about it,

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.610
these systems in the body,

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.140
these hormone systems and
neurotransmitter systems

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.650
that make you awake at
certain periods of the day

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.900
and sleepy at other times

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.610
are operating by averaging

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:50.110
when you view the brightest light.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.900
Now, that can immediately tell us

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.700
that what most people
are doing is terrible,

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.550
they're waking up and they're
looking at their phone,

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.320
which isn't triggering activation
of these cells in the eye

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.030
and the central circadian clock,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.110
then a few hours later,

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.500
they might get in their car
with sunglasses and drive.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.313
Now, a note about sunglasses
and prescription lenses,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.340
absolutely never, ever,
ever compromise safety

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.000
for the sorts of things I'm talking about,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.300
so if you need to wear
sunglasses for safety reasons,

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.340
wear them,

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.190
absolutely, if you wear
prescription lenses or contacts,

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.760
wear them, they won't filter
out the wavelengths of light

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.130
that are necessary for
setting these central clocks,

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.200
so safety first, of course,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.470
if you have a retinal
degenerative disorder,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.360
retinitis pigmentosa, macular
degeneration, or glaucoma,

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.410
or those run in your family,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.700
you want to avoid excessively
bright light all the time,

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.340
you wanna be very cautious about that,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.060
you're going to wanna
get your light exposure

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.810
through seeing dimmer
light, including sunlight,

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.810
but for longer periods of time, perhaps.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.207
You might immediately ask,

00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:53.757
"What about low-vision or blind people,

00:37:53.757 --> 00:37:55.380
"how do they set these central clocks?"

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.030
Well, turns out that
low-vision and blind people,

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.300
most of them, provided
they still have eyes,

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.300
that the eyes weren't removed

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.720
because of a burn or a tumor
or something like that,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.800
still maintain these neurons
that set the circadian clock,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.310
which brings me to a
really important point,

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.760
it's not about seeing
and perceiving the sun,

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.620
this is a subconscious mechanism
by which these neurons,

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.900
which are called
melanopsin ganglion cells,

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.620
these neurons set your central clocks

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.090
by getting activated by the
particular wavelengths of light

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:29.570
that are present in the atmosphere,

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.223
even coming through cloud cover,

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.210
and you don't need to
see or perceive the sun

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.610
in order to get this mechanism to start.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.560
Now, it's such a vitally
important mechanism

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.910
because it dictates how well

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.310
and what time you will want to
fall asleep later in the day,

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.900
so for those of you that are night owls

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.157
and you insist that you're a night owl

00:38:49.157 --> 00:38:51.110
and you have the genetic polymorphism

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.110
that makes you a night owl,

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.850
you may very well have
that genetic polymorphism,

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.930
those genes that make
you want to stay up late

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.710
and wake up late,

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.400
but chances are, about half of you

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.960
that think that you're night owls

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.880
are just not getting enough
sunlight early in the day.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.410
So viewing light early in
the day, ideally sunlight,

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.530
is key for establishing
healthy sleep-wake rhythms

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.460
and for allowing you to
fall asleep easily at night.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.780
Now, it's not gonna make sure

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.690
that all that happens every single time,

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.057
but it is the foundation of proper sleep

00:39:23.057 --> 00:39:25.460
and what we call circadian health,

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.640
it governs metabolism
and so many other things

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.223
that are supposed to exist
on a regular 24-hour cycle.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.087
Some of you, many of you, might be asking,

00:39:36.087 --> 00:39:37.980
"What else can help set this rhythm?"

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.520
Well, it turns out that light

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.990
is what we call the primary
zeitgeber, the time giver,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.930
but other things can help
establish this rhythm of cortisol

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.520
followed by melatonin 12
to 16 hours later as well.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.480
The other things besides light

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.960
are timing of food intake,
timing of exercise,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.410
as well as various drugs or
chemicals that one might ingest,

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.490
not illegal drugs,

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.333
although those will impact
circadian mechanisms as well,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.560
but the reason we focus
so heavily on light

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.560
is that light is the main
way that this central clock,

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.677
the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
was supposed to be set,

00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:22.380
and we know that because
it's the only direct input

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.480
to the clock.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.590
These neurons in the eye that
are also part of the brain

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.760
that we call melanopsin ganglion cells

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.290
that, not so incidentally, were discovered

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.800
by my friend and colleague David
Berson at Brown University,

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.380
and others, Samer Hattar,
King-Wai Yau, et cetera,

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.530
worked out the mechanisms,
the molecular mechanisms,

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:41.560
but it was really David Berson

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.363
that discovered these
incredibly fascinating,

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.570
you know, these are cells that
aren't important for sight

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.500
like pattern vision,

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.980
but are for setting our clocks,

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.090
David's really credited
with making that discovery.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.640
Those cells are the main way

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.500
and the only direct way to set the clock,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.070
in fact, it's fair to say

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:06.700
that light viewed by
these melanopsin cells,

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.630
in particular, sunlight,

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:12.500
is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.070
than, say, getting up in
darkness and just exercising.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.110
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.800
exercise early in the day in darkness

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.070
if that's what you like to do,

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.370
it will have somewhat an effect

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.130
on raising your wakefulness
early in the day

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.620
and setting these rhythms,

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.500
and this is because of
some other pathways,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.820
for the aficionados out there

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.090
who wanna know more neuroscience,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.030
here's how it goes, you've got this clock

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.930
above the roof of your mouth

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.720
that churns out this 24-hour rhythm

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.630
and it's communicated
to all the other organs

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.160
and tissues of your body,

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.550
but there's another structure,

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.870
it has a cool name, it's called
the intergeniculate leaflet,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.350
which sits a few millimeters
away in the brain,

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.580
and it's involved in
regulating the clock output

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.680
through what's called non-photic,
non-light-type influences

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.470
like exercise and feeding, et cetera.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:02.420
So if you are not feeling
awake during the day

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.210
and you're having trouble sleeping,

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.170
get the sunlight exposure
that we just talked about,

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.180
but in addition to that,

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.540
if you wanna become an
early riser, for instance,

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.660
and you wanna feel more awake

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.200
during the early part of the day,

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.500
by getting that light exposure

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.000
and exercising early in the day,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.250
you will, after two or three days,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.690
you will naturally start to
wake up earlier in the day,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.130
and that's because these
clock mechanisms have shifted,

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.860
it's like setting the clock earlier

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.280
as opposed to delaying the clock,

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.530
and that takes us to a
somewhat complicated,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.810
but very important, aspect to all this,

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.400
which is, what sets the
clock and keeps it anchored?

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.570
The main thing is that bright
light early in the day,

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.500
the other thing is sunset,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.680
when the sun is also at low solar angle,

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.333
low, close to the horizon,

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.520
by viewing sunlight at that
time of day in the evening,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.410
or afternoon, depending
on what time of year it is

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.340
and where you are in the world,

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.800
these melanopsin cells,
these neurons in your eye,

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.970
signal the central circadian clock

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.090
that it's the end of the day,

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.510
and there's a really nice study

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.940
that was published last year,

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.770
and I will put links to
these references on a website

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:11.860
not too long from now,

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.780
there was a really nice study that showed

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.910
that viewing sunlight around
the time of the sunset,

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.320
doesn't have to be just
crossing the horizon,

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.470
but circa sunset,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.273
within an hour or so of sunset,

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.930
prevents some of the bad effects of light

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.860
in preventing melatonin
release later that same night,

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.800
so let me repeat this,

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.330
viewing light early in the day is key,

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.260
viewing light later in the day

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.270
when the sun is setting,
or around that time,

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:45.290
can help protect these
mechanisms, your brain and body,

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.820
against the negative effects
of light later in the day,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.290
so let me talk about you would do that,

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.650
you'd go view the sunset

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.920
or you would go outside in
the late afternoon or evening,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.410
again, if you safely can do that

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.410
with sunglasses off, you will,

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.650
if you need to wear sunglasses, fine,

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.810
but it will take probably
100 to 1,000 times longer

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.160
with dark sunglasses than
if you take them off,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.680
again, if you wanna do this
through a window at work,

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.080
that's fine, but it'll
take 50 times longer,

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.040
so the best thing to do is

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.020
just to get outside for a few minutes,

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.780
anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes,
also in the afternoon.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.140
Having those two signals
arriving to your central clock

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.560
that your body, your internal world,

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.770
knows when it's morning and
knows when it's evening,

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.020
is tremendously powerful.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.030
Maybe think about it this way,

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.090
every cell in your body
needs glucose and energy,

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.230
it needs, whether or not
it gets that from meats

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.760
or it gets it from ketones or
it gets it from carbohydrates

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.510
or fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter,

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.330
it is eventually converted
into a certain form of energy

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:43.990
that all your cells use,

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.760
but you don't take glucose,

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.070
you don't take bread or
a steak or a nice orange

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.350
and shove it in your ear,

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:51.300
you put it in your mouth,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.150
it goes into your stomach, it's digested,

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.700
and then that resource is distributed

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.530
to all the cells of your body.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.910
Every cell in your body needs oxygen,

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.650
and you don't put a hose

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.100
you know, through your
nostril or through your ear

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.190
or through some other
orifice in your body,

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:10.260
you inhale air and it's then
distributed via the lungs

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.350
to the cells in your blood stream,

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.380
and then it's distributed to
all the organs of your body.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.460
Every cell and organ in your
body needs light information,

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.300
and the way to get that light information

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.200
to all those cells,

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.510
because you have a thick skull

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.230
and the inside of you is
dark inside your skin,

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.810
there's no sunlight getting in there,

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.760
is by viewing sunlight with your eyes

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.550
at the two times of day
that I'm referring to, okay?

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.420
That's the only route.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.050
There was a study published in "Science,"

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.930
an excellent journal,

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.230
well over 10 years ago,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.240
that showed that light shone
on the back of the knee

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.180
could set these circadian rhythms,

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.670
that study was retracted,

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.120
and unfortunately, most people don't know

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.410
that it was retracted,

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.990
there were some experimental flaws,

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.450
that people were actually viewing light

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:57.510
through their eyes.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:58.740
That study was repeated,

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.250
turns out, there is no

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.450
extraocular photo reception in humans.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.690
Whatever somebody tells you

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:07.470
that light to the skin
or light to the wherever

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:09.500
is beneficial for your health,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.700
we can talk about that,

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.760
but there's no way that light information

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.720
is setting your clocks,

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.930
you need these cells in your eyes

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.740
to perceive or to see light

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.060
at the particular times of
day that I'm referring to.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.100
Some animals, like snakes
and other reptiles,

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.760
actually have a hole in
the top of their skull

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.510
to get light information
directly to their pineal

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.940
to suppress melatonin.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.000
We don't have that hole,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.160
I mean, most of you don't
have holes in your skull.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.720
These holes in your skull

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.340
that we call the sockets for the eyes

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.380
are actually there primarily
to allow light information

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.650
to this central clock,

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.710
and then vision and pattern
vision and color vision

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.580
came much later in evolution,

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.360
we know this on the
basis of genetic studies

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.120
we get to discuss in a future podcast.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.930
So get that light information

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.060
to the cells of your brain and body

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.450
by viewing sunlight at
the two times of day

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.433
that I referred to.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.617
There's always a lot of questions about,

00:47:05.617 --> 00:47:07.880
"How long, how much, how do
I know if I've had enough?"

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.900
You'll know because your rhythm

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.200
will start to fall into
some degree of normalcy,

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.080
you'll start to wake up

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.710
at more or less the same time each day,

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.370
you'll fall asleep more easily at night,

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.070
generally, it takes
about two or three days

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:20.760
for these systems to align,

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.990
so if you've not been
doing these behaviors,

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.230
it's gonna take a few days,

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.330
but they can have tremendous benefits,

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.550
and sometimes rather quickly,

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.320
on a number of different
mental and physical aspects

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.153
of your health.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:35.830
Now let's talk about
the bad effects of light

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.340
because light is not supposed
to arrive in our system

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.560
at any time,

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.490
and nowadays, because of
screens and artificial light,

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:48.580
we have access to light
at times of day and night

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.610
that normally we wouldn't.

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.290
Now, earlier I said that
you need a lot of light,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.123
in particular, sunlight,

00:47:54.123 --> 00:47:56.290
to set these clock mechanisms,

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.110
that's true, but there's a
kind of diabolical feature

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.230
to the way all of this works,

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.943
which is the longer you've been awake,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.070
the more sensitive your retina
and these cells are to light,

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.830
so that if you've been
awake for 10, 12, 14 hours,

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.760
it becomes very easy for
even a small amount of light

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.490
coming from a screen or
from an overhead light

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.800
to trigger the activation of the clock

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.660
and make you feel like
you wanna stay up later,

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.920
make it harder to fall asleep,

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.350
and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.620
So the simple way to think about this is

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.280
you want as much light
as is safely possible

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.640
early in the day, morning
and throughout the day,

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.840
including blue light,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.860
so take those blue
blockers off during the day

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.870
unless you have a real issue
with screen light sensitivity,

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:43.860
and you want as little
light coming into your eyes,

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.920
artificial or sunlight,

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.610
after, say, 8:00 p.m.,

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.690
and certainly, you do not want to get

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.980
bright light exposure to your eyes

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.080
between 11:00 p.m. and
4:00 a.m., and here's why,

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.160
David Berson, who I mentioned before,

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.320
and another and friend and
colleague, Samer Hattar,

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.050
who's director of the chronobiology unit

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.240
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.790
published a paper in
"Cell," which is a journal,

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.950
another excellent journal,
very high stringency,

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:12.950
showing that light that
arrives to the eyes

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.880
between 11:00 p.m. and
4:00 a.m., approximately,

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.340
suppresses the release of dopamine,

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.250
this neuromodulator
that makes us feel good,

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.550
and it's sort of an
endogenous antidepressant,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.040
and can inhibit learning

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.630
and create all sorts of
other detrimental effects,

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.310
it does this through a mechanism,

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.480
for those of you that wanna
know the neural pathways,

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.900
that involves light to the eyes

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.856
that's then signaled to a
structure called the habenula,

00:49:38.856 --> 00:49:40.640
the habenula looks like
two little bat ears

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.530
sitting right in the middle
of a structure in your brain

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:43.550
called the thalamus,

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:44.650
don't worry about these names

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:45.720
if you're not interested in this stuff,

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.440
if you are, these are
just avenues to explore,

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.360
when that habenula gets activated

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.130
it's actually called the
disappointment nucleus

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.090
because it actually
makes us feel less happy

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.190
and more disappointed,

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.700
and can lead to certain
forms of depression

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.180
in the wakeful state.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.460
Now, if you wake up in
the middle of the night

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.460
and you need to use the bathroom

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:05.770
or you're on an all-night flight

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:10.323
and you're, you know, need to
read or whatever it is, fine,

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.340
every once in a while,
it's not gonna be a problem

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.420
to get bright light exposure to your eyes

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.860
in the middle of the night,

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.530
but if you think about
our lifestyle nowadays

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.140
and being up late looking at phones,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.820
even if you dim that screen,

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.700
you're triggering this activation

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.160
because your retinal sensitivity

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.310
and the sensitivity of
these neurons has gone up

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.720
late in the day.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.750
Now, I'm not here to dictate

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.080
what you should or shouldn't do,

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.080
but for those of you that are

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.300
experiencing challenges with mood,

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.580
those of you that have anxiety,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.210
learning problems, issues focusing,

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.350
the questions I usually get
are, "How can I focus better?"

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.080
Well, we will get to that,

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.340
but one of the best ways you can support

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.980
your mechanisms for good
mood, mental health,

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.800
learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:55.670
is to take control of this
light exposure behavior at night

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.780
and not get much or any
bright light exposure

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.950
in the middle of the night.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.610
Red light won't trigger this pathway,

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:05.230
but very few people have
the kind of infrared lights

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:06.957
that are set up, or floor lights,

00:51:06.957 --> 00:51:09.170
and that brings me to an important point,

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.690
which is about the location of light,

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.600
this hasn't been discussed
much out there, I don't think,

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.410
these cells in our eye,

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.250
these neurons that
signal the central clock,

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.100
reside mostly, not
exclusively, but mostly,

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.180
in the bottom half of our retina,

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.800
and because we have a lens
in front of our retina,

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.870
and because of the optics of lenses,

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:29.630
that means that these cells

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:32.000
are actually viewing
our upper visual field,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.520
there's an inversion of the
visual image, et cetera,

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.170
you can look that up
if you wanna learn more

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:38.510
about retinal optics, it's fascinating,

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:40.620
but not the topic for today.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.950
These cells are in the bottom
half of your retina mostly,

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:47.950
and so they're viewing the
overhead visual space around you.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.440
This is probably not
coincidental that these cells

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.970
were essentially designed
to detect sunlight,

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.120
which is overhead, of course,

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.630
so if you want to avoid

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:05.660
improper activation of these neurons,

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.970
it's better to place lights
that you use in the evening

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:10.830
low in your physical environment,

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:15.640
so on desktops or even the
floor, if you wanna go that way,

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.980
as opposed to overhead lights,

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.950
so overhead florescent
lights would be the worst,

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.340
that would be the worst case scenario,

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.790
lights that are overhead
that are a little bit softer,

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.040
of the sort or yellow or reddish tints,

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.090
would be slightly better,

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.710
but dim lights that
are set low in the room

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.730
are going to be best

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.230
because they aren't going
to activate these neurons

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.160
and therefore shift your circadian clock,

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.570
so that's a goal.

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:43.610
Some people, like Samer Hattar
that I mentioned earlier,

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:46.700
he turns his home basically
into a cave in the evenings.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.120
Candlelight actually does not

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.690
trigger activation of these cells,

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:55.690
so candlelight and fireplaces
and campfires are fine,

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.300
dim lights, very dim lights are fine,

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.050
and lights low in the
physical environment,

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:02.720
of course, the problem with
candlelight and fireplaces

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.650
is the fire hazard,

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:06.713
but you're smart people, you
know what to do about that.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.850
Don't burn down whatever
structure you're in,

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.260
including forests, please.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.880
So, keep the lights low
in in your environment.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.010
What if you wake up in
the middle of the night

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:22.733
and you find yourself watching
TV or on the computer?

00:53:23.731 --> 00:53:25.800
Well, in that case, you might
wanna wear blue blockers,

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.110
and you certainly would
wanna dim the screen,

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.630
but ideally, you're not doing that,

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.660
it's remarkable the positive effects

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.630
of getting that bit of
sunlight early in the day,

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:36.220
maybe even also around sunset,

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.090
and avoiding bright lights,

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:40.560
and especially overhead bright lights,

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.730
between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:44.470
Now, I'm not talking about shift work,

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:46.070
I'm realizing that we're probably

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:47.740
gonna have to have an entire discussion

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.410
devoted just to shift workers

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.830
because there's some
good information there

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.740
about how they can protect themselves

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.340
against some of the very bad
health effects of shift work,

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.830
of getting light in the
middle of the night,

00:53:57.830 --> 00:53:59.210
but we rely on shift workers

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.440
and they're super important to culture

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.470
and society and the economy,

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:05.050
so I wanna acknowledge them

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:08.010
and let you know that
we will do a discussion

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:11.060
about shift work and jet lag,

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.350
but let's talk about what light can do

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:17.580
in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.240
So the way to think
about this whole system,

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.980
again, is you've got adenosine building up

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.090
depending on how long you've been awake

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.150
and it's making you sleepy,

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:26.820
and then you've got the
circadian mechanisms

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.490
that are timing your wakefulness

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:30.090
and timing when you wanna be asleep,

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:32.400
mainly through cortisol and melatonin,

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.470
but there are a bunch of other things

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.560
that are downstream of
cortisol and melatonin,

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.080
like, we tend to be hungrier
during our wakeful period

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.030
than late at night,

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:42.800
some people like to eat late at night,

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.390
but if you're finding that you

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:46.820
can't become a day person
or a morning person,

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.010
shifting your light exposure, exercise,

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.950
and food intake to the daytime will help.

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.750
Some people like to stop
eating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m.

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:58.930
because of metabolic reasons

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:01.340
or they're trying to maintain
their weight or lose weight,

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.690
that's actually not supported
so well by the literature,

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:07.510
the literature around
nutrition essentially says

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:09.880
that it's best to restrict your feeding

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.120
to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.180
to not be eating around the clock,

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:17.130
and whether or not that's 4
hours or 8 hours or 16 hours

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.610
is a much lengthier discussion
than we have time for now,

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.557
I would refer you to Satchin Panda's book,

00:55:23.557 --> 00:55:25.610
"The Circadian Code,"
which talks all about that,

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:27.370
he's an expert, a former colleague of mine

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:29.740
from the Salk Institute in San Diego,

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:33.360
you can explore intermittent
and circadian fasting,

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.580
so to speak, through Satchin's literature,

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.413
we'll talk about that,

00:55:36.413 --> 00:55:38.450
we might even get Satchin
in here if we're lucky

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:39.860
at some point in the future,

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:43.370
but you can actually use
light to wake up earlier.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:46.440
Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues
did a beautiful study

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.440
showing that, if you turn on
the lights before waking up,

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.850
so around 45 minutes to
an hour before waking up,

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.400
even if your eyelids are closed,

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.683
provided you're not under the covers,

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.760
after doing that for a few days,

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.450
that increases your total sleep time

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:07.420
and shifts forward the time
at which you feel sleepy,

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.730
it makes you want to go
to bed earlier each night.

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:13.210
Now, in a kind of diabolical way,

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.530
they did this with teenagers

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.780
who are notorious for
wanting to wake up late

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.613
and stay up late,

00:56:17.613 --> 00:56:18.770
and what they found was

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:20.820
bright light flashes,
just turning on the lights

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.170
in their environment, overhead lights,

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.090
because they're trying
to activate this system

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.530
and that's why they're
using overhead lights,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.140
even through the eyelids,
before these kids woke up,

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.690
then made those kids naturally
wanna go to bed earlier

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:34.220
and they ended up sleeping longer,

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.230
so that's something you could try,

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.610
you could put your lights on a timer

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.020
to go on early in the
day before you wake up,

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.440
you could open your blinds

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.280
so that sunlight is coming through,

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.590
and again, if you curl
up under the covers,

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:49.320
then it's not gonna reach these neurons,

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.560
but it's remarkable that light

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.250
can actually penetrate the eyelids,

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:55.470
activate these neurons, and
go to the central clock.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.960
That study illustrates a
really important principle

00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.940
of how you're built,

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.090
which is, you have the capacity

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:05.050
for what are called phase
advances and phase delays,

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:07.190
and I don't wanna
complicate this too much,

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.640
so the simplest way to think about

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.090
phase advances and phase delays

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:15.337
is that if you see light late in the day,

00:57:15.337 --> 00:57:17.910
and in particular, in
the middle of the night,

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:22.340
your brain and body, for
reasons that now you understand,

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.430
will think that that's morning light

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:25.570
even though it's not sunlight

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.150
because you have this
heightened sensitivity,

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:29.910
and it will phase delay,
it will delay your clock,

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:32.050
it will essentially make
you want to get up later

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.780
and go to sleep later,

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.550
so if you get light exposure
too late in the evening

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:37.940
or in the middle of the night,

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.280
it's going to make it hard

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.540
to want to wake up that next morning early

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:42.843
and to go to bed early.

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:49.370
The opposite is also true,
if you wake up early,

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:54.340
say, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.,
and get light exposure,

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.300
or even earlier, 4:00 a.m.,
and get light exposure,

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.100
it will phase-advance your clock, okay?

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.620
It's gonna make your
clock think it's earlier

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.400
and you'll wanna wake up earlier,

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.730
so the simple way to think about this

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.870
is if you're having
trouble waking up early

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.690
and feeling alert early in the day,

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:14.300
you're going to wanna try
and get bright light exposure

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.070
even before waking up because
it will advance your clock,

00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:20.220
it's sort of like turning
the clock forward,

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.730
whereas if you are having
trouble waking up early,

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:24.860
you definitely don't want to get

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.110
too much light exposure
or any light exposure

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:29.410
to your eyes late in the evening

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:30.260
and in the middle of the night

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.160
because it's just gonna delay
your clock more and more,

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.460
so rather than get into the specifics

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.720
of everybody's situation

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.070
because there are many of you out there

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:39.220
with different situations

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:42.390
and lifestyle requirements, et cetera,

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:44.000
the way to think about this

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.270
is that you have these internal mechanisms

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:47.990
of adenosine and circadian clocks,

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:49.600
and they're always operating,

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.450
and what you're trying to
do is provide them anchors,

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:55.910
you're trying to provide them
consistent, powerful anchors

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:59.280
so that your cortisol, your melatonin,

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.450
and then everything that
cascades down from that,

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:05.170
like your metabolism and
your ability to learn

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:08.260
and your sense of alertness,
your dopamine, your serotonin,

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.620
all that stuff is timed regularly,

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:16.620
one of the reasons why there's
so much challenge out there

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.000
with focus and anxiety and depression,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.310
there are a lot of reasons for that,

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:25.420
but one of the reasons is that
people's internal mechanisms

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.680
aren't anchored to anything regular.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.670
Now, this doesn't require
being neurotically attached

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:33.180
to getting up at a very
specific time, going outside,

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.270
viewing the sunlight at
the same time every day,

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:36.810
these systems, again, will average,

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:39.910
but if you can provide them
consistent light anchors

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.790
early in the day and in the evening,

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:43.370
and avoiding light at night,

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:45.740
you will be amazed at
the tremendous number

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:48.030
of positive effects
that can come from that

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.000
at the level of metabolic
factors, hormones,

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.460
and just general feelings of wellbeing,

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.330
in fact, most of us are familiar

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.380
with what it is to not sleep well

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.000
and all the terrible effects that has,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.370
maybe one night you're
fine, two nights even,

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:06.150
for the new parents out
there, I sympathize with you,

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:09.570
but most people are not
familiar with what it is

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:13.420
to sleep really, really
well on a consistent basis,

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.180
and when you start doing that

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.040
by controlling your
sleep environment, right,

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.830
get the proper sleep surface,
get the proper pillow,

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.840
get the temperature in the room right,

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.800
get your light exposure right,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.750
start timing your exercise
at normal periods or times

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.820
throughout the day and week,

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.370
it's amazing how many
other biological systems

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.120
just naturally fall in line,

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.847
and this is why whenever people ask me,

01:00:35.847 --> 01:00:36.800
"What should I take?"

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.427
which is one of the most
common questions I get,

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:39.477
"What supplement should I take?

01:00:39.477 --> 01:00:40.647
"What drug should I be taking?

01:00:40.647 --> 01:00:42.320
"What things should I be taking?"

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.320
The first question I always ask
them is, "How's your sleep?"

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.610
and 90% of the time, they tell me

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.810
they either have trouble
falling asleep or staying asleep

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.420
or they don't feel rested
throughout the day.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.640
A brief note about naps,

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.640
naps, provided that they're
less than one ultradian cycle,

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.580
provided they're 20 minutes
or 30 minutes or even an hour,

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.650
can be very beneficial
for a lot of people,

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.290
you don't have to take them,

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.580
but many people naturally feel a dip

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.660
in energy and focus late in the afternoon,

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.800
in fact, if we were gonna
look at wakefulness,

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.040
what we would find is that you get

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.480
that morning light exposure, hopefully,

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.550
your cortisol goes up, people
will start feeling awake,

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:19.880
and then around two, or three,
or four in the afternoon,

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.400
there's a spike in everything

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.890
from alertness to ability to learn,

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.460
some metabolic factors drop,

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.590
and then it just naturally comes back up,

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.240
and then it tapers off
as the night goes on.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.760
So for some of you, naps are great,

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.350
I love taking naps,

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:38.450
some people, they wake up from
naps feeling really groggy,

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:40.350
that's probably because
they're not sleeping

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:42.540
as well as they should at night

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.740
or as long as they should at night,

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.380
and so they're dropping into REM sleep

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.060
or deeper forms of sleep in the day time,

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.290
and then they wake up and
they feel kind of disoriented,

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.900
other people feel great after a nap,

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.360
so that's another case where,
just like with caffeine,

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.010
so sort of have to evaluate for yourself.

01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:59.610
As we discuss this,
you're probably realizing

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:02.700
this is a lot like nutrition
where nowadays it's just crazy,

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.240
I mean, if you go on social media,

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.370
it's like you've got people
who are pushing carnivore,

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.310
you've got other people
who are pushing vegan,

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:11.070
other people who are pushing paleo,

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:13.030
every variation of every diet,

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.910
and there's a lot of data to support

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:17.340
any and all of those and
the arguments go on and on,

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.500
and there's probably a
lot of genetic variation

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.000
and lifestyle variation

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.410
that's going to dictate whether or not

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:24.270
something is good for you,
whether or not you like it,

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.050
whether or not you'll stick to it.

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:29.840
The same thing is true for circadian

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.680
and sleep and wakefulness behaviors,

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.390
except the light-viewing behavior

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:36.370
that I talked about before,
there's no way around that,

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:37.870
that's hardwired into our system,

01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:41.230
the same way we could factually say

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:43.760
that everybody needs some nutrition

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.580
at some level from some source,

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.500
everybody needs light information

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.700
arriving in their system in
some way at regular intervals,

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.080
so that's really what this is about.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.000
Okay, so naps are gonna
be good for some people,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.833
not for others,

01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:59.280
I have a colleague, a very
accomplished neuroscientist,

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.830
who likes to take naps just after lunch,

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:06.130
I personally like to take a
nap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.,

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.390
but there's a practice

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:09.820
that I've adopted in the last 5 years

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.370
that I've found to be immensely beneficial

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:15.340
that is sort of like
napping but isn't napping,

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.740
it's a thing that they call yoga nidra,

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.010
yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep,

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:23.800
and it's a sort of meditation
that you listen to,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.810
there are number of scripts,

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:26.450
I've talked about this on podcasts before

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:29.710
but I'm going to post a link
to the two that I like most,

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:33.620
that allows you to consciously

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.290
bring your entire body and mind

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:38.140
into a state of deep relaxation,

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.210
and sometimes you fall asleep
and sometimes you don't,

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:46.160
this is done for 10 to 30 or
even 60 minutes at a time.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.280
The other thing that works
really well is meditation,

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.150
so I'm talking about naps,

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:52.700
but I'm also talking about yoga nidra,

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.510
which is sort of a form of meditation,

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.490
and then more standard
forms of meditation,

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.170
all three of those do something powerful

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.240
which is that they bring our mind

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.060
into a state of less so-called

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.030
sympathetic nervous system activation,

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.720
go back and listen to episode one

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.880
if that doesn't make any sense,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.620
which is what governs your alertness,

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.480
and instead, it activates
cells and circuits in your body

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.970
that promote the
parasympathetic nervous system,

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.710
or the calming system.

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:20.920
A lot of people are
not good falling asleep

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.830
because they're not good at calming down,

01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:26.200
so some people have no
trouble falling asleep,

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.620
but many people have a
hard time falling asleep,

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.310
or at least every once in a while

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:32.310
experience challenges falling asleep.

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:35.080
I don't have problems
falling asleep most nights,

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.130
but I've noticed that
if I'm working very hard

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.040
or if the world is particularly stressful,

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.410
my mind gets into a bit
of a kind of OCD loop

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.850
where I tend to ruminate on things,

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.513
and I'm not even thinking
about anything in particular,

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:48.240
it's just challenging for me
to disengage and fall asleep.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.630
Meditation and yoga nidra scripts

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:52.580
have been immensely helpful for me

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.920
in terms of accelerating
the transition to sleep,

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.770
so they involve taking a few minutes,

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.070
10 to 30 minutes or so,

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:01.510
just like you would for a nap,

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.540
and just listening to a
script, almost passively,

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.730
and it has you do some
particular patterns of breathing

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.620
and some other kind of
body-scan-like things

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.150
that can really help
people learn to relax,

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:14.680
not just in that moment,

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.520
but get better at relaxing
and turning off thinking

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.720
in order to fall asleep when
they wanna do that at night.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.360
There's another thing
that's similar to this,

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.040
which is certain forms
of hypnosis for sleep,

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.870
for that, I'll just
refer you to the website

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.960
of a colleague and collaborator of mine,

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.270
David Spiegel, who's our associate chair

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:35.580
of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences at Stanford,

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.150
he's developed a website,

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:41.870
which is reverie,
R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com,

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.620
so reveriehealth.com,

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.310
that has a lot of science-supported,

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:49.380
clinically supported hypnosis scripts

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.730
that essentially take the brain

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:53.150
into states of deep relaxation

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.870
for the sake of rewiring the
brain and neuroplasticity,

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.430
but one of those scripts that's there

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:59.930
and is available free is for sleep,

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.970
and we'll talk more about
hypnosis at a later time

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.320
because it has a ton of other effects

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.223
that aren't just limited to sleep.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.370
So a period of time each day

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:10.990
that you devote to getting better

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.450
at falling and staying asleep

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:15.130
is actually a really
good practice to adopt.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.600
The other thing about these practices

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.800
like meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis,

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.167
is people would always say to me,

01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:22.210
"Well, when should I do them?"

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:24.077
and I always say, "Well, the
best time of day to do it

01:06:24.077 --> 01:06:26.027
"is when you first wake up in the morning,

01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:28.407
"provided you've gotten
your sunlight already,

01:06:28.407 --> 01:06:30.017
"anytime you wake up in
the middle of the night,

01:06:30.017 --> 01:06:30.960
"or any time of day."

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.890
In other words, they're
always good for you

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:34.510
because it's a training mechanism

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:36.770
by which you self-train
your nervous system

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:39.310
to go from a state of heightened alertness

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:40.270
that you don't want

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.450
to heightened relaxation that you do want,

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.330
and so it's really teaching
you to hit the brake,

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:48.990
and that brings us to an even
more important point, perhaps,

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:51.550
which is, we've all experienced

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:54.420
that we can stay up if we want to, right?

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.920
If we wanna stay up late on New Year's

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.280
or we wanna push an all-nighter,

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.830
some people can do that
more easily than others,

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:03.380
but we're all capable of doing that,

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.900
but it's very hard to make
ourselves fall asleep,

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.720
and so there's a sort of asymmetry

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.660
to the way our autonomic nervous system,

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.860
which governs this
alertness-calmness thing,

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.350
the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system,

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:15.610
there's an asymmetry there

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.500
where we are more easily
able to engage wakefulness

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.520
and drive wakefulness,

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.710
we can force ourselves to stay awake,

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:26.370
than we are able to force
ourselves to fall asleep,

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.350
and one of the things that
I say over and over again,

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:31.520
and I'm gonna continue to
say over and over again,

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.480
is it's very hard to control
the mind with the mind,

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.300
when you have trouble falling asleep,

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.280
you need to look to some
mechanism that involves the body,

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.670
and all the things I described,

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:43.490
meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra,

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.760
all involve exhale-emphasized breathing,

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.780
certain ways of lying down
and controlling the body,

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:52.060
we're gonna get into
breathing in real depth

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.110
at another time,

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.620
but all of those involve using
the body to control the mind

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.960
rather than trying to, you know,

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.640
wrestle your mind into a
certain pattern of relaxation,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.640
so earlier in episode one, I
talked about the Mobius strip,

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.240
this continuous loop that is
the brain-body relationship,

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.050
or the mind-body relationship,

01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:15.150
and when we're having
trouble controlling the mind,

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.660
I encourage people to
look towards the body,

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.020
look toward sunlight,

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.760
avoid sunlight and bright light

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.620
if that happens to be late at night,

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.800
so there's a theme
that's starting to emerge

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.170
which is, in order to control this thing

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.550
that we call the nervous system,

01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:29.000
we have to look back to

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.660
some of the things we discussed earlier,

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:33.000
like sensation, perception, et cetera,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.170
but we have to ask, what can we control?

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:37.800
Well, I'm talking about
controlling light exposure,

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.040
controlling your breathing and body,

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.500
I'm not going into details right now

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.170
but you can see the yoga nidra script

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.200
or the reveriehealth.com,

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.930
or Headspace would be a great place

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:49.440
to adopt a meditation practice,

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.050
any of those are really teaching you

01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:53.320
to use your body to control your mind,

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.210
and to allow you to explore
the mind-body relationship

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.480
in a way that gives you more control

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.360
over your mind and the
mind-body relationship, okay?

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.650
So we talked about light,

01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:06.980
we talked about activity
and timing of light,

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.200
we talked about the usefulness of naps,

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.420
and these things that I'm
calling non-sleep deep rest,

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:16.880
which include meditation,
yoga nidra, and hypnosis,

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.680
non-sleep deep rest,

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.170
or what I, hereafter, we
will refer to as NSDR,

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:25.010
not to be confused with EMDR,

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:26.730
I don't think I've ever heard NSDR,

01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:31.730
so I'm planting a flag for
NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.330
as a way to reset one's
ability to be awake

01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:38.130
after you emerge from NSDR,

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:40.620
so to get some more wakefulness
and ability to attend,

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.560
some emotional stability, reset,

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.680
as well as make it better
and easier to fall asleep

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.490
when you wanna go to sleep at night.

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:51.030
Now, the non-sleep deep rest

01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:53.180
does have some research to support it,

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.970
there's a beautiful study done

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:56.970
out of a university in Denmark,

01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:59.700
I will later provide a link to that study,

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.410
that showed that this meditation

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:05.250
and yoga nidra-type meditation

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:08.140
allows dopamine and other neuromodulators

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.790
in an area of the brain
called the striatum

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:13.040
that's involved in motor
planning and motor execution,

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.410
to reset itself,

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.890
in other words, this NSDR
can reset our ability

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:21.580
to engage in the world in a
way that's very deliberate,

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.990
and not to throw in another acronym,

01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:26.240
but NSDR resets your
ability to engage in DPOs,

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.850
duration, path, and outcome,

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:29.397
so now you're probably
rolling your eyes like,

01:10:29.397 --> 01:10:30.940
"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,"

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:35.940
but just bear with me
because NSDR is so powerful,

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:39.290
because first of all, it doesn't require

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:41.380
that you rig yourself to any device,

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.450
it doesn't require that you
take much time out of your day,

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:47.830
it doesn't require that you
ingest anything, except air,

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:51.280
and it can have so many positive effects

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.450
right down to the neuromodulator level,

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:54.910
so I think in the years to come,

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.270
my lab's exploring this

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.460
in a collaboration with
David Spiegel's lab,

01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.713
but other labs are
looking at this as well,

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:04.080
I think NSDR is going to start
to play a more prominent role

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.150
in what we call wellness and health,

01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:07.570
both mental health and physical health,

01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:09.960
so I encourage you to
explore those practices.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.410
Okay, so what about things that we can

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:14.370
and maybe should or should not take

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.640
in order to control
and access better sleep

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.900
and better wakefulness?

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.870
We've talked about things
you can do or not do,

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:26.290
we've talked about nutrition
and the timing of nutrition,

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:27.700
now let's talk about compounds,

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.130
those could be prescription drugs,

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:30.860
those could be supplements,

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.920
there are a number of different things

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.100
that will affect your
circadian timing and behavior,

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.480
in fact, almost everything
that you could take

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.060
will affect your circadian
timing and behavior,

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:44.893
that's right.

01:11:44.893 --> 01:11:47.510
So years ago when I
was in graduate school,

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:49.490
I had a professor, unfortunately,
he passed away now,

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:52.170
but his name was Ted Jones,
the late Edward Jones,

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.940
who was a world-class neuroanatomist,

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.170
he wrote the book on the thalamus,

01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.640
in fact, it's called "The Thalamus,"

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.470
and an expert on patterns
of activation in the brain

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:01.520
during sleep,

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.020
and I'll never forget that
during one of these lectures,

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.237
someone asked Ted the question,

01:12:06.237 --> 01:12:08.247
"What is the effect of some drug

01:12:08.247 --> 01:12:11.340
"on these waves of activity in
the thalamus?" or something,

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.430
and his answer was incredible.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.440
Now, he was a pretty gruff guy,

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.230
and so his answer was delivered

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:19.510
in the form of a kind of
aggressive direct statement,

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:22.407
he said, "A drug is a substance

01:12:22.407 --> 01:12:24.407
"that when injected into a person,

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:26.960
"produces a scientific publication,"

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.840
and what he was saying
is actually quite true,

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.890
which is that most every compound

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:36.210
will have some effect on
some aspect of biology,

01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:37.043
this is why it's hard

01:12:37.043 --> 01:12:38.640
to sort through everything
that's on PubMed,

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.550
if you put any molecule or
compound or drug into PubMed

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:47.160
and then you put sleep next to
it, or alertness next to it,

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.940
you're likely to find a paper
where there's an effect,

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.410
but that's not necessarily telling you

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.850
that that drug is helpful for that,

01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:56.870
what it's telling you is

01:12:56.870 --> 01:13:00.560
that anytime you change what you take

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.740
or you stop taking something,

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.270
say you're taking sleeping
pills, Ambien or whatever it is,

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:06.250
and you stop taking them,

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.780
your sleep behavior will change.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.707
Let's stay you take an aspirin

01:13:09.707 --> 01:13:11.160
and you don't normally take aspirin,

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.320
you will shift your circadian rhythm,

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.240
now you might not shift it perceptibly,

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.140
you might not create
problems for yourself,

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:20.850
but anytime you ingest a
compound at high potency,

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:24.140
you're going to provide some
shift to your circadian rhythm.

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.020
Now, that said, there are a couple things

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.240
that are directly in line with the biology

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.950
related to falling and staying asleep

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:32.950
and directly in line with
the biology of wakefulness,

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.790
there's a whole category of things,

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.800
like stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine,

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.640
and prescription stimulants, that are,

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.100
the prescription ones were designed

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.490
for the treatment of narcolepsy,

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:46.770
so things like modafinil or armodafinil

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:48.180
that are designed to created wakefulness,

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.710
they are all essentially chemical variants

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:55.630
of things that increase
epinephrine and dopamine.

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.130
Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.650
that things like cocaine and amphetamine

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:01.180
are just across the board bad,

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.090
they have so many addictive
and terrible effects,

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:08.100
in the proper setting prescribed
by the proper professional,

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.340
things like modafinil for
narcolepsy might be appropriate,

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.610
I know that a lot of people
out there take Adderall,

01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:18.100
even though they haven't
been prescribed Adderall,

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.410
in order to increase wakefulness,

01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:24.060
that is essentially, well,
it's illegal for one,

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.150
but also it's abusing the system

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:27.530
in the sense that you're pushing back

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.470
on the adenosine system
slightly differently

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:31.140
than you do caffeine,

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.370
it will make you feel more alert,

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:33.600
there tends to be a heavy rebound

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.370
and they do have an addictive potential,

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.950
there are also some other effects of those

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:37.783
that could be quite bad,

01:14:37.783 --> 01:14:40.070
so we're gonna explore stimulants

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:42.870
in a whole month related to drugs,

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:44.270
but there are some supplements

01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:48.330
and some things that are
safer, certainly safer,

01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:50.920
and that, in cases where you're

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.250
doing all the right behaviors,

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.770
you're exercising and eating correctly

01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:56.470
and you're still having
trouble with sleep,

01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:00.070
that can be beneficial for
falling and staying asleep.

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:02.570
Now, I wanna be very clear,
I am not pushing supplements,

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:04.800
I am just pointing you toward some things

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.370
that have been shown in
peer-reviewed studies

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:08.420
to have some benefit.

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.870
The first one is magnesium,

01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:13.390
there are many forms of magnesium,

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:14.770
but certain forms of magnesium

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:17.610
can have positive effects on sleepiness

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:18.900
and the ability to stay asleep,

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.660
mainly by way of increasing
neurotransmitters like GABA

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.820
which help turn off the DPO,

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.290
the kind of thinking about the future,

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.910
duration-path-outcome analysis,

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:34.910
and make one's mind kind
of drift in space and time

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.740
and make it easier to fall asleep,

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.520
there are a lot of forms
of magnesium out there,

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.520
but in particular is magnesium
threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:47.320
which you have to check to
see if this is right for you,

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.460
check with your doctor,

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.010
but magnesium threonate is

01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:52.390
associated with transporters in the body

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:54.530
that bring more of it into cells

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:57.370
that allow people to feel
this kind of drowsiness

01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:58.420
and help them fall asleep,

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.140
so I personally, I can only
talk about what I personally do,

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:04.870
I personally take 3 or 400
milligrams of magnesium threonate

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:07.420
about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.870
and it helps me fall asleep.

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:13.370
The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A,

01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:17.792
T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,

01:16:17.792 --> 01:16:20.160
100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me,

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.000
also helps me turn off
my mind and fall asleep,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.980
I take it 30 to 60 minutes
throughout the day.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.380
Interestingly, theanine
is now being introduced

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.350
to a lot of energy drinks

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:31.560
in order to take away the jitters

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.940
that are associated with
drinking too much caffeine

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:36.150
or with some other things
that are in the energy drinks,

01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:39.160
energy drinks can be problematic,

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.830
they can contain a lot of L-taurine,

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.820
I'll just tell you an anecdote,

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.653
when I was a postdoc,

01:16:43.653 --> 01:16:45.670
I was drinking a lot of a
particular energy drink,

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:47.870
it has a lot of taurine in it,

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:51.130
and actually the whites of my eyes,

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.210
the sclera, as it's called,

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:54.480
of my eyes turned beet red,

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.710
and I went to a friend
who's an ophthalmologist,

01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:59.727
I said, "Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker,

01:16:59.727 --> 01:17:00.847
"I haven't been hit on the head,

01:17:00.847 --> 01:17:02.070
"I don't know what's going on,"

01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:03.017
and he looked and he said,

01:17:03.017 --> 01:17:06.420
"I think you've got some
microvascular damage,"

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.440
and we walked through what
I was taking and doing,

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.387
and he said, "Oh, it's
probably the taurine,

01:17:10.387 --> 01:17:11.527
"excessive levels of taurine

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:13.930
"can create some microvascular damage."

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.960
So if you're having
microvascular damage in your eye,

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.440
you probably have microvascular damage

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.770
deeper in your skull, so I stopped,

01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:21.760
that's the reason why I
don't take energy drinks,

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.990
so just a consideration,

01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:25.940
again, I'm not here to tell
you what to do or not do,

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.143
but just wanna arm you with information.

01:17:31.067 --> 01:17:33.030
The thing about theanine and magnesium

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:35.440
is taken together, they
do, for some people,

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.240
they can make them so
sleepy and sleep so deeply

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.010
that they actually have trouble
waking up in the morning,

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:42.170
so you have to play with
these things and titrate them

01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.270
if you decide to use them,

01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:44.830
again, if you decide to go this route,

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:47.110
I would not start by taking supplements,

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:48.120
I would start by getting your

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.470
light-viewing behavior correct,

01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:52.030
and then think about your nutrition

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:53.330
and then think about your activity

01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:55.800
and then think about whether
or not you wanna supplement,

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.900
we already talked about melatonin earlier.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.860
There's another supplement
that could be quite useful,

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.740
which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.710
which is a derivative of chamomile,

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:10.050
50 milligrams of apigenin
also can augment or support

01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:13.200
this kind of creation of a sleepiness

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.440
to help fall asleep and stay asleep.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.160
A note about sleepwalkers and
people with very vivid dreams,

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.740
theanine can often make
your dreams very vivid,

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.460
sleepwalkers should be
careful about taking theanine,

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.840
everyone should be careful
about taking anything,

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.830
and don't take anything

01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:30.240
without consulting your
board-certified M.D.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.150
or healthcare professional first, okay?

01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:34.760
Your health is your responsibility,

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.140
I am not gonna take responsibility

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.780
for what you decide to do
experimentally in any case,

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.680
but especially as it relates
to supplementation and drugs.

01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.900
As a important point, apigenin

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.600
is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor,

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:52.320
so women who want to keep
their estrogen levels high,

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.270
or at whatever levels
they happen to be at,

01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:56.760
should probably avoid apigenin altogether,

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.360
and men, take that into
consideration as well,

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.620
men need estrogen also,

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.980
you don't wanna completely
eliminate your estrogen,

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.680
that it can create all
sorts of bad effects

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.270
on libido and cognition, et cetera,

01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:10.290
so apigenin in some people

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:12.120
is gonna be a pretty
strong estrogen inhibitor,

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.663
so keep that in mind.

01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:15.870
There are other things you can take

01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:17.500
to help you sleep better,

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.260
those are the legal ones
that, at least I'm aware of,

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.790
have pretty broad safety margins,

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.080
but again, you need to explore

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.363
your safety margins with any compound.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.190
I think a great website

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.820
that I can refer you to is examine.com,

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.670
examine, the word, just as it
sounds, .com, is a website,

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:35.100
I have no relation to them,

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.680
but there, you can find links
to peer-reviewed studies

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.190
for any compound or supplement,

01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:41.850
as well as some important warnings

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:43.410
related to the things I discussed,

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:44.900
as well as any other thing

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.550
that you might decide to supplement with

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.563
or ingest to help improve your sleep.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.150
Okay, that was a lot of information

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:55.850
about how to get better at sleeping,

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:58.763
falling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera.

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.790
An important feature of
this podcast, as you know,

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:03.350
is that we dive deep into topics

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:05.460
for several episodes at a time,

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.370
at least a month at a time,

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:10.110
so by stopping here, I recognize

01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.570
that there are probably
many more questions

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:13.820
that you still have,

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:15.530
and the great thing about that

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:18.090
is that we have another
episode coming up soon,

01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:21.270
I'm going to hold office hours
where I'm going to answer

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:24.560
your specific questions
about episodes one and two,

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.830
so if you have questions
about this episode,

01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.340
you have questions about episode one,

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.970
write them down, put them in the comments,

01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:32.480
I'll also do a post on Instagram

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.590
where you can put them
in the comments there,

01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:38.840
but put them in the comments
to this episode as well,

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:41.970
please recommend the
podcast if you like it,

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.350
please subscribe to it here on YouTube,

01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:46.470
please subscribe to it on Apple,

01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:48.370
we're now on Spotify as well,

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:49.900
recommend it to a friend,

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.090
the community that we're creating here

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:54.140
around these topics of
sleep and wakefulness

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.540
and other neuroscience-
and health-related themes

01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:00.050
is best supported by your
involvement and your questions,

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:02.180
and so I'm going to be
reading all of your questions,

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.620
distilling those into the
most commonly asked questions

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.800
and liked questions,

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.880
so if you see something below

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.770
that you are particularly interested in,

01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:10.603
you don't have to put
that question in again,

01:21:10.603 --> 01:21:13.810
you can just give it a like,
the little thumbs-up tab,

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:17.810
and if you're listening to
this on Spotify or Apple,

01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:19.980
please go to YouTube, subscribe,

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.970
and put your question there,

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:23.080
or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.650
and you can put your questions there

01:21:24.650 --> 01:21:27.140
so that next episode, I
can answer those questions

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.600
and then we can move forward

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:31.240
even more deeply into
these critical topics

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.680
around sleep and wakefulness

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.850
so that you can be armed
with all the information

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.250
and resources that you need.

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.860
Last but not least, a number of you

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.110
have very graciously asked how
you can support the podcast,

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:43.560
the best way to support the podcast

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.850
is to subscribe on YouTube or
one of the other platforms,

01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:49.840
we are now on Spotify and Apple,

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.980
and the other way you can
really support the podcast

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.550
is to check out our sponsors,

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:55.250
which were discussed at the beginning.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:57.210
So thank you so much for
your time and attention,

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.853
and above all, thank you for
your interest in science.

01:21:59.853 --> 01:22:02.686
