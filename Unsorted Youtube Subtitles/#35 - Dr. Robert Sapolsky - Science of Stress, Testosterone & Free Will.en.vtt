00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.920
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.003
for everyday life.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.510
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.990
and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.130
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.800
Today I have the pleasure of introducing

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.760
Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.900
Dr. Sapolsky is a Professor of Biology

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.720
and Neurosurgery at Stanford University.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.020
His laboratory has worked on
a large variety of topics,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.360
including stress, hormones,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.510
including testosterone and estrogen,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.860
and how the different members
of a given species interact

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.180
according to factors like hormones,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.480
hierarchy within primate troops,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.060
and how things like stress, reproduction

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.410
and competition impact behavior.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.580
One of the things that
makes Dr. Sapolsky's work

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.040
so unique is that it combines
elements from primatology,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.530
including field studies
with human behavior,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.490
in essence trying to unveil how
humans as old world primates

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.160
are controlled by different
elements of our biology

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.940
as well as our psychology.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.880
Dr. Sapolsky is also a prolific
author of popular books,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.047
such as "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers",

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.680
"The Trouble with Testosterone",

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.480
and "Behave: The Biology of
Humans at Our Best and Worst".

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.310
During the course of our discussion today,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.500
Robert also revealed to me

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.377
that he is close to completing
a new book entitled,

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:24.990
"Determined: The Science
of Life Without Freewill."

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.240
And indeed we discuss the science of life

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.860
without freewill during this episode.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.370
We also discuss stress and
how best to control stress

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.740
and how stress controls us at both,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.100
conscious and subconscious levels.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.600
We talk about testosterone and estrogen

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.560
and hormone replacement therapy

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.360
and how those impact
our mind, our psychology

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.550
and our interactions with others.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.740
As with any discussion with Dr. Sapolsky,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.540
we learn about scientific mechanisms

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.060
that make us who we are.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.910
And today we also discuss tools

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.340
and how we can leverage
those scientific mechanisms

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.400
in order to be better
versions of ourselves.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.550
I should mention that
unlike most guest interviews

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.570
on the Huberman Lab podcast,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.270
this one had to be carried out remotely

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.640
due to various constraints,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.690
so you may hear the
occasional audio artifact,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.660
please excuse that.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.950
We felt that the value of a
conversation with Dr. Sapolsky

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.360
was well-worth those
minor, minor glitches.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930
And indeed the information
that he delivers us

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.620
is tremendously valuable, interesting,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.870
and in many cases actionable as well.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.640
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.550
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.460
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.070
It is, however, part of my desire

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.620
and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770
about science and science related tools

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.230
to the general public.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.360
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.250
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.370
Our first sponsor is ROKA,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.150
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.430
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.410
The company was founded by

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.480
two All-American swimmers from Stanford,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.800
and everything about the
design of the sunglasses

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.430
and eyeglasses was created
with performance in mind.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.760
There are several things I like
about ROKA glasses so much.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.470
One of them is that the aesthetic
of the glasses is great.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.130
Unlike a lot of performance
glasses out there

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.360
that you can wear while swimming

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.940
and running but also indoors,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.910
these glasses don't make
you look like a cyborg.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.410
The aesthetic of them is really terrific,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.800
and they have a lot of
different styles to select from.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.750
In addition to that, the
quality of the lenses

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.860
on both the sunglasses
and eyeglasses are superb.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.280
The optical clarity is great,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.750
you can move from brightly
lit areas to shadowed areas,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.290
and you don't get any degradation

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.740
in the quality of the visual image.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.080
And that's absolutely essential.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.720
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.750

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.750
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.060
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.700
that analyzes data from your blood

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.490
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.600
and help you reach your health goals.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.680
I've long been a believer

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.560
in getting regular blood work done.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.040
And now with the advent
of quality DNA tests,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.510
you can get a lot of
information about your genetics

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.930
and how that also impacts your immediate

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.340
and long-term health.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.740
The reason I'm such a fan of
getting blood work done is

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.020
that it is really the
only way to understand

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.200
what's going on in your system at a level

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.040
that can really inform your decisions

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.660
about your immediate and long-term health.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.340
The problem with a lot of
blood and DNA tests, however,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.610
is that you get numbers
back about your hormones

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.200
and your metabolic factors, etc.,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.300
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.640
With InsideTracker, they have
a very easy to use dashboard

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.030
that gives you that information,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.630
and then gives you some
suggestions and directives

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.930
about things you could
change about your nutrition,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.110
about your exercise and
other lifestyle factors

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.560
that can help you move those
numbers in the direction

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.860
that's best for you and for your health.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.330
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.880
you can go to InsideTracker.com/Huberman
to get 25% off

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.390
any of InsideTracker plans,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.980
just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.090
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Belcampo.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.730
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.620
that raises organic grass-fed

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.360
and finished certified humane meats.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.980
I eat meat about once a day,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.090
in general my lunch or my
breakfast consists of some meat,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.860
and that meat has to be
of very high-quality,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.860
and generally I'll eat
some vegetable as well.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.870
And then I tend to eat pastas and rice

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.460
and things of that sort later
in the day or in the evening

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.950
in order to facilitate
the transition to sleep.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.020
So I'm eating meat about once a day,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.530
and I always insist
that the meat that I eat

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.080
be of the very highest quality

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.490
and that the animals were
raised and maintained humanely.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.070
While conventionally raised
animals are confined to feedlots

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.260
and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.500
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.520
and seasonal grasses resulting in meat

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.240
that's higher in nutrients
and healthy fats.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.010
In addition, they raise
their animals in a way

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.800
that's not just better for our health,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.570
but also has a positive
impact on the environment.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.220
They practice regenerative agriculture,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.330
which means the meat is climate positive

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.560
and carbon negative.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.110
So you can feel good
about what you're eating

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.180
at the environmental level
and for sake of your health.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.370
You can order Belcampo's
sustainably raised meats

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.840
to be delivered to you
by using my code Huberman

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.740
at Belcampo.com/Huberman and
entering my code Huberman

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.970
to get 20% off your first time order.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.870
I'm partial to the ribeyes
or the New York steaks,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.280
so on one day I might have a ribeye,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.770
the next day I might
have a New York steak,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.470
I also really like the meatballs,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.380
I'm a particular fan of the meatballs.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.850
So, again, that's Belcampo.com/Huberman

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.380
and enter the code Huberman

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.110
at checkout to get 20% off your order.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.320
And now without further ado,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.430
my conversation with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.580
Great, well, thank you so much,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.050
Robert, for joining us today.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.040
I've been looking forward
to this for a very long time

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.873
and I appreciate it.

00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:38.523
- Oh yes, glad to be here.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.240
- There is an enormous range of topics

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.980
that we could drill into,
but just to start off,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.530
I want to return to a topic that is

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.400
near and dear to your
heart, which is stress.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.230
And one of the questions
that I get most commonly is,

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.720
what is the difference between
short and long-term stress

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.190
in terms of their benefits
and their drawbacks?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.810
And the reason I say benefits is that,

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.690
obviously stress and the stress
response can keep us alive,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.500
but stress, of course, can
also sharpen our mental acuity

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.860
and things of that sort.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.650
So how should we conceptualize stress

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.090
and how should we conceptualize stress

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.560
in the short-term and in the long-term?

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.560
- Well, basically sort of two
graphs that one would draw.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.670
The first one is just all
sorts of beneficial effects

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.980
of stress short-term,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.500
and then once we get into chronicity,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.580
it's just downhill from there.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.180
Short-term because it saves
you from the predator,

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.020
short-term because you're
giving a presentation

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.260
and you think more clearly
or your focus is better,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.973
all sorts of aspects of that.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.860
And what then winds up
being an argument is,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.400
how long does it take to go
from short-term to long-term?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.370
And that's somewhat arbitrary,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.030
but the sorts of chronic stressors

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.860
that most people deal
with are just undeniably

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.330
in the chronic range, like
having spent the last 20 years,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.193
daily traffic jams or abusive
boss or some such thing.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.700
The other curve that's sort
of perpendicular to this

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.800
is dealing with the fact

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.430
that sometimes stress is a great thing.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.100
Like our goal is not to
cure people of stress

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.000
because if it's a right kind, we love it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.490
We pay good money to be stressed that way

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.330
by a scary movie or a rollercoaster ride.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.960
What you wind up seeing is

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.350
when it's the right amount of stress,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.650
it's what we call stimulation.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.100
And the basic curve there is,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.870
here is an optimal level of
stimulation and too little,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.120
and function goes down with
what we would call boredom,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.160
and too much and function goes down

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.130
with what we would call stress.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.943
And the optimum is what all of us aim for.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.873
- In terms of the benefits
of stress in the short-term,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.900
one thing that's really striking to me is,

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.360
how physiologically the stress response

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.160
looks so much like the excitement response

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.440
to a positive event.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.490
And we can speculate that
the fundamental difference

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.260
between short-term stress
and short-term excitement

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.990
is some neuromodulator like
dopamine or something like that.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.470
But is there anything else that we know

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.270
about the biology that reveals to us?

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.310
What really creates this
thing we call valence

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.710
that an experience can be
terrible or feel awful,

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.250
or it can feel wonderful,
exhilarating depending on

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.050
this somewhat subjective
feature we call valence?

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.223
Do we know what valence
is or where it resides?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.253
- On a really mechanical level,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.740
if you're in a circumstance
that is requiring

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.080
that your heart races and
you're breathing as fast

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.823
and you're using your
muscles and some such thing,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.700
you're going to to be
having roughly the same

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.830
brain activation profile,

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.460
whether this is for something wonderful

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.500
or something terrible with
the one exception being

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.510
that if the amygdala is
part of the activation,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.323
this is something that's going
to be counting as adverse.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.160
Whether that's the circumstance,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.750
an adverse circumstance
recruiting the amygdala into it,

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.720
and how much it's the
amygdala being involved,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.860
biases you towards interpreting
it as even more awful.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.200
The amygdala in some ways
is kind of the checkpoint

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.453
as to whether we're talking
about excitement or terror.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.170
- Let's use the amygdala
as a transition point

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.550
to another topic that you've
spent many years working on

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.810
and thinking about, which is testosterone

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.300
and other sex steroid hormones.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.630
I heard you say once before that

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.020
among all the brain areas
that bind testosterone,

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.260
that where testosterone
can park and create effects

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.430
that the amygdala is among

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.270
the most chockablock full
of these parking spots,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.080
these receptors.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.210
I realize there's a lot here,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.560
but how should we think

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.530
about the role of
testosterone in the amygdala

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.250
given that the engagement of
the amygdala is fundamental

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.260
in this transition point
between a exhilarating,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.080
positive response and a
negative stressful response?

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.520
Or maybe just broadly,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.260
how should we think about testosterone

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.710
and its effects on the brain?

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.190
- And pertinent to the transition from

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.250
whether this is a stressor
that's evoking fear

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.650
or revoking aggression in
terms of that continuum,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.630
also because the amygdala
is in the center of all

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.473
four points on those axes.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.580
Basically, almost everybody out there

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.200
has a completely wrong idea
as to what testosterone does,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.066
which is testosterone makes you aggressive

00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:24.820
because males, virtually
every species out there

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.330
have more testosterone
and a more aggressive

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.080
and seasonal measures
have testosterone surging

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.100
at the time of year, they're
punching it out over territory.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.240
And you take testosterone
out of the picture,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.110
you castrate any mammal
out there, including us,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.890
and levels of aggression will go down.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.756
And the easy thing then tends to conclude

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:51.930
that testosterone causes aggression.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.980
And the reality is testosterone
does no such thing,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.220
it doesn't cause aggression.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.670
And you can see this both
behaviorally and in the amygdala.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.970
What does testosterone do?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.480
It lowers the threshold
for the sort of things

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.670
that would normally provoke
you into being [mumbles]

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.120
so that it happens more easily.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.120
It makes systems that are
already turned on, turn on louder

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.660
rather than turning on aggressive
music or some such thing.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.270
What does that look like behaviorally?

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.530
You take five male
monkeys, put them together,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.110
they form a dominance hierarchy.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.740
Number one is great,
number five is miserable,

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.260
number three is right in between.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.130
Now take number three

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.970
and shoot the guy up
with tons of testosterone

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.050
and he's going to be
involved in more fights.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.657
Aha, testosterone uniformly
causes aggression,

00:13:46.657 --> 00:13:49.700
but you look closely and
there's a pattern to it,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.310
is number three now
challenging numbers two and one

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.820
for their place in the hierarchy.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.550
Absolutely not, he is brown-nosing them

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.610
exactly as much as he used to.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.760
What's going on is he's
just a miserable terror

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.220
to poor number four and five.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.800
And in that case, what
testosterone is doing

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.513
is amplifying the preexisting
patterns of aggression.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.070
Amplifying the social learning,

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.940
that's where it'd gone into there.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.820
Now on sort of the more reductive level,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.490
so how does that translate
into the amygdala?

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.880
Does testosterone make amygdaloid neurons

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.950
have action potentials?

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.420
Does it cause those
neurons to suddenly speak

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.080
about fear and aggression spontaneously?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.580
Absolutely not.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.040
What they do is,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.990
if the amygdala is
already being stimulated,

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.463
it increases the rate of neuronal firing.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.280
What its worth?

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.660
It shortens after-hyperpolarizations.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.530
So the theme there exactly is,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.053
it's not creating your aggression,

00:14:53.053 --> 00:14:55.220
it's just upping the volume of

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.710
whatever aggression is already there.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.903
And once you factor that in,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.000
it's impossible to say anything
about what testosterone does

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
outside the context of what
testosterone related behaviors,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.820
how they get treated [laughs]
in your social settings.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.653
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:15:15.653 --> 00:15:18.760
And in terms of status
and the relationship

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.140
between individuals, either
nonhuman primates or humans,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.830
can we say that testosterone
and levels of testosterone?

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.020
Or I should say, can we say

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.670
that relative levels of
testosterone between individuals

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.023
is correlated to status
within the hierarchy?

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.650
- Yes, but in a way that winds up

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.070
being totally uninteresting.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.810
Like you go back on
whatever number of decades,

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.640
the endocrinology texts,

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.560
and there were two totally
reliable findings in there.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.257
Let's see, I have a dog in here that's-

00:15:51.257 --> 00:15:53.920
- Oh, good, we like dogs at
the Huberman Lab podcast.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.530
- Oh, okay, it is jingling with that.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.220
- They are welcome, they are
absolutely welcome, yeah.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.940
- And there'd be two truisms,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.270
which is higher levels of testosterone

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.730
predict higher levels of aggression

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.350
in humans and other animals.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.440
Higher levels of testosterone

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.620
predict higher levels of sexual activity.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.570
Whoa, testosterone causing both,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.380
and the correlation is there.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.810
And when you look closely, we've
got cause and effect stuff,

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.430
sexual behavior raises
testosterone levels,

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.440
aggression raises testosterone levels.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.340
Your levels before had
were barely predictive

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.870
of what's going to happen,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.163
so it's a response rather than a cause.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.950
When you look at that though

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.853
in terms of making sense
of individual differences,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.763
they don't matter a whole lot.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.870
You can spend an entire career
on the social circumstances

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:57.250
that produce 3.5% more
testosterone in the circulation,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.020
and expect to see all sorts
of interesting implications.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.280
And that's not really the case,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.031
it's somewhat of a yes or no modulator

00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:12.240
of the much more subtle social
stuff that's already there.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.890
- Very interesting.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.710
I think that there are
a lot of misconceptions

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.390
about human biology, but
testosterone seems to be one area

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.193
where at least from what I
can find on the internet,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.010
it's sort of at the peak
of misunderstanding.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.580
Maybe we could just ask
a few more questions

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.360
about testosterone and sexual behavior

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.770
because there's an interesting story there

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.020
about castration versus non-castration

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.300
and the causality, again.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.410
But before you address that,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.190
I just want to highlight
something that you said

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.000
that I think is so vital,
which is that behaviors,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.430
such as aggressive behaviors
and sexual behaviors

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.300
can actually increase testosterone.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.850
Did I hear that correctly?
- Yeah.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.850
- And the reverse is sort of
true, but not in a causal way.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.523
Is that right?

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.210
- The opposite direction
of the causality, yeah.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.110
- Yeah, yeah, so if I were to increase

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.550
somebody's testosterone by 30%,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.230
male or female doesn't matter,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.880
their sexual behavior
may or may not change.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.260
- Essentially zero effect at all.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.620
Your brain is not that sensitive

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.420
to fluctuations in testosterone levels.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.160
In terms of things like aggression,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.300
raising testosterone,
this is a great footnote.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.020
If you have the right type of

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.710
willing to die on the trenches
devotion sort of thing,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.760
watching your favorite team play a sport

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.040
will raise your testosterone levels

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.950
as you sit there with the
potato chips in your armchair.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.590
So it's not the physicality of aggression,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.820
it's the psychological framing of it.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.460
So, yeah, testosterone
is not causing that.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.900
And a great way to appreciate that is,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.580
okay, so you had all these testosterone

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.400
sexual behavior correlations,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.790
and you do the definitive
endocrine intervention,

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.970
which is you do a subtraction study,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.630
you've removed the testes.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.300
And as I said before, levels
of sexual behavior goes down.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.600
Good, we've just shown

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.250
that testosterone is
somehow have caused it.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.470
Critically they go down,
but not down to zero,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.470
whether you are a rat or a
monkey or a human, whatever.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.850
And what predicts how much residual

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.940
sexual behavior is there,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.683
how much sexual behavior
there was before castration?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.690
What that's telling you is by then

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.090
that's behavior that's being
carried by social learning

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.100
and context rather than by the hormone,

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.330
exact same thing with aggression.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.170
Drops after castration,
doesn't go to zero,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.330
the more prior history of it,

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.780
the more it just keeps
coasting along on its own

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.900
even without testosterone.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.850
- Very interesting.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.470
Can we say that there is an exception

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.600
in terms of the early
organizing effects of hormones?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.020
Like, for instance, if a
developing animal is deprived of

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.950
a testosterone or estrogen

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.550
or aromatized testosterone into estrogen,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.870
there's a whole story there is, you know.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.200
But then I could imagine that
the circuits of the brain

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.550
that are responsible for
initiating sexual behavior

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.240
in the first place might not emerge,

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.990
and therefore not be sensitive

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.610
to the testosterone later in life.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:25.443
Is that right?

00:20:25.443 --> 00:20:26.760
Okay.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.020
And a great way of seeing that

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.390
is this totally nutty biological factoid,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.890
which is the second to
fourth digit ratio enhanced.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.723
- Oh yeah.

00:20:38.723 --> 00:20:42.290
- Totally obscure thing, the
ratio of one to the other

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.270
in some way reflects
levels of testosterone,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.890
androgen exposure during fetal life.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.060
And I can't remember which
way it goes and it's minuscule

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.720
and you need a thousand
people in your sample size

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.140
to be able to see anything,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.870
but you see it in other primates,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.050
it's already there in fetal
sonograms, all of that.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:07.990
So that's a readout of subtle differences

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.220
in prenatal exposure,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.053
and that winds up being a
predictor of a whole range of

00:21:14.053 --> 00:21:16.800
sort of stuff in adult behavior.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.160
So, yeah, at the fetal end,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.830
when you're still building everything,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.580
testosterone and the amount of that

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.270
is making a huge difference.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.120
By the time you're an adult,

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.360
it's just somewhat of
an old and a non-signal.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.300
- Yeah, I have a confession,

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.420
which is that I was a
master's student at Berkeley

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.420
in Marc Breedlove's arena, so
I'm an author on that paper,

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.330
although I'm deep within the author line,

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.050
and you got the description
of it exactly right

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.580
that it's the D2, the index
finger to the ring finger ratio

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.210
is more similar in females
than it is in males.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.200
In males, the index finger
tends to be shorter.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.890
And for people out there
who are listening to this

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.560
who are now freaking out or measuring,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.210
that there is a proper way
to measure this, which is,

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.400
eyeballing it doesn't work all the time

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.580
unless at the extremes.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.480
And there's some very
interesting stories there.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.490
It actually has been replicated
no fewer than five times,

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.223
Marc Breedlove tells me.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.370
But yes, in terms of these
early organizing effects,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.770
those seem very robust in most studies.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.710
These later effects are
sort of activation of

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.110
neural circuits by hormones.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.330
I'm absolutely fascinated by this.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.183
And I do have a couple other questions,

00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:33.710
which is, we normally associate
testosterone with males,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.660
but of course, females
make testosterone as well

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.180
from the adrenals and
presumably elsewhere too.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.580
I'm guessing if we looked hard enough,

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.150
we'd probably find that
there were other sources

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.080
of androgens in females.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.913
Can we say

00:22:45.913 --> 00:22:50.260
that these general contours
of effects on aggression

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.580
also pertain to females?

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.140
And I suppose I should ask in particular

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.580
about female-female aggression,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.280
which does exist in many species,

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.220
female-male agregression as
well as maternal aggression,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.460
which is a robust aspect of
our evolution, of course,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.270
that the mother will,
an angry mother animal

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.580
of any kind protecting her
young is truly dangerous,

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.160
in the best sense of the word.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.540
- And that type of post-parturition,

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.540
period after birth aggression
is all about estrogen,

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.760
progesterone, those sorts of things.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.770
Female aggression, the rest of the time

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.530
has testosterone as a major
player at a much lower level

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.620
on the average.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.430
On the average, one always has to say,

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.780
but it's basically the same punchlines.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.520
In females, the lower levels
of testosterone are essential

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.120
for typical levels of
aggression and sexual behavior.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.060
Nonetheless, they're not causing it,

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.950
it's not sensitive to small
individual differences.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.340
Same exact thing.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.423
You can get way over-impressed

00:23:59.423 --> 00:24:02.750
with the importance of
androgens in females

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.160
just as readily as in males.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.840
- So in line with that,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.340
how should we conceptualize testosterone?

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.090
I realize there isn't a single sentence

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.370
that can capture a
hormone in all its effects

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.220
because hormones have
so many different slow

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.420
and fast effects on the brain,
on other glands on their own,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.370
on the very glands that produce them.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.990
But as I've heard you talk
about testosterone today

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.360
and over the years, I
start to get the impression

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.877
that as the most misunderstood molecule

00:24:31.877 --> 00:24:34.123
[laughs] in human health in the universe,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.730
it's clearly doing
something very powerful.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.590
It's shifting the way that
certain neural circuits work,

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.850
adjusting the gain on the
amygdala, as you described,

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.410
and certainly other things as well.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.600
Is there any truism
about testosterone like,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.500
and its relationship to effort

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.320
or its relationship to resilience,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.280
and in a way that maybe will
help me and other people

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.150
to sort of think about how
to think about testosterone?

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:03.983
- Yeah.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.070
Maybe three separate answers to that.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.140
The first one is, I think
it's a fair summary to think

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.140
that when it comes to
motivated strong behaviors,

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.020
what testosterone does is make you

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.767
more of whatever you already are.

00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:24.760
And that to me, sexual arousal,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.400
libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.990
reactive aggression, things of that sort.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.580
It's upping the volume of things

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.243
that are already strongly there.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.133
Second way to think about it is,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.690
well, here's like my favorite
finding about testosterone.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:49.280
And this was some wonderful
work by a guy, John Wingfield,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.980
who's one of the best behavioral
endocrinologists out there.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.930
And about 20 years ago he
formulated what was called

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.630
The Challenge Hypothesis
of Testosterone in Action.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.110
What does testosterone do?

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.370
Testosterone is what you secrete

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.010
when your status is being challenged,

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.930
and it makes it more likely that you'll do

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.320
the behaviors needed to
hold onto your status.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.000
Okay, so that's totally
boringly straightforward

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.250
if you are a baboon.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.060
If somebody is challenging your high rank,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.750
the appropriate response on your part

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.490
is going to be aggression.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.050
All right, so we've just got
in through the back door,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.860
testosterone and aggression, again.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.720
But then you get to humans,

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.420
and humans have lots of
different ways of achieving

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.350
or maintaining status.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.980
And all you need to do is go to like some

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.760
fancy private school's annual auction,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.350
and you will see all these
half-drunk alpha males

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.740
competing to see who can
give the most money away

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.070
as a show of conspicuous like

00:26:55.167 --> 00:26:56.530
property that they have.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.989
And in a setting like that, I mean,

00:26:58.989 --> 00:27:01.710
I haven't been able to take urine samples,

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.340
if there's times, unfortunately,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.940
but that shows the flip side of it.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.730
If you have a species
that hands out status

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.980
in a very different sort of way,

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.750
testosterone is going to boost that also.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.010
Okay, so that generates a
totally nutty prediction.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.810
Wow, take people in a circumstance,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.010
say playing an economic game

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.630
where you get status by being trustworthy

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.710
and being generous in your
interactions with the game.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.880
If you give people testosterone,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.300
does that make them more generous?

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.260
And that's absolutely the case.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.650
Totally cool finding.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.660
I'm showing you, I don't know,

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.010
basically if you took a
whole bunch of Buddhist monks

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.290
and shot them up with testosterone,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.150
they'd get all competitive with each other

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.470
as to who could do the most
random acts of kindness.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.470
And if we have a societal
problem with too much aggression,

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.490
the first culprit to look
at is not testosterone,

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.350
the first to look at is

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.220
that we hand out so much
damn elevated status

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.020
for aggression in so many circumstances.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.640
So I find that finding to be fantastic.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.010
Third thing about
subtlety of testosterone.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.240
Okay, so like some subtler
behavioral effects,

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.330
you give testosterone to people

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.850
and they become more confident,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.380
they become more self-confident.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.850
Well, that's good, people pay to take

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.620
all sorts of nonsensical self-help courses

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.680
that will boost your self-esteem.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.670
And that's a good thing

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.640
unless testosterone
makes you more confident,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.430
that is inaccurate,

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.050
and you're more likely to
barrel into wrong decisions.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:45.260
What's shown in economic game
play is that testosterone

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.000
by making you more confident
makes you less cooperative

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.420
because who needs to cooperate

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.603
because I'm on top of this all on my own.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.620
Testosterone makes people
cocky and impulsive.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.950
And that might be great in one setting,

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:00.920
but if and the other is,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.957
you're absolutely sure your army is to

00:29:02.957 --> 00:29:05.730
get over on the other
country in three days.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.337
So hell, let's start World War I,

00:29:07.337 --> 00:29:09.840
and you get a big surprise out of it.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.680
Testosterone altering
risk assessment beforehand

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.780
probably played a big role in
that kind of miscalculation.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.120
- Super-interesting.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.870
I always think about testosterone

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.710
and dopamine being close
cousins in the brain,

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.720
not just because of their relationship

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.600
through the pituitary and hypothalamus.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.600
That, of course, but also because
of dopamine's salient role

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.290
in creating this bias
towards exteroception.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.890
When somebody takes a drug,
with it increases dopamine,

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.320
or they're chockablock full of dopamine.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.710
They tend, I want to highlight 'tend'

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.060
because this is, I'm
really generalizing here,

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.950
but they tend to focus on outward goals,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.770
things beyond the
boundaries of their skin.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.230
And testosterone seems
to do a bit of the same,

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.660
it tends to put us into a similar mode of

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.360
perceiving the outside world in ways

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.810
that we're asking questions like,

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.840
how do I relate to this
other of my species?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.770
How do I relate to these goals?

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.870
Is there anything that we can
do to better conceptualize

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.880
the relationship between testosterone

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.720
and dopamine and motivation?

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.050
Or would that just take
us down the alleyways of,

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.290
of neural pathways and the hypothalamus?

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.820
Which is fine too.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.560
- Well, I think it's got lots to do with

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.000
sort of this massive
revisionism about dopamine.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.460
Everyone, since the pharaohs
got brought up being taught

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.510
that dopamine is about
pleasure and reward.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.290
It turns out it isn't, it's
about anticipation of reward,

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.140
and it's about generating the motivation,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.050
the goal-directed behavior
needed to go get that reward.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:51.580
And before you know it, you're
using like elevated dopamine,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.400
your entire life to motivate you to do

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.460
whatever is going to get
you like entry into heaven

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.990
after-life kind of, it's
doing that sort of thing.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.640
So it's really about the motivation.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.950
And what testosterone
does even in individuals

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.400
who are not aggressive and
why testosterone replacement

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.230
is often a very helpful
thing for aging males is

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:20.230
it increases energy, it
increases a sense of thereness,

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.400
a presence of alertness
that increases motivation.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.500
So that's a whole aspect,
which then takes us into

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.563
is your motivation to get up and like go,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.340
hand out lots of soup in a soup
kitchen for homeless people,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.173
or is it to get up and go
ethnically cleanse a village.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.110
It's got much to do with
what your makeup was

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.540
before the testosterone got onboard.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.730
So it's activating in an energetic sense,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.100
testosterone within minutes
increases glucose uptake

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.760
into skeletal muscle.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.277
You're just more awake
and alert and all of that,

00:32:00.277 --> 00:32:03.160
and that has a lot to do
with what dopamine does.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.300
And as one might predict then,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.340
getting just the right
levels of testosterone

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.780
infused into your bloodstream
feels great to lab rats.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.960
They will lever press to
get infused into the range

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.010
that optimizes dopamine release.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.730
So there is, you are absolutely right,

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.594
they're deeply intertwined.

00:32:24.594 --> 00:32:26.590
- Yeah, such beautiful biology there.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.920
And I love the way you
encapsulate their relationship.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.393
I want to ask about estrogen,

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.380
we don't hear about estrogen as often,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.260
and it's always
interesting to me now doing

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.140
some public facing education,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.650
that testosterone is this
very controversial molecule,

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.186
just to say it is almost
controversial. [laughs]

00:32:47.186 --> 00:32:49.440
[Robert laughs]
But estrogen doesn't seem

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.570
to hold the same controversial weight,

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.700
and yet estrogen has a
very powerful effects

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.700
on both the animal brain
and on the human brain

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.120
of males and females.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.930
Men do not want their
estrogen to go too low.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.010
Terrible things happen, they
will lose cognitive function,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.960
libido can drop.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.680
So men need estrogen as well,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.260
but perhaps maybe we can put
the same filter on estrogen

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.450
as we did on testosterone.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.020
Are there any general themes of estrogen

00:33:23.705 --> 00:33:24.800
that people should be aware of

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.720
or that you think that are
generally misunderstood?

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.100
Is it really all about
feelings and empathy

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.563
and making us more sensitive?

00:33:32.842 --> 00:33:34.300
I sense not.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.060
- No, and it's once again
very context dependent.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.650
And if estrogen after giving
birth is playing a central role

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.930
in you wanting to shred
the face of somebody

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.370
getting too close to your
kittens kind of thing,

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:53.370
we know it's not just warm,
fuzzy, empathic kind of stuff.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:58.690
Estrogen in lots of ways
could be summarized by,

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.280
if you've got a choice in the matter

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.350
between having a lot of estrogen
in your bloodstream or not,

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.740
go for having a lot of estrogen.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.061
It enhances cognition,
exactly as you said,

00:34:10.061 --> 00:34:13.570
it stimulates neurogenesis
in the hippocampus,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.010
it increases glucose and oxygen delivery,

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.720
it protects you from dementia,

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.720
it decreases inflammatory
oxidative damage to blood vessels,

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.550
which is why it's good for protecting

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.470
from cardiovascular disease
in contrast to testosterone,

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.253
which is making everyone
of those things worse.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.230
This springs up this
minefield with a question,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.523
which is, so what about
post-menopausal estrogen?

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.440
And all sorts of lab studies
with non-human primates

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.510
suggested that you keep
estrogen levels high

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.060
after a monkey's equivalent of menopause.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.220
And you're going to keep
brain health a lot better

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.640
or decreasing the risk
of dementia, stroke,

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.220
every such thing.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.940
Estrogen is a great
antioxidant, all of that.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.930
So in the 90s I think

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:11.390
when Healy, I'm forgetting her name,

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:15.630
but when there was the first
female head of the NIH,

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:20.630
Bernadine Healy set up this
massive prospective human study,

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.160
what was going to be the
biggest one of all times,

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.500
looking at the pluses and minuses

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.710
of post-menopausal estrogen.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.410
And tens of thousands of
women, and this was...

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.600
And they had to cut the study short

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.460
because what they were seeing was,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.910
estrogen was not only
doing the normal bad stuff

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.310
that you expect in terms of
some decalcification stuff,

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.820
but it was increasing the risk
of cardiovascular disease,

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.397
and it was increasing the risk of stroke,

00:35:51.397 --> 00:35:54.310
and it was increasing
the risk of dementia.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.270
And this ground to a halt and everybody,

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.860
they stopped the study and front page news

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.450
and everybody panned at that point.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.820
And nobody could make sense of it

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.110
who had been spending the
last 20 years studying

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.970
the exact same thing in primates

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.430
and seeing all the protective effects.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:16.430
And the explanation turned
out to be one of those things

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.390
where like the law of
unexpected consequences.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.870
Okay, menopause in women,

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.710
it lasts different lengths of time,

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.740
that may be a factor that's going to come.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.280
You know what, let's not start
giving our study subjects

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.300
more estrogen until they're
totally past menopause.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.210
And when you've got that
lag time in between,

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.550
you shift all sorts of
estrogen receptor patterns,

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.530
and that's where all of
the bad effects come from.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:46.210
- Wow!
- All of the monkey studies

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.440
had involved just maintaining

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.110
ovulatory levels into the
post-menopausal period.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.310
And you do that and you get great effects.

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.260
Estrogen is one of the
greatest predictors of

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.720
protection from Alzheimer's
disease, all of that,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.270
but it needs to be physiological.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.130
Just keep continuing what
your body has been doing

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.710
for a long time versus let
the whole thing shutdown

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.030
and suddenly like try to
fire up the coal stoves

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.050
at the bottom of the
basement kind of thing,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.550
and get that going,

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.120
there you get utterly different outcomes.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.380
And that caused a lot of
human health consequences

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.910
when people suddenly decided that estrogen

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:32.910
is in fact neurologically
endangering post-menopausally.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.540
- Wow, that's fascinating.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.850
And I never thought that these

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:42.430
steroid hormone receptors
could by not binding estrogen,

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.970
being devoid of estrogen
binding, I should say,

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.130
could then set off opposite
biochemical cascades.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.963
Fascinating.

00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:50.870
I guess it raises the question

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.540
about testosterone replacement too,

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.429
whether or not people should

00:37:55.429 --> 00:37:58.970
[laughs] talk to their
doctor before too long.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:02.000
Men and women talk to your
physicians before too long

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.230
to avoid these, whatever is
happening in these periods

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.000
where there isn't sufficient
testosterone and/or estrogen.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.850
It sounds like could
cause longer-term problems

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.970
even when therapies are introduced.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.730
- Two additional misery
slash complications.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.390
So, okay, you're trying to understand,

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.560
you look at women with a history

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.620
with or without post-menopausal
estrogen replacement

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.640
where it's done great.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.540
And you're seeing 20 years later,

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.819
estrogen is a predictor of a
decreased risk of Alzheimer's.

00:38:33.819 --> 00:38:38.330
Then you got to start
trying to do the unpacking

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.390
prospective type studies.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.240
How much estrogen?

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.150
At which times?

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:49.150
Estrogen is a catchall term
for a bunch of hormones,

00:38:49.231 --> 00:38:52.090
estrone, estradiol, estriol.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.850
How much of each one of them?

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.660
Natural or synthetic?

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.700
Go try to figure all of that out.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.830
And the second complication is,

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.540
it's often hard to say anything
about what estrogen does

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.060
outside the context of
what progesterone is doing.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.080
And often it's not the
absolute levels of either,

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.970
it's the ratio of the two.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.500
This is such a more
complicated endocrine system

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.740
than testosterone.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.740
And because you have to
generate dramatic cyclicity

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.450
that like no male hypothalamus
ever has to dream off.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:30.400
It's a much, much more complicated system,

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.420
thus, it's a lot more
complicated to understand,

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:38.420
let alone like figure out what
the ideal benefits are of it.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.533
- Yeah.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.960
I don't know what to
make of the literature on

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.420
dropping rates of testosterone
and endocrine disruptors.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.170
I was at Berkeley when Tyrone Hayes

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.210
published his data on these frogs

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.900
that were drinking water
from various locations

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.260
throughout the United States,
not just in California,

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.100
and seeing very severe
endocrine disruption

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.770
through blockade or,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.900
and of androgen receptors
and all sorts of issues.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.560
And you hear this all the time now

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.180
that sperm counts are dropping,

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.130
that there are all these
endocrine disruptors

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.500
that there's birth control in the water,

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.570
in the drinking water.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.710
It all starts to sound a little crazy,

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:21.163
and yet I've also been fooled before by,

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.550
I guess a good example would be,

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.020
there's a lot of crazy
stuff in the world online

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.810
about all the terrible stuff
in highly processed foods.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.020
And yet you've got very
respectable people,

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.900
endocrinologists at UCSF
like Robert Lustig saying,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.080
yeah, a lot of these hidden sugars

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.250
and these emulsifiers,
they're causing real problems.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.963
So I've become more
open-minded about the question.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.960
And so, are we suffering
from drops in sperm counts

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.010
and testosterone and
estrogen and fertility

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.260
as a consequence of endocrine disruptors

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.600
in the environments and food,

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.620
or because of social reasons?

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.560
Is there anything that
we can hang our hat on

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.100
like real data that you're confident in?

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.283
Or is it just a mess?

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.883
- No, the phenomenon does
appear to be quite real.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.430
Cross-sectional studies,
human populations,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.750
or I still don't understand why this was

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.170
one of the first things
that Hayes spotted.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.349
Decreasing testicle size in crocodiles.

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:24.182
[Andrew laughs]

00:41:24.182 --> 00:41:25.107
Go figure why that was

00:41:25.107 --> 00:41:27.730
one of the first contributions to this.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.690
And I think the phenomenon
is absolutely real.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.810
And what you're then left with
is two classic challenges,

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.590
which is this is correlated with

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.870
something broad environmental toxins.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.860
Which ones, how much, when, etc.?

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.230
And the other one always
being, well, okay,

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:49.160
dropping is a dropping
enough to make a difference.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.650
How big of an effect is this?

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:54.110
And those are where the
juries are still out.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.470
- Yeah, it's an area that I know

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.820
there's a lot of interest in,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.000
and you've got groups of people

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.760
who won't touch a receipt at a store

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.650
because of the BPAs that
are on the inks of the...

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.644
And then [laughs] you've got people

00:42:05.644 --> 00:42:07.475
who don't care about those things.

00:42:07.475 --> 00:42:09.840
It is a fascinating area.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.110
I hope that more biology
will be done there soon.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.703
I'd like to briefly return to stress.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:21.493
You described a study once about two rats,

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.260
one running on a wheel voluntarily,

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.300
one who is basically
stuck in a running wheel,

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.380
and it's forced to run
anytime, rat number one runs.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.550
So in one case the rat is
voluntarily exercising. [laughs]

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.640
And in the other case,
the rat is being forced

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.660
to go to PE class, so to speak,

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.660
but really, and seeing
divergent effects on biology.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.500
And I'd like to just
touch into this and use it

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.023
as kind of a case study for
stress mitigation in general.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.030
I'm rather obsessed in our
colleague, David Spiegel,

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.710
Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.540
is obsessed with this question of,

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.003
how humans can start to
mitigate their own stress?

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.840
What do you think about stress mitigation

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.370
and what should we do as
individuals and as families

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.760
and as a culture to try
and encourage people

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.540
to mitigate their stress, but in ways

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.210
that are not going to turn
us into rat number two,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.560
where we're being forced
to mitigate our own stress

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.890
and therefore it becomes
more stressful. [laughs]

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.740
- And what you see is, rat number one gets

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.060
all the benefits of exercise.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:34.130
Rat number two gets all the
downsides of severe stress

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.750
with the same exact muscle expenditure

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.520
and movements going on.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.170
Perfectly yoked, great example

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.080
that it's the interpretation on your head.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.840
And I haven't kept up
with that literature,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.030
but I'll bet you, rat number two

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.250
is having a whole lot more
activity in its amygdala

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.653
than is rat number one.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.040
Okay, so stress mitigation.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.720
Anything I should say here
I should preface with,

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.910
I'm reasonably good at telling people

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.810
what's going to happen if they
don't manage their stress,

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.500
but I'm terrible at actually
like managing stress

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.640
or advising how to manage that.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.210
I'm much better with the
bad news aspect of it.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:23.210
But what you see is, by now
just a classic literature,

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.910
half a century old, sort of showing

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.470
what are the building blocks of stress.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.450
Not, ooh, you step outside

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.060
and you've been gored by an elephant,

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.930
and can you grow from your experience?

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.670
And what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.300
In that you could have a stress response,

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.720
but you're in the realm of the gray zone

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.960
of ambiguous social
interactions, that sort of thing.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.057
Some people have massive stress responses,

00:44:51.057 --> 00:44:53.800
others not at all, in between, enjoy it.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.620
Like what are the building blocks of,

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.180
what makes psychological stress stressful?

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.413
And the first one is exactly

00:45:00.413 --> 00:45:03.710
what is brought up by that running study.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.510
Do you have a sense of control?

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:10.390
A sense of control makes
stressors less stressful.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.570
And the running wheel shows
that or studies where you,

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:18.410
you lab rat or you
college freshman volunteer

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.630
have been trained that
by pressing a lever,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.880
you're less likely to get a shock.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.840
And today you're at the
lever they're working away

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.720
and unbeknownst to you the
lever has been turned off,

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.270
and it has no effect on shock frequency,

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.600
but because you think
you have some control,

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.480
you have less of a stress response.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.080
If you were a rat and doing
this day-in and day-out,

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.170
you're less likely to get an ulcer.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.010
So a sense of control.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:46.410
And related to that is a
sense of predictability.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.480
Rat get shocked, human
gets shocked, whatever,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.210
and the scenario either is
the shocks come now and then,

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.750
or the shocks come now and then,

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.120
and 10 seconds before a
little warning light comes on.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.980
And when you get the warning light,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.300
the shocks are distressful.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.060
You got predictability

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.520
because if you're not
getting warning lights,

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.120
any second you could be a half second away

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.350
from the next shock.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.050
You get a warning light,

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.980
and you know that if there isn't one,

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.970
you've got at least 10
seconds worth of relaxation.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.020
You know what's coming,

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.470
you can prepare your coping responses,

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:26.620
and best of all afterward you
know when you're finally safe,

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.650
when you can recover from it.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.373
And that's enormously protective.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.390
Others outlet for frustration,

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:37.600
you take a rat who is getting shocked,

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.690
and if it could run on a running wheel,

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.220
that's a protective thing,
that's doing it voluntarily.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:47.330
If you've got a rat and he
can gnaw on a bar of wood,

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.150
a stressor is less stressful.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.260
Unfortunately, if you have
a rat or primate or human

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.970
and they're stressed, the
ability to aggressively dump on

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.250
somebody smaller and weaker

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.440
also reduces the stress response.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:08.440
And the fact that displacement
aggression reduces stress

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.960
accounts for a huge percent
triggers like unhappiness.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.130
So all of those are variables,
get social support as well.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.980
That's a good one.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.990
Interpreting circumstances is being

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.420
good news rather than bad.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.800
Hurray, so you've got this very simple

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.790
sort of like take home recipe of go out

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.890
and get as much control
and as much predictability

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:32.490
and as many outlets and as much
social support as possible,

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:33.980
and you're going to do just fine.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.270
And you go out and do that,

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:38.010
and that's a recipe for total disaster

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:41.660
because it's much, much
more subtle than that.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.020
In one great example, okay,
so you're getting shocks,

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.150
you want a warning beforehand,

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.760
get a little warning light
10 seconds before each shock,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.323
it's wonderfully protective.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.890
Get a warning light one
second before the shock

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.110
doesn't do anything.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.490
There's not enough time for you to get

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:03.430
the psychological benefits
of the anticipation.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.340
Now instead, gets the
little warning coming on

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.980
two minutes before each shock,

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.960
and it's going to make things worse

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.580
because you're not going to
be sitting there like reveling

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.910
and sort of your sense of predictability,

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.320
and it's soon going to be, oh.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.700
You're going to be sitting
there for two minutes saying,

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.400
damn, here it comes.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.860
Predictive information only
works in a narrow domain.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.830
Similarly, control.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.330
Do you want to have a sense of
control on the face of stress?

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.330
And the answer is, only if it
is a mild to moderate stressor

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:43.230
because what's happening then,

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.480
your sense of control is
completely independent

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.240
of the reality of whether
you have control or not,

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.740
but in the face of mild
to moderate stressors,

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.780
a sense of control gets interpreted as,

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.610
wow, look how much worse
things could have been.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.340
Thank God, I have control,

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.880
I'm on top of this to master my fate.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.370
In contrast, if it's a major stressor,

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:08.300
all that arbitrary sense of control does

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.410
is make you think,

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:13.500
oh my God, look how much
better it could have been.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.847
I could have prevented it.

00:49:14.847 --> 00:49:16.890
And we all know that intuitively

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.430
like we do that in the face
of people's worst stressors.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.430
Nobody could have stopped the car

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.980
the way the kids suddenly jumped out.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.210
It wouldn't have mattered

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:30.090
and if you had gotten them
to the doctor a month ago,

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.360
instead of now, it
wouldn't have made any...

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.390
You didn't actually have any control.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.240
And what you see is,

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.950
you absolutely want to have
a huge sense of control

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.990
over mild to moderate stressors,

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.480
and especially ones that
result in a good outcome.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.230
Hooray, for me, and in the
face of horrible stressors,

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:54.830
what you want to do is
like self-deception,

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:58.300
and like truth and beauty
don't necessarily go

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.420
hand-in-hand at that point.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.950
And that's why stress management
techniques impact control

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.740
and predictability wind up
being far worse than neutral

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.000
if you're preaching that
to somebody homeless

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.350
or somebody with terminal cancer,

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.980
or somebody who is a refugee.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.530
Tell a neurotic middle-class person

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:20.820
that they have the psychological tools

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.440
to turn hell into heaven.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.030
And there's some truth to that.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:26.760
Do the same thing to somebody

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.070
who is going through a real hell,

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:32.577
and that's just privileged heartlessness

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:37.430
to do that because that doesn't work.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.070
More and more outlets, if
your outlets are damaging,

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:43.130
that's not a good way to mitigate stress.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:46.680
Social support, if you're
confusing mere acquaintances

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.380
for real social support,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.750
you're going to have the rug pulled out

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.280
from under you at some point.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.380
If you're mistaking
social support for being,

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.450
going and bitching and moaning
and demanding supportiveness

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:00.340
from everyone around you
rather than you doing

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.020
some of that reciprocally,

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.293
that's not going to work very well either.

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.600
It's not simple.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.660
It's not for nothing that
lots of us are really lousy.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.170
It, like being good friends
and things like that,

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.720
and why it takes a lot
of work to do it right?

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.250
Because you do it wrong

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.300
and it may temporarily
seem like a great thing,

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:29.380
but when it turns out to be
completely misplaced faith,

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.113
you're going to be feeling
worse than before you started.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.013
- Interesting.

00:51:34.013 --> 00:51:35.830
These days, there's a lot of interest in

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:38.580
using physical practices
to mitigate stress,

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:41.030
trying to get out of the ruminating,

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:45.410
and to some extent take
control of neural circuits

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.350
in the brain by using exercise

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:51.370
and using breathing and hypnosis.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:55.313
And, of course, hypnosis has
a mental component as well.

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:59.410
What are your thoughts
on stress mitigation

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:00.520
from the standpoint of,

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.460
okay, so we don't want
to be rat number two,

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.380
we want to select something for ourselves,

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.730
so we have to take the
initiative for ourselves.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.410
Being forced into exercising is not,

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:13.280
it could actually have
negative health effect perhaps.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.020
So we need to pick something that we like,

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.633
we need to take control of it.

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.730
In terms of supporting other people,

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.110
you touched on that a bit.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.080
What is the best way to
support other people?

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.690
Is it to talk about the stressful thing?

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:27.680
I mean, I'm not asking you
to play psychologist here,

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.450
but I find divergent data on this.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.800
We can spin ourselves up into a lather

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.750
by ruminating on something.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:41.140
And language seems to me
like it's a wonderful tool,

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.670
but it's also a fairly deprived tool

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.940
because it doesn't really get into

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.670
the core of our physiology

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.940
like something like breathing would.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.873
So what are your thoughts on more,

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.530
for lack of a better way to
put it, more head-centered,

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.610
cognitive approaches to stress mitigation

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:00.450
versus kind of going
at the core physiology.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.340
Cold showers now are even
a thing to some extent

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.370
just to get people stress acclimated,

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.323
voluntarily taking cold showers.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.030
- That makes some sense physiologically,

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:16.450
preconditioning for when
the real stressors come.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:18.553
In terms of what you bring up,

00:53:18.553 --> 00:53:22.780
oh, transcendental meditation,
mindfulness, exercise,

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.780
prayer, sort of reflecting on gratitude,

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.390
all that sort of thing.

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:32.760
Collectively they work on the average,

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.320
they work in terms of,
they can lower heart rate

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.920
and cholesterol levels and have
all sorts of good outcomes,

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.060
but they compromise us.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.820
One is exactly the caveat

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.920
that comes out of the
running wheel study is,

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.230
it doesn't matter how
many of your friends swear

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:50.460
by the stress management technique.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.390
If doing it makes you want to scream

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.850
your head off after 10 seconds,

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:56.610
that's not the one that's
going to work for you.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:00.460
So read the fine print
and the testimonials,

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.953
but it's got to be something
that works for you.

00:54:01.953 --> 00:54:06.740
Another one is the stress
management type techniques

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:11.200
that work, you can't save
them for the weekend,

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.160
you can't save them for
when you're stuck on

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.080
hold on the phone with
Muzak for two minutes.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.430
It's got to be something where
you stop what you're doing

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.460
and do it virtually,
daily or every other day,

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.320
and spend 20, 30 minutes doing it.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.990
And what you see coming
out of that is this

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:32.641
like 80/20 rule from economics.

00:54:32.641 --> 00:54:35.740
80/20, 80% of the complaints
in the store come from

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.703
20% of the customers, things like that.

00:54:37.703 --> 00:54:41.480
What you see is, if your
entire life consists of

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.290
every single thing on your shoulders,

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:48.740
that you can't say no to 24/7.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.210
If you've stopped that and finally said,

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:54.400
my wellbeing is important enough

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.450
that I'm finally get to
say no to some of the stuff

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:57.830
that I can't say no to.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.580
And I'm going to do it
every day for 20 minutes,

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.500
whatever stress management technique

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.270
you then do in those 20
minutes sort of who knows what,

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.740
you're already 80% of the way there

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:13.380
simply by having decided your
wellbeing is important enough

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.910
that you're going to stop every single day

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.730
and have that as a priority.

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.360
And that's exactly the same finding

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.060
that you find people with
chronic depression untreated

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.090
that merely calling and
getting an appointment

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.240
to see a mental health professional,

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.670
people start feeling better already

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.480
because it's evidence that
you've been activated,

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.170
and you matter enough to do this,

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.180
and you could conceive
that this would actually

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.970
have a good outcome rather
than a hopeless one.

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.970
Just doing something meditative

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:47.820
or reflective every day or so,

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:52.050
and it hardly even matters
which one you're doing.

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.130
And what comes out of that
is thus another warning,

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.630
which is do not trust anybody who says,

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.770
it has been scientifically proven

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.280
that their brand of stress management

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.990
works better than the other ones.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.150
Just watch your wallet at that point.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:09.090
- Yeah, amen.

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:12.150
I think one of the core goals of my lab

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:13.480
and David Spiegel's lab,

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.650
and I know you've worked with David

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.550
and published papers with David as well

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.400
is to really try and find out

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.220
what are the various
entry points to this thing

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.930
that we call the autonomic nervous system

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:23.890
and the stress system,

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.720
and these systems that when gone unchecked

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.800
really can take us down a dark path.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.020
And the idea that there
are so many entry points

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.540
is really the one that keeps,

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.500
what the data keep telling
us over and over again.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:39.100
So there's no magic
breathing tool or exercise,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.730
it's any variety of those or one of those.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:44.640
And, again, we come back to this idea

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.910
that it's the one that you select

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.630
and the one that you make space for,

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.730
and it's the one that you hopefully enjoy

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:54.240
that's going to work best
in terms of physiology.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.860
- And [mumbles] benign for those people

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.470
who were stuck around you.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:00.380
- Right, right, absolutely.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.160
And that brings me to this question of,

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:08.160
I find it amazing that
how we perceive an event,

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:12.260
and whether or not we chose
to be in that event or not

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:16.200
can have such incredible different effects

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.530
on circuitry of the brain
and circuitry of the body

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.133
and biology of cells.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.080
And in some ways it boggles my mind,

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.750
like how can a decision made presumably

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:28.440
with the prefrontal cortex,

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.300
although other parts of the brain as well,

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.430
how can that change
essentially the polarity

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:36.300
of a response in the body.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.160
And, I mean, you've talked before

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.920
about Type A personalities in there.

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.830
We don't have to go into
all the detail there

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.660
for sake of time, but it is interesting

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.310
that the effects of endothelial cells.

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:49.170
I mean, literally of the size of, [laughs]

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:53.330
of the portals for blood
are in opposite direction,

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.150
depending on whether or not somebody

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:58.530
wants to be in a situation
as a highly motivated person.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:01.140
Maybe you could just give
us the top contour of that

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.240
because I think it really illustrates

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.880
this principle so beautifully.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.920
And then maybe if you would,
you could just speculate on

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.590
how the brain might
have this switch to turn

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.630
one experience from terrible to beneficial

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:20.100
or from beneficial to terrible,
it's really fascinating.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:24.220
- Well, all you need to do is like tonight

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.510
before you're going to sleep

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:29.220
and you're lying in bed
and you're nice and drowsy

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.720
and your heart's beating nice and slow,

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.450
you start thinking about the fact that

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.653
that heart isn't going to beat forever.

00:58:36.653 --> 00:58:37.486
[Andrew laughs]

00:58:37.486 --> 00:58:41.250
And imagine your toes
getting cold afterward

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:44.450
and imagine the flow of
blood coming to a halt

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.393
and all of you clotting.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.730
You're going to be doing
something with your physiology

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:52.870
at that point that 99% of
mammals out there only do

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:54.850
if they're running frantically.

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:56.530
And you're going to be turning on your

00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:58.440
sympathetic stress response with thought,

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.490
with emotions, with memory.

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:05.490
And the measure of that is
just how much the cortex

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:09.110
and the limbic system
sends projections down

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:12.590
to all the autonomic
regulators in the brain.

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:17.360
You can think autonomic
regulatory neurons into action

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.510
in ways that only other animals can do

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:24.150
with like extremes of
environmental circumstances.

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:27.960
And given that and the autonomic rule,

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.470
I mean, the other big
challenge in understanding it

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:34.200
is gigantic individual differences.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.543
And that's,

00:59:37.793 --> 00:59:40.860
when you talk about the
optimal amount of stress,

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.440
the counts of stimulation,

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:46.700
and in general that stress
that's not too severe

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.204
and doesn't go on for too long

00:59:48.204 --> 00:59:50.230
and there is overall in
a benevolence setting.

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:53.210
And under those conditions,
we'd love being stressed

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:56.610
by something unexpected and
out of control predictability

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:58.900
like a really interesting plot turn

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.380
in the movie you're watching.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.780
That's great, but you get
the individual differences

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.050
that somehow has to accommodate the fact

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:09.890
that for some people, the
perfect stimulatory amount

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:12.840
of stress is like getting up early

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.810
for an Audubon birdwatching
walk next Sunday morning.

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:18.890
And for somebody else,
it's signing up to be

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.320
like a mercenary in Yemen.
[Andrew laughs]

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.730
And tremendous individual differences

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:28.800
that swamp any simple prescriptions.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.600
- Yeah, the prefrontal cortex,
this thinking machinery

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.940
that we all harbor, it's
such a double-edged sword.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.440
And what's remarkable to me is,

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.070
how the areas of the brain
like the hypothalamus

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.500
and the amygdala, they're
sort of like switches.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.140
I mean, there is context
and there is gain control.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.550
You talked about the gain
control by testosterone, etc.,

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:53.810
but they're really like switches.

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.640
I mean, if you stimulate
ventromedial hypothalamus,

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.540
you get the right neurons,

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.060
an animal will try and kill even an object

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.893
that's sitting next to it.

01:01:00.893 --> 01:01:02.220
You tickle some other neurons,

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.260
it'll try and mate with that same object.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.970
I mean, it's really wild.

01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:09.500
I think there are probably
rules to prefrontal cortex also,

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.560
but it sounds like the context plural

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.810
from which prefrontal cortex can draw from

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:20.970
is probably infinite, so
that we could probably learn

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:22.760
to perceive threat in anything.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.930
Whether or not it's another group

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.040
or whether or not it's science

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.720
or whether or not it's
somebody's version of

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.210
the shape of the earth versus another.

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:33.880
I mean, it's like, you can
plug in anything to this system

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.340
and give it enough data,

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.900
and I think it sounds like you
could drive a fear response

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.130
or a love response.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.620
Is that overstepping?

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:44.510
- Or [laughs] a mixed
horribly ambivalent one

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:47.165
that is changing by the millisecond,

01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:49.990
and then like could be
mutually contradictory.

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.637
No, that's absolutely the case

01:01:51.637 --> 01:01:53.460
in the prefrontal cortex,

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:58.460
I more than once have regretted
having like wasted 30 years

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.873
of my life studying the hippocampus

01:02:00.873 --> 01:02:03.710
then I shoot him and studied
the prefrontal cortex

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:06.450
because it's so much more
interesting what it does,

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:09.490
and it's all this contextual stuff.

01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:11.700
It's all the ways in which

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.320
it's not okay to lie in this setting,

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.470
but it's a great thing in another.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.690
It's not okay to kill
unless you do it to them,

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:20.670
and then you get a medal.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.330
It's not, all of this social context

01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:29.140
and moral relativity and
situational ethic stuff,

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.670
that's the prefrontal cortex

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.070
that's got to master that.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:37.010
And that winds up meaning
that's the place in your brain

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:42.010
more than anywhere where you
say your perception of things

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.500
can powerfully influence the reality

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.350
of what's coming into you.
- Yeah.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.183
- I mean,

01:02:48.193 --> 01:02:51.510
a great example, just
harking back to testosterone.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.930
Okay, so exercise boosts
up testosterone levels.

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:57.740
Does exercise and success do it more

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.040
than exercise and failure?

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.600
A literature back in the 80s or so

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.100
looking at outcomes of marathons.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.140
Did testosterone rise more in the people

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.190
who win than the losers?

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:10.710
Wrestling matches.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.960
Things of that sort
with a simple prediction

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.340
and the answer wound up being,

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.660
you didn't see a simple answer.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.710
Okay, you win the marathon,

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:21.510
that's not necessarily a predictor

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:23.190
of increased testosterone.

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.670
What's that about?

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:29.670
And then you find like the
winner testosterone decreases,

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.950
and you find out the guy who came in 73rd

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.920
is having a massive testosterone increase.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.860
Whoa, what's that about?

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.550
What's that about is
far more human subtlety.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:44.070
The guy who won the race has
a decline in testosterone

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.060
because he came in three minutes later

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.350
than he really, really was expecting.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:50.770
And everybody now is
going to be writing it up

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.740
about how he's over the hill.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.550
And the guy who came in 73rd

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:56.470
is having a boost of testosterone

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.280
because he was assuming he'd
be dead from a heart attack

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.360
by the third mile,
[Andrew laughs]

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.540
and instead he managed to finish.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.040
It's this interpretive
stuff going on in there,

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.350
and that's what prefrontal
cortex is about.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:13.113
- Amazing, it raises this
question of cognitive flexibility,

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.010
Can we tell ourselves that
something is good for us

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:20.710
even if we're not enjoying it?

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.660
And can we wriggle around these corners of

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.970
choosing the exercise or doing the...

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.430
Personally I'm not a big fan
of long bouts of meditation,

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.790
but I've benefited
tremendously from things like

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:40.240
dedicated breathing and
shorter rounds of meditation.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.780
Can I tell myself that it's good for me

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.330
and wriggle around the corner

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:46.690
and get my physiology
working the way I want?

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:48.580
Do we have cognitive flexibility?

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.040
Can I be that third place
runner and tell myself,

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.590
well, at least I came in,
I wanted to win so badly.

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.000
That was my primary goal,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.300
but another goal was to
beat my previous time,

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.420
and I did do that.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.680
And so, [laughs] I mean, it's...

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:09.130
To what extent can we
toggle this relationship

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:11.150
between the prefrontal cortex

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:14.440
and these other more primitive systems?

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.973
- Well, an enormous amount.

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:23.290
For example, being low in a hierarchy

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:26.780
is generally bad for health in
like every mammal out there,

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.380
including us, but we do something special,

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.100
which is we can be part
of multiple hierarchies

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.490
at the same time.

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.340
And while you maybe low
ranking in one of them,

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.920
you could be extremely
high ranking in another,

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.000
you're like have the crappiest
job in your corporation,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.590
but you are the captain
of the softball team

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:48.150
this year for the company.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.950
And you better bet that's somebody

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:51.910
who is going to find all sorts of ways

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.510
to decide that nine to
five Monday to Fridays,

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:56.600
just stupid paying the bills.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.590
And what really matters is
the prestige on the weekend.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:04.600
You're poorer, but you're the
deacon of your church here.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.090
And so we can play all sorts of

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:07.930
psychological games with that.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:12.210
One of the most like consistent,
reliable ones that we do

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:15.570
and need to use the frontal
cortex like crazy is,

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.510
somebody does something rotten

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.370
and you need to attribute it.

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.293
And the answer is, they
did something wrong,

01:06:22.293 --> 01:06:23.980
hmm, because they're rotten.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.830
Always have been

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:28.240
or always will be this
constitutional explanation.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.360
You do something rotten to somebody,

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.350
and how do you explain it afterward?

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:34.080
A situational one.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.130
I was tired, I was stressed
in this sort of setting,

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:40.280
I misunderstood this.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.950
We're best at excusing
ourselves from bad things

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:46.570
because we have access to our inner lives

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.440
and we've got prefrontal cortexes

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.370
that are great at coming up
with a situational explanation

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:54.580
rather than, hey, maybe you're just

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:57.900
like a selfish rotten
human, you need to change.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:02.490
And that's all prefrontal cortex,
and we do that every time,

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:07.080
we don't let somebody merge
in the lane in front of us,

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.760
even though you curse somebody

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.870
who does the same thing to you and...

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:13.783
Endlessly.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.183
- I love it.

01:07:16.183 --> 01:07:18.970
Your statement about the
fact that we can select

01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:21.283
multiple hierarchies to participate in.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.900
To me it seems like a particularly
important one nowadays

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.970
with social media being so prevalent.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:31.350
I know you're not particularly
active on social media

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.590
although you might be pleasantly,

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.410
or I don't know unpleasantly
surprised to find out

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:37.970
that there's a lot of
positive discussion about you

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:40.270
and your work, so you don't
even need to be on there.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:43.440
We'll just continue to
discuss [laughs] your work.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.470
But what's interesting about
social media I've found

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:49.200
is that the context is very, very broad.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.170
I mean, one could argue that
who one selects to follow

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.040
and which news articles
you're reading, etc.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.240
can create a kind of a
funneling of information

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.440
that itself can be dangerous.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.680
More verification of crazy ideas

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.323
or even just less exposure to new ideas.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.130
But there's also this idea

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:11.100
that social media is an
incredibly broad context.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.880
So as you scroll through
a feed, it's no longer

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.810
like being in your eighth grade classroom

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:18.630
or your office or your faculty meeting.

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:21.480
You are being exposed to thousands,

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.960
if not millions of contexts,
this meal, that soccer game,

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.210
this person's body,
this person's intellect.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.740
YouTube is another example.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:34.939
It's a vast, vast landscape.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:37.640
So the context is completely mishmash

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.190
whereas I'm assuming we evolved.

01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:41.810
I think we did evolve under contexts

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.500
that were much more constrained.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.640
We interacted with a limited
number of individuals

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.820
and a limited number of different domains,

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.280
seasons tended to be constrain us all.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.090
Of course, then we got
phones and televisions,

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:54.180
and this started to expand,

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:58.330
but now more than ever, our
brain, our prefrontal cortex

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:00.200
and our sense of where we exist

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.620
in these multiple hierarchies

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.670
has essentially wicked out into infinity.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:08.750
How do you think this might be interacting

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:12.310
with some of these more primitive systems

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:16.000
and other aspects of our biology?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.710
- Well, I think what you get is,

01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:20.870
in some ways the punchline of,

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:24.600
what's most human about humans,

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.670
which is over and over we
use the exact same blueprint,

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:33.130
the same hormones, the same
kinases, the same receptors,

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:37.000
the same, everything were built
out of the exact same stuff

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.060
as all these other species out there,

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.760
and then we go and use it
in a completely novel way.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:47.410
And usually in terms of being able to

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:51.840
abstract stuff over space
and time in dramatic ways.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.080
So, okay, you're a low ranking baboon

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.850
and you can feel badly because
you just like killed a rabbit

01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:59.810
and you're about to eat

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:01.930
and some higher ranking guy boots you off

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.560
and takes it away from you,

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.800
and you feel crummy and it's
stressful and you're unhappy.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.530
We are doing the exact same
things with like our brain

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:15.980
and bodies when we're losing
a sense of self-esteem,

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.960
but we can do it by watching a
movie character on the screen

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.580
and feeling inadequate
compared to like how wonderful

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.100
or attractive they are.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.500
We can do it by somebody driving past us

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.420
in an expensive car, and we
don't even see their face,

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.963
and you can feel belittled by
your own socioeconomic status.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.040
You can watch like the
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.770
or read about what Bezos is up to.

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:47.590
And for some reason, decide
your life is less fulfilling

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:50.730
because you didn't fly
into space for 11 minutes.

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:54.910
And so you can feel miserable
about yourself in ways

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:57.490
that no other organism can,

01:10:57.490 --> 01:11:02.330
simply because we can have
our meaningful social networks

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:06.010
include like the party you're
reading about on Facebook

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:07.700
that you weren't invited to

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.480
because it's taking place in Singapore,

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.920
and you don't know any of those people,

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.350
but nonetheless, somehow
that could be a means for you

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:18.510
to feel less content with
who you've turned out to be.

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:20.560
Do you take steps in your own life

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.680
to actively restrict the contexts

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.290
in which you think and
live and contemplate

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.810
in order to enhance your creative life,

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.083
your intellectual life?

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.663
Are those steps that you actively take?

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.680
- Well, I very actively
don't know how to make use

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.440
of anything [laughs] with social media.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.640
So I guess that counts as my having thus

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.087
actively chosen not to learn how.

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:55.830
So that's the case certainly
for the last year and a half,

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:58.650
like lots of people, I've
gone through stretches

01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:01.850
where I've managed to sort
of enforce a moratorium

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:06.290
on looking at the news, and
that was wonderfully freeing.

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:08.473
I think in the larger sense though,

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:12.680
in addition to me being a neurobiologist,

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.470
I'd sort of spent decades
spending part of each year

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:20.030
studying wild baboons out in a
national park in East Africa.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:24.300
And I'd spend three months
a year without electricity,

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.470
without phone calls,
with going 12 hours a day

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.600
without saying a word to somebody.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.900
And when I finally would,
it would be somebody

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.313
nomadic pastoralist guy
in a different language.

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:42.150
Yeah, I did 90% of my
like insightful thinking

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:44.240
about anything in the laboratory

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.030
during those three months each year,

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:50.150
and not one in the lab, and
not when inundated with stuff.

01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:53.170
- Well, I think there is a shifting trend

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:57.550
towards trying to create a
narrowing of context that...

01:12:57.550 --> 01:13:00.960
And I like what I see, I have
a niece, she's 14-years-old

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.550
and she and her friends are very good

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:04.200
at putting their phones away.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.210
They say, we're not
going to have our phones

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:09.200
for this interaction, especially after...

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.770
And I realized we're
still somewhat in this.

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:13.290
It's unclear where it's headed,

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.610
but 2020 was so restrictive

01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:17.490
and she was so separated from her friends.

01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.580
Now it's, let's really
focus on being together

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.390
and not bring in all these
other elements from our phones.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:26.520
And that brings me great hope for

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.720
that generation, [laughs]
maybe they will...

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.610
Or who knows, maybe they'll
run off and study baboons,

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:33.823
we need more field researchers.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.880
So along the lines of choice,

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.680
I'd like to shift gears slightly

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.060
and talk about freewill,

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:43.743
about our ability to make choices at all.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:49.750
- Well, my personal way out in left field

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:53.080
inflammatory stance is,

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.430
I don't think we have a shred of freewill

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.800
despite 95% of philosophers.

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:05.470
And I think probably the
majority of neuroscientists

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:07.680
are saying that we have freewill

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.460
in at least some circumstances.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.900
I don't think there's any at all.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.373
And the reason for this is,

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.430
you do something,

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:20.550
you behave, you make a choice, whatever.

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:23.560
And to understand why you did that,

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.943
where did that intention come from?

01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:30.470
Part of it was due to like
the sensory environment

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.600
you were in the previous minute.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.430
Some of it is from the hormone levels

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:36.460
in your bloodstream that morning.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.360
Some of it is from whether
you had a wonderful

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.040
or stressful last three months

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.480
and what sort of neuroplasticity happened.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.620
Part of it is what hormone levels

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.020
you were exposed to as a fetus.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.740
Part of it is what culture
your ancestors came up with,

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.260
and thus how you were
parented when you were a kid.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.970
All of those are in there,

01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.690
and you can understand where
behavior is coming from

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:02.513
without incorporating all of those.

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:05.133
And at that point,

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.500
not only are there all of
these relevant factors,

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.170
but they're ultimately all one factor.

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:17.310
If you're talking about what evolution

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:19.110
has to do with your behavior,

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:22.240
by definition you're also
talking about genetics.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.010
If you're talking about what your genes

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:27.350
have to do with behavior, by
definition you're talking about

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:29.150
how your brain was constructed

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.330
or what proteins are coded for.

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:35.830
If you're talking about
like your mood disorder now,

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.010
you're talking about the sense of efficacy

01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:39.790
you were getting as a five-year-old.

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:41.100
They're all intertwined.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.270
And when you look at all those influences,

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:48.170
basically like the challenge is,

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:52.430
show me a neuron that
just caused that behavior,

01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:54.180
or show me a network of neurons

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:55.910
that just caused that behavior.

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:59.990
And show me that nothing
about what they just did

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:04.090
was influenced by anything
from the sensory environment

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:07.252
one second ago to the
evolution of your species.

01:16:07.252 --> 01:16:12.252
And there's no space in there
to fit in a freewill concept

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.080
that winds up being in your
brain, but not of your brain.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:22.000
There's simply no wiggle
room for it there.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.210
- So I can appreciate that our behaviors

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:28.400
and our choices are the
consequences of a long line

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:32.390
of dominoes that fell
prior to that behavior.

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:37.290
But is it possible that I can intervene in

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:40.163
the domino effect, so to speak.

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:44.560
In other words, can my
recognition of the fact

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.830
that genes have heritability,

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:50.400
there is an epigenome that,
there is a hormonal context,

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.983
there is a historical context.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:56.370
Can the knowledge of that give me some

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.510
small shard of freewill?

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:02.730
Meaning, does it allow me to say, ah,

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:07.200
okay, I accept that my choices
are somewhat predetermined,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.050
and yet knowing that gives me

01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:13.160
some additional layer of control?

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.420
Is there any philosophical
or biological universe

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.653
in which that works?

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.433
- Nah.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:28.820
All of that can produce the
wonderfully positive belief

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:30.963
that change can happen.

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.640
Even a traumatic change, even
in the worst of circumstances,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.670
most unlikely people,
and change can happen,

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:39.850
things can change.

01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:42.120
Don't be fatalistic, don't decide

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.370
because we're a mechanistic,
biological machines

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:47.080
that nothing can ever...

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.430
Change can happen,

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:52.000
but where people go off the rails

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:57.860
is translating that into,
we can change ourselves.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.500
We don't, we can't because
there's no freewill.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:07.090
However, we can be
changed by circumstance.

01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:10.750
And the point of it is,

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:15.530
like you look at an Aplysia, a sea slug

01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:18.060
that has learned to retract its gill

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.810
in response to a shock on its tail,

01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:24.710
you can do like conditioning,
Pavlovian conditioning on it,

01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:27.980
and it has learned, its
behavior has been changed

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.140
by its environment.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.410
And you hear news about something like

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:35.933
horrifically depressing going on,

01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:41.620
and refugees in wherever.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:45.860
And as a result, you feel
a little bit more helpless

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.940
and a less of a sense of
efficacy in the world,

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:53.280
and both of your behaviors
have been changed.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.200
Okay, okay, yeah, I guess that,

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.200
but the remarkable thing is,

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.430
it's the exact same neurobiology.

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:04.410
The signal transduction
pathways that were happening

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:09.410
in that sea snail incorporate
the exact same kinases

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.930
and proteases and phosphatases

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:16.210
that we do when you're having
mammalian fear conditioning,

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:20.090
or when you're alert, it's conserved.

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:23.140
It's the exact same thing,
it's simply playing out

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.200
in obviously a much, much fancier domain.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:31.200
And because you have learned

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.290
that change is possible

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:36.330
despite understanding mechanistically

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:39.690
that we can't change
ourselves volitionally,

01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:42.390
but because you understand
change is possible,

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:46.020
you have just changed
the ability of your brain

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.620
to respond to optimistic stimuli.

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.150
And you have changed the
ability of your brain

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.420
to now send you in the
direction of being exposed to

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:57.590
more information that will seem cheerful

01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:59.160
rather than depressing.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.040
Oh my God, that's amazing,

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.470
what Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther king

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:05.940
and all these folks did.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.490
Wow, under the most
adverse of circumstances,

01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:09.840
they were able to do.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.970
Maybe I can also, maybe I can go read more

01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:17.450
about people like them to
get even more data points

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:20.620
of change the neurochemistry,

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.550
so that your responses are different now.

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:27.690
And you're tilted a little
bit more in that direction

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:29.660
of feeling like you can make a difference

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:32.350
instead of it's all damn hopeless.

01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:34.480
So enormous change can happen,

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.230
but the last thing that
could come out of a view of,

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:41.670
we are nothing more or less
than the sum of our biology

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.690
and its interactions with environment,

01:20:43.690 --> 01:20:45.567
is to throw up your hands and say,

01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:48.603
and thus it's no use
trying to change anything.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.260
- So we can acknowledge that
change is extremely hard

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.390
to impossible, that
circumstances can change,

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:59.840
and yet that striving to
be better human beings

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.610
is still a worthwhile endeavor.

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:04.160
Do I have that correct?
- Absolutely.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.550
Because simply the knowledge,
either from experience

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:12.760
or making it to the end of
the right neurobiology class

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.800
has taught you that change can happen

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.333
within a framework of a
mechanistic neurobiology.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.940
You were now more open
to being made optimistic

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.110
by the good news in the world around you.

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.597
You are more likely to be
inspired by this or that,

01:21:28.597 --> 01:21:32.520
you were more resistant to
getting discouraged by bad news,

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.940
simply because you now
understand it's possible.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.860
- Mm-hmm, yeah, somebody who spent

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.880
much of his career working
on the hippocampus,

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.970
I have to assume that you are
a believer in neuroplasticity,

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:46.820
that neural circuits can change
in response to experience,

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:49.810
and that some of the same
so-called top-down mechanisms

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:52.970
of prefrontal cortex that
we were talking about before

01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:54.100
can play a role there,

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.040
that the decision to try and change

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.540
and the pursuit of knowledge
and the pursuit of experience

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.070
can shape our circuitry,

01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:05.090
and therefore make us different
machines, so to speak.

01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.923
- Yeah.

01:22:05.923 --> 01:22:10.840
And not only can say
prenatal hormone exposure

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:14.130
changed the way your brain
is being constructed,

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:17.330
but learning that
prenatal hormone exposure

01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:19.580
can change the construction of your brain

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.990
will change your brain right now,

01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:26.210
and how you think about where
your intentions came from.

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:29.120
Wow, maybe that had
something to do with it.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.080
The knowledge of the
knowledge is an effector

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.203
in and of itself.

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.900
- That's such an important and
powerful statement to hear.

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.370
I think that many people
think that if a tool,

01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:47.370
if it doesn't involve
a pill or a protocol,

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.870
that it's useless.

01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:51.620
And certainly there
are pills and protocols

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.710
that are very useful
in a variety of context

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:57.930
for a variety of things, but
the idea that knowledge itself,

01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:01.680
whereas you put it, knowledge
of knowledge is itself a tool,

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.680
I think is a very important
concept for people

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.100
to embed in their minds.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:11.080
And, listen, I'm so
grateful for this discussion

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.160
and for you raising these topics.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.683
I think that people,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.750
many people know your work
on testosterone, on stress,

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:19.940
and we've covered some of that today,

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:24.010
the work on freewill and this
idea that we are hopeless

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.093
or that we are in total control.

01:23:28.431 --> 01:23:30.270
I think I'm realizing in listening to you

01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:35.270
that it's neither is true,
and that the solution resides

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.610
in understanding more about freewill

01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:43.033
and lack of it, [laughs]
and also neuroplasticity.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.290
You're working on a book about freewill,

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:49.860
are you willing to tell us
a little bit about that book

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.330
and where you are in that process

01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:52.920
and what we can look forward to?

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:56.113
- Yeah, it's going really slow.

01:23:57.470 --> 01:24:02.470
Title is, "Determined: A Science
of Life Without Freewill."

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.530
And essentially the
first half of the book is

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:08.960
trying to convince a reader,

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.810
okay, if not that there's
no freewill whatsoever,

01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:15.400
but at least there's a lot
less than is normally assumed.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.570
And I'm going through all the

01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:19.490
standard arguments for freewill,

01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:24.490
and why that doesn't make sense
with 21st century science?

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:29.610
And that has led to reading
a lot of very frustrating

01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:34.610
philosophers who basically
are willing to admit

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:39.070
that stuff is made out of
like atoms and molecules.

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:42.140
And like there's a physical
reality sort of world,

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.240
they're not just relying on magic,

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.210
but that they believe in
freewill for magical reasons,

01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:50.150
and where it doesn't make sense.

01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:52.760
Okay, so the first half of the book is to

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.827
hopefully convince people that
there's much less freewill

01:24:54.827 --> 01:24:57.030
than we used to think.

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:59.940
And then the second half
is this gigantic juncture

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.960
built around the fact
that I haven't thought

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.070
there's any freewill since
I was like an adolescent.

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:08.280
And despite thinking that way,

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.500
I still have absolutely no idea

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:14.510
how you're supposed to
function with that belief.

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:18.140
How are you supposed to
go about everyday life

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:23.140
if anything you feel
entitled to isn't true?

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.660
If any angers and hatreds
you feel aren't justified,

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.530
if there's no such thing as appropriate,

01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:31.950
blame or punishment or praise or reward,

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:33.890
and none of it makes any sense,

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:37.210
and somebody like even
compliments you on your haircut,

01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:40.540
and you've been conditioned
to say, oh, thanks,

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.210
as if you had something to do.

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.310
How are we supposed to function with that?

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:50.823
And so the second half
is wrestling with that,

01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.980
and what the punchline there is,

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.120
is it's going to be incredibly hard.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.850
And if you think it's going to be hard

01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:03.730
to subtract a notion of freewill

01:26:03.730 --> 01:26:07.500
out of making sense of
like serial murderers,

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.460
it's going to be a thousand times harder

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:14.195
making sense of when somebody
says "good job" to you.

01:26:14.195 --> 01:26:16.130
[Andrew laughs]
And because it's the exact

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:21.130
same on reality of sort
of our interpretations.

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.690
It's going to be incredibly hard,

01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:27.520
but nonetheless when
you look at the history

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.520
of how we have subtracted
the notion of agency

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.430
out of all sorts of realms of
blame, starting with thinking

01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:41.510
that witches caused
hailstorms 500 years ago

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:45.500
to the notion that
psychodynamically screwed up mothers

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.440
cause schizophrenia, we've done it.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.640
We've done it endless number of times,

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.750
we've been able to subtract
out a sense of volition

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:57.760
in understanding how the
world works around us.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.980
And we don't have murderers
running amuck on the street,

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:04.440
and society hasn't
collapsed into a puddle,

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.203
and in fact, it's a more humane society.

01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:11.520
So the good news is it's possible

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.710
because we've done it
repeatedly in the past,

01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:16.760
but it's going to be hard as hell.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.127
And it's hard as hell to try
to write about that coherently,

01:27:20.127 --> 01:27:23.760
[laughs] I'm discovering,
so it's going slowly.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.430
- Well, I speak for many,
many people when I say

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:31.470
that we're really excited
for the book when it's done

01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.890
and we will patiently wait,

01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:37.490
but with great excitement
for the book, "Determined".

01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.940
You said it's the title, correct?

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:43.050
- Yeah, "Determined: The Science
of Life Without Freewill".

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:45.010
It seems like you can't
publish your book these days

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:48.680
without a sub-title, so that's it?

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.800
- Fantastic.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.920
Well, very excited to read the book.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.790
I'm very grateful to you
for this conversation today,

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:56.650
I learned a ton.

01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:58.130
Every time you speak I learn,

01:27:58.130 --> 01:28:00.060
and for me it's really been a pleasure

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.470
and a delight to interact with you today

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:07.080
and over the previous years,
I should say, as colleagues.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.880
And thank you again, Robert,
for everything that you do

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.750
and all the hard, hard work and thinking

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:13.780
that you put into your work

01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.820
because it's clear that
you put a lot of hard work

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:21.279
and thinking, and we all
benefit as a consequence.

01:28:21.279 --> 01:28:25.253
- Thanks, and thanks for
having me, this was a blast.

01:28:26.610 --> 01:28:28.540
- Thank you for joining
me for my conversation

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.550
with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:32.820

In addition, please check out the sponsors

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.420
that we mentioned at the
beginning of this podcast.

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.190
That's a terrific way to support us.

01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:56.560
And for those of you
that are interested in

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.150
supporting research on stress, on sleep,

01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:02.790
and how to better access
sleep and combat stress,

01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:04.780
you can do that by supporting the research

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:07.120
being done on those
topics in my laboratory.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.160
You can go to HubermanLab.stanford.edu,

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.850
and there you'll see a tab entitled,

01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:14.530
Support Research in the Huberman Lab.

01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:17.150
So that's for work at the
Huberman Lab at Stanford,

01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:18.750
not the Huberman Lab podcast.

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:20.340
And there's a Make a Donation tab

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.600
where you can make a
tax deductible donation.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.940
And if you're not already following

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.440
the Huberman Lab on Instagram,

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.260
please check out Huberman Lab
on Instagram and on Twitter.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.530
On both those channels, I
post information about science

01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:35.790
and science related tools
anywhere from one to five minutes.

01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:37.940
Some of that information
overlaps with the podcast,

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.010
but a lot of it is unique

01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:41.350
and different from the
information on this podcast.

01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:43.260
And last but not least,

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:44.971
thank you for your interest in science.

01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:47.554
