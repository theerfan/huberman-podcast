00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.983
for everyday life.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.830
My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.580
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.440
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.540
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.900
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.850
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.980
to bring you zero cost
to consumer information

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.910
about science and science-related tools.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.960
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.790
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.480
Our first sponsor is Headspace.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.910
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.070
I've been meditating on and
off now for about 30 years,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.610
although I confess more off than on.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.250
And that's because I think
like, for a lot of people,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.640
sticking to a meditation practice
can be pretty challenging.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940
I started using Headspace a few years ago

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.050
and I found that it's really allowed me to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500
stick to a meditation
practice on a regular basis.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.680
I meditate anywhere from
five to seven times a week.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.850
The app includes meditations

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.010
that are all backed by
scientific peer-reviewed studies.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.010
And it makes it really easy to start

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.700
and complete the meditations.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.140
I started using these
meditations while I was flying

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.410
a few years back.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.320
On JetBlue flights,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.080
they started offering
Headspace meditations.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.330
That's where I initially started.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.030
And then I moved over to the app,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.280
and I really enjoy it and I
derive great benefit from it.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.780
If you'd like to try Headspace,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.200
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.033
And if you do that,

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.450
you'll get all the meditations
that Headspace offers

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.020
for free for one month.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.190
That's headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.540
You get all the meditations for free,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.193
which is the best offer that

00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:37.260
they has available right now.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.410
So if you're interested
in it, check it out.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.660
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.470
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.100
probiotic drink.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.140
I started using Athletic Greens in 2012,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.840
and I've been using it
continuously ever since.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.083
I started using Athletic Greens because

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:56.540
I found it rather dizzying to know

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.690
which vitamins and minerals to take.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.750
And Athletic Greens allows me to get

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.270
the full base of all the
necessary vitamins and minerals

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.670
in one easy to consume drink.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.020
It also turns out that the
drink tastes quite good.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.280
I mix mine with some lemon
juice and some water,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.410
I drink it once or twice a day.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.160
The probiotics in Athletic
Greens are also important to me

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.780
because there are a lot
of data now supporting

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.440
the fact that the gut microbiome

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.590
is important for the gut-brain axis

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.610
for various aspects of cognitive function,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.060
immune function, metabolic function.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.430
There's just a huge number of things

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.160
that having a healthy gut microbiome

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.620
has been shown to be important for.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.340
So by taking Athletic Greens,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.990
I have that base covered as well.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.390
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.740
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.920
And if you do that,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.910
they'll give you a year supply
of liquid vitamin D3 K2.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.750
There are also a lot of data
now showing that vitamin D3

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.430
is very important for
a number of different

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.290
biological functions.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.510
In addition, they'll give
you five free travel packs

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.710
with your order.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.720
It can be difficult to mix
up powders while on the road,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.230
when in a car, or in a hotel,
or on a plane, et cetera.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.670
The travel packs make everything
really clean and easy.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.480
So you'll get the year
supply of vitamin D3 K2

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.960
plus the five free travel packs

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.730
if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.770
The third sponsor of
today's podcast is Madefor.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.200
Madefor is behavioral science company

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.790
that makes learning positive
habits and growth mindset easy.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.410
I've been involved with
Madefor since the beginning

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.130
as the lead of their scientific advisory.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.020
Other members of the
scientific advisory include,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.130
for instance, the head
of the chronobiology unit

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.200
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.660
as well as psychiatrists
from Harvard Medical School

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.120
and elsewhere, all of whom
are serious about science

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.260
and science-related tools

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.550
for developing positive
habits and growth mindset.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.610
The program is a 10 month-program,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.010
during which each month you
engage in a specific activity

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.890
designed to encourage and cultivate

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.260
positive habits and growth mindset.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.230
As well, we hold a monthly Zoom call,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.960
during which we discuss the
program, people's progress,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.190
and answer any questions
they have directly.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.490
If you'd like to try Madefor,
you can go to getmadefor.com,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.330
and if you put Huberman in at checkout,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.010
you'll get 20% off the program.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.610
That's getmadefor.com,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.720
put Huberman in at checkout,
and get 20% off the program.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.880
Today, we're going to talk about

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.040
how to change your nervous
system for the better.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.650
As you recall, your nervous
system includes your brain

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.310
and your spinal cord,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.280
but also all the connections
that your brain and spinal cord

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.540
make with the organs of your body

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.360
and all the connections
that the organs of your body

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.570
make with your brain and spinal cord.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.020
This thing that we call the
nervous system is responsible

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.860
for everything we know,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.430
all our behavior, all our emotions,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.130
everything we feel about
ourselves and the outside world,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.360
everything we think and believe.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.510
It's really at the center of
our entire experience of life

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.473
and who we are.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.460
Fortunately, in humans,
unlike in other species,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.560
we can change our nervous system

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.030
by taking some very specific
and deliberate actions.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.170
And, today, we're really
going to focus on the actions,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.170
the motor commands and the
aspects of movement and balance

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.880
that allow us to change
our nervous system.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.310
It turns out that movement and balance

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.870
actually provide windows or portals

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.750
into our ability to
change our nervous system

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.640
the way we want,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.580
even if those changes are not about

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.270
learning new movements or
learning how to balance.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.350
And soon you'll understand why.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.500
So, today, we're going to talk a lot about

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.560
the basic science of neuroplasticity.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.140
I promise to not use
excessive nomenclature.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.290
There'll be a little bit,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.860
but I'll try and make
it as clear as possible.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.580
And we're also going to talk a
lot about protocols and tools

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.430
that the scientific literature points to

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.450
and support for changing
our nervous system,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.250
again, not just for sake of
learning new motor movements

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.890
or how to balance better,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.050
but for how to feel differently

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.840
about particular experiences,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.790
both past, present, and future,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.710
and as well as how to learn faster.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.680
We're not going to discuss
hacks, a word I loath,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.640
we're not going to discuss gimmicks,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.200
we're going to discuss
mechanism and scientific data

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.960
and the tools that those mechanisms

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.030
and scientific data point to

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.330
so that you can tailor your
practices around learning

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
to your specific needs and goals.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.770
So let's begin by just examining

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.500
the big picture question which is,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.140
does the brain control behavior?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.630
And my hope is that everyone
is immediately thinking yes.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.280
The brain and nervous
system, we really should say,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.580
'cause the brain is just one component

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.610
of the nervous system,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.840
controls our behavior.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.340
How does it do that?

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.440
Well, there are a couple different
levels that it does that.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.170
First of all, if we're
talking about movement,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.720
behavior generally means movement,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.120
if we're talking about movement,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.050
we have two categories of neurons

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.610
that are very important to think about

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.240
in the context of neuroplasticity.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.030
First of all, we have what are
called lower motor neurons.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.943
These are motor neurons that
live in our spinal cord.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.560
For the aficionados out there,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.540
for those of you that might
be headed to medical school

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.990
or just want to learn
more about the anatomy,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.910
they live in the ventral
horn of the spinal cord.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.580
But that doesn't matter if
you don't want to know that,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.960
just know that you have
these things called

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.740
lower motor neurons.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.210
These are neurons that
are in the spinal cord

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.610
but they extend a wire
that we call an axon

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.230
out into the peripheral
nervous system, into the body.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.940
And those neurons connect with muscle.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.120
They send electrical potentials out there

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.890
that allow our muscles
to twitch into contract.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.530
As a little point of fact, actually,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.070
we don't have muscle memory.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.960
There's no such thing as muscle memory.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.330
Muscles are dumb.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.930
They don't know anything,

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.360
they don't have a history,
they don't have a memory,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.330
they don't know anything.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.490
It is the neurons that
control those muscles

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.550
and their firing patterns
in which all the information

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.870
for motor patterns are stored.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.440
So your ability to walk
is not muscle memory,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.173
it's neural memory.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.530
Now, the lower motor neurons,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.210
while smarter than the muscle so to speak,

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.220
are not the most brilliant
of the motor neurons.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.400
They are generally involved
in doing what they are told,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.190
and they are told what
to do from two sources.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.620
We have circuits in our brainstem,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.590
so this would be kind of around
your neck deep in the brain,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.210
that are called central
pattern generators.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.980
These are sometimes called CPGs.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.550
Central pattern generators
are what allow us to generate

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.810
repetitive patterns of movement.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.400
So inhaling and exhaling,
inhaling and exhaling

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.200
subconsciously is controlled
by a central pattern generator.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.040
That just means a collection of neurons.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.873
If you really want to know,

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:45.260
they're called the pre-Botzinger neurons

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.900
discovered by Jack Feldman
and colleagues at UCLA.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.940
These neurons in the brainstem

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.650
send information down the phrenic nerve

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.840
and control the diaphragm.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.750
And it goes inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.880
And you don't have to think about that.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.820
You could think about it

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.180
and you could change the
durations of inhales and exhales

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.410
and change that up,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.100
but the motor neurons that control that

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.373
are just responding to what
the brain is telling it to do.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.780
The other central pattern
generators include

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.900
things like walking.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.120
The right limb-left limb, right
limb-left limb pattern that

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.860
we normally associate with walking

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.330
was learned during childhood,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.670
and these central pattern
generators, sometimes called CPGs,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.010
tell our lower motor neurons, "Fire.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.440
Now you fire, now you fire."

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.630
So they are literally saying,
"Right, left, right left."

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.040
They are the marching
orders from the brainstem

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.440
to the lower motor neurons.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.360
So these lower motor neurons
do what they are told.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.150
They are obedient little soldiers

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.000
and they do what they are told,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.420
and their job is to make
the muscles contract

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.470
at specific times.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.310
Okay.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.200
That's all simple.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.400
But then there are the
upper motor neurons.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.860
The upper motor neurons actually
reside in our motor cortex,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.040
way up on top of the brain.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.410
And they are involved in sending signals

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.890
for deliberate action.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.380
So they send signals to
the lower motor neurons

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.300
which are the effectors,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.890
the ones that actually
control the muscles,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.000
but the upper motor neurons are the ones

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.060
that send very specific signals.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.210
For instance, the signals
that would allow you

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.970
to make a cup of coffee in the morning

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.050
or to deliberately engage
in any kind of behavior.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.240
Now, you can probably make a
cup of coffee in the morning

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.680
without having to think about it too much.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680
It's almost reflexive for you now,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.990
which means that a lot of the information

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.580
about how to perform
that particular movement

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.300
has been passed off to
circuitry that's now

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.290
more or less in the brainstem
and below the motor cortex.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.410
Now, why am I giving you all this detail?

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.240
Well, if you want to
change motor patterns,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.780
you have to know where in the
circuitry changes are possible

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.290
and you ought to know where the changes

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.340
are most likely to occur.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.230
You also need to know, how
do you signal to the brain

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.550
and nervous system that
a change is necessary?

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.610
So let's just pause there,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.830
return to the initial
question that we started with,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.230
which is, does the brain control behavior?

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.760
And the answer is yes,
and now you know how.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.820
It's upper motor neurons,
lower motor neurons,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.720
you've got these things called
central pattern generators

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.920
and some connection with the muscle.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.350
So there you go, you just got,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.320
basically, what was the equivalent of

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.300
the introduction to a college lecture

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.600
on motor control and the nervous system.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.270
But the point today is
all about plasticity.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.960
How can that be leveraged
in order to open up

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.760
this magical thing that we call plasticity

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.530
in order to access changes
to our emotional experience,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.520
or to our belief system,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.550
or to our ability to remember

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.410
and use specific kinds of information

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.440
for say math, or language, et cetera?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.560
Well, what I'm not going
to tell you is that

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.380
you need to go running
or you need to go biking,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.300
or that simply going
through motor patterns

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.330
is going to open up plasticity because

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.000
I hate to tell you this, but
as beneficial as exercise is,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
it does not open plasticity
unless you do certain things.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.470
And I will tell you exactly

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.670
what those certain things are today.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.170
To be clear, I think exercise
is wonderful and healthy,

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.700
can improve cardiovascular function,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.450
maintain strength, bone
density, all that good stuff.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.470
But just working out or doing
your exercise of various kinds

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.720
will not change your nervous system.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.930
It will maintain it,

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.360
and it can certainly improve
other health metrics,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.963
but it is not going to open
up the window for plasticity.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.720
The question we need to ask

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.300
is can behavior change the brain?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.280
We already agree that the
brain can change behavior,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.260
but can behavior change the brain?

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.780
And the answer is yes,

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.630
provided that behavior is
different enough in specific ways

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.860
from the behaviors that you
already know how to perform.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.950
Let me repeat that.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.930
Can behavior change the brain?

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.470
And the answer is yes,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.200
provided that behavior is different enough

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.510
from the sorts of behaviors

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.980
that you already know how to perform.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.320
And I should've added the word well.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.790
Because you can't obviously
perform a behavior

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.580
that you don't know how to perform

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.960
because you don't know how to do it yet.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.470
But there's a key element
to accessing neuroplasticity

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.040
that frankly I don't see out there

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.100
in the general discussion
about neuroplasticity.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.260
In the general discussion
about neuroplasticity

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.070
and about learning, I hear
all these gimmicks about using

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.270
different ways to remember
lots of people's names

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.670
and arranging things
into their first letters

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.350
and mnemonics and all this kind of stuff,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.653
which, frankly, to me
feels really gimmicky.

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:42.360
I think that if you
look at super learners,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.000
they tend to be people that have a process

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.470
of say extreme memory.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.820
But people who have
extreme memory, generally,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.703
the literature shows us, are
pretty poor at other things.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.270
I don't think most of us are
interested in walking around

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.900
knowing how to remember everything.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.940
In fact, there are some
interesting studies

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.660
looking at humans who over-remember,

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.070
and they suffer tremendously

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.570
because they remember all sorts of things,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.210
like the number at the top of the receipt

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.460
at the bodega that they bought
a Coca-Cola 10 years ago.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.170
This is useless information
for most people.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.000
They don't do well in life, really.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.770
So the goal isn't to remember everything,

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.670
the goal is to be selective
about your brain changes.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.230
And when we talk about brain changes,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.340
I want to highlight adaptive changes.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.730
There's a whole category of
things that we're going to discuss

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.050
when we talk about traumatic
brain injury and dementia,

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.520
a topic for a future episode,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.170
about all the things that happen when you

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.550
have damaged your nervous system
or you're missing neurons.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.670
But, today, I really want to talk about

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.450
something that I think
is very near and dear

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.570
to many of your hearts, which is

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.920
what are the behaviors
that you can engage in

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.190
to access neuroplasticity

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.450
so that then you can apply that plasticity

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.473
to the specific things that
you want to learn or unlearn.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.270
This is very important
because I don't want people to

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.130
get the impression that
we're really talking about

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.920
learning a bunch of motor movements.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.870
You may be an athlete, you
might not be an athlete.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.290
You might want to learn how
to dance, you might not.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.580
You might want to learn how to dance

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.150
and get better at remembering

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.830
and learning languages, for instance,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.760
or at unlearning some
difficult emotional experience,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.730
meaning you want to
remove the emotional load

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.120
from a particular memory of an experience.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.790
What we're talking about today
is using behavior as a gate

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.880
to enter states of mind and body

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.933
that allow you to access plasticity.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.260
So let's talk about the
different kinds of plasticity

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.450
that are available to us.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.520
Because those will point directly

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.840
towards the type of protocols
that we should engage in

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.620
to change ourselves for the better,

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.533
the so-called adaptive plasticity.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.790
There is something called
representational plasticity.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.290
Representational plasticity is just your

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.320
internal representation
of the outside world.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.260
So you have a map of auditory
space, believe it or not,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.100
meaning you have neurons that respond

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.340
when something over on my right happens,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.410
like I'm [snaps fingers]
snapping my fingers

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.243
over to my right.

00:16:06.243 --> 00:16:07.580
I can't snap as well on my left,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.224
which is the whole thing unto itself.

00:16:10.224 --> 00:16:11.057
[snaps fingers]

00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.880
Yeah, weak over there on the left side.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.440
But when I do that,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.360
there are different
neurons respond to those.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.270
We have a map of visual space.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.540
Certain neurons are seeing things

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.670
in certain portions of
visual space and not others.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.330
We have a map of motor space,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.810
meaning when we move our limbs
in particular directions,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.060
we know where those limbs are

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.240
because even if we can't see them,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.470
we have what's called
proprioceptive feedback.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.620
So we have knowledge
about where our limbs are.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.330
In fact, people that lack certain neurons

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.100
for proprioceptive feedback,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.160
they are very poor at
controlling their motor behavior.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.260
They get injured a lot.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.580
It's actually a terrible situation.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.960
So we've got all these
representations inside

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.210
and we have maps of our motor commands.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.100
We know that, for instance,
if I want to reach out

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.210
and grab the pen in front of me,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.510
that I need to generate a
certain amount of force.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.053
So I rarely overshoot,
I rarely miss the pen.

00:17:06.573 --> 00:17:08.520
Our maps of the motor world

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.453
and our maps of the
sensory world are merged.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.560
The way to create plasticity

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.340
is to create mismatches or
errors in how we perform things.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.330
And this I think is an amazing

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.130
and important feature of neuroplasticity

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.053
that is highly underappreciated.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.850
The way to create plasticity

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.370
is to send signals to the
brain that something is wrong,

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.860
something is different, and
something isn't being achieved.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.500
I think this will completely reframe

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.280
the way that most people
think about plasticity.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.187
Most of us think about plasticity as,

00:17:44.187 --> 00:17:45.620
"Okay, we're going to get into this

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.970
optimal learning state or flow,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.280
and then suddenly we're going to be able

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.510
to do all the things that
we wish that we could do."

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.460
Well, I hate to break it to you, but flow

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.960
is an expression of what
we already know how to do.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.800
It is not a state for learning.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.330
And I'm willing to go to bat with any of

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.920
the flo-wa-nis-tas out there

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.730
that want to challenge me on that one.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.010
Flow is an expression of
nervous system capabilities

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.780
that are already embedded in us.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.700
Errors and making errors

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.100
out of sync with what we would like to do

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.410
is how our nervous system is cued

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.010
through very distinct
biological mechanisms

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.510
that something isn't going right.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.710
And, therefore, certain
neurochemicals are deployed

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.970
that signal the neural circuits
that they have to change.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.530
So let's talk about the experiments

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.670
that support what I just said.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.230
'Cause I'm about to tell
you that making errors

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.330
over and over and over again

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.300
is the route to shaping
your nervous system

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.110
so that it performs better
and better and better.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.700
And I'm not going to tell you

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.970
that the last rep of a set
where you hit failure in the gym

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.330
is anything like neuroplasticity.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.250
You hear that too that it's
pushing to that point of a cliff

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.940
where you just can't function anymore,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.860
that's the signal.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.940
That's not the signal.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.850
That's a distinct neuromuscular phenomenon

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.570
that bears zero resemblance

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.760
to what it takes to get neuroplasticity.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.610
So let's talk about
errors and making errors

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.770
and why and how that triggers
the release of chemicals

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.170
that then allow us to not just

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.900
learn the thing that we're
doing in the motor sense,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.990
play the piano, dance, et cetera,

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.040
but it also creates an environment,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.830
a milieu within the brain,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.470
that allows us to then go
learn how to couple or uncouple

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.250
a particular emotion to an experience,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.850
or better language learning,

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.780
or better mathematical learning.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.230
It's a really fundamental
aspect of how we're built.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.030
And when you look at it, it's
actually very straightforward.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.940
It's a series of logical steps

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.160
that once you learn how
to open those hatches,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.050
it becomes very straightforward to deploy.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.500
Last episode, we discussed

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.550
some of the basic principles
of neuroplasticity.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.660
If you didn't hear that episode,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.330
no problem, I'll just review it quickly,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.770
which is that it's a falsehood

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.400
that everything that we do and
experience changes our brain.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.640
The brain changes when
certain neurochemicals,

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.110
namely acetylcholine,
epinephrin, and dopamine,

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.910
are released in ways and
in the specific times

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.860
that allow for neural circuits
to be marked for change.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.170
And then the change
occurs later during sleep.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.990
I'll review that later, but, basically,

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.630
you need a certain cocktail of chemicals

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.150
released in the brain in order
for a particular behavior

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.660
to reshape the way that our brain works.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.920
So the question really is

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.620
what allows those
neurochemicals to be released?

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.990
And last episode, I
talked all about focus.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.540
If you haven't seen it
or heard that episode,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.810
you might want to check it out,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.090
about some specific tools and practices

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.780
that can allow you to build
up your capacity for focus

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.360
and release certain
chemicals in that cocktail.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.460
But, today, we're going to talk about

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.590
the other chemicals in the
cocktail, in particular dopamine.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.510
And we're really going to
center our discussion around

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.860
this issue of making errors

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.800
and why making errors
is actually the signal

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.050
that tells the brain,
"Okay, it's time to change,"

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:01.310
or, more generally, it's time
to pay attention to things

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.250
so that you change.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.430
And I really want to distinguish
this point really clearly,

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.630
which is that I'm going
to talk today a lot about

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.930
motor and vestibular,
meaning balance programs,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.840
but not just for learning
motor commands and balance,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.770
not just for learning new
motor skills and balance,

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.670
but also for setting a stage

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.420
or a kind of condition in your brain

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.620
where you can go learn
other things as well.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.570
Let's talk about some classic experiments

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.990
that really nail down

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.676
what's most important in this
discussion about plasticity.

00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:34.790
As I mentioned last episode,

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.500
and I'll just tell you right now again,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.050
the brain is incredibly plastic

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.080
from about birth until about age 25.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.640
Passive experience will shape the brain

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.920
just because of the way that the chemicals

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.420
that are sloshing around in there

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.080
and the way that the neurons are arranged

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.230
and all sorts of things.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.660
The brain's job is to customize itself

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.120
in response to its experience.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.340
And then somewhere about 25,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.680
it's not like the day
after your 26th birthday,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.070
plasticity closes,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.650
there's a kind of tapering
off of plasticity,

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.330
and you need different
mechanisms to engage plasticity

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.253
as an adult.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.560
We're mostly going to be talking
about adult plasticity today,

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.447
but I got a lot of questions about,

00:22:13.447 --> 00:22:15.980
"Well, what about if I'm younger than 25?"

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.543
First of all, that's great.

00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:22.240
I wish I had a time machine, but I don't.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.870
Because as I've said before,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.580
the stinger is when you're young,

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.710
your brain is very plastic,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.660
but you have less control
over your experience.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.230
When you're older, generally,

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.397
you have more control of your experience,

00:22:31.397 --> 00:22:33.400
but your brain is less plastic.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.120
So if you're already asking the question

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.720
as a 20-year-old or a
15-year-old, "What can I do now

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.270
that's really going to enhanced my brain?"

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.640
I guess the simple
answer would be an aside,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.690
which would be get the broadest
education you can possible.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.640
That means math, chemistry,
physics, literature, music,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.800
learn how to play an instrument.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.490
I'm saying that 'cause
I wish I had, et cetera.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.610
Get a broad training in a number of things

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.050
and find the thing that really

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.800
captures your passion and excitement,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.260
and then put a ton of
additional effort there.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.600
That's what I recommend,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.520
including emotional development.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.600
Maybe a topic for a future episode.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.590
But if you are an adult,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.660
or if you are a young person,

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.800
knowing how to tap into
these plasticity mechanisms

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.840
is very powerful.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.700
You need these chemicals
deployed in the nervous system

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.080
in order to mark whatever nerve cells

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.730
happen to be firing in the
time afterward for change.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.597
And people are obsessed with asking,

00:23:30.597 --> 00:23:34.390
"What supplements, what
drugs, what conditions,

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.030
what machines will allow for that?"

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.540
But there's a natural set of
conditions that allow for that.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.400
When we came into this world,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.103
we learned to take our
different maps of experience,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.500
our motor maps, our auditory
maps, our visual maps.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.880
And to link them, we align those maps.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.040
The simplest example is
the one I gave before.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.950
If I hear something off to my
right, like I click like that,

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.210
it could come from my fingers snapping

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.760
or it could come from something

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.340
generated by somebody else or
something else to my right,

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.400
I look to my right.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.940
If I hear it on the
left, I look to my left.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.620
If I hear it right in front of me,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.910
I keep looking right in front of me.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.990
And if I hear it behind me, I turn around.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.760
And that's because our
maps of visual space

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.320
and our maps of auditory space

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.900
and our maps of motor space

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.170
are aligned to one another
in perfect register.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.190
It's an incredible feature
of our nervous system.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.370
It takes place in a structure

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.740
called the superior colliculus,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.950
although you don't need to know that name.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.880
Superior colliculus has layers,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.660
literally stacks of
neurons like in a sandwich

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.560
where the zero point right in front of me,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.040
or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.260
or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left,

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.590
are aligned so that the auditory neurons,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.540
the ones that care about sounds,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.380
at 15 degrees to my right,

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.500
sit directly below the neurons

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.080
that look at 15 degrees to
my right in my visual system.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.130
And when I reach over to this direction,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.000
there's a signal that's sent
down through those layers

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.780
that says 15 degrees off to the right

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.200
is the direction to look,
it's the direction to listen,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.250
and it's the direction to
move if I need to move.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.750
So there's an alignment.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:16.970
And this is really powerful.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.960
And this is what allows
us to move through space

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.260
and function in our lives
in a really fluid way.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.270
It's set up during development.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.930
But there have been some
important experiments

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.900
that have revealed that
these maps are plastic,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.160
meaning they can shift, they're
subject to neuroplasticity.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.320
And there are specific rules
that allow us to shift them.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.830
So here's the key experiment.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.630
The key experiment was
done by a colleague of mine

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.490
who's now retired but whose
work is absolutely fundamental

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.330
in the field of
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.460
The Knudsen Lab,

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.760
and many of the Knudsen
Lab scientific offspring,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.380
showed that if one is
to wear prism glasses

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.343
that shift the visual field,

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.090
that eventually there'll be a shift

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.560
in the representation of
the auditory motor maps too.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.960
Now, what they initially did is

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.073
they looked at young subjects,

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.120
and what they did is they
moved the visual world

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.470
by making them wear prism glasses.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.830
So that, for instance, if
my pen is out in front of me

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.650
at five degrees off center,

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.920
so just a little bit off center,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.180
if you're listening to
this, this would be like

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.330
just a little bit to my right,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.490
but in these prism glasses,

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.800
I actually see that pen
way over far on my right.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.940
So it's actually here,
but I see it over there

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.950
because I'm wearing prisms on my eyes.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.860
What happens is in the first day or so,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.150
you ask people or you ask
animal subjects or whatever

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.400
to reach for this object,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.440
and they reach to the wrong place

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.593
because they're seeing it where it isn't.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.950
This gets especially complicated

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.400
when you start including sounds.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.630
When you have a thing off to
your right making a sound,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.750
but the thing is actually right here.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.890
So you're hearing the
sound at one location

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.180
and you're seeing the
object at another location

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.650
because you're wearing these prisms.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.393
So your image of the world
is totally distorted.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.890
Or, in experiments done by other groups,

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.350
they wear glasses,

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.070
subjects wore glasses
that completely invert

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.660
the visual world so that
everything is upside down,

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.100
which is an extreme example
of these representational maps

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.543
being flipped or shifted.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.800
But what you find is that
in young individuals,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.610
within a day or two,

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.630
they start adjusting their motor behavior

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.730
in exactly the right way

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.110
so that they always reach
to the correct location.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.760
So they hear a sound at one location,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.270
they see the object that
ought to make that sound

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.600
at a different location,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.160
and they somehow are able to
adjust their motor behavior

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.520
to reach to the correct location.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.710
It's incredible.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:52.770
It's absolutely incredible.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.762
Or, in the case of the people

00:27:53.762 --> 00:27:55.870
who would look at the world upside down,

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.820
they somehow are able to
navigate this upside down world

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.880
even though we're completely used to

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.010
our feet being on the floor
and not on the ceiling

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.160
and people not walking at us

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.360
by hanging off the ceiling like bats.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.550
Amazing.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.050
And what it tells us is that these maps

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.570
that are aligned to one another

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.530
can move and shift and rotate,

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.650
and even flip themselves.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.240
And it happens best in young individuals.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.810
If you do this in older individuals,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.780
in most cases, it takes a very long time

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.790
for the maps to shift,

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.620
and in some cases they never shift.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.730
So this is a very experimental scenario,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.500
but it's an important one to understand

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.870
because it really tamps down the fact

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:41.110
that we have the capacity
to create dramatic shifts

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.260
in our representation
of the outside world.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.530
So how can we get plasticity as adults

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.330
that mimics the plasticity

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.190
that we get when we are juveniles?

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.210
Well, the Knudsen Lab and
other labs have looked at this,

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.990
and it's really interesting.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.060
First of all, we have to ask,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.740
what is the signal for plasticity?

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.810
Is it just having prism glasses on?

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.780
No, because they did that
experiment and ruled that out.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.720
Is it just the fact that the visual thing

00:29:09.761 --> 00:29:11.410
appears to be far over to my right

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.090
when in fact it's right in front of me?

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.050
No.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.870
The signal that generates the plasticity

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.220
is the making of errors.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.520
It's the reaches and failures

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.080
that signal to the nervous system

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.170
that this is not working.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.670
And, therefore, the shifts
start to take place.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.700
And this is so fundamentally important

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.687
because I think most people think,

00:29:36.687 --> 00:29:38.490
"Oh, well, practice is going to be

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.370
I have to access beginner's mind,"

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.670
which is a great concept, actually,

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.860
it's about approaching things
expecting to make errors,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.693
which is great.

00:29:44.693 --> 00:29:47.370
I think I am a believer
in beginner's mind.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.930
But people understandably get frustrated,

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.670
like they're trying to
learn a piece on the piano

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.130
and they can't do it,

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.510
or they're trying to
write a piece of code,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.587
or they're trying to access
some sort of motor behavior,

00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:58.930
and they can't do it,

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.785
and the frustration drives them crazy,

00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:01.940
[indistinct] "I can't
do it, I can't do it,"

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.570
when they don't realize that
[laughs] the errors themselves

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.517
are signaling to the
brain and nervous system,

00:30:07.517 --> 00:30:09.030
"Something's not working."

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.040
And of course the brain doesn't understand

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.320
the words something isn't working.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.080
The brain doesn't even
understand frustration

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.690
as an emotional state.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.760
The brain understands the
neurochemicals that are released,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.730
namely epinephrine and acetylcholine,

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.320
but also, and we'll get into this,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.580
the molecule dopamine

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.250
when we start to approximate
the correct behavior

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.960
just a little bit,

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.300
and we start getting a little bit right.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.050
So what happens is when we make errors,

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.670
the nervous system kind of,

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.790
I don't want to say freaks
out because it's a very

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.420
mechanistic and controlled situation,

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.120
but the nervous system starts
releasing neurotransmitters

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.600
and neuromodulators

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.000
that say, "We better change
something in the circuitry."

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.280
And so errors are the basis [laughs]

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.330
for neuroplasticity and for learning.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.440
And I wish that this was
more prominent out there.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.550
I guess this is why I'm saying it.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.040
And humans do not like
this feeling of frustration

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.260
and making errors.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.450
The few that do do exceedingly
well in whatever pursuits

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.110
they happen to be involved in.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.070
The ones that don't,
generally don't do well.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.560
They generally don't learn much.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.410
And if you think about it,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.020
why would your nervous system ever change?

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.500
Why would it ever change?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.810
Unless there was
something to be afraid of,

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.090
something that made us feel awful

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.400
will signal that the nervous
system needs to change,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.820
or there's an error in our performance.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.070
So it turns out that the
feedback of these errors,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.600
the reaching to the wrong location

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.920
starts to release a number of things.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.620
And now you've heard
about them many times,

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.970
but this would be epinephrin.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.270
It increases alertness,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.810
acetylcholine, focus.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.690
And this is why frustration

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.130
that leads us to just kind of quit

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.130
and walk away from the endeavor
is the absolute worst thing.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.110
Because if acetylcholine is released,

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:55.260
it creates an opportunity to
focus on the error margin,

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.200
the distance between what
it is that you're doing

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.840
and what it is that you would like to do.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.890
And then the nervous system starts to

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.770
make changes almost immediately

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.820
in order to try and
get the behavior right.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.120
And when you start getting
it even a little bit right,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.010
that third molecule comes
online or is released,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.280
which is dopamine,

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.280
which allows for the plastic
changes to occur very fast.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.250
Now, this is what all
happens very naturally

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.360
in young brains.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.550
But in old brains, it
tends to be pretty slow,

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.250
except for in two conditions.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.970
So let me just pause and just say this,

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.420
if you are uncomfortable making errors

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.143
and you get frustrated easily,

00:32:34.405 --> 00:32:37.550
if you leverage that frustration

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.150
toward drilling deeper into the endeavor,

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.480
you are setting yourself up for a terrific

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.070
set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.420
But if you take that frustration

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.410
and you walk away from the endeavor,

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.320
you are essentially setting up plasticity

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.290
to rewire you according to
what happens afterwards,

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.380
which is generally
feeling pretty miserable.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.190
So now you can kind of start to appreciate

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.060
why it is that continuing
to drill into a process

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.300
to the point of frustration

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.530
but then staying with that
process for a little bit longer,

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.950
and I'll define exactly
what I mean by a little bit,

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:13.950
is the most important
thing for adult learning

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.690
as well as childhood learning,

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.230
but adult learning in particular.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.700
Now, the Knudsen Lab did two

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.210
very important sets of experiments.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.670
The first one was published in "Nature,'

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.610
very important study,

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.060
which showed that juveniles
can make these massive shifts

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.300
in their map representations,

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.980
meaning you can shift the visual world

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.790
using visual prisms a huge
amount and very quickly.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.940
Young individuals can

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.483
shift their representations of the world

00:33:41.483 --> 00:33:44.170
so that they learn to reach
to the correct location.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.560
They get a lot of plasticity all at once,

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.350
and it happens very fast in a
period of just a couple days.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.210
In adults, it tends to be very slow

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.800
and most individuals
never actually accomplish

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.880
the full map shift.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.680
They don't get the plasticity.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.760
Here we're talking about map shifts,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.670
but this could be learning a new language,

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.130
this could be any number
of different things

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:07.360
that [indistinct] we're attempting.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.590
So what we're saying is
what I already said before,

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.750
which is that we learn
very well as youngsters,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.543
but not as adults after 25.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.410
But then what they did

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:20.720
is they started making the
increment of change smaller.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.540
So instead of shifting
the world a huge amount

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.800
by putting prisms that
shifted that the visual world

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.410
all the way over to the right,

00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:30.800
they did this incrementally.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.270
So, first, they put on prisms

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.340
that shifted it just a little bit,

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.080
just like seven degrees I
believe was the exact number.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.860
And then it was 14 degrees,

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.270
and then it was 28 degrees.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.990
And so what they found was
that the adult nervous system

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:47.240
can tolerate smaller and
smaller errors over time,

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.620
but that you can stack those errors

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.280
so that you can get a lot of plasticity.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.520
Put simply, incremental
learning as an adult

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.810
is absolutely essential.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.980
You are not going to get massive shifts

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.150
in your representation
to the outside world.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.600
So how do you make small errors
as opposed to big errors?

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.600
Well, the key is smaller
bouts of focused learning

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.223
for smaller bits of information.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.120
It's a mistake to try and
learn a lot of information

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.610
in one learning about as an adult.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.030
What these papers from
the Knudsen Lab show,

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.200
and what others have gone on to show,

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.340
is that the adult nervous
system is fully capable of

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.350
engaging in a huge amount of plasticity,

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.490
but you need to do it
in smaller increments

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.950
per learning epoch or
per learning episode.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:36.880
So how would you do this?

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.950
Well, say for instance, I'm
terrible at free throws,

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.650
so let's say I wanted
to learn free throws.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:45.573
I'm 45 years old, so I'm well
past the 25 and under mark.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:48.662
I'm going to make errors.

00:35:48.662 --> 00:35:50.650
I'm going to make a lot errors.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.600
If I go into learning free throws

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.600
knowing that errors are
the gate to plasticity,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.870
well, then I feel a little bit better,

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:01.990
but I still have to aim for

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.140
the rim of the basket or the net.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.410
Basically, showing how little
I know about basketball.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.660
But I think I know the general
themes around basketball,

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.550
involves a net, a back
board, and a ball, of course.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.870
So I go to the free throw
line and I'll throw.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:16.750
How long should I go?

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.423
Well, until I'm hitting
the point of frustration.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.890
And at that point, continuing probably for

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.850
anywhere from 10 to 100 more trials

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.900
should be my limit, right?

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.970
That should be my limit if I want to

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.060
improve some specific aspect
of the motor behavior.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.070
And so the question then is

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.650
what should I be paying attention to?

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.670
What should I be focusing on?

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.880
Well, obviously trying to
get the ball into the basket.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.530
But the beauty of motor learning

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.180
is that the circuits for
auditory and visual and motor

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.120
more or less teach themselves.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.150
I don't necessarily have
to be paying attention to

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.700
exactly the contact of
my fingers with the ball

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.300
or some random feature like

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.180
whether or not I'm
bending my knees or not.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.260
The key is to try a number
of different parameters

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.160
until I start to approximate

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.310
the behavior that I want
to get a little bit better,

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.670
and then trying to get
consistent about that.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.757
Now, many of you involved
in sports learning will say,

00:37:10.757 --> 00:37:11.800
"Okay, well, that's obvious,

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.420
it's just incremental learning."

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.860
But the key thing is in those errors.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.920
By isolating the errors and
making a number of errors

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.120
in a particular aspect
of the motor movement,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.240
it signals to the brain that it's plastic.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.520
And if I leave that episode of going

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.050
and trying to learn how
to shoot free throws,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.670
my brain is still plastic.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.940
Plasticity is a state of the
brain and nervous system.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.160
It's not just geared
toward the specific thing

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.370
I'm trying to learn.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.210
So there are two aspects to plasticity

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.450
that I think we really need to highlight.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.300
One is that there's
plasticity geared toward

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.800
the thing that you are
trying to learn specifically.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.920
And then there are states of mind and body

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.750
that allow us to access plasticity.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.170
Now, toward the end of this episode,

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.880
I'm going to spell out specific protocols

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.820
in a little more detail.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.960
That free throw example

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.770
might not correlate with
what you want to learn.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:02.820
Actually, I don't have a huge
desire to learn free throws.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.203
I've more or less given up on basketball,

00:38:06.076 --> 00:38:07.600
and free throws in particular.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.340
But I think that it's
important to understand

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.530
that motor movements are
the most straightforward way

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.440
to access states of plasticity.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.670
And that can be for sake of
learning the motor movement

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.363
or for sake of accessing
plasticity more generally.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.240
One very important aspect to
getting plasticity as an adult

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.670
is not just smaller increments,
meaning shorter bouts.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.990
So I gave an example of

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.520
another 100 free throws or something,

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.040
but going out there and just
getting 10,000 free throws

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.320
all at once or packing as
much as I can into one episode

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.540
is not going to be as efficient for me

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.760
as shorter bouts of intense
learning as an adult.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.250
Because the error signals
are not as well-defined

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.090
to my nervous system.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.197
It's not going to know
what needs to change.

00:38:54.197 --> 00:38:55.980
And so this is really the key element

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.260
of incremental learning,

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.190
is that you're trying to
signal to the nervous system

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.130
at least one component
that needs to change.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:04.090
The nervous system needs
to know what the error is.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.880
Now, when I shoot free throws, Lord knows

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.670
there are a lot of different
kinds of errors that happen,

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.910
probably the way I'm bending my knees,

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.540
the arc of the ball, the way
I'm organizing my shoulders,

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.150
probably where my eyes
are, lots of things.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.490
So which ones to focus on?

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.260
And that's what I said before,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.730
the beauty of the motor system is

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.880
I don't have to worry about all of that.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.430
I just need to get the
reps in a number of times,

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.410
and the nervous system will figure out

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.490
how far off my motor commands are,

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.850
at the level of these maps
that I described earlier,

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:37.850
how far those deviate
from the desired behavior,

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.150
getting the ball into the basket,

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.570
and it will start making adjustments.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.060
But as I make adjustments,

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.340
or as my nervous system
makes adjustments for me,

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.550
the key thing is to not start adding

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.240
a variety of new errors
because then it gets confused.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.300
And so this is why short learning bouts

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.910
are absolutely essential.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.080
So let's say it's for learning
an instrument as an adult.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.480
Probably anywhere from 7 minutes

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.510
to 30 minutes,

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:09.290
provided that you're fully
attending, you're very focused,

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.810
is going to be a pretty
significant stimulus

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.370
to inspire plasticity
in the nervous system.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.050
Now, there is one way to
get a lot of plasticity

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.220
all at once as an adult.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.840
There is that kind of Holy Grail thing of

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.410
getting massive plasticity

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:31.410
as you would when you were a
young person but as an adult.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.800
And the Knudsen Lab revealed this

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.800
by setting a very serious
contingency on the learning.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.090
What they did was they
had a situation where

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.330
subjects had to find food

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.120
that was displaced in their visual world,

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.690
again, by putting prisms,

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.190
and they had to find the food,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.740
and the food made a noise,

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.700
there was a noise set to kind
of the location of the food

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.670
through an array of speakers.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.790
Basically, what they found was that

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.280
if people have to adjust
their visual world

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.690
in order to get food,

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.390
the plasticity would eventually occur,

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.860
but it was very slow as an adult.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.173
It was very, very slow.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.823
Unless they actually
had to hunt that food.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.000
In order to eat at all,
they needed plasticity.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.420
And then what happened was remarkable.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.940
What they observed is that
the plasticity as an adult

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:29.860
can be as dramatic, as robust
as it is in a young person

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.300
or in a young animal subject,

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.040
provided that there's a serious incentive

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.220
for the plasticity to occur.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.450
And this is absolutely
important to understand,

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:44.160
which is that how badly we
need or want the plasticity

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.810
determines how fast that
plasticity will arrive,

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.720
which is incredible because

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.180
the brain is just neurons
and soup of chemicals.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.700
But this means that the
importance of something,

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.510
how important something is to us,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.820
actually gates the rate of plasticity

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.990
and the magnitude of plasticity.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:06.270
And this is why just passively
going through most things,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.930
going through the motions, as we say,

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.750
or just getting our
reps in quote, unquote,

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.930
is not sufficient to get the
nervous system to change.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.423
This study, a beautiful study,

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.860
published in the journal
of neuroscience shows

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.820
that if we actually have to

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.510
accomplish something in order to eat

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.940
or in order to get our ration of income,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.250
we will reshape our nervous
system very, very quickly.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.800
So the nervous system has a capacity

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.310
to change at a tremendous rate,

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:43.600
to an enormous degree at any stage of life

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.870
provided it's important
enough that that happen.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.347
And I think some of you might be saying,

00:42:48.347 --> 00:42:49.770
"Well, duh, that's obvious.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.190
If it's really crucial,

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.280
then, of course, it's
going to change faster."

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.090
But it didn't have to be that way.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.680
And for most people who
are trying to learn how to

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.350
learn faster or learn better,

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:04.280
they probably, in most cases,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.130
they are hitting a limit

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:11.840
because the need to change
is not crucial enough.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.680
And I think there are a number of places

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.300
where this has important relevance

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.680
in the people who are battling
addiction, for instance.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.350
I will be the first to say that

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.090
I sympathize with the fact that addictions

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.730
have a biological component.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.970
There's clearly cases where people

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.230
struggle tremendously
to change their behavior

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.040
and their nervous system, in
some cases, is so disrupted

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.150
by whatever substance they've been abusing

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.990
or behavior that they've been engaging in,

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.580
that it's that much
harder for them to change.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.220
But we've also seen incredible
examples where when people

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.630
have to change from an
internal standpoint,

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.690
from their own belief
and desire to change,

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.170
that massive change is possible.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.180
And so I think that the
studies that Knudsen did

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.020
showing the incremental learning

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.510
can create a huge degree
of plasticity as an adult

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:04.450
as well as when the
contingency is very high,

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.370
meaning we need to eat, or
we need to make an income,

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:08.203
or we need to do

00:44:08.203 --> 00:44:11.010
something that's vitally important for us,

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:15.270
that plasticity can happen
in these enormous leaps

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:19.160
just like they can in
adolescence and young adulthood.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.820
That points to the fact that it has to be

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.870
a neurochemical system.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.710
There has to be an underlying mechanism.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:28.510
This wasn't a case of
sticking a wire into the brain

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.290
or taking a particular drug.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.170
All the chemicals that
we're about to talk about

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.430
are released from drugstores,
if you will, [laughs]

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.860
chemical stores that already
reside in all of our brains.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.280
And the key is how to
tap into those stores.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.150
And so we're going to next talk about

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.360
what are the specific behaviors

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.490
that liberate particular
categories of chemicals

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:54.540
that allow us to make the
most of incremental learning

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:59.540
and that set the stage for
plasticity that is similar enough

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.670
or mimics these high contingency states,

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:03.930
like the need to get food,

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.940
or really create a sense
of internal urgency,

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.030
chemical urgency, if you will.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.200
If you've heard previous
episodes of this podcast,

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.230
you may have heard me talk
about ultradian rhythm,

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.820
which are these 90-minute rhythms

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.280
that break up our 24-hour day.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.610
They help break up our sleep
into different cycles of sleep

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.393
like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.400
They break up our day in ways that

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.580
allow us to learn best within
90-minute cycles, et cetera.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.617
So some of you might be saying,

00:45:35.617 --> 00:45:37.137
"Wait, you've been talking
about ultradian cycles,

00:45:37.137 --> 00:45:39.040
and a moment ago you were talking about

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.110
7-minute or 12-minute or
30-minute learning cycles.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:46.120
Today, we're really talking
about how to tap into plasticity

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.370
through the completion of a task

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.570
or working towards something
repetitively and making errors.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.060
And so just to frame this

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.500
in the context of the ultradian cycle,

00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.920
you might sit down,

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.110
decide that you're going to
learn conversational French,

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.200
which would mean that you probably

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.600
don't already speak French.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.890
So you're going to sit down,

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.870
you're going to decide
you're going to learn

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:11.720
some nouns and some verbs,

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.860
you might do some practice set.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.710
The ultradian cycle
says that for the first

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.270
5 to 10 minutes of doing that,
your mind is going to drift

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.350
and your focus will probably kick in,

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:24.910
provided that you're
restricting your visual world

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:26.760
to just the material in front of you,

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.880
something we talked about last episode,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.080
somewhere around the 10 or 15-minute mark.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.850
And then at best you're probably
going to get about an hour of

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:38.430
a deliberate kind of tunnel
vision learning in there.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.900
Your mind will drift.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.200
And then toward the end of that,

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.170
what is now an hour and 10
or hour and 20 minute cycle,

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.490
your brain will sort of
start to flicker in and out,

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.260
you might start thinking
about what you need to eat

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.080
or the fact that you have to
use the bathroom or something.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.820
And then by 90 minutes, it's probably time

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.740
to just stop the learning
about and go do something else,

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.090
maybe return for a second
learning about later,

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.210
maybe take a nap afterwards or something

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:04.180
to enhance the learning.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.810
It's going to happen within
about a 90-minute block.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.480
You're going to go through
that cycle of learning.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.050
But when I refer to the 7 or 12

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.710
or 30 minutes of making errors,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.464
what I mean is when
you're really in a mode of

00:47:16.464 --> 00:47:19.450
repeating errors, not deliberately,

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:20.947
you're trying your best
to accomplish something,

00:47:20.947 --> 00:47:22.470
and you're failing.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.001
You're absolutely failing.

00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:28.340
You're trying to remember say
the sign language alphabet.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.110
I was trying to teach
myself this recently,

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.660
and then I keep repeating and repeating,

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.900
and then get to a certain point
where I kept making errors,

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.950
making errors, making errors.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.820
You want to keep making
errors for this period of time

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.370
that I'm saying will last anywhere

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.670
for about 7 to 30 minutes.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.950
It is exceedingly frustrating,

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:48.900
but that frustration, it
liberates the chemical cues

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.990
that signal that
plasticity needs to happen

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.283
and they also signal the
particular neurons that are active.

00:47:56.229 --> 00:47:57.280
So in the case of sign language,

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.070
it might be the ones that
control my hand movements

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.180
as well as me thinking about
what the different letters are.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.990
It's signaling different
opponents within the networks

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.540
between the brain and body,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.887
and it's trying to figure out,

00:48:08.887 --> 00:48:10.900
"Wait, where are these errors coming from?

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.930
Where are the errors coming from?

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.890
Ah, it's those neurons,
they're making the mistakes.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.220
They're making the mistakes,
they're making the mistakes."

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.610
And it essentially highlights
that pathway for change.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.470
And it is the case that when we come back

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.850
a day or two later in a
learning about after a nap

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.950
or a night or two of deep rest,

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.847
then what we find is that we
can remember certain things

00:48:30.847 --> 00:48:32.400
and the motor pathways work.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.860
And we don't always get it perfectly,

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.640
but we get a lot of it right.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.070
Whereas, we got it wrong before.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.460
So that 7 to 30-minute
intense learning about

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.060
is within the ultradian cycle,

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.110
and I want to be clear about that.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.470
And some people can tolerate
many of these per day.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:51.780
Most people can only tolerate
one or two, maybe three.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.960
This is intense work.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.940
If shooting free throws, you
could probably do it all day.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.380
But what I'm talking about

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.320
is really trying to accelerate plasticity

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:05.320
by having a period of the 7 to
30 minutes per learning about

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:10.440
that is specifically about making errors.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.540
I want to really underscore that.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.150
And it's not about, as I mentioned before,

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.150
coming up with some little hack or trick

00:49:18.215 --> 00:49:19.760
or something of that sort.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.630
It's really about trying to

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.990
cue the nervous system that
something needs to change

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.600
because otherwise it simply won't change.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.540
Now, there's another aspect to learning,

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.770
I think it's only fair to mention,

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:36.500
which is that we can all learn very easily

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.510
when there's something
very bad happens to us.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.050
I don't wish this on anyone,

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.480
but it is the case that if
something really terrible happens

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.340
that we will have a lifetime
memory for that event.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.210
There are processes that
allow us to uncouple

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:51.630
the emotional load of that event.

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.060
I talked about some of
those a few episodes back,

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.660
the episode on dreams,
trauma, and hallucinations.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.670
And we're going to return
to trauma release, PTSD,

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.040
and some of those other
themes in a future episode.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.870
But the reason why negative experiences

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.780
can be wired into us so quickly is because

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.310
our nervous system's main
job is to keep us safe,

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:15.950
but at a deeper level, it's
because negative experiences

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.820
cue us to the fact that
whatever's happening

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.140
that's really bad is very different

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.133
than the other things that
tend to happen before.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.230
Most of our experience doesn't remap us,

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.790
but those negative experiences deploy

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:31.710
high levels of norepinephrine,
high levels of acetylcholine,

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.780
and really make so that

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.370
whatever it is that we
experienced in that bad episode

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.600
is essentially queued up,

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.160
and so we're on the lookout for it.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.680
And this has a number of negative effects

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.550
in terms of psychological
and emotional effects,

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.410
but it is really a process
designed to keep us safe.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:54.420
The other ways in which
we can learn more quickly

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.150
besides just making errors

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.840
is when something really surprises us.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.350
And if we're positively
surprised by something

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:04.380
or we are just flooded with
this molecule dopamine,

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.260
then there's a great
opportunity for plasticity.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.760
Dopamine is a molecule that's
almost always associated

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.950
with pleasure

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.250
and with the accomplishment
of a particular goal,

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.690
but it's really also a
molecule of motivation.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.950
It's a molecule that is
released inside of us

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:22.130
when we think we're on the right path.

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:25.940
And it does have a capacity
to increase neuroplasticity,

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.330
motivation, et cetera.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.040
It's released in response to
a number of natural behaviors,

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.640
just that help with
the progression of ours

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.450
and other species,

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.583
things like food, sex,

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.220
in some sense social connection,

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.760
although that's more serotonin,

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.400
and serotonin doesn't have the same

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.760
effects on plasticity quite the same.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.360
And we'll talk about a few later.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.980
But dopamine is when we
think we're on the right path

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.290
toward an external goal,

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.450
a little bit is released

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.080
and it tends to give us more
motivation toward that goal.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.540
I think everyone could stand
to enhance the rate of learning

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.690
by doing the following.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.940
Learn to attach dopamine,
in a subjective way,

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.170
to this process of making errors.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.510
Because that's really combining
two modes of plasticity

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.880
in ways that together can
accelerate the plasticity.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.830
So, earlier, I talked about making errors

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:20.510
and having a focus about

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.970
of learning that includes
making a lot of errors

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:25.410
inside of that learning about.

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.920
That is going to be frustrating,

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.560
but the frustration itself is the cue,

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.990
and epinephrine will be very
high under those conditions.

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:36.830
But if you can just subjectively

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.780
associate that experience
with something good

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.580
and that you want to
continue down that path

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:42.560
as opposed to quitting

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.920
when you hit the point of frustration,

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.940
well then you now start to

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.540
create a synergy between
the dopamine that's released

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.830
when we subjectively
think something is good,

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.700
or tell ourselves something is good,

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.240
and that situation of making failures.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.630
In other words, making
failing repetitively,

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:02.030
provided we're engaged in a
very specific set of behaviors

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:03.090
when we do it,

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.050
as well as telling ourselves
that those failures

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.700
are good for learning and good for us,

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.120
creates an outsize effect
on the rate of plasticity.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.410
It accelerates plasticity.

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:16.127
Now, some of you might be
asking, and I get asked a lot,

00:53:16.127 --> 00:53:18.520
"Well, how do I get
dopamine to be released?

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.380
And can I just tell myself
that something is good

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.213
when it's bad?"

00:53:21.213 --> 00:53:23.730
Well, actually yes, believe it or not.

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.230
The thing about dopamine
is it's highly subjective.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:27.520
What's funny to one person

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.800
is not necessarily funny to the next.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.940
So it has to have some sense
of authenticity for you.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.750
But if you really want to be learning

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:36.500
the thing that you're trying to learn,

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.847
that should be reason
enough to tell yourself,

00:53:38.847 --> 00:53:40.760
"Well, I'm frustrated,

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.600
but the frustration is the
source of accelerated learning."

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.570
Dopamine is one of these
incredible molecules

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:49.240
that both can be released

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:52.780
according to things
that are hardwired in us

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.690
to release dopamine.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:57.310
Again, things like food,
sex, warmth when we're cold,

00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:59.250
cool environments when we're too warm.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.080
It's that kind of
pleasure molecule overall.

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.270
But it's also highly subjective

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:10.160
what releases dopamine in
one person versus the next.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.280
Everyone releases dopamine in
response to those very basic

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.410
kind of behaviors and activities,

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:18.380
but dopamine is also released

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.440
according to what we subjectively
believe is good for us.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.980
And that's what's so powerful about it.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.540
In fact, a book that I highly recommend,

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.080
if you want to read more about dopamine,

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.850
is a book that frankly
I wish I had written,

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:28.830
it's such a wonderful book,

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.520
it's called "The Molecule of More."

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.470
And it really talks about dopamine

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.400
not just as a molecule
associated with reward,

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.150
but a molecule associated
with motivation and pursuit,

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.600
and just how subjectively
controlled dopamine can be.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.070
So make lots of errors,

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:46.970
tell yourself that those
errors are important

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.960
and good for your overall learning goals,

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.620
so learn to attach dopamine,

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.890
meaning release dopamine in your brain

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.410
when you start to make errors,

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.510
keep the bouts of
learning relatively short

00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:59.740
if you're an adult.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.080
Younger people can probably engage

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.750
in more bouts of learning.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.520
And it's probably one of the reasons why

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.240
they learn so much faster.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.240
They can just pack so
much more information

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.640
into the brains and nervous
systems compared to adults.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.010
It's a little bit like,

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.090
I'll use the example of
performance-enhancing drugs.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:18.610
Some of those drugs probably
do enhance performance

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:21.530
at the level of increasing red
blood cell count, et cetera.

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.520
But a lot of what those
drugs do is they allow

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.340
athletes to recover faster
so they can just train more.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.010
They allow them to do more work.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.670
And so being a child is a little bit like

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:33.660
being in a performance
enhanced brain milieu.

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.010
Their brains are kind of on
natural, healthy neurochemicals

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.700
that afford them a lot more
learning should they pursue it.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.570
So this goes back to my advice
for young people early on.

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.440
If you're young, what should you do?

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.580
Learn as much as you can

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.370
about as many things as you possibly can.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.470
And I suggest specializing in something.

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.350
I guess I'm not in a position
to give anyone direct advice,

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:59.050
but I would say, hopefully,

00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:01.450
by about age 30, hopefully younger,

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.200
you have some sense of what excites you

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.240
and try and get really good at that thing,

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.123
provided it serves the world for better.

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:12.980
But that's all I'll say in
terms of parenting advice.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.220
It's not my place.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.890
But maybe sometime I'll have an episode

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:21.190
completely devoted to sort of
youth and learning in youth.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:23.980
But once you're attaching dopamine

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.570
to this process of making errors,

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:28.360
then I start getting lots of questions

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.040
that really are the right questions,

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.080
which are, how often should I do this?

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.190
And when should I be doing
this and at what time?

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:36.490
Well, I've talked a little bit about this

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.500
in previous episodes,

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.920
but as long as we're now
kind of into the nitty-gritty

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.680
of tools and application,

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.250
each of us have some natural
times throughout the day

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:47.700
when we are going to be much better

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.780
at tolerating these errors

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.520
and much more focused on what
it is that we're trying to do.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.490
Last episode was about focus,

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:57.960
but chances are that you
can't focus as well at 4:00 pm

00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.170
as you can at 10:00 am.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.020
It differs for everybody
depending on when you're sleeping

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.370
and your kind of natural
chemistry and rhythms.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.430
But find the time or times of day

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:11.000
when you naturally have
the highest mental acuity,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.760
and that's really when you want to engage

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.380
in these learning bouts.

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.640
And then get to the point
where you're making errors

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.710
and then keep making
errors for 7 to 30 minutes.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.350
Just keep making those
errors and drill through it.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:24.580
And you're almost seeking frustration.

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.590
And if you can find some
pleasure in the frustration,

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:28.300
yes, that is a state that exists,

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.360
you have created the
optimal neurochemical milieu

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.610
for learning that thing.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.320
But then here's the beauty of it,

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.840
you also have created the optimal milieu

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.760
for learning other things afterward.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.350
If you leave that about of,

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.800
I gave the example of free throws,

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.950
or maybe it's playing tennis,

00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:46.823
or maybe it's some other skill,

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:49.360
and you sit down to read a book,

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.890
your brain is in a heightened state

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:54.500
to learn and retain the information.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.620
Because those chemicals don't get released

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.610
and then shut down.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:59.060
You're creating a whole milieu,

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.470
an environment of these chemicals.

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:05.170
And the tale of how long
these chemicals stay

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.220
sloshing around in your brain

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.680
has too many factors for me
to put a hard number on it.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.880
It's going to depend on
transporters and enzymes

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.240
and all sorts of things.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.350
But at least for an
hour or so I would say,

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:18.400
you're going to be in a
state of heightened learning,

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.060
and the ability to learn,

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.910
not just the motor patterns
but cognitive information,

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:24.010
language information,

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:26.020
maybe you go to therapy right after that

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.290
and you work on something

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:29.650
in a very deliberate way that
you're trying to work on,

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.090
maybe you don't go to therapy,

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.410
maybe you do something else
that's important to you.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.990
Again, there are just a variety
of examples I could give.

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:39.950
There are a number of things that

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:44.200
allow us to powerfully
access these states of error

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.633
that are kind of surprising
but also kind of fun.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:49.820
Again, these aren't gimmicks,

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.010
these tap into these basic
mechanisms of plasticity.

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:57.080
And the three that I'd
like to talk about next

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.500
are balance,

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.300
meaning the vestibular system,

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.680
as well as the two sides

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.460
of what I call limbic
friction or autonomic arousal.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.680
And if none of that makes sense,

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.720
I'm going to put a fine
point on each one of those

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.790
and what it is and why it works

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.930
for opening up neuroplasticity.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:18.190
Let's talk about limbic friction.

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:19.970
Now, limbic friction is not a term

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:21.620
you're going to find in the textbooks.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.570
So if any of my colleagues are listening,

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:25.890
I want to repeat limbic friction,

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:28.010
I realize is not something
you're going to find

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:29.650
in any of the textbooks.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:32.340
But it is an important principle

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:36.290
that captures a lot of
information that is in textbooks,

00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:38.330
both neurobiology and psychology,

00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.263
and it has some really
important implications.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:46.710
Limbic friction is my attempt
to give a name to something

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:50.460
that is more nuanced and
mechanistic than stress.

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.950
Because, typically, when
we hear about stress,

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.930
we think of heart rate,
heartbeat going too fast,

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:57.450
breathing too fast, sweating,

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:59.110
and not being in a state that we want,

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:01.670
we're to alert and we
want to be more calm.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:05.050
And, indeed, that's one condition in which

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:06.730
we have limbic friction,

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:08.720
meaning our limbic system

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.730
is taking control of a
number of different aspects

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:15.180
of our autonomic or automatic biology.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.770
And we are struggling to control that

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.260
through what we call top-down mechanisms.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.800
We're trying to calm down

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.000
in order to reduce that level of arousal.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.030
We're all familiar with this,

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.620
it's called the stress response.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.430
However, there's another aspect of stress

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:32.290
that's just as important,

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:34.950
which is when we're
tired and we're fatigued

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.630
and we need to engage,

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:38.750
we need to be more alert than we are.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.430
And so what I call
limbic friction is really

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.100
designed to describe
the fact that when our

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.330
autonomic nervous system
isn't where we want it,

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.380
meaning we're trying to be more alert

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.210
or we're trying to be less alert,

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.980
both of those feel stressful to people.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.760
The other way to put it
is that the word stress

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.480
is not a very good word to describe

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.190
what most people experience as stressful

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:01.240
because it can either be being
too tired or being too alert.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.650
Now, why am I bringing this up

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.070
in a discussion about neuroplasticity?

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.610
This is not a discussion about stress.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.310
At some point, we will talk about stress

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.670
and tools to deal with stress.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.840
But the reason I'm
bringing this up is that

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.330
in order to access neuroplasticity,

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.620
you need these components of focus,

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.610
you need the component of
attaching subjective reward,

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:23.420
you need to make errors, all this stuff.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.810
And a lot of people find it difficult

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:30.260
to just get into the overall
state to access those things.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.890
So now there's a series of gates

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:34.320
that people are having
a hard time accessing.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.000
They're too tired and they
can't focus, for instance.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.970
Well, here's the beauty of it.

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:44.470
If you are too alert,
meaning you're too anxious,

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:47.430
and you want to calm down
in order to learn better,

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:49.060
there are things that you can do.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.630
The two that I've spoken about previously

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:52.680
on various podcasts,

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.140
and I'll just review them really quickly,

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.730
are the double inhale exhale.

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.100
So inhaling twice through the nose

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.610
and exhaling once through the mouth.

01:01:58.610 --> 01:02:02.240
This is not some yoga trick or some hack.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.110
This is what's called
a physiological sigh.

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.350
It offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs,

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:07.750
it has a number of different effects.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.153
These were described in
textbooks dating back to the 30s

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.770
and a number of laboratories have explored

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.610
the neurocircuitry underlying these

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.140
so-called physiological sighs.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.150
That will calm you down
faster than anything else

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.970
that I'm aware of.

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:25.090
The other thing is starting
to remove your tunnel vision.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.150
When you use tunnel vision,
you're very focused,

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:28.950
that epinephrine up is
released by dilating

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:32.150
your field of gaze,
so-called panoramic vision.

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:35.270
Great, so now you can start to

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:39.200
sort of move up and down this
level of autonomic arousal.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.670
The key is you want to
be in a state of arousal

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:43.730
that's ideally matched

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.510
to the thing that you're
trying to perform or learn.

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.140
So if I'm really anxious

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.000
and I can't even pick up the basketball

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.300
or I feel like I'm shaking
or my muscles are too tight,

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.780
I don't have that kind of looseness,

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.730
when I move like that, it
almost makes it look like

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:59.403
I could throw a free throw,
but I miss 95% of the time,

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.210
unless the basket is very, very low

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.110
and I place it in directly.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.120
I guess that's not a free
throw, is it? [laughs]

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.420
In any case, the point being that

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.410
you want to be in a state
of alertness but calm.

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.393
And so you need to have
ways to calm yourself down

01:03:14.393 --> 01:03:16.423
when you're too amped up.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.570
But the other side of limbic
friction is important too.

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:22.640
If you are too tired and you can't focus,

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.370
well, then it's going to be
impossible to even get to

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:26.880
the starting line, so to speak,

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.740
for engaging in neuroplasticity

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.550
through incremental learning, et cetera.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.070
So in that case, there are other methods

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.210
that you can do to wake yourself up.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.060
The best thing you should do
is get a good night's sleep,

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.220
but that's not always possible,

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.900
or use a NSDR, non-sleep
deep rest protocol.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.400
But if you've already done those things

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.200
or you're simply exhausted
for whatever other reason,

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.580
then there are other things
that I often get asked about,

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.550
like sure a cup of coffee or
super oxygenation breathing,

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.530
which means inhaling more than exhaling

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.453
on average in a breathing about.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.220
Now we're sort of getting
toward the realm of like

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.360
how you could trick your
nervous system into waking up.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.960
And if you bring more oxygen in

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.560
by making your inhales deeper and longer,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.220
you will become more alert.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.280
You'll start to actually
deploy norepinephrine

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.700
if you breathe very fast.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.570
So there are things that you
can do to move up or down

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:15.610
this so-called autonomic arousal arc.

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:18.020
And what you want to
ask before you undergo

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.770
any learning about is

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.120
how much limbic friction
am I experiencing?

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.820
Am I too alert and I want to be calmer,

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:28.010
or am I too calm and too sleepy
and I want to be more alert?

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:30.990
You're going to need
to engage in behaviors

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.963
that bring you to the starting
line in order to learn.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.360
There are other things that
you can do in order to then

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.820
learn better and faster
besides incremental learning,

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.860
and those center on the vestibular system.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.870
And this may come as a
surprise to some people,

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.010
but probably not as a surprise

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:52.040
to some of you whose
professions or whose recreation

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.420
involves a lot of motor activity

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.810
and sort of what we call high
dimensional skill activity,

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.360
not just running or cycling

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.340
or very linear activities
like weightlifting,

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.010
but things that involve inversions

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.680
and a lot of lateral movement,

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.690
actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.670
these kinds of things,
gymnastics type stuff.

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:13.370
Why the vestibular system
to access neuroplasticity?

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:16.860
Well, we have a hardwired
system for balance,

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.990
and here's how it works

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.853
in as simple terms as I
can possibly come up with.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:26.140
As we move through space,

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.780
or even if we're stationary,

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.950
there are really three
main planes of movement.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:31.610
Now, I realize some people
are just listening to this,

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.200
so I'm going to do this for both the folks

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.120
that are just listening

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.230
and for those of you that
are watching on video.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.130
So there are three main modes of movement.

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:40.660
And it turns out that your brain

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.350
doesn't really know where your body is,

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:45.130
except through that
proprioceptive feedback.

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:47.000
The main way it knows

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.400
is through three planes of
movement that we call pitch,

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.890
which is like nodding.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.780
So if I nod like this, that's pitch.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.450
Then there's yaw, which is side to side,

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:59.640
which is like shaking my head no.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.690
And then there's roll from side to side

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.330
like when a puppy looks
at you, like mm-mmm,

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:05.680
that kind of thing.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.520
So pitch, yaw, and roll.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.600
And the pilots out there

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.650
will know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:16.490
The brain knows the orientation
and position of your body

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.140
relative to gravity,

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.730
depending on whether or
not your brain in your head

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:25.220
actually is engaging more
in pitch, yaw, or roll,

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:28.200
or some combination because
if I lean down like so

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.570
or like so, it's a combination
of pitch, yaw, and roll.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.020
You might say like,
"What is going on here?"

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.960
Well, we have these little
things in our inner ear

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.620
called the semicircular canals.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.700
Just like our eyes have
two main functions,

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.450
one is to see objects in space

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:43.830
and the other is to set
our circadian clocks

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:45.120
through subconscious mechanisms,

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.060
our ears have two main roles.

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.170
One is to hear, to perceive sound waves

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.180
or take in sound waves for
perception, so-called hearing,

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.620
and the other is balance
or vestibular function.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.210
So sitting in our ears are
these semicircular canals,

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.200
and they're these little tubes
where these little stones,

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.520
they're actually little bits of calcium,

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.480
roll back and forth like little marbles.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.490
When we roll this way, they
roll this way, when we pitch.

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:09.550
When we go from side to side,

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:10.900
there's some that sit flat like this

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.270
and they go [makes swishing sound]

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:14.170
like marbles inside of a hula hoop.

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.970
And then we have roll,
there's some that are kind of

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.670
at 45 degrees to those and
it's kind of pitchy on roll.

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:20.740
Okay, great.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.300
That sends signals to the
rest of our brain and body

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.080
that tell us how to compensate

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.010
for shifts relative to gravity.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.340
And you say, "Okay,

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.740
I thought we were talking
about plasticity."

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.220
But this is where it
gets really, really cool.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:38.220
Errors in vestibular
motor sensory experience,

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:40.880
meaning when we are off-balance

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.850
and we have to compensate by
looking at, thinking about,

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:47.480
or responding to the world differently

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.130
cause an area of our brain
called the cerebellum,

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:51.470
it actually means mini brain,

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:53.010
it looks like a little mini brain

01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:56.390
like tucked below our cortex in the back,

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:58.390
cause the cerebellum to signal

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:00.460
some of these deeper brain centers

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.760
that release dopamine,
norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.730
And that's because these circuits

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:09.713
in the inner ear, et cetera,

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.150
and the cerebellum,

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:16.920
they were designed to
recalibrate our motor movements

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.610
when our relationship to gravity changes.

01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:21.050
Something fundamental to survival.

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:22.940
We can't afford to be
falling down all the time

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.210
or missing things that we grab for,

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:28.450
or running in the wrong direction

01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:29.980
when something is pursuing us.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.960
These are hardwired circuits that tap

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.650
right into these chemical pathways.

01:08:34.650 --> 01:08:38.660
And those chemical pathways
are the gates to plasticity.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.840
So I really want to spell this out clearly

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.320
'cause I've given a lot
of information today.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.153
The first thing is,

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:47.080
how are you arriving
to the learning about?

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.420
You need to make sure your level

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.100
of autonomic arousal is correct.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.140
The ideal state is going to
be clear, calm, and focused,

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.670
maybe a little bit more
on the arousal level,

01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.340
like heightened arousal.

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.200
So understand limbic friction,

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.470
understand that you can be too tired,

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.960
in which case you're going to
need to get yourself more alert,

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.500
or you can be too alert

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.250
and you're going to need
to get yourself calmer.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.270
That gets you to the starting line.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:12.510
When you're at the starting line,

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:13.960
then you're going to go
into a learning about,

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.880
and that's when you want to
start making these errors.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.200
But what I'm saying is
there's a layer in between

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.850
where if you are interested
in using motor patterns

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:27.470
as a way to open up plasticity
for all kinds of learning,

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:28.683
not just motor learning,

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:34.797
disrupting your vestibular
motor relationship,

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.890
and I'll tell you how
to do that in a moment,

01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:41.320
can deploy or release
neurochemicals in the brain

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.510
that place you into a state

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:47.030
that makes you much better at learning

01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:50.440
and makes making errors
much more pleasureful,

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.240
you're much more willing to do that.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.357
Now, some of you are probably saying,

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:54.530
"Flow state, flow state."

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:57.140
Okay, I have friends
that work on flow states

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.430
and who are involved in

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.340
flow states and trying to
figure out what they are.

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.790
I have great respect for those people.

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:05.585
I want to tip my hat to them.

01:10:05.585 --> 01:10:07.010
Very important work.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.010
But, again, flow is an expression

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.950
of what you already know how to do.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:13.010
It's not how you learn,

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.770
it's how you express what
you've already learned.

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:17.190
I want to be really clear about that.

01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:20.010
It's been kind of presented
as this super state

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:24.380
or highly desirable state
that we can all reach for.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.250
That's the wrong [indistinct] to reach for

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.880
until you already know
how to do the things

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.960
that I'm describing, in my opinion.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.080
So the vestibular system,

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.090
if you can engage the vestibular system

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:38.130
and create some errors
within the vestibular motor

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.860
operations that you're carrying out,

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.440
you create a neurochemical
state that then makes you

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.890
very, very good at learning
very quickly regardless of age.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.120
So what would this look like?

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.910
Does this mean just doing inversions?

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.010
Does this mean doing yoga?

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.843
Maybe.

01:10:52.843 --> 01:10:56.763
Does this mean taking corners
faster on your road bike?

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.750
Let's say you always swim
freestyle or breaststroke,

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:05.750
does this mean swimming
backstroke or butterfly?

01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:07.310
It depends.

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:09.500
It depends, however, on a very,

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.340
very easy to understand
parameter, which is

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:15.600
how regularly you perform
a particular motor behavior

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:18.820
and how novel a behavior is.

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.380
So the more novel that a behavior is

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.920
in terms of your relationship to gravity,

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.580
the more it will open up the
opportunity for plasticity.

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.160
Have you ever seen somebody who just

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.560
jumped out of a plane for the first time

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.850
with a parachute? [laughs]

01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:35.050
I don't even want to think about what,

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:36.830
if you've just seen somebody
who jumped out of a plane

01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:38.070
for the first time without a parachute,

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:40.250
I just hope the plane was on the ground.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.130
But if you seen somebody after that,

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:44.870
they are in this incredible
state because their

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:47.430
body and brain are flooded
with all these neurochemicals

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:49.080
because it's very novel to them.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.040
However, I've got friends
from communities that

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.860
have done thousands upon thousands,

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.480
maybe tens of thousands of jumps,

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.330
and they're always alert and aware,

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:59.370
but it becomes pretty regular for them.

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.240
That's the point.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.200
And they're not in this
kind of buzzed out,

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.113
excited state afterwards
because it's routine for them.

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:08.050
The key is to bring novelty

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:11.490
to the vestibular motor experience,

01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:15.193
the vestibular motor commands
that you're performing.

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.940
How do you do that?

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.700
Well, it's all about your
orientation relative to gravity.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.740
Now, I wouldn't want anyone
to place themselves at risk.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.470
So if you can't do handstands,
don't try and do them,

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:27.850
freestanding and whatever.

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:29.030
If you're good at handstands,

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:32.120
guess how much plasticity doing
handstands for half an hour

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.870
is going to create for you.

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.330
Zero.

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:36.163
Zero.

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:38.630
Your body is fully comfortable
walking on your hands.

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.590
I see these people walking on your hands,

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:42.170
being upside down, being inverted.

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:43.670
Your Cirque du Soleil performers,

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:44.820
they're very comfortable there,

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.370
and there is zero
learning, zero plasticity

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:49.000
because the failures and errors

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.430
and the relationship to gravity

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.890
are very typical for that individual.

01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:56.600
Now, what this means is

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.690
that if we're going to use motor practices

01:12:58.690 --> 01:13:00.560
to open up plasticity for learning,

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.210
not just those practices, but
maybe some cognitive skills

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:06.640
or other things in the
period that follows,

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.720
we need to create a sense of
novelty relative to gravity.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.440
And that means being
either in a new position

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.370
or slightly unstable.

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:17.050
Believe it or not,

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:18.320
I don't want anyone injuring themselves,

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.000
but the sensation of
falling or close to falling

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.970
signals the cerebellum to
signal the deep brain centers

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:26.820
that release these neurochemicals

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.887
that something is very different

01:13:27.887 --> 01:13:31.080
and we need to correct
this error very, very fast.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.350
Now, earlier, I was talking about

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:34.630
high contingencies for learning,

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:37.610
and you definitely don't want
to make it a kind of like

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:40.953
either survive this or
die kind of experience.

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:43.450
I confess, I occasionally look at these

01:13:43.450 --> 01:13:45.880
parkour videos on YouTube.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.320
Believe it or not, a lot
of those people have died,

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.389
the ones that do these ridiculous things

01:13:50.389 --> 01:13:52.260
of hanging off of buildings and things.

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.620
I am not suggesting you do that.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.930
Please don't do that.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:58.120
What I'm talking about is
finding safe ways to explore

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.600
the sensory motor vestibular
space, as we call it,

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.090
the relationship between those things.

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.520
So that could be through yoga.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.650
If you're terrible at yoga,

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.070
there's more opportunity for you to learn

01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:09.480
than somebody who's very
skilled at yoga, for instance,

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.340
or gymnastics, or handstands,
or on your road bike.

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.180
This is, unfortunately, what,

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.070
I don't want to name
brands, but stationary bikes

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:17.700
where they give you the visual experience

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.650
of moving through space,

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:20.780
but you're not actually
moving through physical space,

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.500
there's no vestibular feedback.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.663
It's all visual.

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:27.640
You're stationary on the bike.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.810
So unless you're hanging off
the bike in your living room

01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:32.060
like almost to the point
you're tipping the bike,

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:34.800
you're not getting the actual vestibular

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.350
motor sensory mismatch.

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:38.720
That mismatch is the signal that deploys

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.500
dopamine, epinephrin,
and these other things.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.910
I don't care how excited or
how much fun the ride was

01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.190
or how much music you're
playing that you love,

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.700
it's not the same situation

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:52.700
as being out of your normal relationship

01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:55.210
to the gravitational pull.

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.350
So the first gate is to arrive at learning

01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.660
at the appropriate level
of autonomic arousal.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.300
Clear and focused is best,

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.490
but don't obsess over being
right there, it's okay.

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.720
If you're a little anxious
or a little bit tired,

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.640
then you want to make errors.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.750
We talked about that,

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.640
and this vestibular motor
sensory relationship

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.550
is absolutely key

01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:18.870
if you want to get heightened
or accelerated plasticity.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:21.420
And we talked about another feature,

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.420
which is setting a contingency.

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.570
If there's a reason,

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.230
an important reason for
you to actually learn,

01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:28.910
even if you're making failures,

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:30.700
the learning will be accelerated.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.090
So there's really four things
that you really need to do

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:36.060
for plasticity as an adult.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.730
And I would say that these
also apply to young people.

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:42.120
And there's an interesting

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.100
kind of a thought
experiment there as well,

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.860
which is if you look at children,

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.890
they are moving a lot
in different dimensions.

01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:52.593
They are sometimes hanging from trees.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.250
My sports were always
things where I tended to get

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:58.290
hurt a lot, fall a lot.

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.160
So it's skateboarding for
me when I was younger,

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.790
so a lot of falling and rolling

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:05.070
and various things of that sort.

01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:06.780
But whatever sport the kids are playing,

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.790
or even if they don't play a sport,

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:11.080
they tend to move in a lot of different

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.960
relationships to gravity,

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.850
more dimensionality to their
movements I should say,

01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:16.683
than adults.

01:16:16.683 --> 01:16:18.130
And one of the questions that's always

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.850
kind of been in the back of my mind is,

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.950
as we age we get less good at
engaging in neuroplasticity.

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:25.660
Part of that is because

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.531
as the brain ages there
are certain changes to

01:16:28.531 --> 01:16:29.960
the way that neurons are structured,

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.970
their molecular components, et cetera.

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:35.500
But it's kind of a self-amplifying,

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:40.480
or I should say self-degenerating cycle

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:46.720
where as we get older, we
tend to get more linear

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.250
and more regular about
specific kinds of movements.

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:51.430
So we'd get on the treadmill,
or we take the walk,

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.620
or we just always go up
the same stairs, et cetera.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.540
And there's less opportunity, typically,

01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:00.330
for engaging these relationships
to the gravitational pull

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:03.200
through the vestibular
motor sensory convergence

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.090
that we talked about a moment ago.

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:07.350
And so you sort of have
to wonder whether or not

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:10.390
the lack of plasticity
or the reduced plasticity

01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:13.363
in older individuals, which includes me,

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.760
would reflect the fact that

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.820
those chemicals aren't
being deployed because

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.780
we're not engaging in certain behaviors

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.250
as opposed to we can't
engage in the behaviors

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:26.070
because the chemicals
aren't being deployed.

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.310
Now, I have a feeling it's both.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:29.270
These have a reciprocal relationship.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.150
And I certainly, again, I don't think

01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:34.010
it would be wise for
anyone who doesn't have

01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:36.230
the muscle stabilizing skills

01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:38.640
or the bone density, et cetera,

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.210
to start doing inversions
and things of that sort.

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.190
That's not what I'm talking about here.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:44.610
But it's interesting to think about

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:46.650
the sorts of exercise that we engage in.

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:48.440
We all know that getting
the heart rate elevated

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.090
three to five times a week

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:52.190
is really good for us for
cardiovascular health.

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:54.830
I think there's a ton of
data to support that now.

01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:57.290
Some load-bearing exercise is important

01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:58.540
for increasing bone density

01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.860
and maintaining muscular strength

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.020
and proprioceptive feedback.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.320
Because, I'm sure many of you know this,

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.470
but resistance exercise actually trains

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:09.180
the nerve to muscle connections

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.680
as much as it does the muscles themselves.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.210
Something I talked about at
the beginning of the episode.

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:18.310
But I think most of us
could stand to increase

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:21.800
the degree to which we
engage this vestibular system

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.910
in novel ways.

01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:24.380
And that can be done quite safely

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.230
through a number of different mechanisms.

01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:29.960
I'm not a surfer, but people
who do that sort of thing

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.450
are very familiar with
orienting their body differently

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:34.640
according to the gravitational pull.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.080
They're lying down, then
they're standing up,

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.870
then they're turning,
they're leaning their head.

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:40.440
So, again, it's this
pitch, yaw, roll thing.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.680
And, again, if you're
very skilled at surfing,

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.810
you're actually not going to

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.530
open up plasticity just by surfing.

01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:49.740
It's in the learning of these
new relationships to gravity

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:52.563
that the windows for
plasticity are enhanced.

01:18:54.034 --> 01:18:56.510
I want to make sure that
I underscore the fact

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:59.060
that this vestibular thing
that I've been describing

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:02.440
is a way to really accentuate plasticity.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.270
It's tapping into an
inborn biological mechanism

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:09.100
where the cerebellum has outputs
to these deep brain nuclei

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.563
associated with dopamine,
acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.

01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:15.870
You don't want to endanger
yourself in the course of

01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:18.863
pursuing these activities, but
it is a powerful mechanism.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.130
That's kind of an amplifier on plasticity,

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:24.470
as is high contingency.

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:26.590
If you really need to
learn conversational French

01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:28.130
to save your relationship,

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.870
the chances are you're going to learn it.

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:31.660
There are limits, of course, to the extent

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:35.890
to which one can accentuate
or accelerate plasticity.

01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:37.890
The ceiling on this is not infinite,

01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:40.060
although we don't know how high it goes.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.340
I think it's reasonable to say that

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.787
if someone put a gun to my head and said,

01:19:42.787 --> 01:19:46.020
"Learn conversational French
in the next 120 seconds,"

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.900
that conversational French will be limited

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.320
probably to just one word,

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.680
probably the word oui
or something like that.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.430
Because I can't stuff in all
the knowledge all at once.

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.820
I think that's the dream
of brain-machine interface,

01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.610
that one will be able to download a chip

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:01.790
into their hippocampus or cortex,

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:03.670
or some other brain structure
that would allow them

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:06.100
to download conversational French.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.573
And someday we may get to that,

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:11.080
that capability may come about.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.130
Right now, it does not exist,

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:17.040
nor is there a specific pill
or chemical that will allow you

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.520
to download more information more quickly.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.120
This is the issue around nootropics

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.790
I've talked about before.

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:26.740
There are things that can increase focus,

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.700
mainly things that increase acetylcholine

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:31.160
and transmission through
the nicotine system,

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.420
things that can increase
dopamine, things like L-tyrosine.

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.590
Again, I'm not recommending these.

01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:37.390
You need to heed the
warnings on those bottles,

01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:39.960
but they will increase
these neurochemicals.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.100
And there are, of course,

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.260
things that will increase epinephrin,

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.220
things like caffeine,

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:47.240
or some people, because of
prescription, take Adderall.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.850
I'm, again, not suggesting
people take any of these things.

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:53.380
In fact, today I focused
almost exclusively

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:58.020
on behavioral tools and ways
of structuring learning bouts

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.350
that will allow you to
access more plasticity

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:01.710
regardless of age.

01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:03.740
And they center around things that

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.960
I'm sure if you look around you you'll see

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.460
evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning is powerful,"

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.000
or, "Oh, the vestibular system

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
can open up opportunities for plasticity."

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.827
I'm sure that the yogis
out there all saying,

01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:18.470
"Wait, this sounds exactly like yoga.

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:20.370
We're supposed to push to an edge

01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:23.100
and do these inversions and
do all those sorts of things."

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:23.970
Well, I want to be clear,

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:25.590
I never said anyone should do inversions.

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:29.210
I said that the vestibular
system is a valuable portal

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:30.680
into some of these neurochemical states

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.150
that favor plasticity.

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:36.170
But not so seldom, I hear
from the yoga community,

01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:37.507
and they will say things like,

01:21:37.507 --> 01:21:39.700
"Much of what you're saying
about how the brain works

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.520
or neuroplasticity has
already been described

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.306
or is embedded in yoga practices."

01:21:44.306 --> 01:21:45.460
And I just want to be very clear,

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.690
I have tremendous respect for

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:49.720
the yoga community and the practices,

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.090
I've done yoga from time to time,

01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:52.940
I find it challenging and valuable.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.930
I'm not a regular practitioner.

01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:58.020
But the problem with yoga

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.880
is exactly the same problem with science,

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.780
which is that yoga has a lot of practices

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.330
for which there are very specific names,

01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:10.290
but no description

01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.180
or lending of understanding
about mechanism.

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:15.857
And science has a lot
of mechanisms [laughs]

01:22:15.857 --> 01:22:17.810
and a lot of publications and papers

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:19.230
for which there's very little,

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:22.053
if not no description
of tools and practices.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.260
My goal in not just today

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.680
but in many ways throughout
the course of the podcast

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.120
is to bridge the gaps between
these various disciplines

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.360
in ways that are grounded mainly

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.830
to the fields of neuroscience
and some related fields.

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:40.370
So, yes, it's true that I look at things

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:41.940
mainly through the lens of science,

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:45.190
but that's not to say that
it exhaustively explains

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:47.170
everything about anything,

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:49.220
nor is it to say that it's the only lens

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.520
through which one could look at

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.210
something like neuroplasticity.

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:53.850
So I just want to acknowledge that

01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:55.240
I have great respect for all these

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.820
different practices and communities.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.730
And I think that, indeed,
there are many cases in which

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:03.110
different communities
and practices have been

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:07.380
aimed at targeting the
same goals or outcomes.

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.080
Science and neuroscience,

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.270
through an understanding of mechanism,

01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:15.470
can allow all of us to gain
kind of common understanding

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:16.860
about what those practices are

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.050
and how to access things
like neuroplasticity,

01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:20.900
sleep, et cetera.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.530
And I do believe. as I've said
previously on this podcast,

01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:26.030
that understanding mechanism

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:28.140
affords us a certain flexibility.

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.080
And I don't mean physical flexibility.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.340
I mean a flexibility when we can't engage

01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:34.380
in a particular behavior,

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.390
maybe we were injured or
maybe we're not in the right

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.750
situation to do a particular practice,

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:40.640
but by thinking about mechanism,

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.060
we can adapt our circumstances.

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.990
I talked about this with sleep.

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:47.350
If you're rigidly attached to one protocol

01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:49.620
of always looking at sunlight
at one particular time

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.000
in the morning and in the evening,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.010
that is not as valuable as
understanding the mechanisms

01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:55.520
of why you might look at

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.840
sunlight at one particular
time versus another

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.670
because that affords you a flexibility,

01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:00.680
allows you to adapt.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.300
And life is very dynamic and
we don't have control over

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.610
all the external conditions all the time.

01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:08.400
And so understanding mechanism

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.560
through the lens of neuroscience,

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.540
I do believe, can be very powerful

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.160
because, of course,
there are multiple ways

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.280
to access dopamine,

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.120
there are multiple ways
to adjust limbic friction.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.270
It's not just through respiration.

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:21.940
Of course, there are many ways to do that.

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.100
And so my overall goal
here in this episode

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.490
and with this podcast

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:29.730
is to give you some
understanding of the mechanisms

01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:32.140
and the insights into
the underlying biology

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:33.990
that allow you to tailor

01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:38.110
what these kind of
foundational mechanisms are

01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:40.790
to suit your particular learning needs.

01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:44.030
So I really thank you for
your time and attention today.

01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:45.540
I've covered a lot of material.

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:49.050
I very much encourage questions
in the comments section

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.880
if you're looking at this on YouTube.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.750
And if you're not and
you're listening to it,

01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:54.120
on Apple or Spotify.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.820
Please feel free to visit us
over on the YouTube channel

01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.760
and put your questions
in the comments section.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.650
I do read them.

01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:02.830
This entire month is all
about neuroplasticity.

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:04.210
There's a lot to cover,

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:06.640
but I'm very excited to
delve deeper into this topic

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.140
as it relates to your
particular interests.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.600
Many of you have graciously asked

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.740
how you can help support the podcast.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.910
The best way you can do that

01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:16.010
is to subscribe to the YouTube channel,

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.740
if you haven't done that already,

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.700
as well as to place questions
in the comments section below,

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:23.200
or comments if you'd
like to give us feedback.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.060
Also to subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:29.780
And Apple allows you to
leave a five-star review,

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:32.170
if you believe we deserve
a five-star review,

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.070
as well as leave comments
about the podcast.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:38.000
In addition, if you
can suggest the podcast

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.070
to your friends, to your family members,

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:42.330
or anyone that you think
might be able to use

01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:43.700
and appreciate the information,

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:45.520
that's a terrific way to support us.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.400
And, of course, check out our sponsors

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.620
that we mentioned at the beginning.

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:51.200
That's a terrific way
to support us as well.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.100
Several times throughout today's episode,

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.820
as well as on previous
episodes of the podcast,

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.730
I've talked about various supplements

01:25:57.730 --> 01:26:00.670
that can be useful for enhancing sleep,

01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.190
enhancing neuroplasticity, et cetera.

01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:05.260
And, again, I want to emphasize that

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.190
I always think that behavioral practices

01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:08.780
are the place to start.

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.410
I don't think supplements should ever be

01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:11.950
the first line of entry

01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:14.000
for people looking to
enhance these aspects

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.380
of their nervous system and life.

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.720
But for those of you that
are interested in supplements

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.300
and the supplements that I take,

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.620
I'm pleased to announce that
we partnered with Thorne,

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:23.950
T-H-O-R-N-E.

01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:27.190
And Thorne makes supplements
that are, in my opinion,

01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:29.700
of the very highest stringency in terms of

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.290
what's listed on the bottle

01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:32.980
is actually what you'll
find in the bottle,

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.410
this is a serious issue for
the supplement industry,

01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:37.460
as well as just the overall quality

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:40.000
of the materials they put
into their supplements.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.730
If you'd like to take a look
at the supplements that I take

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:45.410
as well as explore any
of them for yourself,

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:50.410
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:51.920
And if you look there, you'll see

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.960
a number of the different
supplements that I take.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.960
And if you decide to purchase any of them,

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.640
you'll get 20% off your order.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:02.590
So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman

01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:03.980
to see the supplements that I take

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.570
and to explore if any of
them are right for you.

01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:09.210
In the next episode of this podcast,

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:12.380
we're going to continue to
explore neuroplasticity.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:15.080
This, as you may recall, is
the way that we go about things

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.460
here the Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.450
which is to really drill deeply

01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:21.980
into a topic for three or
four, or even five episodes

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.160
so that by the end of those episodes,

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.730
all of you have a very firm
understanding of how to

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:28.970
apply the principles of neurobiology

01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:30.900
to the specific practices

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.330
and endeavors that are
most important to you.

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:36.140
So I very much thank you
for your time and attention.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:38.040
I know it's a lot of information

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.490
and it takes a bit of focus and attention,

01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:43.200
and certainly will trigger plasticity

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.060
to learn all this information.

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.520
I want to encourage
you and just remind you

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.970
that you don't have to
grasp it all at once,

01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:51.630
that it is here archived

01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:53.470
and that if you want to
return to the information,

01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:54.930
it will still be here.

01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:57.270
And that I, most of all,

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:59.400
really appreciate your
interest in science.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.300
Thank you so much.
