00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.950
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.011
for everyday life.

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:09.330
[gentle music]

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.380
of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.250
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.970
This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.710
and research roles at Stanford.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.910
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.200
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.280
about science and science-related tools

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.970
to the general public.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.370
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.410
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.270
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.560
Founded by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.430
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
have really been designed

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.610
with the utmost care
and the utmost attention

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.710
to the science of optics
and the visual system.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.320
So one of the things I like so much

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.460
about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.640
is that they're extremely lightweight.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.290
If you get sweaty, so for instance,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.470
if you wear them while
running, or walking, or hiking,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.030
they don't slip off.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.510
And with the sunglasses,
when you're outdoors,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.010
if there's cloud cover,
or if there's shadows,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.700
or if the day gets brighter or dimmer,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.230
you can still see your
surroundings perfectly well.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.010
And that's because the designers at Roka

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.610
really understand the way
the visual system works

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.790
how it habituates, how it adapts.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980
You don't need to understand the science

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.440
behind all that, but they do,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.520
and as a consequence the
eyeglasses perform extremely well

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520
under all conditions,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.510
whether or not that's indoors or outdoors.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.910
So they put a ton of science
and purpose into the design.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.400
They also happen to look really good.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.060
They have a really nice aesthetic.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.760
A lot of, as you know,
performance active wear eyeglasses

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.060
look rather ridiculous, but
the Roka glasses, I think,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.740
have a very nice aesthetic to them

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.050
that you can wear anywhere.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.650
If you'd like to check out Roka glasses,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.740

and enter the code Huberman at checkout

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.370
for 20% off your order.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.660
Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.110
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.830
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.350
to help you better understand your body

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.230
and reach your health goals.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.900
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.610
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.660
that impact our immediate
and longterm health

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.290
can only be analyzed from a blood test.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.690
And now, with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.000
we can also get insight
into our specific DNA makeup

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.730
and how that influences
our lifestyle choices

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.990
and our health status.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.740
The problem with a lot of blood tests

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.640
is that you get a lot of information back,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.570
but you don't always know what
to do with that information.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.870
With Inside Tracker, they
have a very easy to use,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.260
personalized dashboard platform

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.040
that informs you what sorts of lifestyle,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.900
nutrition, exercise, changes
you might want to make,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.640
according to the levels of
particular metabolic factors,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.580
hormone factors, et cetera,
in your blood and DNA.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.130
So it makes everything very simple,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.600
both in terms of where
you're at health-wise

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.030
and what you should or could do,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.340
in order to improve your health,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.590
something I do believe most
everybody would like to do.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.730
With Inside Tracker, it
makes all that very easy.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.980
They also have something
called the inner age test.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.090
This is a test that shows
you what your biological age

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.720
and compares to that, of course,
to your chronological age.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.130
And, of course, your biological age

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.300
is really what you want to know,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.960
because it's a predictor of
how long you're going to live

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.720
and the quality of your life.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.250
If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.440

just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.030
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.140
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.080
that are ideally suited
to your sleep needs.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.030
Everybody needs something different

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.420
in terms of what to sleep on.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.970
Some people like a hard mattress.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.240
Some people like a soft mattress.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.580
Some people tend to run warm.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.460
Some people tend to run cold.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.500
With Helix Sleep, you go to their website,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.890
you take a very brief two-minute quiz,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.550
and you answer some questions such as,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.840
do you tend to sleep on your stomach,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.750
or your side, or your back?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.583
Maybe you don't know.

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:59.780
Do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.570
At the end of that quiz, you
match to a specific mattress.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.220
I took that quiz about six months ago,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.470
and I matched to the Dusk Mattress,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.760
and I've been sleeping on
a Dusk mattress from Helix

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.720
for the last six months,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.250
and I've been sleeping better
than I ever have before.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.250
Basically, everyone's unique,
and Helix understands that,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.490
and that's built into the
design of their mattresses

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.460
and this two-minute quiz that
you take to match you to one.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.530
If you'd like to try a
Helix Sleep mattress,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.720
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.270
take their two-minute quiz,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.540
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.450
You'll also get up to $200
off any mattress order

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.420
and two free pillows.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.340
They make terrific pillows.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.610
You'll get a 10-year
warranty on that mattress,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.910
and you get to try it out
for 100 nights risk-free.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.810
If you don't like it,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.190
they'll come pick it up and take it away.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.023
You won't get charged,

00:04:44.023 --> 00:04:45.770
you'll get your money back, et cetera.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.550
So that's helixsleep.com/huberman

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.320
for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.240
We are now beginning a new topic

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.410
for the next four to five episodes

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.630
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.120
Before we move into that,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.370
I want to just briefly
touch on a couple questions

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.290
that I got from the last episode,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.430
which was related to the
science of endurance training.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.580
I described the four kinds
of endurance training.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.660
We posted protocols of
the specific four kinds

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.370
of endurance training at hubermanlab.com.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.410
Just go to that episode,
you can see the download,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.280
it's a zero-cost PDF.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.950
I got a lot of questions

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.070
about what's called concurrent training,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.900
which is how to program endurance training

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.560
if you are also interested

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.610
in strength and hypertrophy training.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.310
Or how to incorporate strength
and hypertrophy training,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.810
which was in the previous
episode, with endurance training.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.230
This can all be made very simple.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.410
Ask yourself, what are
you trying to emphasize,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.500
and then emphasize that
for a 10 to 12 week cycle.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.400
So if you're mostly
interested in endurance,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.960
I would say use a three to two ratio,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.030
maybe get three endurance
training workouts per week,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.470
maybe four, and two strength
and hypertrophy workouts.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.320
If you're mainly focusing
on strength and hypertrophy,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.240
get three or four workouts
for strength and hypertrophy

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.260
and do two endurance workouts.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.400
Start with the minimum number
of sets that's required

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.790
to get the result that you want.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.190
So if you're not accustomed
to doing endurance work,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.670
you would start with the minimum number

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.230
that's listed on that protocol.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.570
So if it says three to five sets,

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.120
you would start with
three, maybe even just two,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.070
and then work your way up
by adding sets each week.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.520
I do suggest that people get

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.600
at least one complete rest day per week.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.190
And although I know a lot
of people don't like that,

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.023
I benefit from that.

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.100
I actually benefit from having

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.730
two complete rest days each week.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.510
I just continue to make progress that way,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.510
whether or not it's for
strength and hypertrophy

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.200
or for endurance.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.780
I am a big believer in rest
days, other people are not.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.970
And those could be active rest days,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.493
hiking, relaxing, et cetera.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.000
After a 10 to 12 week cycle,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.240
then I also suggest taking anywhere

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.540
from five to seven days completely off.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.200
You can still enjoy life and do things,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.560
I know for you addicted exercisers

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.060
that you're going to loathe to do that,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.700
but that's one way to stay injury free,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.800
keep your joints and
tissues healthy over time,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.300
and continue to make progress.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.300
If you don't want to do
that week off, don't do it.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.250
None of this is holy.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.930
None of it is a strict prescriptive.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.960
Just ask yourself, what
are you going to emphasize

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.050
and emphasize that, in
terms of the total volume

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.920
of workouts that you do,
and work up incrementally,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.360
and then move into another cycle.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.630
That's what I suggest.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.990
So go to hubermanlab.com,

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.780
you can get the protocol there.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.970
We are now going to move into a new topic

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.840
unrelated to physical performance.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.550
Starting with this episode

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.500
and for the next four to five episodes,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.283
we are going to talk all about the senses.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.360
That's sight, eyesight,
hearing, touch, taste, smell,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.560
and we're also going to talk
about this critical sense

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.170
that we call interoception,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.040
or our sense of our internal real estate.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.750
Now, the reason that we are
talking about the senses

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.720
is because if you understand
how the senses are perceived,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.840
what they're about, what
the underlying cells

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.950
and connections are about,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.980
you will be in a terrific position

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.220
to understand the month's
topic that follows,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.590
which is all about mental health.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.810
Now, I want to emphasize
that if you're somebody

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.730
who doesn't have any trouble

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.770
seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.263
and has an excellent
sense of interoception,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.910
I do believe that these episodes

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.990
will still be very relevant to you,

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.820
because they have everything to do with

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.470
how you move through the world,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.830
how you make sense of information,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.350
and how you organize your
thoughts and your emotions.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.320
I also want to emphasize
that we're going to cover

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.060
a lot of practical tools.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.650
So today's episode is going to be

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.900
all about vision and eyesight,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.810
a topic that's very near
and dear to my heart,

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.010
because it's the one that
I've been focusing on

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.080
for well over 25 years of my career.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.780
But we're not just going to get
into the mechanistic details

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.580
about how light is converted

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.070
into electrical potentials
and things like that.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.950
We are going to talk about practical tools

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.490
that you can and should use
to help maintain the health

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.540
of your visual system and your eyesight.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.740
Very often, young people
will say, what should I do?

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.260
You know, you're always talking about,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.350
you know, neuroplasticity and
how it tapers off over time,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.400
but I'm a young person, what should I do?

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.480
You should absolutely train
and support your eyesight.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.520
In fact, if you're a young
person and you see perfectly,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.140
or you feel as if you
see the world perfectly,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.080
you are in the best position to bolster,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.180
to reinforce that visual system,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.000
so that you don't lose
your vision as you age.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.200
In addition, you can
leverage your visual system

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.120
for better mental and
physical performance,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.660
and we're going to talk about that.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.860
If you're somebody who suffers

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.140
from a clinical disorder of vision,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.260
you have trouble seeing,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.650
or if you need corrective
lenses in order to see,

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.390
this episode is definitely for you.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.701
And while of course I can't
make clinical diagnoses,

00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:53.160
I can't have a one-to-one conversation

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.350
with any of you in this
format, nor am I a clinician,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.270
I'm a scientist, not a physician.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.780
I did consult with our
chair of ophthalmology,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.840
Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.130
at Stanford University School of Medicine,

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.630
as well as several other people

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.910
to really vet the information

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.390
and make sure that the protocols

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.930
that I'm describing are consistent

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.600
with the clinical literature.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.880
If you have a severe eye problem,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.460
you should be working with

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.030
a really good ophthalmologist
and/or optometrist,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.420
but certainly an an ophthalmologist
who's a medical doctor.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.330
But I do believe that the information

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.650
that we're going to discuss today

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.300
is going to be relevant to everybody

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.070
and will set the stage for the month

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.510
on mental health and mental performance.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.120
So, let's get started.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.790
When we hear the word vision,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.090
we most often think about eyesight,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.230
or our ability to perceive
shapes, and objects,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.050
and faces, and colors.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.150
And indeed, vision involves eyesight,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.800
our ability to see shapes,
and objects, and faces,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.480
and colors, and so forth.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.480
However, our eyes are responsible
for much more than that,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.320
including our mood,
our level of alertness,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.330
and all of that is included
in what we call vision.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.910
So I just want to take about
three, maybe four minutes,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.790
and talk about how the visual
system works, how it's built,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.560
and how you are able to
so-called see things around you.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.670
I also want to describe the ways

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.140
in which your eyes and your visual system

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.930
impact your mood and
your level of alertness.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.770
And then, we are going to get
right into some protocols,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.800
some specific things that
each and all of you should do

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.670
if you want to enhance your vision

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.520
and maintain your vision as you get older.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.400
And again, if you're a
15-year-old or a 12-year-old,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.970
this episode is especially for you,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.000
because your nervous system

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.250
is far more plastic than mine is.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.950
It's much more amenable to change,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.850
so you can really build a
very strong visual system.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.390
And in doing that,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.170
and if you adopt specific behaviors

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.690
at any age of light viewing

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.350
at particular times and particular ways,

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.470
then you can build an emotional system

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.960
that's also reinforced
by your visual system.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.040
So, let's talk about vision.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.873
What is vision?

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:10.193
Well, vision starts with the eyes.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.400
We have no what's called
extraocular light perception.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.900
While it feels good to
have light on our skin,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.580
while it feels good to be outside

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.980
in the sunlight for most people,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.750
the only way that light information

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.860
can get to the cells of your body

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.420
is through these two little goodies

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.253
on the front of your face.

00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:29.220
And for those of you listening,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.320
I'm just pointing to my eyes.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.420
As many of you have heard me say before,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.860
on this and other podcasts,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.180
your eyes, in particular,
your neural retinas

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.980
are part of your central nervous system.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.310
They are part of your brain.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.560
They're the only part of your brain

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.970
that sits outside the cranial vault.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.260
In other words, you have
two pieces of your brain

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.120
that deliberately got squeezed

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.800
out of the skull during development

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.040
and placed in these things
we call eye sockets.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.300
There's a genetic program
for the specific purpose

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.340
of making sure that three
little layers of neurons,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.720
nerve cells, got squeezed out

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.250
and form what are called
your neural retinas.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.190
Now, the eyes have a lot
of other goodies in them

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.350
that are very important,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.183
and those are the goodies

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:11.370
that we're going to focus on a lot today.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.660
There's a lens to focus light,
precisely to the retina.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.483
If you're somebody who requires
eyeglasses or contacts,

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.350
chances are, you don't do that correctly,

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.520
and so, that's why you use other lenses,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.600
like eyeglasses or contacts.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.100
There are also other pieces of the eye

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.550
that are designed to
keep the eye lubricated.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.840
You also have these things
that we call eyelashes.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.090
Most people don't know this,

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.990
but eyelashes are there to
trigger the blink reflex

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.220
if a piece of dust or something
gets in front of your eye.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.333
It's a beautiful adaptation of nature.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.910
They aren't just aesthetically nice.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.950
Costello happens to have
very long eyelashes.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.320
He gets compliments
about this all the time.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.770
Maybe you have long eyelashes.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.600
I don't have particularly long eyelashes.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.300
But the eyelashes are there,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.250
so that if a piece of dust or something

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.880
starts to head towards the cornea,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.690
the eye blinks very, very fast.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.840
It's the fastest reflex you
own is your eye blink reflex.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.160
We also have these things called eyelids.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.700
Now, eyelids might seem like
the most boring topic of all,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.500
but they are incredibly fascinating.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.220
Today, we're going to talk
about how you can actually

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.410
use your visual system to
increase your levels of alertness

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.430
based on the neural circuits

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.690
that link your brainstem
with your eyelids.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.840
And no, we are not going
to have a blinking contest,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.020
because I would win and you would lose,

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.900
and that wouldn't be fun for you.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.900
So, let's talk about what
the eyes do for vision.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.300
Basically, the entire job of the eyes

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.670
is to collect light information

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.310
and send it off to the rest of the brain,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.170
in a form that the brain can understand.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.610
Remember, no light actually gets in

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.050
past those neural retinas.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.090
It gets to the neural retina,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.870
and we have specific cells in
the eye called photoreceptors.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.130
They come in two different
types, rods and cones.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.960
Cones are mainly responsible
for daytime vision,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.590
and the rods are mainly
responsible for vision at night

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.223
or under low light conditions,
generally speaking.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.270
So basically what happens
is if your eyelids are open,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.270
light comes into the eye,
the lens focuses that light,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.620
light is also just called
photons, light energy,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.713
onto the retina.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.820
These photoreceptors, the rods and cones,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.670
have chemical reactions inside them

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.690
that involve things like vitamin A

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.890
and that chemical reaction

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.520
converts the light into electricity.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.880
Now, that might seem incredibly abstract,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.290
but the way to think about
this is very similar to,

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.650
for instance, you have
touch receptors on your skin

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.620
and when you press on
those touch receptors,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.250
they convert pressure, physical pressure,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.260
into electrical information

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.093
and those neurons send it up
to your spinal cord and brain,

00:15:51.093 --> 00:15:53.170
and you can register that somebody or you

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.620
are touching the top of
your hand, as I'm doing now.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.613
With the eyes and the retina,

00:15:57.613 --> 00:15:59.320
it's just that light gets converted

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.490
into electrical information.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.090
Within the eye, within the retina,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.853
there are then a series
of stages of processing,

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.870
and that information eventually
gets sent into the brain

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.440
by a very specific class of neurons.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.860
I would like you to know
the names of these neurons.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.730
They're called retinal ganglion cells.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:18.980
So the only thing you need to know

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.270
about the neuroscience
of the eye at this point

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.950
are that there are rods and cones.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.930
The cones are involved
in bright daytime vision

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.993
and rods are involved in more
dusk or nighttime vision.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.710
And you've got these cells
called retinal ganglion cells

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.750
that send the information
off to the rest of the brain.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.550
Now, here's what's incredible.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.040
I just want you to
ponder this for a second.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.493
This still blows my mind.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.923
Everything you see around you,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.670
you're not actually seeing
those objects directly.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.060
What you're doing is
you're making a best guess

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.950
about what's there based on
the pattern of electricity

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.940
that arrives in your brain.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.910
Now, that might just seem totally wild

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.380
and hard to wrap your head around,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.240
but think about it this way,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.670
because this is the way it actually works.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.480
Let's take an example of a
color, like green or blue.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.470
You have cones in your eye

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.460
that respond best to
the wavelength of light

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.550
that is reflected off, say, a green apple.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.230
So, you don't actually
see the green apple.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.490
What you see is the light
bouncing off that green apple,

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.170
and it goes into your eye,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.980
and you see it and perceive
it as round and green,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.680
but not because you see anything green.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.430
No green light arrives in your brain.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.610
What happens is your
brain actually compares

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.620
the amount of green reflection
coming off that apple

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.910
to the amount of red and blue around it.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.030
Well, you might say, well, the green apple

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.110
is sitting on a brown
table or a white surface.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.080
Well, then, it will appear very green.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.850
Because the amount of wavelength of light

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.500
for green is very high,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.020
and the amount for red is very low,

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.760
and so, it looks very green, okay?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.000
So, we don't actually
see anything directly.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.330
What the brain is receiving
is a series of signals,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.990
electrical signals, and it's
comparing electrical signals,

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.150
in order to come up with what
we call these perceptions.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.890
Like I see something green,
a green apple, or I see red.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.780
Let me give you a slightly
different example.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.660
If you were to play a key on the piano,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.540
let's say you play, I'm not a musician,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.910
but I'm going to, so hopefully
I won't get this too incorrectly

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.300
but let's say you have like E sharp,

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.540
and maybe it's like ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.170
If the brain gets that signal,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.970
it doesn't actually know E that's what,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.660
it doesn't recognize it

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.570
until you were to play
another key next to it,

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.910
dun, dun, dun, dun,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.470
and what it does, it does the math,

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.070
it does the subtraction,
and it compares those two.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.740
So when we see something green,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.280
or we see something red,
or we see something blue,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.750
we're not actually seeing it directly.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.500
The brain is making a guess about

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.900
how green or red or blue that thing is

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.070
by comparing what's around it, okay?

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.820
And if that seems hard
to wrap your head around,

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.460
don't worry, because we will explain it

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.690
in more depth going forward.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.770
But I really want people
to understand this,

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.770
that vision, eyesight, is not
looking at things directly,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.440
and that information getting
directly into your brain,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.160
it is translated.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.380
Light information is transformed
into electrical signals

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.840
that your visual system
exquisitely understands.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.220
Now, what does this mean?

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.560
Why should you care about this?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.290
Well, if you have a dog
like I do, or a cat,

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.090
they are not colorblind,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:43.090
but they lack the cones
that respond to red,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.190
meaning long wavelength light.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.770
So what does that mean?

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.900
That means that when they see green,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.933
it's different than the green you see.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.470
Not because that apple
is invisible to them,

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.580
but because they aren't
able to compare it to red,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.350
and you are.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.220
As a consequence, when
they look at a green lawn,

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.170
it looks more brownish or orange to them.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.640
When you wear a red shirt
in front of your dog or cat,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.280
if you see a stop sign
and they see a stop sign,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.610
they see orangish-brown, and you see red.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.430
presuming that you are a trichromat,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.730
meaning you have three-color vision.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.030
So, this is all to say that every animal

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.700
sees the world differently,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.390
depending on whether or not they have

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.560
one or two or three of
these different cones,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.680
the red, blue, or green cones.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.700
If you are a mantis shrimp of all things,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.070
you see hundreds of colors

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.500
that human beings can't see, okay?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.020
Many things animals see into visual ranges

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.610
that you and I can't see in.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.090
So for instance, a pit
viper senses heat emissions,

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.210
it literally sees the
heat coming off of you

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.780
or of an animal that they want to eat.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.780
If you are a ground squirrel,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.810
you can see ultraviolet light.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.870
This is going to sound kind of weird,

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.760
but ground squirrels
actually signal one another

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.790
by standing up outside
and shining sunlight

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.930
off each other's stomachs to each other,

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.790
signaling at a distance,
just like, you know,

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.310
you could signal somebody with a mirror

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.990
in sunlight at distance.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.290
There are species of primates,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.680
this isn't very pleasant to think about,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.190
that urinate on their hands,

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.660
and then wipe it all over their stomach.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.310
and then use that sunlight

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.290
to reflect different
signals to each other.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.130
I don't know what they're saying.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.720
We always assume it's
something cute and nice,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.630
but maybe they're insulting each other.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.630
So this actually gets right down

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.280
to the heart of these bigger questions,

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.110
like consciousness, what do we see?

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.950
What's out there?

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.220
How much of life is
really accessible to us?

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.590
And I could go on and on, you know,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.200
this used to be kind
of an obsession of mine

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.270
when I was coming up in the
field of visual neuroscience

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.810
to understand how different
animals see the world

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.360
compared to us.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.710
You know, I'll give one
more example, a diving bird,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.840
you know, a bird that
flies over the ocean.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.800
It has an incredible task.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.950
It has to both view the horizon,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.620
and it has to view schools of fish,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.940
and then, it has to make a trajectory

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.560
down into the water and grab
one of those fish to eat.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.890
And the water has what's
called a refractory index.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.620
It actually shifts like a prism,

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.330
the impression or the perception

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.760
of where that fish is, right?

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.140
If the bird sees the fish
right below it, it has to know,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.060
it has to adjust its diving
trajectory just right,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.510
because it knows that that fish

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.540
actually isn't where it sees it.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.300
It's probably a few inches
ahead or to the side of that,

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.200
because of the way that
water diverts the image.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.620
If you've ever dropped a
coin to the bottom of a pool,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.980
if you go straight down
looking at that location.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.410
If you were to look from
the top of the pool,

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.170
and you dive straight down
with your eyes closed,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.150
you will miss, because the water refracts,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.370
it shifts the visual image.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.430
Well, diving birds have an arrangement

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.610
of these retinal cells that
communicate to the brain

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.790
that's both a streak to view the horizon,

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.850
'cause they need to know where they are

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.890
relative to the horizon,

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.550
and they have a pupil like we
do on the bottom of their eye,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.060
so that they can make very
accurate dive and attacks

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.160
on these schools of fish,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.470
and catch fish, and eat those fish.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.950
We just have pupils in
the middle of our eyes.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.167
So there's a ton about
the optics of the eye,

00:23:08.167 --> 00:23:10.530
and the way that it
communicates with the brain

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.080
that allows us to see.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.540
We could spend hours talking about this,

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.970
but what I'd like to embed in your mind

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.320
is that what you experience
in the outside world

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.330
is bottlenecked, it's
limited by which wavelengths,

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.930
which colors if you will,
of light that you can see.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.910
That your brain is coming up

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.850
with a best guess about what's there.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.860
It doesn't actually know what's there.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.110
And that your vision
is distinctly different

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.140
from say, the vision of a dog

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.190
or from the vision of
somebody who's a dichromat,

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.560
meaning they don't have a red cone.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.920
A lot of people, in particular
about 1 in 80 males,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.150
lacks a red cone and
therefore, sees the world

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.910
much the same way that Costello does.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.910
Although, he sees it from just
much lower toward the ground.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.180
So, that's what I'd like you to understand

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.010
about the way the eye
communicates with the brain.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.280
I would also like you to understand

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.890
that the brain itself
is making these guesses

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.160
and that those guesses are largely right.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.720
How do I know that?

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.260
Well, they're right
because when you reach out

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.390
to grab a glass, most of
the time you grab the glass,

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.370
and you don't miss, right?

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.250
Most of the time, when you make judgments

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.600
about the world around you,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.620
based on your visual impression of them,

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.283
it allows you to move
functionally through the world.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.670
But let me give you some examples

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.840
of where this guessing
is happening right now.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.780
And it's so incredible that, to this day,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.000
this still blows my mind.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.320
Cover one eye with one hand.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.570
If you're driving, maybe don't do this.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.340
If you're viewing the world around you,

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.980
presumably you can see
everything that's out there.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.160
I could do this with one
eye or the other eye.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.810
You probably see better
out of one or the other,

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.110
and we'll talk about that.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.870
You have a giant blind spot

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.370
in the middle of your visual field.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.650
It's called your blind spot.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.260
It is the spot in which
the connections, the wires,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.900
from all those retinal ganglion cells

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.650
exit the back of the eye and
head off toward the brain.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.010
In other words, you are
blind for a huge spot

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.060
of your central vision.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.893
The part of your vision

00:25:10.893 --> 00:25:13.080
that's highest acuity, highest detail,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.610
and yet, you don't see that ever.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.910
You cover one eye, and
you see perfectly fine.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.150
And it's not just because your eye

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.680
is moving around really quickly.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.940
Your brain is guessing
what's in that spot,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.540
which is absolutely incredible,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.160
and so, you don't see that blind spot.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.330
This is happening all the time.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.360
Now, when you have two eyes open,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.180
the way that your eyes are
positioned in your head

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.490
and the way they view the world is such

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.680
that they fill in each
other's blind spots,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.460
so it's pretty convenient.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.540
But if you cover one
eye, that's impossible,

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.590
and yet, you still see
the world as complete.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.400
So the brain is doing
these incredible things.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.940
It's also creating
depth, a sense of depth.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.430
Even though what arrives from the retina

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.550
is essentially a readout of a
two-dimensional, flat image,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.810
so it can sense depth.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.840
How do you know depth?

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.140
Well, this is very simple.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.580
Things that are closer
to you tend to be larger

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.320
than things that are far away.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.450
Things that are closer to you

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.500
tend to look like they're moving faster.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.700
If you've ever been in a train
and you look to your side,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.140
the rungs on a fence, or the
train tracks going by you,

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.310
look like they're going very fast.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.190
If you look off in the distance,

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.230
they look like they're moving very slowly.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.200
And there are differences

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.360
between what's close to you
and what's further away.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.920
So, a little house on the horizon,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.830
you don't look at it and say,

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.740
oh, that must be a tiny, little house.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.270
You have some prior knowledge

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.700
that things further away are smaller.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.150
So that's the main way that you do that.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.630
And you compare the location,

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.440
at which information about
light lands on the two eyes.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.550
So your eyes are slightly
offset from one another.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.200
So that, for instance, if I look at you,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.527
if you were standing right
in front of me right now,

00:26:46.527 --> 00:26:48.040
and I were to look at you,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.680
the image of your face,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.480
the light bouncing off your
face to be more precise,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.600
lands on one eye in a
slightly different location

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.910
than it does in the other eye,
and then the brain does math.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.480
It basically does the equivalent

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.400
of geometry and trigonometry,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.270
and essentially figures out
how far away you are from me,

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.540
which is just incredible.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.080
So the brain does all
this very, very fast,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.210
and the brain uses about 40 to 50%

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.350
of its total real estate for vision.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.980
That's how important vision is.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.740
Now, for those of you that are blind,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.330
or low vision, or no vision,
that real estate in the brain

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:31.200
will be taken over by neurons
that control sense of touch

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.160
and a sense of hearing,

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.840
and your, indeed, hearing
and touch are much better,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.400
higher acuity, and faster in blind people.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.450
But for most of you, who
I presume are sighted,

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.180
this is how it works.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.290
So, that's kind of vision from
eye to brain in a nutshell.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.410
There are a bunch of different stations

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.760
in the brain that do different things.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.510
That's eyesight.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.510
Now, I want to talk about
the other aspect of vision,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.780
which is the stuff that
you don't perceive,

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.750
the subconscious stuff.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.780
And then, we'll transition directly

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.440
into how you can use light and eyesight

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.537
to control this other stuff
because it's very important

00:28:08.537 --> 00:28:13.537
and that other stuff is
mood, sleep, and appetite.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.320
And there are ways in which
you can use the same protocols

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.800
that I will describe,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.560
in order to preserve and
even enhance your vision,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.470
your ability to see things
and consciously perceive them.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.050
So the protocols we will describe

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.300
have a lot of carry over
to both conscious eyesight

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.460
and to these subconscious
aspects of vision.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.390
And I just want you to
understand a little bit more

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.460
about the science of seeing,
of eyesight and vision,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.570
and then all the protocols
will make perfect sense.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.740
So as amazing as eyesight is,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.710
it actually did not evolve for us

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.930
to see shapes and colors
and motion and form.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.070
The most ancient cells in our eyes,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:00.700
and the reason we have eyes,
is to communicate information

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.790
about time of day to the
rest of the brain and body.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.070
Remember, there's no
extraocular photo reception.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.870
There's no way for light information

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.420
to get to all the cells of your body,

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.430
but every cell in your body needs to know

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.737
if it's night or day.

00:29:13.737 --> 00:29:15.360
And I talked a little bit about this

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.970
on the, in the episodes on sleep,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.630
and this episode is not about sleep.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.490
But I want to emphasize that
there is a particular category

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.700
of retinal ganglion cell,

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.913
remember the neurons that
connect the retina to the brain,

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.020
that is involved in a
special kind of vision

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.040
that has nothing to do
with conscious perception

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.270
of what's around you,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.600
and it's happening right now,
it's happening all the time.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.160
These are so-called melanopsin
retinal ganglion cells,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.250
named after the opsin that
they contain within them.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.150
They are essentially photoreceptors,

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.810
remember before I said
there are photoreceptors

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.770
and then these ganglion cells?

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.050
Well, these melanopsin
cells, as the name suggests,

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.093
melanopsin, have their own
photoreceptor built inside them.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.480
The opsin that they contain

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.070
is actually very similar to the melanopsin

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.980
that is present in the
skin of some amphibians

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.450
and that causes those amphibians
to change their skin color

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.770
in different light conditions.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.860
So you have, believe it or not,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.860
a little bit of frog skin
in your eye, so to speak.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.700
Okay, not exactly, but you
essentially have the equivalent

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.793
of what frogs have on
their skin in your eye.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.023
If you are low vision or no vision,

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.830
as long as you have retinas,

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.070
it's very likely you
still have these cells,

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.420
even though you can't see
or you don't see well.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.490
These cells, retinal ganglion cells,

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.190
communicate to areas of the brain

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.680
when particular qualities of light

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.990
are present in your environment
and signal to the brain,

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.523
therefore, that it's early
day or late in the day.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.130
These melanopsin ganglion cells

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.880
are sometimes also called
intrinsically photosensitive cells

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.540
because they behave like photoreceptors.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.130
What do these cells respond to,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.510
and why should you care about them?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.750
Well, you should care about them,

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.730
because they regulate
when you'll get sleepy,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.640
when you'll feel awake, how
fast your metabolism is,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.490
excuse me, your blood sugar levels,

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.513
your dopamine levels,
and your pain threshold.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.330
There are other factors
that impact those things,

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.070
but they are one of the,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.450
if not the most powerful determinant,

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.190
of those other things like
mood and pain threshold,

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.483
sleepiness, wakefulness, et cetera.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.870
These melanopsin ganglion cells

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.870
have been shown by the
Nitz Group, N-I-T-Z,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.380
up at University of Washington,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.780
and by Samer Hattar's lab
and David Burson's lab,

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.420
and a number of other people's labs,

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.410
Satchin Panda, Prevencio, et cetera,

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.660
a number of excellent labs in neuroscience

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.060
to set the circadian clock

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.630
and to respond best to the contrast

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.850
between blue and yellow light

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:10.850
of the sort that lands on the
cells when you view the sun,

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.090
when it's a so-called low solar angle,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.330
when it's low in the sky,

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.210
either in the morning or in the evening,

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.380
what does all this mean?

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.550
It means, and here's the first protocol,

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.940
and you've probably
heard me say this before,

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.490
but is appropriate to this
episode to say it again.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.330
If you are not viewing the sun, sunlight,

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.030
even through cloud cover,

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.400
for two to 10 minutes in
the early part of the day,

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.640
when the sun is still low in the sky

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.240
and doing the same thing
again in the evening,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.870
you are severely disrupting
your sleep rhythms,

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.180
your mood, your hormones, your metabolism,

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.630
your pain threshold,
and many other factors,

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.800
including your ability to
learn and remember information.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.510
The most central and important
aspect of our biology,

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.470
and perhaps our psychology as well,

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:05.470
is to anchor ourselves in
time, to know when we exist.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.750
Okay, it sounds a little bit
abstract and philosophical,

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.583
but it's not.

00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:15.550
And we don't know time as a real thing

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.770
because of watches and clocks.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.400
We know time at a biological level,

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.350
based on where the sun is and where,

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.270
which of course is where
we are relative to the sun,

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.840
because the earth is spinning around.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.330
Now, what does this mean for a protocol?

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.660
It means, see, get that light
in your eyes early in the day,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.190
and anytime you want to be awake.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.470
So try and get as much sunlight

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.200
in your eyes during the
day as you safely can.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.300
We'll talk about eye safety
this episode in depth.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.850
And the blue light and the
contrast of that blue yellow,

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.950
remember we don't see blue,
this is all subconscious.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.130
This is blue reflections
coming off of sunlight.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.170
Blue light, we've been
told is so terrible for us,

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:54.840
it is absolutely essential and wonderful

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.330
for waking up the brain,

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.340
for triggering all sorts of
positive biological reactions,

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.650
but it needs to be
viewed early in the day.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.840
If you can't see sunlight,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.400
because it's the thick
cloud cover of say a,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.430
you know, you're in
the UK and it's winter,

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:11.640
then artificial lights,
especially blue lights,

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.698
would be very beneficial to you.

00:34:13.698 --> 00:34:16.940
We need a lot of this light
and its contrast with yellow,

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.200
in order to trigger
these melanopsin cells,

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.600
which will then trigger
your circadian clock,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.740
which sits above the roof of your mouth,

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.810
which will signal every cell in your body,

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.100
including temperature, rhythms, et cetera.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.560
So first things first, your visual system

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.960
was not for seeing
faces, motion, et cetera.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.113
The most ancient cells in your eye,

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.960
which are there right now as we speak,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.960
are there to inform your body
and brain about time of day,

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.560
so you want to get that
bright light early in the day.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.140
Absolutely essential, two to 10 minutes,

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.130
you can download the light meter app

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.710
if you want to measure lux.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.270
When we, when I explained how
to do that in earlier episodes

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.080
it got a little convoluted,

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.100
get that two to 10 minutes,
ideally without sunglasses.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.490
Now, here's another reason to do this,

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.720
and I've never spoken about
this before on any podcast,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.510
which is that there have
been several studies now

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.150
in thousands of subjects,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.010
exploring what can be done

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.410
to prevent myopia, nearsightedness,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.123
and other visual defects.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.520
And it turns out, in a series
of large clinical trials,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.040
the conclusion has emerged
that getting two hours a day

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.700
of outdoor time without sunglasses,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.940
blue light, this blue light
that everyone has demonized,

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.380
getting that sunlight during
the day for two hours,

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.010
even if you're reading other things,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.970
and doing other things outside,

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:44.610
has a significant effect
on reducing the probability

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.493
that you will get myopia, nearsightedness.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.190
Now, whether or not that's also due

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.020
to the fact that myopia can be caused

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.640
by viewing things up close to too much.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.540
So if you're indoors,

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.340
we tend to be looking at
things more closely, right?

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.750
Unless you have a very large house

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.900
with walls that are
very far away from you,

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.810
but the effect does seem
to be directly related

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.170
to getting sunlight,

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.760
and not just to the distance
that you're viewing.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.730
I'm going to describe
this study just briefly,

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.020
but this is a second protocol.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.700
So we have one protocol
about getting sunlight

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.710
to set your circadian
clocks, meaning wake you up,

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.560
establish your sleep, will occur
about 12 to 16 hours later,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.700
that's all in the sleep episode.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.840
But also to enhance your mood,
to enhance your metabolism,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.950
to optimize your hormone levels,

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.990
and to optimize learning
and dopamine levels,

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.700
this feel good neuromodulator

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.823
that's essential to not
getting depressed, et cetera.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.330
But now's the second protocol,

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.900
which is ideally, and
this includes children,

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.590
as long as they're not very small infants,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.930
ideally, we're all getting
two hours of outdoor time,

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.690
even if there's cloud cover.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.020
Remember, we evolved mostly
under outdoor conditions,

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.320
not indoor conditions,

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.260
and no artificial blue light

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.620
will not replace this
aspect of your visual system

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.510
and offsetting myopia.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.280
So I just want to briefly
describe this study,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.470
because it's a very important one,

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.070
and I don't think it's
discussed often enough.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.560
There are many studies exploring this,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.100
but one of the ones I liked the most,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.750
looked at 693 students,

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.850
and a subset of them were encouraged

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.830
to spend 11 hours a week outdoors.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:24.530
Okay, so most kids are in
school five days a week or so,

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.100
so they're spending 11
hours a week outdoors.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.500
They are sometimes reading outdoors.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.850
They're not always just playing outdoors,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.063
they might be reading books, et cetera.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.350
They used eight different schools.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:37.650
And the reason they did the study,

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.570
I probably should have mentioned,

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.560
is that myopia, nearsightedness,
is a global epidemic.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.850
At least, that's how it was
referred to in the study.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.060
I don't know who decides
what's an epidemic or not.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.960
I think there are thresholds for that.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.970
This paper published in the
journal Ophthalmology in 2018

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:58.700
described the fact that being
outdoors for two hours a day

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.380
could significantly reduce the probability

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.600
that these children would
develop nearsightedness.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.040
And it turns out based on other studies,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.530
that adults who spend
two hours a day outside,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.420
that would be reading
outside, talking outside.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.960
No, it does not include light

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.680
coming through the windshield of your car,

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.380
I'll explain why in a few moments,

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.570
offset the formation of myopia.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.210
Now, myopia, or nearsightedness,

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.480
has to do with the way that the lens

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.350
focuses light onto the retina.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.570
I don't want to get into a
long description of this now,

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.130
but basically the lens has
bring light to the retina,

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.530
not in front of it, not behind it.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.270
If it brings light to a
position in front of the retina,

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.050
then you won't see clearly, you
will need corrective lenses.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.920
If it brings light directly to the retina,

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.230
then you will see clearly,

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.230
that should be intuitive why
that makes, why it makes sense.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.340
So you might say, well,
why would being outside,

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.440
getting this blue light

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.270
or this blue-yellow contrast from sunlight

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.600
actually offset myopia?

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.740
Well, it probably, and I
want to emphasize probably

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.720
has to do with the fact

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.400
that these melanopsin ganglion cells,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.150
these intrinsically
photosensitive ganglion cells,

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.120
are not just responsible for sleep,

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.750
and talking to your circadian
clock, and that sort of thing,

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.380
they also make connections
within the retina.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.150
They connect to things like,

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.440
this is for the aficionados,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.150
the ciliary body, the iris,

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.790
the muscles and the
structures within the eye

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.040
that actually move the lens

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.950
and allow you to adjust your vision

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.240
to things up close or far away.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.020
And in doing so, they
increase or improve the health

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.860
of the little tiny muscles within the eye

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.880
that move the lens.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.660
And they probably, again, this
needs a little bit more work,

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.760
in order to really tamp
down the mechanism.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.000
They're probably also involved

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.140
in bringing growth
factors and blood supply

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.990
to the muscles and to the
neurons that are responsible

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:02.810
for this focusing
mechanism within the eye.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.640
So remember, your eye
is an optical device.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.820
You were born with lenses,
you don't have to use glasses,

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.340
or maybe you do because you
have lenses in your eyes

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.840
and those lenses need to move.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.233
It's not a rigid lens, like a glass lens.

00:40:14.233 --> 00:40:15.417
It's a dynamic lens,

00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:17.760
and it has little muscles that pull on it,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.440
and squeeze it, and make
it thicker or thinner,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.290
as you look at things close and far away,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.270
and I'll describe how
that works in a moment.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:30.170
These melanopsin cells and
their activation by sunlight,

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.543
completely subconsciously,
unaware, you're unaware of this,

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.210
promote the health of
this system within the eye

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:43.030
and allow you to offset the
myopia, nearsightedness.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.240
In other words, getting
outside for two hours a day,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.590
each day, on average, even
if there's cloud cover,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.600
without sunglasses on,

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.600
will allow you to offset
the formation of myopia.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.520
Now, you might still form myopia

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.220
if you have certain structural features

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.370
or a genetic basis for that,

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.590
we will talk about things
that you can do as well.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.840
But for everybody, we
should be doing this.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.270
And that might seem like a lot,

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.670
but this is the way that
your visual system works.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:13.130
Staying indoors, just
getting artificial light,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.520
and looking at things up
close leads to visual defects.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.870
Okay, it's a form of kind of
like visual obesity, right?

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.620
The posture of your visual
system, if you will,

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.120
is going to be unhealthy
if you're just indoors

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.270
and you're not getting
sunlight early in the day

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.790
and for at least two hours per day.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.870
I want to talk a little bit
more about how our eyes adjust

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.223
to things that are
close to us or far away.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.260
This is an absolutely
brilliant consequence

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.690
of our nature and our design.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.670
And whenever I say nature and design,

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.290
people always ask me, you know,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.470
what are you really trying to say?

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.950
Are you trying to talk about creators?

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.440
Are you talking about intelligent design?

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.710
Look, I want to be very frank with you.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.890
I wasn't consulted at the design phase,

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.000
and neither were you.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.160
And so, that is all very interesting,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.260
but it's not the topic of this discussion.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.630
What is clear and what is
the topic of this discussion

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.070
is that the eye can dynamically adjust

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.760
where light lands by moving the lens

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.110
and changing the shape
of the lens in your eye,

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.770
through a process called accommodation.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.810
And if you understand this
process of accommodation,

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.920
you not only can enhance
the health of your eyes

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.810
in the immediate and long-term,

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.830
but you also can work better.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.930
You'll be able to focus better
on physical and mental work.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.840
You will be able to
concentrate for longer.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.030
And I want to emphasize that
so much of our mental focus,

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.840
whether or not it's
for cognitive endeavors

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.193
or physical endeavors,

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:45.210
is grounded in where we
place our visual focus, okay?

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.010
What we look at and our ability

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.930
to hold our concentration there

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.810
is critically determining how we think.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.950
So, in other words, if
you can hold visual focus,

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.550
you can hold mental
focus, cognitive focus,

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.880
but holding visual focus is
challenging, it's tiring,

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:07.280
because it requires movement of the lens.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.380
And that movement of the lens

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.210
requires activation of muscles.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.420
And the activation of muscles,

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.960
as you know from the physical
performance episodes,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.490
if you saw them and even if you don't,

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.560
is dictated by neurons.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.200
So, what is accommodation?

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.190
Well, it's actually very
simple and very elegant.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:26.070
And again, this is another case where

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.560
whenever I look at this stuff,

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.200
even though I've been
looking at for years,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.710
learning about it for years,
it still boggles my mind

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:35.740
that we have these apparati
built into our eyes.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.430
So, we have lenses in our eyes,

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.330
and we have these things
called the irises.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.020
You know, you're all
familiar with the iris,

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.120
because you'll see people's
pupils get bigger or smaller,

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.990
and we intuitively think of
eyes as having the pupils.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:52.110
If you actually draw two
circles on a sheet of paper,

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:53.960
and you just, they look like two circles.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.800
But if you put little dots
in the middle of them,

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.990
they look like eyes.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.810
Your brain recognizes those as eyes,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.120
because one of the first things you see

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.990
when you come into this world are eyes.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.570
And actually, if you put the
little dots close together,

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.810
it'll look kind of wrong,
like it's cross-eyed.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.200
And if you put them at different locations

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.080
within those two dots,
of opposing locations,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.140
it'll look google-eyed.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.650
And so, your brain is actually filling in

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.070
all the face and other information,

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:16.850
even emotional information,

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.390
just based on this recognition of eyes.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.660
And so, there's clearly we know this,

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.517
there's real estate deep up in,

00:44:22.517 --> 00:44:24.750
you know, further up in the brain,

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:29.380
that's responsible for
analyzing and recognizing faces

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.750
and the eyes and the position

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.520
of these little things we call irises,

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.310
and pupils, et cetera, is really important

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.520
for how we interpret the status of others.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.020
And that's why it's such a powerful thing

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.730
just to put two circles and, you know,

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:45.720
move the pupils around on paper.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.577
In fact, I want to get into accommodation,

00:44:47.577 --> 00:44:49.260
but if you think about it,

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.707
if one of my pupils was up there

00:44:50.707 --> 00:44:51.970
and the other one was down there,

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.650
one was really big, and
one was really small,

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.970
that would actually be a
sign of pretty severe damage.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.090
If someone gets hit hard
on the side of the head,

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.870
you'll notice that they
shine a light in one eye.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:01.780
You know why they're doing that?

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.390
They're actually looking at the other eye.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.820
When you shine light of the
eye that pupil constricts

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.240
to limit the amount of
light that comes in,

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.393
so it doesn't damage the eye.

00:45:09.393 --> 00:45:11.820
This also happens when you
walk outside, and it's bright,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.280
it constricts, but we have what's called

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.150
the consensual pupil reflex.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.110
There's a connection
deep in the brainstem,

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.510
deep back here in the brain near my neck,

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.040
that connects the pupil
mechanism for the two eyes,

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.090
and they're looking at the other eye.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:26.920
And if you shine light in one eye,

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.160
and that people constricts
but the other one doesn't,

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.610
there's a good chance
there's brainstem damage.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:32.790
This is what they do on the side

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.130
of a, you know, football
field or a boxing match,

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.800
or if someone unfortunately
hits their head.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.160
So, two pupils and don't
freak out if one pupil

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.480
is a little bit smaller than the other,

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.020
that doesn't necessarily
mean brain damage.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.910
But if you suddenly have one
pupil bigger than the other,

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.860
you absolutely want to go
see a neurologist right away.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.640
So, the eyes and the pupils
are indicative of things

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.830
that are happening deep in the brain.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.570
Now, accommodation is our
ability to accommodate

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:02.100
to things that are up
close here or further away.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.560
And the way this works is that the iris,

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.550
and the musculature, and a structure

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.660
called the ciliary body move the lens.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.780
So, when you look far away,

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.320
okay, when you see things far away,

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.950
your lens actually relaxes,
it can flatten out.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:18.783
So I want you to think about this.

00:46:18.783 --> 00:46:20.410
When you look far away,

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.750
when it may be anywhere from
like 20 feet away from you

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.990
out to a horizon that's miles
or kilometers away from you,

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.500
the lens can just relax.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.000
It can flatten out.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.310
And you'll notice that
it actually is relaxing

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.100
to look at a horizon.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.860
It's relaxing to look far away.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.970
Whereas if I look at
something up close to me

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.710
like this pen, or my phone,
or a computer screen,

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.870
or this microphone, it takes effort.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.470
You'll sense the effort.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.710
Now, some of that effort
is actually eye movements,

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.380
because you have muscles
that can move your eyes

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.190
within their sockets.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.480
But a lot of the work, quote unquote,

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:59.320
is neural work of the muscles
having to move and contract,

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.430
such that the lens actually gets thicker,

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:05.540
in order to bring the light to the retina

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.260
and not to a location in
front of it or behind it,

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.280
so called accommodation.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.330
There's also changes in
the size of the pupil,

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.800
as things are closer and
further away from you.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.360
In fact, there's a simple
way to think about this.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.960
Healthy pupils are going to dilate

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.560
when you look at something
far away from you.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.630
Now, when you see
something that excites you

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.240
or stresses you out,
your pupils also get big.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.323
Your eyes get wide.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:33.500
But if you look at something far away,

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.730
your pupils are going to dilate.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:38.180
And when you look at things
that are closer to you,

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.120
when you move them up close,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.660
the pupils are going to shrink.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.550
That's all part of this
accommodation mechanism.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:44.990
Now, you might say,

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:46.600
why are you telling me
about accommodation?

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.433
This is crazy.

00:47:47.433 --> 00:47:48.280
Why are you telling me about this?

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.740
Well, these days we're
spending a lot of time

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.010
looking at things, mainly
our phones up close,

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.770
and computers up close,
and we are indoors.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.830
If you are a young person, and
even if you are 25 or older,

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.530
and you are spending a lot of time

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.320
looking at things up close,

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.220
and you are not allowing
your vision to relax.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.470
In other words, you are
not giving your lens

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:11.840
the opportunity to flatten out,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.083
and for these muscles to
relieve themselves of this work,

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.780
you may or may not have
migraine headaches.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.810
You may or may not have headaches.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.650
You might, and that could
be the cause of those.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:27.120
But you are also training your eyes

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:32.910
to be good at looking at things
up close and not far away,

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.970
and as a consequence,

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:37.240
you are reshaping the neural
circuitry in your brain,

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.870
and it is not good.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:43.660
It is not healthy to only
look at things up close.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.820
Now, there are a lot of
recommendations out there right now,

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.470
especially with all the lockdowns

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:49.610
of the last, you know, 12 to 18 months

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.620
that people should look up from
Zoom every once in a while.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.750
Or maybe now, I'm hearing
that people should take calls

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.060
instead of doing Zoom,

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.630
where you should look up
from your computer screen.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.720
It's actually not going
to solve the problem,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.640
just to look up from your computer screen.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.890
You need to go to a window.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.450
You need to look out at a distance.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:08.150
Ideally, you would even open the window,

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.520
because those windows actually filter out

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.420
a lot of the blue light that
you want during the daytime.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.550
A lot of the sunlight,

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:17.150
it's actually 50 times less gets through.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.490
You want to get out onto a balcony.

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.570
You want to relax your eyes
and look out at the horizon.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.480
You want to go into what's
called panoramic vision,

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.030
and let your vision expand.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.310
You want this lens mechanism
to be very elastic.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:30.080
You don't want it to get stuck

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.330
in that configuration of
looking at things up close.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.300
Accommodation is a wonderful
feature of your visual system,

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.200
but you don't want to push that too hard,

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.673
too often, or for too long.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:44.050
You want to view the horizon.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.360
You want to get outside,

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.770
not just to lighten the load on your mind,

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.020
or to think about other things,

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.300
but to maintain the health
of your visual system.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.780
In other words, you want
to exercise these muscles

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.170
and that involves both the lens moving

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.670
and getting kind of thicker
and relaxing that lens.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.960
And the relaxation of the lens

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.590
is actually one of the
best things you can do

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.970
for the musculature of the inner eye.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:14.960
So what's the protocol, how
often should you do this?

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.840
You might be surprised,

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.090
but for every 30 minutes of focused work,

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.230
you probably want to look
up every once in a while

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:23.240
and just try and relax
your face and eye muscles,

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.470
including your jaw muscles,

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.780
because all these things are
closely linked in the brainstem

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.610
and allow your eyes to go into
a so-called panoramic vision,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.360
where you're just not
really focusing on anything

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.840
and then refocus on your work.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.840
At least every 90 minutes of
looking at things up close,

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:42.790
or even if you're looking at a screen,

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:43.890
you know, television screen,

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:47.090
or you're watching a
movie, or you're indoors,

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:49.180
for every 90 minutes of that,

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:53.510
you ideally would have at least 20,

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.410
probably more like 30 minutes
of being outside, ideally.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:02.107
But if you can't be outside,
of non up-close vision.

00:51:02.107 --> 00:51:03.260
And you might say, that's impossible,

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.340
how am I supposed to do that?

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.980
You know, I'm in an office
or I'm in a building.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.550
Get to a window, get outside
if you can do it safely,

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:13.940
get onto a balcony, and
just let your eyes relax.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.143
Many people are experiencing
severe vision problems,

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.190
because they're not getting
enough sunlight during the day.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:21.410
They have sleep problems,

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.670
because they're not viewing
sunlight early in the day.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.870
And as I've mentioned
in previous episodes,

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.170
they're getting a lot of
artificial stimulation,

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.380
artificial light stimulation,

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.780
of the eye in the middle of the night,

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.920
all of this is through the visual system.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.963
So migraines, fatigue,

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:42.320
challenges with your eyesight
getting worse as you age,

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.620
or even in young people, there's a,

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.550
you know, at least
according to the articles,

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:48.520
they describe it as
this epidemic of myopia

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.480
can largely be dealt
with by getting outside,

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.320
going into panoramic vision,

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.850
experiencing some distanced vision,

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:59.040
look at things off in the horizon.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.980
If you're walking or hiking or biking,

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.530
not looking at your phone the whole time

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:03.620
that you're doing that.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.270
If you're at the bus
stop or you're commuting,

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.970
certainly not looking at your phone

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.240
the entire time you're doing that.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.530
So this is vital.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.800
And I want to emphasize another protocol,

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.340
though I don't want to get
into it in too much depth,

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.173
'cause I want to make sure

00:52:16.173 --> 00:52:18.810
that I also talk about a number
of other important aspects

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.370
of the visual system that
are more related to sight,

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:25.960
but getting into optic
flow is very important

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.253
for de-stressing your system.

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.760
When you move through space,

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.610
whether or not it's through
walking, biking, even swimming,

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.520
if it's self-generated optic flow,

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.110
so probably not driving or motorcycling,

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:43.840
but yes, bicycling or I
don't know, unicycling.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.980
I don't know why I
thought about unicycling.

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.320
There used to be a graduate
student at Stanford

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.670
who was a really impressive unicycler,

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:48.770
those are pretty rare.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.960
As long as it's self-generated optic flow,

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.550
meaning you're generating
motion of your body

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:56.570
and the visual images around you

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:58.840
are passing by on your eyes,

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.940
that is very good for the visual system.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.010
And it's very good for the mood systems

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.100
and the neuromodulator
systems of the brain and body

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.310
that regulate mood.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.240
This is well-established.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.320
So I'm not telling people to get away

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.440
from their phone and their computers.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.670
I spend a lot of time staring at a page,

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.570
drawing, writing, texting,
et cetera, just like you do,

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:20.080
but we're really talking about
some very simple protocols

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.240
that aren't just designed
to improve your sleep,

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.335
but are really designed to
bolster and enhance your vision.

00:53:26.335 --> 00:53:28.010
And of course, because it's this podcast,

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:29.270
we will also talk about things

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.050
that you can take to improve your vision.

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.140
But if your visual behavior isn't right,

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.360
and I do believe we should
always start with behaviors,

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.930
and then think about nutrition,
supplementation, et cetera,

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:42.140
if your behaviors around
vision aren't right,

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:45.270
you cannot expect to have
good, healthy eyesight

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.600
for a long time, meaning
throughout your lifespan.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.410
And if your vision is already poor,

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.860
many of these things that
I'm talking about today,

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.693
perhaps all of them,

00:53:53.693 --> 00:53:56.510
will improve your vision to some degree.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:59.070
And if your vision is starting to go,

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.910
then doing these behaviors

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.940
is likely to really enhance
the quality of the vision

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.660
that you will build
and maintain over time.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.820
And all of these are
essentially zero cost, okay?

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.770
If you live in a very dark environment,

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:14.770
like a cave or outer space,

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:16.560
it's going to be hard to
do some of this stuff.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.610
But if you're on planet earth,
even if there's cloud cover,

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.000
chances are you can do some, or most,

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.110
or even all of these
some, most, or all days.

00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:27.450
What I'm about to describe next

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.030
is going to seem so
silly on the face of it,

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.083
but has deep mechanism to support it.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.923
Put simply, when you get
tired, your eyelids close,

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.323
and when you're alert,
your eyelids are open.

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:46.490
That is because you have
neurons in your brain,

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.110
that depending on your level of alertness,

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.193
will make it easy or hard
to keep your eyes open.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.230
Now, that's a complete duh,

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.350
except that we don't often
think about the relationship

00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:01.423
between alertness and where we
are looking and our eyelids.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:05.270
Now, I learned this from a
colleague of mine in psychiatry,

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:06.520
who happens to work on hypnosis.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.950
I'm not going to hypnotize you right now.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.350
That's actually for a future episode.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.550
But what happens when we get tired?

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.173
Our eyelids close, and
our chin moves down.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.100
We tend to nod out this way.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.920
If you have ever been in a classroom,

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.080
certainly not one of mine,

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.940
but if you've been in a classroom

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.340
and the lecturer is kind of drawing on,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.720
or it's the afternoon,

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.300
what you'll notice is
that a number of students,

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.360
their heads are jolt, kind
of their eyelids are closing,

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.100
and their chin is dropping, and they,

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.200
you'll see a bunch of heads
bouncing back up, right?

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.590
I was definitely one of
those people in class.

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:43.930
If it was post-lunch in the afternoon,

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.630
it's warm, the hum of the air conditioner,

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:49.263
or whatever it is, and I'm just out, okay?

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.380
When we're wide awake,
the opposite happens.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.470
Our eyelids are open all the way,

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:58.280
and our chin happens to be up.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.280
And no, this is not me telling
you to have good posture.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.750
However, what I learned from
my colleague at Stanford

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:08.610
is that these circuits
actually act in loops.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:13.610
When we look up, maybe it's
because these melanopsin cells

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.690
are in the bottom of our retina, they are,

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.270
and maybe it's because they're there

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:21.750
in order to view sunlight,
which is overhead, which it is,

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.420
but that system of alertness

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.620
is linked to the position of our eyes.

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.550
So when we look up and our eyelids are up,

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.550
it actually has a purpose.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:35.680
It actually creates a
wakefulness signal for the brain.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.330
And so, while this might seem like

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:38.930
the silliest and simple tool

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.300
that I might ever
describe on this podcast,

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.870
if you are feeling tired, it
actually can be beneficial

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:47.550
to the wakefulness systems of the brain,

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.940
including the locus coeruleus

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.050
and these areas that
release norepinephrine

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:52.570
to actually look up,

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.660
to actually look up toward the ceiling.

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.420
You don't want your chin all the way back,

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:59.530
but to look up and to raise
your eyes toward the ceiling

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:02.970
and to look up and try and
hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:04.810
So this isn't looking up
and closing your eyes,

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:07.150
like on a nice sunny day, that's relaxing.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:11.160
This is looking up and actually
looking up at the ceiling.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.720
It actually triggers some
of the areas of the brain

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.430
that are involved in wakefulness.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.260
So if you're somebody who's
falling asleep at your work,

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.260
this can be very beneficial.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:25.260
Likewise, many people are
looking at their phone all day,

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:28.410
and their chin is down,

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:29.900
and then they're sitting at a computer

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.040
that's positioned below them,

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.010
and they're having trouble
staying awake or focusing.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.180
It can be very, I tell
Costello this all the time,

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.170
'cause he's always falling asleep

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:38.410
while he's trying to do his work,

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:42.920
positioning your computer
screen up at eye level,

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.410
or sometimes having it
actually above eye level,

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:49.150
can actually create
wakefulness and alertness

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:50.440
for the work that you're going to do.

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.270
This is simply because of this connection

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.010
between the brainstem circuits

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:58.380
and the other neural circuits
that control wakefulness

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.970
and eyelids opening and looking up.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:04.520
Okay, so it, again,
it's remarkably simple,

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.610
almost laughably simple, but it's grounded

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:08.630
in some of the most hardwired,

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:09.830
meaning present from birth,

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.200
aspects of our neural circuitry.

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:15.520
And norepinephrine released
from locus coeruleus

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.990
isn't just a mouthful,

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:21.020
it's a really interesting
and powerful mechanism

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.650
for how the rest of the brain wakes up.

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.290
Locus coeruleus hoses
the rest of your brain

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:29.020
with norepinephrine, in order
to wake up those circuits

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.240
for work and attention.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.230
And so, eyes up is actually a way,

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.590
a route into increased alertness.

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:39.530
Eyes down is a route into sleepiness,

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:41.550
into reduced alertness.

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:45.373
And I have only one
friend that texts up here,

00:58:45.373 --> 00:58:47.520
like on the street
holds his phone up here.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.040
It looks ridiculous.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.340
And yet, you know, if we were trying

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.140
to create more sense of alertness,

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.340
if that's your goal,

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:58.560
positioning computer
screens up high, chin up,

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.330
looking up if you need to kind
of create an alertness signal,

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.640
not always being chin down and texting,

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.800
or working into typewriters,
or reading below us.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.470
is actually going to send a
recurring wakefulness signal.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:11.870
When things are up, we tend to be alert.

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:14.190
When everything's focused
down, including our eyes,

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.720
it tends to have a more suppressive

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.490
or sedative type signaling

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.180
to the deeper centers of the brain.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.170
Now, before we move on to
the science, and tools,

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:24.690
and protocols related to pattern vision,

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:26.850
I want to mention another
study that was done

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:28.460
by the University of Pennsylvania.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.730
They have a terrific group
there that works on sleep.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:33.410
They made an important discovery

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.810
that I think everybody should know about,

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:39.950
which is that children that sleep in rooms

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:44.900
that have a nightlight or dim
lights are much more likely

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.563
to develop myopia, nearsightedness.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.130
Conversely, children that
sleep in very dark rooms,

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:57.653
so either very dim
nightlights or complete black,

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:01.460
they have a much lower,
statistically speaking,

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.170
a significantly lower probability

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.160
of developing myopia, nearsightedness.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.000
Now, why is that?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.440
It's because the wavelengths
of light that matter

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.233
for these melanopsin cells,

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.623
oftentimes can get through the eyelids.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.880
And that's particularly true for children

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.810
and people that have thin eyelids.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:26.400
Some people, like me,
have very thin eyelids.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.983
I've been told this before.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.180
Not many people touch my eyelids,

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.570
but among those that have,
I have very thin eyelids.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:36.830
I notice I have very thin eyelids
compared to say, Costello.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.240
Now, Costello's eyes droop.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.660
He can't even close his eyes
all the way they're so droopy.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.640
But many people have thin eyelids,

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.700
and those people are going
to be even more prone

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.280
to light coming in through the eyelid.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.580
So for parents, for kids, and for adults,

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.980
you really want to try to get to a place

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.410
where you can sleep in a completely black

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:58.960
or dark environment.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.930
One little exposure to light, no big deal.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.650
But this ties back to the other protocol

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.460
that I've described before in
the mood and sleep episodes,

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.630
which is that viewing light,

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.290
even a very low intensity

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.450
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:14.490
is extremely detrimental to the dopamine

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:17.150
and other mood producing
systems of the brain.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:19.760
It can negatively impact
learning, and immunity,

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.220
and even blood sugar,

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.400
and make people type two diabetes prone

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.160
by way of communication
from these melanopsin cells

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.700
to a structure in the
brain called the habenula.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.540
Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.450
Well, because people have
asked for more mechanisms.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:33.470
So, if you really want to know,

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:35.250
when you look at blue light

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:37.010
or if blue light is getting
in through your eyelids

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.340
in the middle of the night,

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.970
it is likely distorting

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:43.630
this lens accommodation
mechanism in the eye

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:47.260
and leading to myopia in some cases.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.427
So, that's one reason to
avoid blue light exposure

01:01:49.427 --> 01:01:51.440
and bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure,

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.750
in middle of the night.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.340
Viewing any light of bright intensity

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.030
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:01.040
on a consistent basis is
going to suppress dopamine,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.680
because of the way that that light

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.170
activates these melanopsin cells,

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.770
and the habenula, and the dopamine system.

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.680
So it's all very simple,

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.290
get as much bright light
as you can safely, right?

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:13.800
You never want to look
at any light so bright

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.760
that it's painful look
at, during the daytime.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.960
Try and go without sunglasses,
unless you need them.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.110
Now, I wear sunglasses for sake of sport

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:23.180
and sake when it's really bright out,

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.040
but I try to get two hours a day

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.370
of working outside or being outside,

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:30.730
even if there's cloud cover,
that's going to offset myopia.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.330
It's going to help you get better sleep.

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:35.310
It's going to support mood
and metabolism, et cetera.

01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.500
And at night, if you're sleeping

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.560
with a lot of lights in the room,

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.450
and especially, if there are
kids that need a nightlight,

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.900
you should try and wean
them off that nightlight,

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.240
because it's going to be beneficial

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.310
for their vision to wean
them off that nightlight

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:49.270
and put them into a darker environment.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.880
Obviously, you want to get
them emotionally comfortable

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.480
with that first.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.020
Now, let's talk about pattern
vision, actual seeing things,

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.040
like faces and colors, et cetera.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.280
I'm presuming that some of
you out there are colorblind.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.290
We can all help the red-green
colorblind folks out there

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:08.690
by not using red in slides and diagrams,

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.230
and on menus, and things of that sort.

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.030
Try and use magenta instead.

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.560
They can see the contrast
between magenta and green

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.010
better than if there's red and green.

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.160
So, be kind to the
colorblind folks out there.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.080
It's actually a fair percentage.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.960
And there are a lot of
different kinds of colorblind.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.310
I should just mention some
people are true monochromats.

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:29.700
They see the world in black and white.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.263
That's exceedingly rare.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.150
Most colorblind people,
colorblind in quotes,

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:36.900
are red-green colorblind,

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.680
meaning they lack red cone photo pigment,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.130
meaning they can't see
long wavelengths of light.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:45.550
So they see the world much
as a canine or a cat does,

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:48.270
where they don't get
the green-red contrast.

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:50.540
That's why we call it
red-green colorblind.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.000
They have the green cones,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.030
but they can't do the contrast comparison

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.720
that I described at the
beginning of the episode.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.450
So use magenta, and they
will be able to see things.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.440
You wonder why stop signs and stop lights

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.940
and things aren't in magenta.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.410
Well, because the world is unkind

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:07.800
to the red-green color blind individuals,

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.860
and they have to learn the
position of those lights

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.400
in the street lights.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.440
And they have to learn
the shapes of signs,

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.360
which they can do readily,

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.740
and it usually says stop on it as well.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:19.660
But if you care about
colorblind folks, which I do,

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.290
then we could all do them a service

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:24.620
by, I think by law actually in the U.S.,

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.363
menus are required to be
colorblind accessible.

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.500
How can you improve your vision?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.010
How can you get better at seeing things?

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:35.980
Well, one way is to make sure

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.390
that you spend at least
10 minutes a day total,

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:42.330
at least, viewing things
off in the distance.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:45.420
So that would be well
over half a mile or more,

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.760
try and see a horizon,

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.110
try and get your vision out to a location

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:53.103
that's beyond the four walls
of your house or apartment,

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.700
or the doors of your car, and
the windshield of your car.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.390
I know that can be hard to
do, but it's very valuable.

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:00.980
If you live in a city like New York

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.860
and it's skyscrapers everywhere,

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.130
you've probably experienced

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.380
the incredible sense of relaxation,

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.110
and it's aesthetically beautiful,

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.270
when you are walking down
one of these long avenues,

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:12.150
and you turn, and I think they have

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.100
a name for this in New York,

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.580
where the sunset is suddenly visible

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.330
along a long avenue
between some skyscrapers.

01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:22.320
And it's just very relaxing to be able,

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.750
suddenly, to see at a distance,

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.870
and that's actually
because this eye mechanism

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:28.180
of relaxing the lens

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.310
and relaxing some of the
musculature around the eyes

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:34.060
sends signals deep into the brainstem

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.450
that release some of the centers

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:39.100
that are involved in
alertness, AKA stress.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.920
And it's very pleasant for a reason.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.290
It's not a, it's not a
placebo effect if you will.

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:46.570
There are a bunch of neurochemicals

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.340
and things that are associated with that.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.860
So try and see at a distance,

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.420
because it's good for your eyesight.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.060
It'll keep this lens nice and elastic,

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.690
and the muscles nice and
strong that move the lens,

01:05:56.690 --> 01:06:00.510
and it has this relaxing component to it.

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:05.090
Now, our visual system is
exquisitely tuned to motion,

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:07.130
not just our self-generated motion,

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.920
but the motion of things around us.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.050
And one of the things that it does

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.780
is something called smooth pursuit.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.780
Smooth pursuit is our ability
to track individual objects

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.560
moving, as the name suggests,
smoothly through space

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:23.983
in various trajectories.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.840
You can actually train
or improve your vision

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.747
by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli,

01:06:32.747 --> 01:06:34.030
and that sounds really boring.

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:36.060
What you can do is, and
I'll provide a link to some

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.110
that I think are pretty good

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:39.440
that are used in various clinics,

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.400
ophthalmology and optometry clinics.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.040
You can actually take
a few minutes each day,

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.700
or maybe if you don't do it each day,

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.930
you could every third day or so,

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:50.490
and actually just visually track a ball.

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:52.630
Sometimes it's moving in and
kind of an infinity symbol.

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.070
Sometimes it's more of a sawtooth.

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:56.720
Sometimes it's changing speed.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.820
Sometimes the cue that you're following,

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.380
the little target, is
dilating and contracting.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.560
This is going to keep the
muscles, I want to be clear,

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.440
this is going to keep
the extraocular muscles

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.240
conditioned and strong

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.500
and allow you to have a
healthy smooth pursuit system.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.540
Remember, the brain follows the eye.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.710
It follows the movements of the eye.

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:20.900
It has to deal with that.

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.620
And the neural circuits within the brain

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.600
have to cope with changes
in smooth pursuit.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.580
So if you're doing a
lot of reading up close,

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.720
you're not viewing horizons,

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.780
you're not getting a lot of
smooth pursuit type stimulation

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:35.190
from your life, or you're just getting it

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:37.360
within the confines of a
little box on your phone,

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.590
like your smooth pursuit is
over, you know, millimeters

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.110
or what we always talk
in terms of visual angle,

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:44.920
but the amount of degrees of visual angle.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.370
But if you're just
looking at smooth pursuit

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.070
in this little tiny box on your phone,

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:49.400
or on your computer screen,

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.470
and you're not looking at
objects in your environment

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:52.970
like swooping birds and things like that,

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:53.960
which I'm guessing many of you

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.600
are not spending your time doing,

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.400
well, these mechanisms for smooth pursuit

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.460
will get worse over time.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.610
Your vision will get worse.

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:01.610
And so, while I prefer that people

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.110
get out into the real world

01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:07.080
and experience smooth pursuit
tracking of visual objects,

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:07.913
I don't know, maybe it's a good reason

01:08:07.913 --> 01:08:09.473
to go to a hockey game or, you know,

01:08:09.473 --> 01:08:11.130
and try and keep your eye on the puck,

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.180
which I can never seem to do.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.920
It moves so fast.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.570
Or I guess this is a good
reason to watch live sports

01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.830
if that's your thing, or
to watch a tennis match,

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:19.930
like a cat, like a kitten,

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.970
watching the ball go back and forth,

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:25.080
whatever, watching kids play,
it doesn't really matter.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.990
The idea is that you want to
use the visual system regularly

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:31.030
for what it was designed for,

01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:33.480
and smooth pursuit is a great way

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.460
to keep the visual and
motion tracking systems

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.840
of the brain and the eye
and the extraocular muscles

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.150
working in a really
nice coordinate fashion.

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:44.780
I would say five to 10 minutes,

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:46.940
three times a week will be great.

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.970
If you care about your vision,

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:50.210
you can train your vision in this way.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.580
The other one is to train accommodation.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.880
There are a lot of videos out
there, I want to be clear,

01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.030
on the internet, some of
which are from clinicians,

01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:01.360
some of which are not.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.640
Some of which are from scientists,

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.610
some of which are from other sources,

01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:07.040
talking about things you can do

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.610
to make your vision better,
to improve your vision.

01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:11.810
Most of those are geared

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:14.317
toward improving the
extraocular eye muscles,

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:18.160
but I did consult with
our chair of ophthalmology

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.020
at Stanford School of
Medicine, Jeff Goldberg,

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.810
who's an MD and a PhD,
a phenomenal scientist,

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:25.640
and a phenomenal clinician,

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.400
and incidentally, a
phenomenal chairman as well,

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.700
about what sorts of things, tools,

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.230
are actually beneficial for
pattern vision and sight,

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:37.640
because there's just so much
out there on the internet.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.990
Not all of which is
accurate or good, frankly.

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:43.970
And he agreed that a
smooth pursuit stimulus,

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:47.950
that kind of training,
as well as, or exercise,

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.750
as well as near far.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.210
So spending a few minutes,
you might even just do this

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:54.960
for two minutes of looking
at something up close,

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.200
that's going to activate these
accommodation mechanisms,

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.270
and then moving it at arms length,

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:01.400
and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds,

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.870
maybe more, maybe 15 or 20 seconds,

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:07.510
then slowly moving it into
a location, and then out.

01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:09.740
This is actually a lot
like the visual training

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.770
that's done post-concussion
to try and repair,

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:16.350
actually repair some of
the balance, and motor,

01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:20.380
and visual, and cognitive
aspects of the brain.

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.850
And we are going to have a guest on

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.570
at a future time that,

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:26.610
to deal with concussion and
some post-concussion training.

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:28.750
A lot of post concussion
recovery and training

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:30.420
centers around the visual system.

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.840
Not just because people are
trying to recover their vision

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.580
and their sense of balance,

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.340
but because, as I mentioned earlier,

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.520
the brain's ability to make
sense of its environment,

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.880
and the brain's ability to parse time,

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.840
not just on the day-night schedule,

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.230
but also shorter time intervals,
follows the visual system.

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:51.170
Something we'll turn to a
little bit more at the end.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.100
So what does this mean?

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.750
The tool is, spend two to three minutes

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:56.870
doing smooth pursuit.

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:59.076
There's some programs on YouTube,

01:10:59.076 --> 01:11:00.890
or you can just look up
smooth pursuit stimulus,

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:04.270
and I'll provide a link to
a couple I like as well.

01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:06.640
You could do this with
a pen if you wanted.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.990
You could do this.

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:10.040
Someone else could hold a
wand, and you could do that,

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.580
if you've got someone
that can do that for you.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.310
Practice accommodation for a few minutes,

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:14.850
maybe every other day,

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:16.410
just bringing something in close.

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.183
You'll feel the strain
of your eyes doing that.

01:11:18.183 --> 01:11:21.010
I can feel it right now, move it out.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.550
You'll feel a relaxation point.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:24.240
Move it past that relaxation point,

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.073
where you will have to do

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:26.240
what's called the vergence eye movement

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.670
to maintain focus on that
location as it moves out,

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:30.100
bring it back in.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.760
At the point where you
actually have to go cross-eyed,

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.980
this will differ for different people,

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.870
depending on how far apart your eyes are,

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:37.580
so called interpupillary distance.

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.330
So for me, I have been teased before,

01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:41.520
I have a very short
interpupillary distance.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.340
I'm not a cyclops, but I'm heading there.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.070
Some people are more
walleyed, like a flounder.

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.860
Well, depending on your
interpupillary distance,

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.890
the point at which things

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.910
get blurry and cross-eyed will vary.

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:56.640
But for me, you know, as I get about,

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.390
oh gosh, I guess it's about
six inches from my nose.

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:01.470
It's really hard, I can't
accommodate any longer.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:04.030
I move it out another inch,
and everything's in nice focus.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:05.970
Try and see whether or not
you can get things closer.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.340
Now, you don't want to get cross-eyed.

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.040
Remember what your parents told you,

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.100
or my parents told me,

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.350
that if you cross your
eyes, when you're young,

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:13.550
that they can stay that way.

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:16.080
Actually, they won't
necessarily stay that way,

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.980
but your brain can
start losing information

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.850
and the ability to see binocular depth,

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:22.990
something we'll talk about in a moment.

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:25.360
But for now, the protocol would be,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.470
you know, two to three,
maybe five minutes,

01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:29.440
just practice that,
practice accommodation,

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.910
and then be sure to give
your eyes some rest,

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:34.550
get outside, look at a
horizon, or do nothing,

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:36.300
just kind of let your eyes go soft.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.140
I guess what the yogis
would call soft gaze.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.230
Just kind of relax your eyelids,
not this, not eyes closed.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.870
Just relaxed, panoramic vision,

01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:46.950
try and see the walls around
you without moving your head.

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:48.330
Exercise your eye muscles,

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.970
exercise the accommodation
mechanisms of your eyes,

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:53.190
practice a little bit of smooth pursuit.

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:54.630
You don't have to be neurotic about this,

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:58.250
but if you do this often
enough, meaning every other day,

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.740
every third day or so, you
can be the strange person

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.770
on the plane or in the
classroom doing this.

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:05.320
You know, that people might
chuckle or look at you funny,

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.990
or tease you, but that's okay,

01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:08.810
because you'll be able to see

01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:11.100
when they are losing their vision,

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.050
so you'll get the last laugh.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:15.050
Please don't laugh at them,
but maybe you can help them.

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:17.243
At that point, you can
hold the pen for them.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.330
It's worth doing.

01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:21.240
It's really worth preserving your vision.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.630
And again, if you're a
young person, this is great,

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:24.950
because then you can actually build

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:27.290
an extra strong visual system,

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:29.630
using all the tools that we're describing.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:33.190
I do want to talk about
a new set of findings

01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:34.960
that are related to red light

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.000
and offsetting age-related
macular degeneration.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.980
There are a lot of ways
in which our visual system

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:40.840
gets worse over time,

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.070
but one is so called age-related
macular degeneration.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:46.210
Glen Jeffrey at the
University College London,

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:48.800
somebody I've known for decades as a,

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.340
because he's a scientist,

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.450
has done beautiful work on
development and function

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:53.283
of the visual system,

01:13:53.283 --> 01:13:55.760
has published a number of papers recently,

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.050
one that got a particularly high amount

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:00.140
of attention in the press

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.820
was one that showed that
flashing red light into the eyes

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.090
early in the day, not late
in the day, early in the day,

01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:11.220
can help offset some age-related
macular degeneration,

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:14.160
presumably by enhancing
the mitochondrial function

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.730
in the photoreceptors.

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:17.950
There does seem to be
some evidence for that.

01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:19.530
Although, it's still early days,

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.820
I want to emphasize
you don't want to shine

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.250
really bright lights into your eyes.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.580
You never want to look at any light

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.900
that's so bright that it's painful,

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.740
and you never want to force
your eyelids to stay open.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.020
If you need to close your eyes
in order to be comfortable,

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.420
well, then chances are
that light is too bright.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.590
But doing just a couple minutes a day,

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.780
like two minutes a day of flashing

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.543
this red light into one
eye, and then the other.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:44.440
As long as it was early in
the day before noon time,

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.110
and as long as it was in individuals

01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:48.900
that were 40 years or older,

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.670
did seem to have a significant effect

01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:53.840
in offsetting some of the
age-related macular degeneration

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.620
that would otherwise occur.

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.900
Again, these are early findings.

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.240
If you want to do this, please be careful.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:02.640
Please talk to your optometrist
and/or ophthalmologist.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.700
Your eyesight is precious.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.150
You don't want to damage
it, but it is interesting.

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:07.500
And it does seem like red light

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.310
can improve the function
of the mitochondria.

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.870
These photoreceptors have
a lot of mitochondria,

01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:14.570
the energy-producing
organelles within the cells,

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:17.740
because they are some of the
most metabolically active cells

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.990
in your entire body.

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:20.970
Your photoreceptors
are active all the time

01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:21.803
as you're looking around,

01:15:21.803 --> 01:15:23.870
and even when your eyes
are closed, they're active.

01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:26.460
In fact, through a weird
twist of the biology,

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:29.130
and please look this up if
you're really interested in this,

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.580
your photoreceptors are actually
most active in the dark.

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.413
This is so weird.

01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:37.100
It's a twist of biology, the
way the system's arranged,

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.150
that when light comes on,
they shut off their activity.

01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:42.300
So actually whether or
not you see something

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.880
in front of you, like this pen or my face,

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.350
is because the way your photoreceptors

01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:49.090
are turning off not turning on.

01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:50.280
It's a really cool twist,

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.580
and I don't want to go too
far down that rabbit hole,

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.150
but check it out if you're interested

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.170
in how photoreceptors work.

01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:59.040
It's an absolutely incredible literature.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.680
Just Google, excuse
me, look up on the web.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.020
We are not partial just to Google.

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:06.070
I happen to use Google,
but use your web browser

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:10.300
to look up photoreceptors
hyperpolarization site.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.500
And you can learn a lot about that,

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.190
if you're a real nerd for
this stuff, like I am.

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:17.500
Okay, so red light to the eye,

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.100
can perhaps, it seems,
help maintain vision,

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.770
doing smooth pursuit exercises,

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:25.370
and accommodation near-far exercises.

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:27.890
Some people suffer from poor eyesight,

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.800
simply because their eyes get dry.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.970
There are incredible, believe it or not,

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:34.410
lubricating mechanisms for the eye,

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:37.250
not just tears, but a thin sheet of oil.

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.083
I mean, it's just amazing.

01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:40.030
Unless you have some
sort of corneal abrasion,

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:42.730
the cornea is the clear stuff
on the outside of your eye,

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:46.010
corneal abrasion, when
you blink, it's smooth,

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:47.250
you don't feel it.

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.700
It's just really, really smooth.

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.920
And yet, if you've ever
had a corneal scratch,

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.110
I've had this, it's really
rough, it is so painful.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.613
You have a ton of pain
receptors in the cornea.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.820
The lubrication of the cornea
is supported by blinking.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.090
And while it seems a little silly,

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:09.740
some people actually
benefit from doing some,

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.430
you know, five or 10 or
15 seconds of blinking,

01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:15.040
and then doing their focused work.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.510
Some people, their eyes are drying out,

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:19.110
because as we focus, if
we're trying to do something,

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:22.130
our eyelids stay open,
the eyes can dry out,

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:23.760
but it also can make it such,

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.430
that when we blink the next time,

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:26.960
there's a kind of a need to focus,

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.060
because there's some distortions
in these oils and liquids

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.060
across the corneal surface.

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.760
If you're somebody who
suffers from dry eye,

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.310
I do hope they'll find a treatment

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:36.440
or a cure for dry eye soon.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.910
There isn't one at present.

01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:39.640
Someone stands to make
a lot of money out there

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.194
if you can find a cure for dry eye.

01:17:42.194 --> 01:17:45.020
Let the companies know or start a company,

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.140
right now it's still a
mystery as to how to do that.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.120
But blinking for five 15 seconds,

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.520
probably slowly, not as quickly
as I'm doing here on video,

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.370
but just, you know, maybe a
blink every a second or two

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.410
for 15 seconds can lubricate the eyes.

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:59.340
And that's not directly
related to anything neural,

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.620
it's just going to allow the
optics of your eye to be clear.

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.980
Just like when the screen
of your phone gets dirty,

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.650
like when Costello's texting on my phone,

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:07.740
and I pick it up, and it's
like covered with smudge,

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.610
to clean it off in order
to see things clearly,

01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:12.090
the same thing is happening
for these optical devices

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.140
on the front of your brain.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.010
Remember, these are brain.

01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:18.810
Okay, so a lot of protocols today,

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:22.670
almost all of them behavioral protocols.

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:25.937
I do want to talk a little
bit more about vision

01:18:25.937 --> 01:18:27.650
and how it works internally.

01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:29.410
And then I also want to talk about

01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:31.260
some of the foods and supplements

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.930
that have been shown to support vision

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.440
and offset visual loss,

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.970
and maybe even reverse some visual loss.

01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:40.143
Let's talk about binocular
vision and lazy eye.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.670
I'm very familiar with lazy eye,

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:46.290
because when I was a kid,
I went swimming one day,

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:49.330
one day, and I didn't have my goggles.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:51.620
And so, something must
have been happening,

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.920
as I recall, with the eye
moving down through the water,

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.010
I've always had this problem

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:58.620
that I can only do the freestyle
stroke off to one side.

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.290
The people I swim with
are always laughing.

01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:02.430
Somehow, I kind of move toward drowning

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:04.340
when I try and breathe on the right side.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.450
I think there's some asymmetry
in the way I'm organized.

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:09.820
Anyway, I was off to my left,

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:12.280
and my eye kept going
in and out of the water,

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.450
and there was chlorine in the water,

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:14.500
and it was making my own uncomfortable,

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.603
so I just closed my eye.

01:19:15.603 --> 01:19:16.520
I just decided, you know,

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.053
I knew more or less how
to swim straight-ish.

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:21.680
Might've bounced off the
lane lines a few times,

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.290
but I just use the other
eye to kind of steer

01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:25.140
for that mark on the wall.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.810
Got out of the pool,
took a shower, dried off,

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:32.580
and then completely lost by
binocular vision for three days,

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.413
completely.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.150
The young brain, up until about age seven,

01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:40.300
but maybe even extending
out until about age 12

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:44.260
is extremely vulnerable to differences

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.890
in ocular input between the two eyes.

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:49.530
My scientific great-grandparents
won the Nobel Prize

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:51.670
for discovering so
called critical periods,

01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:54.010
periods of time in which
the brain is more plastic,

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:55.530
more able to change.

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:57.910
Those two guys, David
Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,

01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:59.110
thank you, David and Torsten,

01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:01.530
forever changed the face
of visual neuroscience

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.860
and forever changed the way

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.780
we think about treatment
of the young brain.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.350
It used to be thought that
you wouldn't want to do

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.210
a surgery on a young kid,

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:13.900
because of risk of anesthesia
in young individuals.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.020
But we now know that you need
to repair these imbalances,

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.030
that even a few hours,

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:21.040
okay, I don't want to scare
anybody, I'll talk about reversal.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.550
But a few hours of occluding
one eye early in life

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:27.710
can lead to permanent,
unless something's done,

01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:28.920
permanent changes in the way

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.330
that the brain perceives
the outside world,

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:33.870
such that when that
eye is opened up again,

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:35.460
the brain actually can't make sense

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.440
of anything that's coming through it.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.630
It shuts down that visual pathway somehow.

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:39.950
So what happened to me was,

01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:42.360
I actually was, my eye was fine.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.860
I got out of the pool, I opened my eye,

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.450
but I couldn't see through that eye.

01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:47.400
Everything was blurry, double vision,

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.770
unless I covered this eye,

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:50.840
and then I could see perfectly fine.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.230
Fortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist

01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:55.240
who understood the literature.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.710
Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie,

01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:02.530
who understood the
literature and made it clear

01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:05.700
that what I needed to do was
to occlude the other eye,

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.500
the eye that was working very well.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.360
Clearly, he understood the
work of you Huber and Wiesel.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.200
Now, again, you don't want
to start playing games

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.540
with this kind of stuff when you're a kid.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.850
If you wear, let's say you
have a Halloween costume

01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:15.960
and you wear an eye patch,

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.000
you're a pirate or
something for Halloween,

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.870
and you cover it up on one side,

01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:21.670
probably for the night
of Halloween, it's okay.

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:25.150
I do not recommend doing
that recreationally

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:27.210
if you don't need that
if you're a young child

01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.180
or for your child to do that.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.080
Because, indeed, you create imbalances

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.750
in the brain machinery
that compares information

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.910
coming in through the two eyes,

01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:38.020
and it can shut down
the neural information

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.440
for the occluded, the closed eye.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.280
Now, I was able to reverse this issue,

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.250
but my binocular vision
has never been terrific.

01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:45.770
I'm much better at the dart board

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.160
and still not very good
if I close one eye.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.440
I'm much better at the pool table,

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.320
if I close one eye, and
I still am terrible.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.740
I was the kid in, you
know, in the outfield.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:56.840
You know, the ball is coming towards me,

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.210
the ball's coming towards me,
I'm going to catch the ball,

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.540
and like it hit me square in the lip.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.020
My binocular vision isn't great

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.780
as a consequence of this early event.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:09.960
And I have a hard time with
those binocular stereograms,

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.190
those images that are kind of,

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:12.250
you're supposed to look at them,

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:15.510
and then the binocular
depth image like pops out.

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:16.490
All the other kids were going,

01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:18.670
oh, there's the, whatever,
the Statue of Liberty.

01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:21.080
There's the [inaudible], and I see dots.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.630
Okay, so I have binocular
vision, but I use other cues.

01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:27.430
I use the near-far cues
that I talked about before.

01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:29.750
Motion parallax, the fact
that things are closer to me

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:32.050
are moving faster than
things further away,

01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:33.780
in order to judge depth.

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.530
And years later, when I got involved in,

01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:37.580
and I don't suggest this for most people,

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.860
I got involved in boxing and martial arts

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.730
when I was younger.

01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:43.480
You sometimes will see fighters,

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.100
this is a slip to avoid getting punched.

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.320
It's also generating motion parallax.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.690
Many animals judge depth
by moving their head,

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:56.400
not by using other mechanisms
of accommodation, okay?

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.220
So a lot of birds and monkeys and animals

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.620
will judge depth by moving
their head like this,

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.540
or they'll move from side to side.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.450
Animals that will undulate sometimes

01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:08.360
are actually doing a depth measurement,

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.090
because as you move from side to side,

01:23:10.090 --> 01:23:12.540
the brain is able to do the math of depth.

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.380
So what does this all mean
in terms of protocols?

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:15.330
If you're a young person,

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:18.590
do your best to get really
good binocular vision,

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:21.020
not just at level of your
phone or your tablet,

01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.100
but also at distance,

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.710
you will build strong
binocular visual machinery

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:27.867
in the brain and at the level of the eyes

01:23:27.867 --> 01:23:30.110
and the eye musculature.

01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:32.820
Now, if you're somebody
who did have an occlusion,

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.170
what's needed is to cover up the other eye

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:37.050
to create an imbalance,
so that the weak eye,

01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:37.883
the so-called lazy eye,

01:23:37.883 --> 01:23:40.410
this is sometimes
referred to as amblyopia,

01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:42.090
that eye has to work harder.

01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:45.130
So for me, they patched this other eye

01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.260
and made this eye,

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.760
eventually, I got vision
through that eye back.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.140
then they opened them both up.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.840
Now, you might ask,

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.330
what happens if you cover
both eyes early in life?

01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:54.720
And this is where it gets interesting.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.280
You might think, well, if covering one eye

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.430
leads to poor vision for that
eye after that eye is open,

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:03.110
covering both eyes will
probably make you blind, right?

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:05.130
Actually, that's not what happens.

01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:06.380
What Hubel and Wiesel discovered

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.820
and what's been affirmed
many, many more times over

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.210
in subsequent studies is
that it's competitive,

01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:14.930
that the two eyes are competing

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.510
for real estate up in the brain.

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.790
So if you actually cover both eyes,

01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:23.090
you actually extend the
period of critical plasticity.

01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:24.710
This is a really interesting aspect

01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:26.890
that other people are
starting to leverage now,

01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.480
in terms of how to reopen
plasticity later in life.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.790
But please don't, you know,

01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:33.080
go around with your eyes
covered for too long.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.130
There are some like retreats and stuff

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:38.150
where people go into caves
with absolutely no vision.

01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:39.330
It creates hallucinations.

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:41.470
We'll talk about why
that is in just a moment,

01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:43.130
but here's my suggestion.

01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:45.490
Try and get balanced visual
input through the two eyes.

01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:47.810
Almost everybody has a dominant eye.

01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:50.330
It usually doesn't relate
to your dominant hand,

01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:51.420
although it can.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.950
And so for me, if I cover up my right eye,

01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:57.000
I see much less well, much more poorly.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.210
It's a little bit fuzzy,

01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.470
and I have to work harder

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:01.560
in order to see the camera for instance.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.220
Then, if I cover up my left eye,

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.910
it's actually really easy for me to relax.

01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:06.920
I have a dominant eye.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.250
Now, you can balance that out

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.950
by covering up the dominant
eye a little bit each day,

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:12.940
but I would warn any young people,

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:16.000
meaning, you know, 12 or younger,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.130
against creating these imbalances

01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:20.410
if there isn't a clinical need to do that.

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:23.740
And if you do have strong
imbalances between the two eyes,

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.530
which can be caused by
cataract and lens issues,

01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:29.940
can be caused by neuromuscular
issues, et cetera,

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.720
to try and get those dealt
with as early as possible

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.410
by contacting a really
good ophthalmologist

01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:37.700
and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.230
It is very normal,

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:42.620
I should say, it's very common
for young children, babies

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.390
to have an eye that, with strabismus,

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:48.020
that either deviates
out or that deviates in.

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.180
It is important to correct that.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.220
If you would like to
have balanced division

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.530
between the two eyes and for the brain

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.410
to respond equally to the two eyes

01:25:57.410 --> 01:26:01.480
and to have, I would say high
fidelity, quality vision.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.890
Although some people who
have an eye that drifts

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:06.610
can function normally in life,

01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:09.260
you have an opportunity
early in life to rescue that.

01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:11.770
I won't do, well, maybe I will do this,

01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:14.520
but I can actually relax this eye.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.160
It's so weak, in some cases,

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.500
that it actually can start to deviate.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.410
Here, I'll just do this here.

01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:19.243
It's not crossing my eyes.

01:26:19.243 --> 01:26:22.310
So I actually can move my,
I can misalign my eyes,

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.960
because I have to fight very hard

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.810
to have the musculature for this eye,

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:28.770
keep that eye aligned with the other eye.

01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:30.980
And that's because I've
been doing eye exercises,

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.390
since I was in my twenties,

01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:34.270
'cause I noticed when I would study a lot,

01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:36.280
this eye would start to drift
in, I'd start to see double,

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.240
and I would then, next thing you know,

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.317
I was just covering the eye up,

01:26:38.317 --> 01:26:39.920
and it was getting weaker and weaker,

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.810
just like the atrophy of a muscle.

01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:43.740
So I went to the doctor, what did they do?

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.660
They did the exact wrong thing.

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:47.860
The optometrist I went to gave me a prism,

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:50.070
which adjusted it so that I
could see things normally,

01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:51.790
which just made the eye weaker and weaker.

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:54.640
It's like putting a weak arm into a sling.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.750
So I had to spend at least
three years of 10 minutes a day,

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:01.830
is what I recommend, doing near-far,

01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:05.940
covering up my good eye, doing
near-far with my bad eye.

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:09.410
And now, it's been about 10, 12 years

01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:12.490
that I have pretty
decent binocular vision.

01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:15.400
Now, many of you aren't dealing with this,

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.450
or have these early childhood issues.

01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.680
Some of you might be experiencing

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.100
challenges with fatigued eyes

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.300
or with differences in
focus with the two eyes.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.870
These eye exercises of
near-far, smooth pursuit,

01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:30.010
and checking for dominant
and non-dominant eye

01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:31.460
can be very beneficial.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.150
I'm again, I'm not a
clinician, so I don't want to,

01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:35.780
you know, give you protocols

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.420
or enforce protocols on anybody.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.360
You need to figure out what's
right and safe for you,

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.090
given your vision history.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.390
I do recommend talking to a
really good ophthalmologist

01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:46.690
if you have severe vision
problems of any kind,

01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:49.800
or if you want to offset
vision problems of any kind.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.210
An optometrist as well,

01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:53.960
but ideally would be a
neuro-ophthalmologist.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.630
Okay, I did mention hallucinations,

01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:58.697
and they're fun to talk
about and think about.

01:27:58.697 --> 01:28:00.510
And for years, people have asked,

01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:03.320
why do people get visual hallucinations.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.660
Costello's in sleep right now,

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.720
you can probably hear him
snoring, he's snoring so loud.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.910
He's probably having hallucinations

01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:11.660
about rabbits, pizza, and
those are mainly his favorite,

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.493
and sleep.

01:28:12.493 --> 01:28:14.413
He's dreaming about sleep in sleep.

01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:18.480
Hallucinations are a property
of the visual system,

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.970
and it was always thought
that hallucinations arise,

01:28:21.970 --> 01:28:24.310
because of over-activation or activation

01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:25.860
of certain aspects of the visual system.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.450
I just briefly want to mention a paper

01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:28.770
that was published by my good friend

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:33.070
and phenomenal scientist and
physicist for that matter,

01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:36.630
Cris Niell who's up at the
University of Oregon in Eugene.

01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:38.970
They studied LSD light compounds

01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:42.290
and discovered that
hallucinations actually occur,

01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:46.230
because portions of your
brain become underactive.

01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:49.050
The visual portions of your
brain are under-stimulated.

01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:50.520
This is probably why,

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.580
when people go into these cave retreats,

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.220
something I've never done, I
don't think I ever will do,

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.800
where it's completely black,

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.930
pretty soon, they start hallucinating.

01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:01.910
They start seeing things, even
though there's nothing there.

01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:04.160
The visual system is desperate

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.050
to make guesses about
what's out in the world.

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:07.570
It's like the eager beaver of your brain.

01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:08.660
It's like, what's out
there, what's out there,

01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.270
what's out there?

01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:13.003
Even in low to no vision
people, blind people,

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.580
they are, their brain is
going to be making guesses

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.210
about what's out there
in the auditory world.

01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:20.780
What sounds are there? What
touch sensations are there?

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.430
For sighted folks, it's going to be,

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:24.970
what's out there in terms of light?

01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:26.190
Light is the dominant way.

01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:27.210
Vision is the dominant way

01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:29.270
that we evaluate the world around us.

01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:31.780
So it turns out that hallucinations

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:34.250
are an under-activation
of the visual system,

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:36.880
and then a compensatory, a compensation,

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.010
by which the visual system

01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:41.060
creates activity and hallucinations.

01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.680
So if you're in the dark long enough,

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:44.710
you start to hallucinate and see things.

01:29:44.710 --> 01:29:47.710
So, that's a little note
about hallucinations.

01:29:47.710 --> 01:29:49.890
One of the things that you
can do to improve your vision,

01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:51.540
and it's also kind of fun

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:55.000
is to put a Snellen chart in your home.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.010
A Snellen chart is that list of letters.

01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:59.880
Or if you go to the dreaded
Department of Motor Vehicles,

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.160
actually I'm up for renewal soon,

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.610
so I love the Department
of Motor Vehicles.

01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:04.720
The Department of Motor Vehicles,

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.330
they'll have you cover up an eye,

01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:09.470
read the letters on the chart,

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:11.080
the letters of course
gets smaller and smaller,

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.620
they're trying to figure out
roughly what your vision is.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.520
Cover up the other eye, you'll do that.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.620
Some people including nerdy,
vision scientists like me

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.040
have had Snellen charts in their office

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.300
or in their home for many years now,

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.270
and you can just practice,

01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:26.270
and you can see how you're doing

01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:28.630
sitting at a particular distance.

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:31.240
Your, this is something
that's not often mentioned,

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.080
but your performance on the Snellen chart

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:36.180
will vary depending on time of day,

01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.040
because your level of fatigue

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.930
and your ability to
control that accommodation

01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:42.570
and other mechanisms of
the eye muscles will vary,

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.550
so you can take it as an average.

01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:46.430
It's also a good thing,

01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:48.150
if you're going to get your vision tested

01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:49.744
for corrective lenses,

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:51.560
or maybe you're going to do laser surgery,

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.610
or something of that sort,

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:53.810
if you're thinking about any of that,

01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:55.670
to really get it measured
by a professional.

01:30:55.670 --> 01:30:57.906
The ones that you get
in those supermarkets,

01:30:57.906 --> 01:31:01.030
or in many eyeglass stores,

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:02.260
apologies to the eyeglass stores,

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:05.473
are often wrong by an order of magnitude.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.940
And then, when you start
putting corrective lenses on

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:12.410
that are over-correcting
or under-correcting,

01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:14.240
but more often are over-correcting,

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.220
well, then you're essentially
weakening the system.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.900
It's like putting a prosthetic on a limb

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.760
that you didn't necessarily need,

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.530
or robot arm when you didn't need

01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:23.650
the use of the robot arm.

01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:25.760
Although now there's so much
excitement about robots,

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.670
I think people are going
to be doing that anyway.

01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:30.090
Nonetheless, get your vision tested

01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:32.130
by somebody who really understands vision,

01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:34.780
like an ophthalmologist or
a really good optometrist.

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:38.087
If you put a Snellen chart in your home,

01:31:38.087 --> 01:31:41.410
you know, you can do that as
part of your visual training.

01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:43.410
Now, this might seem excessively nerdy,

01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:46.800
but what is more important
than your eyesight, right?

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.050
Eyesight is so vital.

01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:50.730
It's right up there with
movement and our ability to move,

01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:52.410
to generate, to get up out of chairs,

01:31:52.410 --> 01:31:55.280
and to walk and to run, and
to take care of ourselves.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.910
Eyesight and movement are the main ways

01:31:57.910 --> 01:32:00.660
that we are able to take care of ourselves

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.800
and take care of others.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.010
When you start having compromised eyesight

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:06.700
or compromised movement,
people need to take care of us,

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.730
and we become much more challenged

01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:10.360
in moving through our daily life.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.410
So while it might seem nerdy

01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:13.490
to have a Snellen chart in your home,

01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:16.560
or to do a smooth pursuit
exercise a couple of times a week,

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.190
or to get outside for a few hours a day

01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:20.830
and do your reading or
your laptop work there,

01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:23.270
preserving your eyesight
and preserving your vision

01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:25.680
is one of the most life-enhancing

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.970
or quality of life enhancing
things that you can do.

01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:29.640
And if you're a young person,

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.860
and you can build some of
this into your framework

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.330
of exercise or brain training,
if you want to call it that,

01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:38.690
that can be immensely beneficial
and will really set you up

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:41.290
to have really good vision
over a long period of time.

01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:42.980
Now, of course, there are genetic factors,

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.330
and there are injury-related factors

01:32:45.330 --> 01:32:48.530
that can compromise eyesight
and our ability to see.

01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:51.640
And, of course, the things
I'm talking about today

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.540
aren't going to solve all those issues,

01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:57.030
but they can have a
tremendous, positive impact

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:58.920
if you're willing to do
just a little bit of work,

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.710
and none of this is
involving any cost, right?

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.350
It's just time cost.

01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:06.870
So I want, I do want to talk
about a few other things

01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:09.400
that can perhaps improve vision.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.540
I want to dispel a few myths about stuff

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.570
to take to improve vision.

01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:16.510
And then, I want to just
close by talking about

01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:19.840
how we perceive time using our vision,

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.490
because that will nicely set the stage

01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:24.010
for what we're going to
talk about next episode.

01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:27.580
So now, you understand a lot
about the biology of vision.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.570
You understand that light
has to arrive at the retina

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.060
and get converted into electrical signals.

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:36.500
That process requires
things like vitamin A,

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.560
a fat soluble vitamin.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.100
It requires things like the carotinoids.

01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:46.360
That metabolic cascade,
the biochemical cascade,

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.850
is essential for vision.

01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:49.260
And this is why you've been told

01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.930
that carrots help you see better

01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:52.580
'cause they're high in vitamin A.

01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:55.390
There are a few simple things you can do

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:56.870
to support your vision.

01:33:56.870 --> 01:34:01.870
First of all, it is true
that eating vegetables,

01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:03.890
the dark, leafy vegetables

01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:08.040
and things like carrots that
have vitamin A in abundance,

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.190
and eating them in
close to their raw form,

01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:13.410
so naturally occurring foods

01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:17.380
that contain a lot of
vitamin A in their raw form

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:19.480
can help support vision.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.430
Now, does that mean that if you ingest

01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:23.610
super physiological amounts of that stuff,

01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:25.840
that it's going to make your
vision that much better?

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.650
No, but you do need a
threshold level of vitamin A

01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:33.800
in order to see and in order to see well.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.600
Now, there's a lot of excitement nowadays

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.790
about supplementation to
help support the health

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:40.810
of the visual system.

01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:43.090
And I'm somebody who's pretty open

01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:45.210
to novel forms of supplementation.

01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:46.250
You've probably gathered that,

01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:48.850
if you've been listening
to this podcast for awhile.

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:50.830
You have to determine what's safe,

01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:53.300
and economical, and right for you,

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.710
what your risk tolerance is, et cetera.

01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:58.660
But I want to talk about a molecule

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.730
that's in a lot of
supplements to support vision,

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:05.950
and there are some really good
data on, and that's lutein.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.640
Now, the study I want to describe

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:11.340
is actually published in 2016.

01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:13.040
It's from the Journal of Ophthalmology.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.100
It's a good journal.

01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.880
And the title of this paper is,

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.410
it might catch your attention,

01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:22.070
it's "Increased macular
pigment optical density,"

01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:24.110
that just means that macula,

01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:26.950
is an area of the eye for central vision,

01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:28.113
for high acuity vision.

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:32.817
Pigment density there is
good, you want pigment there.

01:35:32.817 --> 01:35:35.717
"Increase macular pigment optical density

01:35:35.717 --> 01:35:37.010
"and visual acuity,"

01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:40.387
Visual acuity is your ability
to see things in fine detail.

01:35:40.387 --> 01:35:42.680
"Following consumption
of a buttermilk drink

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.710
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks."

01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:49.200
Remember, raw foods?
Lutein-enriched egg yolks.

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.440
Sounds like a Rocky movie,

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.767
where he would drink the raw egg yolks.

01:35:52.767 --> 01:35:56.200
"A randomized double-blind
placebo controlled trial."

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.500
Now, I'm not suggesting you
go out and eat raw egg yolks.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:00.630
There's the risk of salmonella.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:01.770
Although, I did hear this,

01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:02.820
someone correct me if I'm wrong,

01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.040
but the salmonella is actually
on the outside of the egg,

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.950
not actually in the egg
itself, it's on the shell.

01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:13.330
For reasons that relate to how
that egg got into the world,

01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:15.140
that's where the salmonella lives,

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.350
but I could be wrong about that.

01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:19.750
But raw egg yolks are not something

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:21.960
that most people want to consume.

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.280
What is this lutein stuff?

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.580
Well, lutein is in the pathway
that relates to vitamin A

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:32.060
and the formation of the
OPs in the photopigment

01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:33.860
that captures light in
the back of your eye,

01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:37.500
literally absorbs light
pigment in your eye,

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.350
and converts that into electrical signals,

01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:40.570
and allows you to see.

01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:42.380
And there is some evidence,

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.360
I spoke to our chair of ophthalmology,

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.110
there is some evidence through
quality peer-reviewed studies

01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:53.110
that supplementing with
lutein can help offset

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.290
some of the detrimental effects

01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:58.800
of age-related macular degeneration.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.123
But, I want to emphasize
but, or emphasize however,

01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:07.140
only for individuals with moderate

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:09.560
to severe macular degeneration.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.620
For people that have normal vision,

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:16.620
or with a, just a low-degree
of macular degeneration,

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:19.330
these studies did not see
a significant improvement

01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:22.020
of vision from supplementing with lutein.

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.020
So, I'm not going to to tell you

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.793
to supplement with lutein or not.

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:29.480
I don't think any study
is holy, but it does seem

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:32.650
that if you have moderate to
severe macular degeneration,

01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:33.840
talk to your physician, of course,

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.150
talk to your ophthalmologist,

01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:37.650
I'll always say that, and
I'll say it three times,

01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:42.990
supplementing with lutein
could perhaps support vision

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:45.040
and offset some vision loss in that case.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.000
Probably also talk to your ophthalmologist

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.330
or consider the red light therapy

01:37:48.330 --> 01:37:49.750
that I talked about earlier.

01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:51.950
Whereas, if you have normal vision,

01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:55.550
or a low amount of macular degeneration,

01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:57.530
it does not seem, at
least from these studies,

01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:59.760
that lutein had much of an effect.

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.860
Now, I know, and I confess
I'm sort of of the mind

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:08.860
that if I personally had
age-related macular degeneration,

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.730
or a propensity for it in my family,

01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:15.560
which fortunately I
don't, but in that case,

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.060
I would think that
supplementing with lutein,

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:20.610
provided it's safe, could
perhaps be of benefit.

01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:22.470
You might want to consider
a low dose of that.

01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:23.840
So again, I'm not pushing any of this

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:27.910
on anybody by any means,
but you should know that,

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:30.500
under certain conditions of
severe macular degeneration

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.860
or moderate macular degeneration,

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.430
it does seem like lutein
can be beneficial.

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:36.090
It does not have to be
consumed through raw egg yolks,

01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:39.900
although that is the
highest density source.

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.670
Cooking the egg yolk, cooking your eggs,

01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:43.490
if you like your scrambled eggs dry,

01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:48.390
or you like your eggs not easy
over or whatever, not runny,

01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:51.030
then you aren't going to get
the benefits of the leucine.

01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:52.430
There are other sources of leucine,

01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:53.920
non-animal sources of leucine as well.

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.030
You can look those up on the internet.

01:38:57.030 --> 01:39:00.830
Now, there are other
compounds that have been shown

01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:03.060
to perhaps be important for offsetting

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:06.500
or helping different forms of vision loss.

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.880
One is, I'm going to spell
this out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E,

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.900
idebenone, idebenone, idebenone,

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:17.433
I can never pronounce these
compounds, forgive me,

01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:20.460
unless I've worked with them.

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.630
There is evidence that
it can be beneficial

01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:27.570
for Leber's congenital eye disease.

01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:30.020
I would definitely go on to examine.com,

01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:32.730
put in I-D-E-B-N-O-N-E.

01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:36.590
And for things like
Leber's optic neuropathies,

01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:39.670
which is a degenerative
condition of the eye,

01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:40.560
whether or not people should

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.270
just be taking this stuff anyway
is still an open question.

01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:45.290
There aren't a lot of studies about it.

01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:46.870
A lot of people that are interested

01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:49.410
in taking things to support their vision

01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:52.193
are taking lutein as a
preventative measure.

01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:55.400
I don't pass any judgment
one way or the other.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.610
Typically, those supplements

01:39:57.610 --> 01:40:02.550
also include the zeaxanthins
and astaxanthins.

01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:05.670
Okay, the pronunciation of
this is terrible, I'm sure,

01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:07.050
but that's not too far off,

01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:12.050
but basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:13.820
You can see why it's hard to pronounce,

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:17.020
Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:21.450
And the other one is
A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:24.440
Both of these have been shown, excuse me,

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.180
both of these have been shown

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:30.860
to offset some of the disruption in vision

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.770
that occurs with aging.

01:40:32.770 --> 01:40:35.320
What is astaxanthin?

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.440
It's a really interesting compound.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.170
It's the red-pink pigment
found in various seafoods.

01:40:41.170 --> 01:40:43.910
So shrimp, I'm not a big seafood fan,

01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:46.060
but like certain fish, like the,

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:47.230
you'll see at the fish market

01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:49.510
will have that red-pink pigment.

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:51.770
And it's also in the
feathers of flamingos,

01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:54.270
please don't eat the
feathers of flamingos,

01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:56.343
and please also don't eat flamingos.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.520
It's structurally similar to betacarotene,

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.040
so it's very pro vitamin A,

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.710
but it has some chemical differences,

01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:05.900
which may make it safer than vitamin A.

01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:09.210
Remember, vitamin A is
a lipid-soluble vitamin,

01:41:09.210 --> 01:41:12.720
so it can be stored in our
body for long periods of time.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.360
What is the deal with this astaxanthin?

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.490
You know, what are its drawbacks?

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:20.790
Well, we can go to our
ever favorite examine.com.

01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:21.623
What does it do?

01:41:21.623 --> 01:41:23.430
Well, it has a number
of different effects,

01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:27.830
a huge number in fact, but it
does seem to notably increase,

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:29.630
it's now been shown in three studies,

01:41:29.630 --> 01:41:32.850
the antioxidant enzyme profile.

01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:34.870
It has a number of different effects,

01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:36.820
but the most notable for
sake of this episode,

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:39.170
is the one on ocular blood flow.

01:41:39.170 --> 01:41:41.930
It does seem to increase the
amount of ocular blood flow,

01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:43.720
so the blood supply to the eyes,

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.120
so that makes it an interesting compound.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.930
It has a number of other effects.

01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:51.800
For whatever reason, it
also has a notable effect,

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.610
several studies have shown
this, on fertility in males.

01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:59.640
So it seems to at least
double the pregnancy rate

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.380
when men take astaxanthin

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.920
and works as, in particular, it seems here

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.640
in men that were previously infertile.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:11.050
So, I don't know if that has something

01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:13.150
to do with the blood flow
to the eyes, probably not.

01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:14.210
It probably has something to do

01:42:14.210 --> 01:42:16.670
with something unrelated to the eyes.

01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:19.140
Nonetheless, that's an
effect of this molecule.

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.840
It's also been shown to
have positive effects

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.310
on things like skin
elasticity, skin moisture,

01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:25.840
skin quality, et cetera,

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.790
probably due to its effects on blood flow.

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:33.790
So lutein, astaxanthin,
A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N,

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:37.370
and for people who have concerns

01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:39.430
about Leber's optic neuropathies,

01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:41.760
which is going to be a small
percentage of people out there,

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.110
but that is a pretty severe condition,

01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:47.000
there are supplements that
are available out there.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.240
I do encourage you, as always,

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.630
to talk to your ophthalmologist
and physician about them.

01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:53.650
And I will say that there
are a number of people

01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:56.170
that take lutein and some
of these other things

01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:59.270
as a precautionary measure, in
order to bolster their health

01:42:59.270 --> 01:43:01.570
in the same way that some people
take vitamins and minerals

01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:02.410
to bolster their health,

01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:04.507
and some people are
very health, excuse me,

01:43:04.507 --> 01:43:05.910
and some people are very averse

01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:07.130
to taking vitamins and minerals,

01:43:07.130 --> 01:43:08.670
'cause they feel like
they can get all that

01:43:08.670 --> 01:43:10.110
from healthy, whole foods.

01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:13.870
And of course, you can get
these things from whole foods.

01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:15.210
The question is whether
or not you can get them

01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:17.320
in concentrations that are sufficient.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.250
I do think that in the years to come,

01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:22.310
we are going to see more about lutein.

01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:24.270
I think we are going to see more

01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:27.363
about some of these other
compounds like astaxanthin,

01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:30.810
and hopefully by then I'll
be able to pronounce it.

01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:34.190
But, at present, these
things are more or less

01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:36.940
in the kind of experimental
or self-experimental phase.

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:39.250
There are some good double-blind
placebo controlled studies,

01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:41.890
like the egg yolk buttermilk
study of all things

01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:43.530
published in really good journals.

01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:44.800
Journal of Ophthalmology,

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.790
Journal of Investigative
Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences,

01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:50.440
these are good journals.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.410
These are journals are
peer-reviewed by experts.

01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:57.960
The study that I mentioned
earlier about keeping rooms dark

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.910
that was also published
in an excellent journal,

01:43:59.910 --> 01:44:00.930
I think it was JAMA.

01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:03.260
I'll go back and look, it's
not on my screen any longer,

01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.880
but very easy to find,

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.470
and there been some
follow-up studies as well

01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:09.650
from the University of Pennsylvania
and other universities.

01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:11.600
So everything I've talked about today

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.850
relates to studies that were done

01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:15.980
and published in quality,
peer-reviewed journals.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.840
That doesn't necessarily
mean you want to run out

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.980
and start taking this
stuff that I've described,

01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:21.680
or even doing the
protocols I've described,

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:24.670
I've given you an array, a
palette, a buffet if you will,

01:44:24.670 --> 01:44:26.760
of things that you could
do to try and enhance

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.420
or support your vision.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.100
Depending on how good your vision is,

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:33.330
your family history of
vision and vision loss,

01:44:33.330 --> 01:44:35.050
your occupational hazards.

01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:38.090
You know, people that
work with metal filings

01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:39.630
that are flying out of machines

01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:42.663
are going to have a
higher degree of vision,

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.550
you know, risk to their visual system

01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:47.110
than well, people who just do office work.

01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:49.000
Although, if you're doing
a lot of office work,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.690
chances are you're not getting
a lot of long-view vision.

01:44:51.690 --> 01:44:53.010
Your accommodation mechanisms

01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:54.530
are going to start to suffer over time.

01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:56.690
I think we can reliably predict that.

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:59.570
So I've tried to give you an
array of behavioral tools,

01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:03.090
and we did touch upon some
supplementation tools.

01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:04.880
I'd be remiss if I didn't say that,

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.190
because blood flow is so critical

01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:08.150
for the neurons of the eye,

01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:10.150
remember, these are the most
metabolically active cells

01:45:10.150 --> 01:45:12.800
in your entire body, the
cells within your retina,

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.670
because blood flow is required to get them

01:45:14.670 --> 01:45:16.280
the energy and nutrients they need,

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:19.410
having a healthy
cardiovascular system, right,

01:45:19.410 --> 01:45:20.450
doing endurance work,

01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:23.140
doing strength training work regularly,

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:25.587
is going to support your
eyes, and your brain,

01:45:25.587 --> 01:45:26.420
and your vision.

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:28.900
It's indirect, but it's essential, right?

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:31.770
It's necessary, but it's
not going to be sufficient.

01:45:31.770 --> 01:45:33.150
You're going to have to do other things

01:45:33.150 --> 01:45:34.890
to support your eyesight, as well.

01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:36.750
But having a healthy
cardiovascular system,

01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:40.150
because it's going to deliver
blood and oxygen and nutrients

01:45:40.150 --> 01:45:44.400
to this incredible apparati
on the front of your face,

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:45.940
these two pieces of brain,

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:48.460
is going to support your
overall brain health

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:50.130
and vision over time.

01:45:50.130 --> 01:45:51.270
So early in the podcast,

01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:53.060
I talked about how the optimal window

01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.720
for learning is 90 minutes.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.470
That's the so called
ultradian cycle for learning.

01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:59.510
That's why we had all our
episodes to about 90 minutes.

01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:00.880
They're now starting to extend

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.710
into the hour and 50
minute and two hour mark.

01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:06.090
That simply reflects my
enthusiasm and excitement

01:46:06.090 --> 01:46:07.750
about these topics and
my desire to give you

01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:11.020
as much information as I
possibly can in each episode.

01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:12.420
Please remember you don't have to listen

01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.100
to the whole episode all at once.

01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:15.200
Everything is timestamped.

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.980
Everything is captioned
in English and Spanish.

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.250
The captions take a few days on YouTube.

01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:21.130
We apologize for that,

01:46:21.130 --> 01:46:23.190
but in order to have them done correctly,

01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:25.930
it takes a few days after it's posted.

01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:28.000
So if you need those captions,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.420
please check back maybe 24 or 48 hours

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:33.460
after the episodes are released.

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:36.060
If you're enjoying this
podcast and the information,

01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.520
if you're finding it beneficial,

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.460
there are a couple of
things that you can do

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:41.870
that are totally zero cost that
really help us and help you

01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:44.300
get this information going forward.

01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:46.780
One is, if you don't already
subscribe on YouTube,

01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:48.440
please do subscribe.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:49.840
We release episodes every Monday,

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.550
and hopefully soon more often than that,

01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:53.220
shorter episodes as well.

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:56.810
But every Monday we release an
episode, please do subscribe.

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:59.270
If you don't already subscribe
on Apple and Spotify,

01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:01.750
that's very beneficial, please do that.

01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:03.040
That helps us as well.

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.950
If you could give us a
five-star review on Apple,

01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:06.800
if you feel that that's what we deserve,

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.720
and Apple also gives you the opportunity

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.680
to give us comments,
feedback about the episodes.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.700
If you have suggestions about episodes,

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.690
feedback of any kind,

01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:19.150
please put it in the
comment section on YouTube.

01:47:19.150 --> 01:47:20.380
Routinely throughout the week,

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:21.860
after the release of each episode,

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.610
I cover content in shorter format

01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:26.307
and in more depth on
Instagram @hubermanlab.

01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:31.890
Every episode is also
indexed and searchable

01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:34.850
in the search function on
our website hubermanlab.com.

01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:37.850
That's also where we post
links to various studies

01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:40.660
and downloadable protocols, all zero cost.

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.800
And as I mentioned, you can
search for different topics,

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.230
and it will bring you to
the particular episodes

01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:48.040
that contain the
information on those topics.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.520
If you'd like to support us on Patreon,

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.810
we have a Patreon account, it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:57.430
There you can support us
at any level that you like.

01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:59.580
As well, if you'd like to support us,

01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:01.060
please check out our sponsors.

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:02.220
The sponsors that we discussed

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.610
at the beginning of the podcast

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:05.650
are a vital way to keep the information

01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:08.023
being distributed at
zero cost to everybody.

01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:10.510
We only work with sponsors

01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:12.630
that we really love their products

01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:14.050
and that we really respect the people

01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:15.560
that we're working with there.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.380
And of course, there's
no obligation to purchase

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.970
or to even check out those sponsors,

01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:21.330
but if you're in a position to do so,

01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:23.070
that really does help us.

01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:25.560
Routinely throughout the podcast,
we talk about supplements.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.810
There are a lot of supplement companies

01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:28.970
and sources of supplements out there.

01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:29.803
The one that we work with

01:48:29.803 --> 01:48:33.210
and that we partnered with
is Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:35.380
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency,

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.320
in terms of what they say
is in their supplements

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.430
is actually in their supplements,

01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:41.280
because it's independently
tested and verified.

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:44.230
As well as the amounts that
they list on the bottles

01:48:44.230 --> 01:48:47.650
actually are matched by what's
in the capsules and tablets.

01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:49.700
That's a serious problem
in the supplement industry,

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.510
and Thorne deals with that problem

01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:53.760
by being very truthful and very accurate

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.250
about what's in their supplements

01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:56.840
and how much of those things are in there.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.700
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:03.700
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:06.630
There, you'll see all the
supplements that I take.

01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.860
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements,

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:11.350
as well as 20% off any
of the other supplements

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:13.080
that Thorne happens to make,

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.810
if you happen to navigate
into their website

01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:19.810
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.300
And last but not least,

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.420
I want to thank you for your
time and attention today.

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:25.970
Your willingness to learn about
vision and the visual system

01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:27.600
and the various things that you can do

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.410
to help support the health and functioning

01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:30.830
of your visual system.

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:31.960
And of course, I want to thank you

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:32.973
for your interest in science.

01:49:32.973 --> 01:49:35.556
