00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.880
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.460
where we discuss science

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.258
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:09.470
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.970
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.840
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.910
Today, we're talking all about goals

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.810
and the science of goal setting
and achieving your goals.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.590
There's a tremendous amount of information

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.940
on the internet and in books and so forth,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.160
about how to set goals

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.440
and assess your progress towards goals

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.240
and update your goals and so forth.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.780
In fact, there are so
many programs out there,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.770
that includes so many different acronyms

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.720
that it can be a little bit overwhelming.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.610
Today's conversation about goals,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.290
is going to be quite a bit different.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.730
Indeed, we are going to
talk about setting goals.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.860
We are also going to talk
about how to assess progress

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.693
towards goals.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:51.120
And we are going to talk
about goal execution.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.410
However, we're going to do all of this

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.830
in the context of neuroscience,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.830
because it turns out that there
are not hundreds or dozens

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.420
or even several neural
circuits in your brain,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.950
that control goal setting and
movement toward your goals.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.210
There is one

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.660
and while it includes many
different brain areas,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.784
that one circuit is the same circuit,

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:16.460
that's responsible for pursuing all goals.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.180
And it relates to some very
basic neurochemical mechanisms

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.430
that are understood.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.330
So while there's a wealth
of information out there

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.760
about goals and goal setting

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.960
and goal achievement and so forth,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.880
there's comparatively little information

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.550
that's been available to the public

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.970
about the neuroscience of goal
setting and goal achievement.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120
So that's what we're
going to focus on today.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.960
I promise that we're going
to get into the neuroscience,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.050
we're going to touch on a
little bit of the psychology

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.130
and how the neuroscience
relates to what's known

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.890
in the psychology literature.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.360
And we are going to
establish several, in fact,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.150
four specific protocols that
you can use for goal setting,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.710
goal assessment and goal
execution in an ongoing basis,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.650
regardless of what your
personal goals happen to be.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.690
Before we dive into our
conversation about goals

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.180
and goal setting and goal achievement,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810
I'd like to highlight some
recent scientific findings,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.390
that I think are going to be interesting

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.270
and actionable for many of you out there.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.050
In earlier podcasts, we
talked about neuro-plasticity,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.730
which is the brain's ability to change

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.870
in response to experience.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.580
In fact, neuroplasticity
underlies all forms of learning,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.170
whether or not it's language
learning or learning music

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.601
or math or a physical skill,

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.160
all forms of learning
involve the reorganization

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.960
of connections in the nervous system,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.710
the brain and spinal cord and body.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.956
One of the key principles
of neuroplasticity,

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:36.000
is this notion of making
errors as a good thing

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.180
toward neuroplasticity.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.060
It is a little bit counterintuitive,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.400
but what the scientific
literature tells us,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.450
is that whenever we're trying
to learn something new,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.410
if we make an error, we
know it feels frustrating,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.250
but that state of frustration,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.330
actually queues up particular
brain areas to be more alert,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.990
so that on subsequent
attempts to learn that thing,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.227
we have a heightened level of focus

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:59.020
and a higher probability
of learning the new skill,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.697
regardless of what that skill is.

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:03.370
And I've talked about this
before in various episodes,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.040
as encouraging people to
embrace errors or pursue errors,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.730
not as their own end goal,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.280
but errors as an entry point

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.060
for making the brain more plastic.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.680
And if you think about
it really makes sense,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.810
why would the brain change at all,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.110
if it's performing everything perfectly?

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.150
When you make errors, well
in the immediate seconds

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.870
and minutes after those errors,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.480
you are in a better position to learn.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.100
A common question I get, however,
is what should be the rate

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.933
of errors?

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:31.150
Which is really just a way of saying,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.810
how hard should the given task be

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.190
that you're trying to learn or perform?

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.580
And it turns out there's an answer.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.340
There's a recent paper that was published

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.720
in a great journal,
"Nature Communications".

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.750
This is a paper, our last
author, Jonathan Cohen,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.417
and the paper is entitled,

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:51.060
"The Eighty Five Percent
Rule for optimal learning".

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.170
This paper, we will
make available by a link

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.010
in the show note captions,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.040
but basically what this paper shows,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.760
is that when trying to
learn something new,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.060
you want to make the difficulty

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.830
of what you're trying to learn, such that,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.020
you are getting things
right about 85% of the time.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.000
That you're making errors
about 15% of the time.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.840
And the reason I like this paper,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.040
is it really points
specifically to some protocols

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.873
that we can implement

00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:17.740
because people always say, okay,
you want to set a high goal.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.960
You want to try and achieve
something that's really lofty,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.680
but you don't want to
make the goal so lofty

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.680
that you don't make any progress at all.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.010
Other people say, you really want to start

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.440
with really small goals

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.090
and make things very, very incremental.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.110
Only set out to do things that
you know you can accomplish

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.610
and that will feed back on
your self-esteem and all these

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.760
positive feedback loops.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.290
And then, you know, layer
by layer, layer by layer,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.920
you'll eventually get
where you want to go.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.440
Well, it turns out that neither is true

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.250
you need to set the level of difficulty,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.240
such that you're making
errors about 15% of the time.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.120
And I want to emphasize
about 15% of the time,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.240
because there's no way to
figure protocols for sport

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.920
or language or math or anything else,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.030
where you're going to
have exactly 15% errors.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.470
So, anyway, this paper, the
85% rule for optimal learning,

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.850
again, we will supply the link,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.840
but it really points to the idea

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.420
of making things pretty hard,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.640
but not so hard that you're
failing every attempt

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.130
or even half of the attempts.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.450
Failing about 15% of the time
seems optimal for learning.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.430
Hopefully that information
will be useful to any of you

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.210
that are trying to learn something.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.180
Hopefully it will also
be useful to those of you

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.030
that are teaching kids or other adults.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.863
If you're teaching,

00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:26.100
keep in mind that you want
to keep the students reaching

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.060
for higher and higher
levels of proficiency

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.900
in whatever that is that you're teaching.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.850
And that 15% of the time
they should be failing,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.860
if it gets to 20%, that's probably okay.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.830
If they start failing about half the time,

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.820
then probably what they're
trying to learn is too difficult

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.280
for them at that point.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.420
Now, of course, this is going
to be controlled by all sorts

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.340
of external factors,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.340
like whether or not they
slept well the night before,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.900
whether or not you slept
well the night before

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.090
and you're being clear
in your instructions

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.370
to them, et cetera.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.060
But I think the 15%
rule as we may call it,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.870
is a good metric to aim for

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.150
and it can serve both
students and teachers.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.210
In other words, it can
serve both those teaching

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.140
and those that are learning.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.540
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.300
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.170
It is however, part of
my desire and effort,

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.590
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.210
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.210
In keeping with that theme,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.940
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.070
Our first sponsor is LMNT,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.670
LMNT is an electrolyte drink
mixed with everything you need

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.830
and nothing you don't.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.180
That means lots of salt,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.740
some other electrolytes and no sugar.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.450
As I've mentioned before on this podcast

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.660
and in various interviews,
I'm a big fan of salt.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.430
I sort of discovered this a few years ago,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.600
when "Science Magazine",

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.930
one of the pre-eminent
magazines out there,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.790
that publishes research on science,

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.510
but also news articles about science,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.930
talked about the myth of salt research.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.100
It turns out, that contrary
to what I had believed,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.750
which was that salt is
going to cause hypertension

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.350
or that salt is really bad for us.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.730
There's an innate need
for salt in our system

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.410
and indeed, if you dive into
the textbooks on salt balance,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.080
we have entire biological
systems of our kidneys

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.180
and fluid management, et cetera,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.196
that are involved in making
sure that we get enough salt.

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:07.230
In fact, neurons, nerve cells, function

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.970
because salt, sodium actually
enters those cells quickly

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.910
and that's what causes them
to fire action potentials.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.820
The common syllable or a
language of neurons, if you will,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.560
when we are low in sodium,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.240
our neurons don't work as well.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.130
And a few years later,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.620
I had the experience of
feeling kind of shaky

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.010
and I thought I had blood sugar issues.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.130
I went and got my blood sugar
checked and it was fine.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.720
And a physician made the recommendation,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.720
that I actually up my salt intake.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.470
My intake wasn't particularly
low, I didn't think,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.390
but I quickly found,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.300
was that if I consumed enough salt,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.380
usually I would do this in the form

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.840
of putting a little pinch
of salt into some water,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.380
adding a little lemon juice
or something like that,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.410
or salting my food a little bit more.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.090
That I lost any kind of
shakiness in my hands,

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.940
that my mental functioning was better,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.200
my sports performance
was better, et cetera.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.390
So it was really interesting
to see that shift simply

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.070
by increasing my salt intake,

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.410
something that's really counterintuitive,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.893
to a lot of what's out there.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.540
Salt isn't just important
for the function of neurons,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.340
it's important for blood volume

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.250
and working alongside the
other electrolytes, magnesium

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.260
and potassium,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.120
it ensures that cells in
our body function properly.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.330
And I think we're starting
to see a shift out there now,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.687
in the perception of what salt

00:08:15.687 --> 00:08:17.507
and the other electrolytes do.

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:19.660
And really seeing magnesium,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.343
which is one of the
electrolytes, potassium

00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:24.800
and especially salt, as not
necessarily something to avoid,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.430
but in fact something to embrace,

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.450
provided that they're used properly.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.466
LMNT is formulated to help anyone,

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.570
reach their electrolyte needs

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.920
and is particularly well-suited
to people following a keto,

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.780
low carb or paleo diet.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.300
For people following a low carb diet

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.870
or doing intermittent fasting,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.150
what many people don't know,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.040
is that carbohydrate holds water.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.210
It actually brings water into the system

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.410
and you don't want your
system to be low on water,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.630
that's one form of dehydration..

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.470
Salt holds water as well,

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.310
meaning it keeps the water in your system,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.620
which is beneficial for
brain and body function.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.060
LMNT contains a science-backed
electrolyte ratio

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.460
of 1000 milligrams,
that's one gram of sodium,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.140
200 milligrams of potassium
and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.380
And they use the very best
forms of salt, potassium,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.560
and magnesium that are out there.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.890
So the way I use LMNT, is I
usually will mix up one packet

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.700
into about 16 to 30 ounces
of water in the morning

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.010
and drink that first thing

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.460
in the morning when I wake up

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.330
or around breakfast time,
doesn't really matter.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.650
I kind of sip on it through the morning

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.430
or if I'm really thirsty,
I'll drink it all at once.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.900
And then I always make sure
to drink a volume of water

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.380
with an LMNT packet in it,
somewhere around my exercise.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.210
Sometimes it's during the exercise,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.270
if I'm running, I'll
wait until afterwards.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.060
I'll hydrate with it before and after,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.260
if it's a really hot day.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.651
If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to

00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:45.040

You only cover the cost of shipping,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.250
otherwise it's completely free.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.440

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.130
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.500
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.980
probiotic drink.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.460
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.900
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.337
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:10:08.337 --> 00:10:10.600
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.830
is that it covers all of
my foundational vitamin,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.820
mineral, probiotic needs.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.010
We of course need vitamins.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.560
We of course need minerals

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.450
and we do need a healthy gut microbiome

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.740
and probiotics, support
a healthy gut microbiome.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.000
There is now a wealth of quality
scientific published data,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.710
showing that the microbiota,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.140
meaning the little microbes
that live in our gut,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.019
are good for us.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:34.750
And our gut when it functions properly,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.850
communicates with our brain

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.420
and our brain communicates with our gut

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.630
through the so-called, gut-brain axis.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.870
And that gut-brain axis,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.239
is vital for things like immune system,

00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:45.500
endocrine system, meaning hormones

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.860
and for mood and overall brain function.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.460
With Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.760
my minerals and the probiotics I need,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.200
to support a healthy gut
microbiome and gut-brain axis

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.190
without having to worry
about taking a bunch

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.150
of other things.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.210
In fact, when people ask me,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.000
what's the one supplement I should take,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.490
that's going to make me feel better?

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.870
I always say Athletic Greens

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.750
because indeed it makes me feel better

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.340
and it happens to taste terrific.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.380
I drink it twice a day, typically,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.520
I'll have one in the morning,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.560
I mix it with water and a little
bit of lemon or lime juice.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.720
And I'll typically have
it again in the afternoon

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.000
or late afternoon,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.540
again, mixed with water,
some lemon or lime juice.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.160
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.970
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.360
to claim a special offer.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.850
They'll give you five free travel packs,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.820
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens,

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.850
while you're in the car or
traveling by plane, et cetera.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.620
Plus, they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3 + K2.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.890
Many of us are deficient in vitamin D3

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.190
and even for those of us

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.640
that are getting sufficient sunshine,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.350
many of us still need to
supplement with vitamin D3.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.820
Vitamin D3 is involved in
metabolism, immune system,

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.050
brain function, hormones, et cetera.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.420
It has so many important functions,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.240
and K2 has been shown to be important

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.430
for a variety of things,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.600
not the least, which is
cardiovascular health.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.280
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.500
you can claim a special offer.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.900
They'll give you five free travel packs,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.500
plus a year supply of vitamin D3 + K2.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.430
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.020
to claim this special offer.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.680
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.600
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.730
that have the absolute highest quality.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.260
I spent a lifetime working on the science

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.410
of the visual system

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.630
and I can tell you that your
visual system everywhere

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.920
from your eyes to your brain,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.140
includes a ton of different mechanisms,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.080
so that as you move through
different environments,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.680
you can see things clearly.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.572
And even if it's bright
out or there are shadows

00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:30.550
or it's really dim outside,
or it's getting dark,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.930
that your visual system
can try and manage,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.690
to resolve what's out there in the world,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.030
so you can see things clearly.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.540
Many people need corrective
lenses, they need eyeglasses.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.800
Other people, they need
sunglasses as well,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.490
or just simply need sunglasses

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.930
because if it's too bright,
it's very hard to see things.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.650
One problem with a lot of eyeglasses

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.320
and sunglasses out there, however,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.180
is they don't take into account,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.610
the nuanced biology, the visual system.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.810
You may have experienced this.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.370
Have you ever put on a pair of sunglasses

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.330
that aren't so great?

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.580
You move from a really bright
area into a dimly lit area

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.420
and you have to take the eyeglasses off,

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.190
your eyes just don't seem to adjust.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.980
With ROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.900
everything they've done to
design those glasses and lenses,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.780
is with the science of
the visual system in mind.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.070
So you can move seamlessly from
one environment to the next

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.990
and you always see things
with crystal clarity.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.120
Their sunglasses and
eyeglasses are really terrific

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.890
because they can be used for anything.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.140
They have a terrific aesthetic,
so you can wear them,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.660
to work to dinner, et
cetera, they look great.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.260
And, they're also designed
for athletic performance,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.800
you can use them while
running or while cycling,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.630
if you get sweaty, they
won't slip off your face.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.970
They're extremely lightweight,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.230
in fact, I often forget that
they're even on my face.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.750
I wear readers at night
and sometimes when I drive

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.230
and I wear sunglasses when
it's really bright outside

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.720
and I need sunglasses.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.980
If you want to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.570
you can go to roka.com

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.930
That's R-O-K-A.com and

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.940
to save 20% off your first order.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.773
Again, that's ROKA,

00:13:50.773 --> 00:13:54.980
R-O-K-A.com and enter the
code Huberman at checkout.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.760
Let's talk about the
science and in particular,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.150
the biology and neuroscience
of setting and achieving goals.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.390
Setting and achieving goals,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.490
is not a uniquely human endeavor.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.279
Other animals set and
attempt to achieve goals,

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.190
a honeybee attempts to collect honey

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.860
and bring it back to the hive.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.940
A herbivore will go out
and forage for plants

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.630
and will also have a need to reproduce

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.640
at some point in its life.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.840
So, will need to find a mate
and maybe even raise the young,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.540
depending on what species that is.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.370
Predators will have to hunt
and kill and eat their food

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.840
and they have to avoid getting
injured in that process.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.900
They also have to raise young, et cetera.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.560
So humans are among the other animals,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.070
or we could say the animals are among us

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.910
in the need to set goals

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.260
and to make efforts to
achieve those goals.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.290
Now, why do I emphasize
this commonality of process?

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.840
The reason I emphasize this
commonality of process,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.400
is that it turns out that
there is one basic system

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.910
by which all animals, including humans,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.540
set and attempt to achieve goals.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.490
Now humans are unique in our
ability to orient our mind

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.990
toward immediate goals,
moderately termed goals,

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.110
meaning things that might
exist on the scale of a week

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.750
or a month or even a year

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.120
and very long-term goals,
like a lifetime goal

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.810
or a goal that lasts a decade,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.810
or it takes a decade to achieve.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.360
That's what makes us unique.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.490
And of course we don't
have access to the mindset

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.060
or the thinking or the
emotions of other animals,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.260
but what we do know is that,
common neural circuits,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.340
meaning brain areas,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.080
that are present in animal
species and in humans,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.190
are responsible for orienting
our thinking and our action

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.830
toward particular goals.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.820
Another thing that's really
unique about the human brain,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.880
is that we are able to have
multiple goals interacting

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.750
at once.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.440
So, for instance, we probably
all have fitness goals,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.750
goals in relationships of
different kinds, friendships,

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.170
and romantic partnerships

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.340
as well as maybe scholastic goals.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.490
Maybe you're in school

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.230
or you're pursuing some
kind of learning outside

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.490
of the school environment

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.150
or indoor, you have business
goals or financial goals,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.127
we are able to have
multiple goals at once.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.360
And other animals do this,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.000
but humans are unique in the ability

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.720
to juggle a lot of goals.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.260
And actually one of the major
challenges in pursuing goals,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.880
is that goal pursuit often interacts,

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.090
meaning if you can spend 100%

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.150
of your time chasing one particular goal,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.880
that might be very
effective for that goal,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.820
but then we tend to fall back
on some of our other goals.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.210
You can imagine how this plays out.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.690
If you're working very, very hard,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.523
you're solely focused on business often,

00:16:25.523 --> 00:16:28.050
your health will suffer.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.870
If you're solely focused
on your health often,

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.750
other things will suffer.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.700
And so we have to juggle
both our goal setting

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.550
and our goal pursuits.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.160
And so today, we're going
to talk about a number

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.260
of different ways,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.610
to work with what could
very well be called,

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.470
these interleaving goals,

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.268
by focusing on a common practice
or common set of mechanisms

00:16:45.268 --> 00:16:49.020
that are present in all
aspects of goal seeking.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.470
What is that process?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.190
Well, it turns out, it's a neural circuit.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.620
A neural circuit, is simply
a collection of brain areas,

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.960
that when active in a
particular sequence give rise

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.950
to a particular behavior or perception.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.410
So for instance, when you feel happy,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.100
it's not because you have a brain area,

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.020
that's the happy brain area,
that is electrically active.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.250
Rather, it's going to
involve numerous brain areas,

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.730
being active in concert
and to different degrees.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.290
In the same way, that the
keys on a piano, together,

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.760
played in the appropriate sequence,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.550
represent a particular song.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.930
You would never say that one key

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.450
on the piano represents that song,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.290
but that key is necessary.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.710
Similarly, in the brain,

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.860
we can say that a brain
area might be necessary,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.260
but not sufficient to give
us a particular experience

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.950
or generate a particular behavior.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.410
So when we think about goal
seeking and the pursuit of goals

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.770
of any kind in the brain,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.970
it doesn't matter what the goal is.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.230
It involves a common
set of neural circuits

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.580
and the neural circuit
that I'd like to orient us

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.413
toward today.

00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:53.880
And we will return to it a few times,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.500
involves learning a couple of names,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.740
but you don't have to worry so
much about memorizing these.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.540
Just more important is
to understand the logic

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.390
of how it's put together

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.160
and I will explain that
and make it very clear.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
If you want to learn
the names, that's great.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.280
One of the brain areas is
the so-called, amygdala.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.670
The amygdala is most often
associated with fear,

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.503
so you might say, wow,

00:18:10.503 --> 00:18:13.270
how is that involved in
goal directed behavior?

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.280
Well, a lot of our goal directed behavior,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.320
is to avoid punishments,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.360
including things like
embarrassment or financial ruin

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.780
or things of that sort.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.980
And so the amygdala and some
sense of anxiety or fear,

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.920
is actually built in to the circuits

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.532
that generate goal seeking

00:18:28.532 --> 00:18:31.180
and our motivation to pursuit goals.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.180
The other areas are the
so-called, ventral striatum.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.030
The striatum is part of what's
called, the basal ganglia.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.150
The basal ganglia, is a neural circuit,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.040
that can very simply be
described as a neural circuit

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.650
that helps us generate go,
meaning the initiation of action

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.520
and no-go, the prevention
of action type scenarios.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.950
Let me make that even simpler.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.780
The ventral striatum is
part of this thing called,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.613
the basal ganglia.

00:18:55.613 --> 00:18:58.690
The basal ganglia has sort
of two circuits within it.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.770
One circuit is involved in
getting us to do things,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.250
like I'm going to get up tomorrow

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.034
and I'm going to run five miles
first thing in the morning.

00:19:05.034 --> 00:19:05.950
I don't know if I'm
actually going to do that,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.120
but I'm just using that as an example.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.080
Another circuit within the basal ganglia,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.300
is a no-go circuit, it's
the one that says, no,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.940
I'm not going to go for the second cookie

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.120
or the third cookie.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.030
I'm not going to eat that.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.380
And then the go circuit would
be the one that's responsible

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.730
for instead eating something else.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.600
Okay, so we have go and no-go circuits

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.160
within the basal ganglia.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.480
So we've got amygdala,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.300
so what you think of as
kind of fear and anxiety

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.200
and avoidance.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.040
We've got, the basal ganglia,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.050
which are for initiating
action and preventing action.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.730
And then there is the so-called, cortex.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.470
The cortex is the outer
shell of the brain,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.030
and there are two sub
regions of the cortex,

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.400
that are involved in
goal-directed behavior.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.410
One is the lateral prefrontal cortex,

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.910
prefrontal cortex is involved in,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.710
so-called, executive function,
things like planning.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.880
Thinking about things
under different timescales,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.050
so not just what we want
in the immediate term,

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.900
but what we might want
tomorrow or the next day

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.840
and how our actions currently
are going to relate,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.910
to the future.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.158
And the so-called, orbitofrontal cortex,

00:20:02.158 --> 00:20:05.530
orbitofrontal cortex has a
large number of functions,

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.090
but one of the key functions
of the orbitofrontal cortex,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.780
it's involved in meshing some emotionality

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.630
with our current state of progress

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.610
and comparing that emotionality
to where it might be,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.129
when we are closer to a goal.

00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:21.970
So, there are basically four areas,

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:26.020
one involved in anxiety,
one involved in emotion,

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.410
one involved in planning

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.430
and another involved in
this go, no-go action.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.530
So that's a bunch of detail,

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.170
but if I wanted to make it
really simple for everyone,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.030
I would say there are four areas.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.963
One is an area associated
with anxiety and fear,

00:20:38.963 --> 00:20:40.130
it's the amygdala.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.660
The second is involved
in action and inaction,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.030
remember go, and no-go, so
that's the basal ganglia.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.970
The other one is involved
in planning and thinking

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.170
across different timescales,

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.960
so that's lateral prefrontal cortex.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.990
And then the fourth one, is
involved in emotionality,

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.550
where we sit emotionally present,

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.070
compared to where we think
we will be emotionally,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.320
when we reach some particular goal

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.720
and that's the orbitofrontal cortex.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.800
Again, you don't need
to know all those names.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.720
You don't need to know all the details,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.010
just understand that those
different elements are involved

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.820
in the decision-making
processes that lead us

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.890
toward particular goals

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.110
and have us update our
goal seeking, et cetera.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.775
One key thing is it doesn't
matter what the goal is,

00:21:25.775 --> 00:21:28.390
the same circuits are involved.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.910
So whether or not you're
trying to build a company,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.743
that's a billion dollar company

00:21:31.743 --> 00:21:33.160
that's going to go public,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.850
or you're thinking about
planning a craft day at home

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.480
with the kids or for yourself,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.350
or you're thinking about
what movie to go see.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.380
Goals, goal seeking and
assessing progress towards goals,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.360
all involve the exact
same neural circuits.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.480
It's really remarkable.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.830
It's also very convenient
for our discussion today.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.660
What's going on in these circuits,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.410
can basically be boiled down
to two particular things.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.960
The first is, value information,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.530
trying to understand whether or not,

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.650
something is really worth pursuing or not.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.660
So, placing a value on a particular goal.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.130
The other component of
this neural circuit,

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.760
is associated with action,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.300
which actions to take and
which actions not to take,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.450
given the value of a particular goal

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.530
in a given moments time.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.580
I want to say that again.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.996
The other component of the
circuit is involved in action,

00:22:22.996 --> 00:22:26.450
whether or not you should
act or should not act,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.980
based on your assessment
of the value of a goal

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.380
at a particular moment in time.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.790
And you're going to hear
me say over and over again,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:35.623
in this episode,

00:22:35.623 --> 00:22:38.680
the value information
about a goal is so key.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.740
Here's why, there is basically
one neuro-transmitter

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.710
or rather neuromodulator system,

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.436
that governs our goal
setting, goal assessment

00:22:48.436 --> 00:22:50.140
and goal pursuit.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.950
And that is the neuromodulator dopamine.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.960
Dopamine is the common currency

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.470
by which we assess our progress

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.240
toward particular things
of particular value.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.850
In fact, dopamine, is the
way that we assess value

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.060
of our pursuits.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.150
And so, as we take a moment
and we shift our attention,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.270
to the psychology of goal setting.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.410
The things that you've probably
heard a bit more about,

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.180
about what sorts of goals
are good and how to set goals

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.940
and how to categorize goals.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.510
I want you to think about how dopamine,

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.690
could possibly be involved
in these different processes.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.240
And the reason I want you to do this,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.350
is that all of the
psychology of goal setting

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.860
and goal pursuit, is wonderful

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.420
because it places things
into different categories.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.180
It allows us to parse our thinking

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.780
and organize our thinking.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.410
But what's not often seen,

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.610
in fact, I'm not aware of
any literature out there,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.260
scientific or literature
in the popular press

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.171
or in popular books,

00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:47.530
is an understanding of how
the underlying neurobiology,

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.570
can be layered on top of the
psychology of goal setting,

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.820
to allow us to set and pursue
our goals more effectively.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.000
And that's what we're going to do today.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.650
We are eventually going to arrive

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.560
at a set of four practices,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.430
that when performed on a regular basis,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.680
will allow you to assess,

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.870
what is the value of this
next particular action step?

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:11.500
How worthwhile is it, to do
behavior A versus behavior B

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.660
in order to achieve a particular goal?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.220
If any of this is vague now,

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.950
I'm going to make it
all very clear for you.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.870
You're going to come away
with some very specific lists

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.600
of takeaways that you can put
down on paper, if you like.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.630
And that you can use to
set goals, assess goals,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.620
and execute goals more effectively,

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.700
using the neuroscience of
the circuits I just described

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.700
and an understanding of the
neuromodulator dopamine.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.150
Let's take a look at the
psychology of goal setting

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.430
and goal pursuit.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.210
This is an enormous literature,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.740
meaning there are tens of thousands,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.730
if not hundreds of thousands
of scientific papers

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.230
about the topic of goal
setting and goal pursuit.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.170
There's also a lot of
information on the internet

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.550
about goal pursuit.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.200
And in looking over this information,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.550
one comes to appreciate pretty quickly,

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.540
that acronyms are a big thing.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.270
Acronyms, seem to dominate
the area of goal setting,

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.810
especially as it relates to
things in the business sector,

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.430
but also in the relationship sector.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.980
Now, acronyms are wonderful,

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.573
they allow us to organize
our thinking into less

00:25:11.573 --> 00:25:14.410
and conceptually they can be very useful.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.980
But as I moved through this literature,

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.010
I started to see some redundant themes.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.410
And so what I've attempted to do,

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.400
is distill out the redundant themes,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.550
that regardless of the person teaching

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.610
or the scientific laboratory
that happened to come up

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.216
with these acronyms,

00:25:28.216 --> 00:25:32.060
that they boil down to
some common features.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.250
So let's talk about that literature

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.980
and I think we'll come
away with an understanding

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.360
of some basic elements that
are common to all goals.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.320
Now, the modern science or the
modern psychological science

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.210
of trying to understand
goal setting and pursuit,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.240
actually dates back to the 1930s.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.750
And we have to be sure that
members of our species,

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.680
were focused on goal
setting and goal pursuit,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.260
long before the scientific
literature emerged.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.357
It just stands to reason that,

00:25:56.357 --> 00:25:59.030
since the human brain
hasn't evolved that much,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.780
we don't think, in the last 10,000 years,

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.160
that people would be
thinking about these things.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.850
They just didn't get
them down into papers,

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.790
that we could evaluate
on PubMed and so forth,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.623
but now we can,

00:26:08.623 --> 00:26:09.880
so we can look at those papers.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.520
And what you find is
that acronyms are abound

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.050
in the psychology literature

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.000
about goal setting and goal pursuit.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.380
So for instance, you'll
hear about the work

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.414
of Larkin Small, for instance,

00:26:21.414 --> 00:26:24.690
these are the last names
of various researchers.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.680
The so-called, ABC method, that
a goal should be achievable,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.930
it should be believable,

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.260
and that the person be committed.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.570
It's sort of obvious once you
hear about the ABC method.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.990
Then people came along
and expanded on that,

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.930
they talked about the
so-called, SMART method.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.680
SMART being another acronym,
that it be specific,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.020
that the goal be measurable,

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.270
that the goal be attainable,

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.760
that the goal be realistic
and that it be time-bound,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.770
meaning that you set up
certain period of time

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.330
in which a given goal should be performed.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.160
And then people come
along and modify these,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.950
this is the way that
psychology research is done.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.150
I'm not laughing at it.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.286
I'm just chuckling because,

00:26:56.286 --> 00:26:59.450
it seems like the acronyms get
longer and longer and longer.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.890
They developed the, SMARTER approach,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.610
adding an ER to the acronym,
SMART, S-M-A-R-T-E-R.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.970
They added ethical and
rewarding, which fortunately,

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.420
are good things I believe,
ethical and rewarding.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:14.830
What does all this mean?

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.490
Well, what it means is that
any kind of goal pursuit,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.340
any kind of goal setting,

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.380
really has to involve a
number of different states

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.830
and neural circuits in the brain and body,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.900
at least that's how I
view this literature.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.750
Why would I do that?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.810
Well, let's think about
the very modern version

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.140
of the kind of acronyms that
I talked about a moment ago,

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.930
dating back to the 1930s and
extending into the 1990s.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.980
You can find beautiful talks online

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.270
from people who have worked

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.980
with some of the biggest companies

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.410
and greatest high performers out there,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.920
to achieve incredible things.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.480
And they will talk about generating a sort

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.520
of objective mindset for goal setting.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.190
They'll talk about goals
needing to be significant.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.380
That it has to be a big goal.
That it has to be concrete,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.140
so you have to be able to
describe what the goal is.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.630
It has to be action-oriented,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.930
has to be inspirational,

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.240
has to be time-bound.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.550
You have to have reasonable,
realistic, verifiable measures.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.540
You have to constantly up the ante.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.900
If it's starting to sound repetitive,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.520
it's because it is repetitive.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.540
There are basically only
three or four elements,

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.710
to goal setting and goal pursuit.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.720
Basically, an individual
or set of individuals,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.290
has to identify a specific thing

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.300
that they're going to attain.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.900
In some communities, they talk about,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.020
knowing what right looks like,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.990
meaning being able to
define a very specific goal.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.430
You can't just say, I want
to be a champion athlete.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.080
You have to say what sport,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.730
and you have to understand
what the path to that is.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.800
So any big goal of course,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.360
is broken up into a
series of smaller goals,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.900
but the whole thing starts with thinking

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.170
about the end in mind.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.820
And in a few minutes, we will talk about,

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.930
whether or not visualization
of the end in mind,

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.170
is actually beneficial or
detrimental to achieving goals.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.460
There's actually great
neuroscience and psychology data

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.640
on that now.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.560
So, I mentioned all these acronyms,

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.650
not as an attempt to disparage them.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.660
I think they're wonderful.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.950
And I mentioned all that
psychology literature,

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.930
not in an attempt to disparage it,

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.163
but rather just say that, goal
setting is the first step,

00:29:11.163 --> 00:29:14.290
assessment of whether or
not one is making progress

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.720
towards those goals is the
second but necessary step.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.310
And then there's the
business of goal execution.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.580
And that brings us back to
the neural circuit components,

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.910
remember, this neural circuit,

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.410
involving those four things earlier,

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.960
the amygdala, striatum,
orbitofrontal cortex

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.380
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.350
They work together,

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.530
to divide the whole process
as I mentioned before,

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.480
into two general categories.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.670
The first is, assessing value,

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.900
knowing whether or not where
one is at one given moment,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.640
relates to some external thing.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.640
Are things going well
or things going poorly?

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.870
And knowing how to gauge that accurately.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.870
And then, action steps, goes and no goes,

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.300
do more of this, do less of that,

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.500
do this, don't do that, et cetera.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.430
So, now we are going to shift
back to the neuroscience

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.440
and we're going to talk about
the practical applications

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.300
of the information I just described.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.150
Because I've given you a lot

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.650
of kind of academic information.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.030
And as we do this, I'd
like you to keep in mind,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.280
what are some things that
you've either accomplished

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.680
or that you'd like to
accomplish going forward?

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.610
Because as we do this,

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.360
we can build toward a set of protocols,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.820
that at the end, you'll be
able to very quickly plug in,

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.320
your particular goals and a
route to those particular goals,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.363
that's grounded in the science.

00:30:22.363 --> 00:30:24.490
That I think are going
to be very effective

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.000
in allowing you to reach
those goals, more quickly

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.450
and with indeed less effort.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.010
In fact, let's start with a tool now

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.180
because as we move through
all this information,

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.630
I want to make sure that
people are coming away

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.840
with some practical things
that they can implement.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.420
And indeed, some things
that you can even do

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.063
during the course of listening
to or watching this podcast.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.970
The first thing to do, is
to understand the difference

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.930
between peripersonal space
and extra personal space.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.039
Peripersonal space, is
all the space, literally,

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:59.510
that's within inside your body,

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.790
the surface of your skin and
in your immediate environment.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.460
Peripersonal space, is a
key concept in neuroscience

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.107
because you have
particular neural circuits

00:31:08.107 --> 00:31:10.050
and particular chemicals,

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.440
that are geared toward,

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.070
what are called consummatory
behaviors, meaning,

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.840
using things and consuming
things and enjoying things,

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.870
that are in your immediate
peripersonal space.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.880
Let me give you an example
of this for myself,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.090
just to make it concrete.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.980
You can imagine similar
examples for yourself right now.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.980
Within my current peripersonal
space, is my interoception,

00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:34.440
my understanding or perception
of my internal body.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.110
So, how quickly I'm
breathing, my heart rate,

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.960
the feelings on the surface
of my skin, et cetera.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.420
But also, within the confines
of my peripersonal space,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.340
is this coffee mug,

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.930
that if you're listening to
this, you can't see this,

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.710
but I'm lifting up a coffee mug,

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.040
I'm going to take a sip of coffee.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.280
That's a consummatory
behavior, I have the coffee,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.080
I don't have to do much or
motivate much to get it.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.447
I have other things here,
pens and computer, et cetera.

00:31:57.447 --> 00:31:59.930
So things in your peripersonal space

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.622
and consuming those things,

00:32:01.622 --> 00:32:04.576
is generally governed by
a set of neurochemicals,

00:32:04.576 --> 00:32:08.280
that center around the
neuromodulator serotonin.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.550
And there are a few others as well,

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.933
things like oxytocin,
but mainly serotonin.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.110
Contrast that, with the
so-called, extra personal space.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.580
Extrapersonal space is everything

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.430
beyond the confines of my reach.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.150
It would be something in the next room.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.830
It will be something down the street.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.614
It will be something
at some other location,

00:32:25.614 --> 00:32:27.663
in space and time.

00:32:27.663 --> 00:32:30.720
And the neuromodulators
and neurochemicals,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.880
that are associated with
any kind of thinking about,

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.030
anything in the extra personal space,

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.460
are distinct from the
neurochemicals and neuromodulators,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.550
that are involved in thinking
about or making actions

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.750
towards the peripersonal space.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.030
And the molecule that's most
associated with thinking about

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.300
or orienting toward the
extra personal space,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.300
again, things beyond
the confines of my skin

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.000
or your skin, is dopamine.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.820
And this is a vitally important
concept to understand,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.043
when you're setting
goals and seeking goals.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.820
If we are to be good at goal seeking,

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.620
if we are to be good at setting
goals and assessing goals,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.840
if we are to achieve our goals,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.910
we have to be able to
toggle back and forth

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.480
between a clear understanding
of our peripersonal space,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.270
what we have and how we feel
in the immediate present.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:26.020
And our ability to
understand what's out there

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.200
in the extra personal space

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.860
and our ability to move into
that extra personal space.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.760
And a simple way to conceive of all this,

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.760
is that we evaluate our progress
in the peripersonal space.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.282
We evaluate how we feel,
about some pursuit,

00:33:42.282 --> 00:33:45.250
even if we haven't
initiated that pursuit yet.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.470
How we feel about a particular goal,

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.160
is truly a feeling that we
experience in the here and now,

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.060
even though the goal is in the future.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.670
If we are going to
evaluate whether or not,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.450
we made progress today
or yesterday or not,

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.800
that's an evaluation of how we feel

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.223
in the immediate peripersonal space.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.980
However, moving toward any goal,

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.200
involves orienting our thinking

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.083
towards the extra personal space.

00:34:12.774 --> 00:34:13.730
And as we go through today's episode,

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.370
I'm going to teach you a technique

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.690
or rather a neuroscience-based tool,

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.040
that will allow you to continually
transition back and forth

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.590
between the peripersonal space
and the extra personal space

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:28.280
in a way that will allow
you to update and evaluate

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.543
and better execute your goal seeking.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.050
The whole principle behind
this, is that human beings,

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.700
like other animals,
have to make evaluations

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.550
about whether or not they
are on the right track.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.500
However, the important
thing to understand,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.105
is that humans in particular can do this

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:47.140
over different timescales.

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.160
We don't just pursue food
'cause we are hungry,

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.240
we pursue food, excuse
me, for a particular meal,

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.700
that we might be having
with people tomorrow.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.290
We can modulate the timescale

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.070
in a way that other animals don't.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.950
That's how we adjust our goal seeking,

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.430
to different timescales.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.400
And in addition to that,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.210
humans are exquisitely good
at biasing our behavior

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.040
toward particular goals over
very long periods of time.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.810
But there are a lot of mistakes out there,

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.320
in fact, things that are
outright wrong in the literature

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.590
and in particular, in the internet,

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.470
and then the kind of wellness and fitness

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.830
and cognitive fitness space,

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.570
that send people down the wrong path

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.170
and those things we will
talk about in a few minutes.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.330
But things like visualization,
that visualization

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.010
and visualization of this big goal,

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.290
is the best way to achieve your goals.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.210
In fact, that's not the case,

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.890
there's a much approach to doing all this.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.550
So now I'd like to shift gears

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.500
towards talking about a few of the things,

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.680
that most people get badly wrong

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.720
in setting and assessing
and executing goals.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.870
This is based on peer reviewed research,

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.460
so I think it's very solid.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.980
I know it is very solid.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.600
And it runs counter to what
many of us have been taught.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.070
Let's start with a simple one.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.740
We've all heard that multitasking is bad.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.380
We've heard multitasking is
bad, it doesn't allow for focus.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.530
If you want to achieve anything,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.870
if you want to accomplish
anything, you should not multitask.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.040
Well, it turns out, that's wrong.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.370
It turns out that there is
a role for multitasking,

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:18.550
but the multitasking has to
be placed at a particular time

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.270
within your goal seeking behavior

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.245
in order to be effective.

00:36:23.245 --> 00:36:27.550
Really nice studies done at
Carnegie Mellon University,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.210
and the Davis Lab,

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.940
evaluated how long
people are able to focus

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.310
in different environments.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.900
How long they were able to stay
concentrated on their work.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.830
And it turns out that
number is exceedingly low.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.570
It turns out that most people,

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.390
whether or not they're doing computer work

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.130
or whether or not they're doing writing

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.220
or accounting work or
anything of that sort,

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.990
can hold their attention for
about three minutes at a time

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.310
before they shift their attention off.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.490
And that's ridiculously
low when you first hear it,

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.900
but, that probably reflects a
basic state of brain function.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.820
That hearkens back to a time
when we were hunter gatherers,

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.880
I doubt that we were maintaining
focus solidly for hours

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.713
and hours and hours,

00:37:06.713 --> 00:37:08.510
unless we were under
some particular threat

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.930
or in some particular crisis.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.270
Rather, you could imagine
that people collected seeds

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.690
and nuts and berries
for about three minutes

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.030
and then probably stood up, looked around

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.863
and then kept going.

00:37:16.863 --> 00:37:19.170
Or that they were hunting animals

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.810
or in some sort of pursuit,
fishing, et cetera,

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.250
and focused, focused, focused

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.940
and every three minutes or
so, they might've looked up

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.510
and, you know, take a look at the sky

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.080
or looked around to make sure
that other people were there

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.600
or not there, et cetera.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.270
It all stands to reason
that that will be the case.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.690
Again, the neural circuits
haven't evolved much.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.340
Now, multitasking, has been shown

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.430
to have a very interesting
physiological signature,

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.480
when we multitask,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.360
when we jump back and
forth between things,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.140
there is an increase in the
level of the neurotransmitter,

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.930
also sometimes called a neuromodulator,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.270
but basically same thing
for sake of this discussion.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.630
There's an increase in the
neurotransmitter epinephrine,

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.090
which is adrenaline.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.470
And so, there are really nice studies now,

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:03.460
pointing the fact that doing
a bit of multitasking prior,

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.190
to jumping into some focused,
goal directed behavior,

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.100
whether or not it's mental
behavior or physical behavior,

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.540
can actually be useful

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.570
because it gets us into action.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.970
So we've all been told that
multitasking is terrible,

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.940
but if you, for instance,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.400
find yourself cleaning up your house

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.290
and also checking your phone
and doing a number of things,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.120
right at the point where you
should be sitting down to write

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.650
or do some focused work.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.050
It probably reflects
some adaptive mechanism,

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:29.810
where you use action and somewhat
varied multitasking action

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.860
in order to generate
adrenaline in your system,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.490
because adrenaline just
gets you in the action.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.680
Now, that's great,

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.530
but, you don't want to multitask

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.090
throughout any kind of goal seeking

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.020
or goal pursuit behavior.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.250
Because, what's also very clear

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:47.950
and we're going to talk about
this in exquisite depth today,

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.860
is that visual focus

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.210
and in particular contracting
your visual window,

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.580
bringing the aperture of what
you see, to a very fine point,

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.400
can absolutely increase
your clarity of goal seeking

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.660
and the likelihood that
you will pursue your goals.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.720
I've talked about this a little
bit before on the podcast

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.970
as a way of increasing focus
for any kind of pursuit.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.170
I've talked about a practice,

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.030
whereby you can literally
look at a dot or a line,

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.310
placed on a wall or on your
computer in front of you

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.450
for 30 to 60 seconds,

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.850
and then moving into some dedicated work,

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:22.750
where you need to focus.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.350
And indeed, just looking at a narrow piece

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.680
of the visual world, a small
piece of the visual world

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.513
for some period of time

00:39:28.513 --> 00:39:31.400
and forcing yourself to hold
that gaze on that location

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.950
as best you can,

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.480
can increase your level
of cognitive attention

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.240
and your ability to
focus and stay focused.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.830
And this is not magic.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.160
It is the consequence of the fact,

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.130
that most of your cognition
follows your visual perception.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.040
For those of you that are
low vision or no vision,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.348
meaning you're blind, or
you have trouble seeing,

00:39:49.348 --> 00:39:52.350
my lab does a lot of work with people,

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.120
who are low vision, no vision.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.590
They tend to use their
auditory system, their hearing,

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.350
as a way to anchor their
attention to particular things.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.420
But most people out there
can see and see pretty well

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.920
and visual focus is the way to do that.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.850
Now, earlier, we were
talking about this notion

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:13.440
of peripersonal space
versus extra personal space.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.210
And I'm just going to seed a little bit

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.010
of the later conversation by saying,

00:40:18.134 --> 00:40:20.880
that when we focus on an external point.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.427
We are in a process of exteroception,

00:40:22.427 --> 00:40:25.570
is the focus on the extra personal space,

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.663
not the peripersonal space.

00:40:29.038 --> 00:40:32.120
So when we focus on something,
say a line on the wall

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.280
for 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.330
for 30 to 60 seconds and just look at it

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.850
and then move into any kind of action,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.370
whether or not it's work
action or physical action.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.640
We are at its very core.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.840
We are engaging in this pursuit
of extra personal space.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.240
We are placing our focus outside our body

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.310
and therefore we are placing the brain

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:53.143
into goal pursuit mode.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.720
Work at NYU, in particular,
in the laboratory

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.040
of a phenomenal researcher in
their Psychology Department,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.470
by the name of Emily
Balcetis, B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.850
Emily Balcetis, has done
really nice work on this.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.460
They've done is, they've had,

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.550
people focus their visual attention

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.580
on a goal line of some sort

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.600
and then to engage in
some sort of behavior,

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.900
that requires a lot of effort.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.310
And they've done a lot of
different experiments like this,

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.620
but I'll just explain one.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.280
They always include a control group,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.460
where people have to go through
the same physical effort

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.580
or mental effort,

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.883
but they don't focus their
attention just on one location.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.730
The long and short of
these studies is that,

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.940
when people have to focus their
attention on one location,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.300
like a goal line,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.060
they are much more effective
in reaching those goals

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.110
and they achieve them with the perception,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.070
that they expended less effort.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:49.620
I'll give you an example of
one particularly nice study

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.990
from the Balcetis Lab.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.090
So this particular study
involves, physical exercise.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.060
Although, as I mentioned before,

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:58.480
they've done similar studies
looking at cognitive type work.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.305
And what they did is they
had a group of people,

00:42:01.305 --> 00:42:05.400
exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle weights,

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.640
and they had to basically
move a certain distance

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.310
or run a certain distance
to reach a goal line.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.560
One group was focused on the goal line,

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.310
visually focused, on the goal line.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.790
The other group was not
told to visually focus

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.730
on the goal line.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.520
And what they found, was
that the group that focused

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.020
on the goal line, was able
to achieve reaching that goal

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.600
with 17% less effort.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.160
They measured effort and
they got there 23% quicker.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.090
That's a remarkable difference.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.850
So same distance traveled,
with same workload

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.300
because everyone's wearing
the same 15 pound weights

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.160
on their ankles.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.440
One group is simply
looking at the goal line,

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.720
the other group is not told
to look at the goal line,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.660
simply by looking at the goal line,

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.370
does something to the psychology

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.660
and end physiology of these people,

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.340
that allows them to move forward

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.400
with less perceived effort
and to do it more quickly.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.879
That's remarkable.

00:42:59.879 --> 00:43:02.150
And in this case, they're
focused on the goal line,

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.180
but in a few moments,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.050
we'll talk about how one can
use updating of goal line,

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.180
so incremental goal line.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.880
Starting with an intermediate goal,

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.200
and then extending the goal
line further and further.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.450
But just sit back for a
second and think about that,

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.900
just by changing where a person looks,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.070
they changed their perceived effort

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.880
and their ability to do
something, more effectively,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.130
more quickly, than a group that
is not deliberately focusing

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.380
their visual attention on one location.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.380
That's incredible.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.820
And it's so incredible,
in fact, you might say,

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.900
well, how could that possibly be?

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.190
Well, it turns out, it
has a very specific,

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.180
underlying physiological reason

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.040
and that has to do with changes

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.090
in our so-called,
autonomic nervous system.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.150
The aspects of our nervous system,

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.820
that prepare us for readiness and action,

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.320
or that prepare us for
resting and relaxing.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.580
So what is special about
focusing one's visual attention

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.320
at a given location?

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.010
Well, it turns out that
we have two branches

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:57.920
of our visual system.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.730
So visual information all
comes in through our eyes,

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.480
but then it can head down
two different pathways.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.530
One pathway is engaged
when our vision is brought

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:07.363
to a common point,

00:44:07.363 --> 00:44:08.760
what we call, a vergence eye movement.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.400
So if we're focusing very
intensely on a given point,

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.510
regardless of how far away
from us that point is,

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.670
our visual system engages
a certain set of neurons,

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:21.530
neural circuits that are
involved in resolving fine detail

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.590
and that can evaluate small changes

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:24.920
over small periods of time.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.540
Just think of it as a very detailed camera

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.373
of the visual world.

00:44:28.373 --> 00:44:30.220
It tends to be very restricted.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.290
The other pathway through
the visual system,

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.950
is the so-called, magnocellular pathway.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.520
And this is a pathway that's involved

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.220
in taking in global information
about lots of things,

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.990
that are happening around us.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.230
Movement of things to our right,

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.490
movement of things to our left,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.750
things are happening down on
the ground and all around us.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:49.710
And that pathway involves a
sort of relaxation, if you will,

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.610
of the neural circuits that are associated

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:52.950
with alertness and attention.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:53.920
When you walk down the street

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.860
and you're not thinking about much,

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.470
provided you're not looking at your phone,

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.600
you're not focusing on one location,

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.670
you're more or less in a relaxed state,

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.800
compared to when you're
looking for a particular sign,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.730
you're looking for a bus
or a train that's coming,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.730
or a particular person.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.800
And that should inherently make sense,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.030
when your level of attention
and alertness goes up,

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:11.700
there's sort of a small,

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.190
but perceptible increase
in your level of arousal.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.060
It's not really stress necessarily,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.230
but arousal of alertness.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.690
And it turns out that the visual system,

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:24.460
accomplishes this increase
in alertness by communicating

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.320
with your circulatory system

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.560
and the system that
delivers blood and nutrients

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.130
and oxygen to the rest of
the tissues in your body.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.840
So let's talk for a second
about what focusing our vision

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.210
on a particular location does

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.140
because in this study
from the Balcetis Lab,

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.620
what they found was, focusing
on a goal line allows people,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.560
to move more effectively toward that goal.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.910
This is something you can
leverage in all aspects

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.120
of all goal pursuits.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.710
What happens when we focus
on a particular location?

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:50.760
Believe it or not,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.910
there's an increase in
a particular feature

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.700
of our blood pressure.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.570
Now your body has, of course, arteries,

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.860
veins and capillaries,

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.720
and your heart pumps blood,
first to the arteries,

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.530
and then to the other components
of your vascular system.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.970
And we have so-called, blood pressure.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.500
Blood pressure is just how much,

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.870
the fluid volume is
pressing on those arteries,

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:12.400
veins and capillaries.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.870
So you can imagine a pipe
with very little fluid moving

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.030
through it, that's low pressure.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.370
You have a pipe with a lot
of fluid moving through it,

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:19.300
that's even more pressure.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.810
You have a pipe with a lot
of very viscous, meaning,

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.240
very kind of sticky, thick
stuff, moving forward,

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.590
that's even more pressure.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.670
We have blood pressure

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.610
and you've probably had your
blood pressure measured.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.040
There's always two numbers.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.760
You have a top number, which
is the systolic blood pressure.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.110
And then there's the bottom
number, below the line,

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:37.240
which is the diastolic pressure.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.530
So the important thing to understand,

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.360
is that your blood pressure
will rise when your heart beats,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.910
because there's more fluid
moving through those pipes

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:46.200
that are your arteries or
veins and your capillaries.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.010
And that top number is called the systole

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.780
or the systolic blood pressure,

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.890
because that's the pressure at the time,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.893
when your heart contracts.

00:46:54.893 --> 00:46:57.360
So the top number, which normally,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.700
if you have a healthy blood pressure,

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.010
is somewhere in the range
of 90 to 120 millimeters

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:03.710
of mercury. Millimeters of
mercury is just the way,

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.840
that pressure is measured.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.913
That top number, your systole,

00:47:06.913 --> 00:47:08.650
or your systolic blood pressure,

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.451
is what's measured when
the heart contracts.

00:47:11.451 --> 00:47:15.240
So, that's the amount of
pressure when there's a heartbeat

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.030
and it's moving through your vasculature.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.653
Now, between beats, the
heartbeats, but then it relaxes,

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.050
your blood pressure is going
to drop to a lower value

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:27.100
because fluid isn't being
pumped through the system

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.100
at those moments.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.370
And that's the bottom,
the diastolic pressure.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:32.670
And typically for healthy people,

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:35.720
that's going to be 60 to
80 millimeters of mercury.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.770
So you might hear about a normal
blood pressure being about,

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.810
again, this is an
approximate, 120 over 80.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:42.930
What that means is,

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.610
at the point where blood was
being pumped through there,

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.630
your arteries and veins, boom,

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.870
that it's 120 millimeters of mercury,

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:53.250
but then, when the heart
relaxes for a second

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:57.380
before the next beat, then it drops to 80.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.990
So there's high pressure, low pressure,

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.280
high pressure, low pressure.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.210
The fluid is being pumped
through the system.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.440
Now, why am I telling you all this?

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.200
Well, it turns out, that
there are neural circuits

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.670
that link your visual system

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.190
and focusing on a particular
point with that top number,

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.710
the systolic blood pressure.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.621
And when you focus your eyes
on a particular location,

00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:20.350
that systolic blood pressure goes up,

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.020
and there are some other systems

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.350
that are coordinated with
it in your brain and body,

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:25.917
that start releasing adrenaline,

00:48:25.917 --> 00:48:28.720
low amounts of adrenaline in most cases.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.080
And that adrenaline, further
readies your body for action.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.718
So, bringing our visual focus
to a particular location,

00:48:35.718 --> 00:48:38.070
does a number of things to the brain

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.950
and the whole system of
the body, to prepare it,

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.550
to place it into a state of readiness

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.180
that makes us more likely
to lean into our goals

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.630
into action. And if we step
back and think about this,

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.120
this makes perfect sense.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.660
The brain and body need to be coordinated.

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:54.310
We can't just think about a goal.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.690
In fact, a deer or a lion,
can't just think about a goal.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:01.980
It has to think about a goal
and then has to feel some sort

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.430
of activation energy,

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.220
some willingness or desire to move forward

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.700
in pursuit of that goal.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.520
So imagining a goal, has to be coupled

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.170
to the physical pursuit of the goal.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.020
So our visual system in a beautiful way,

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.070
brings together a focus, literally,

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.147
a visual focus on a
particular point outside us.

00:49:21.147 --> 00:49:25.060
Then it recruits an increase
in systolic blood pressure,

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.130
which creates a systemic, a body-wide

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.850
and brain-wide increase
in fuel utilization,

00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:31.923
in oxygen availability,

00:49:31.923 --> 00:49:35.130
in our willingness to
move forward as a body,

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.020
as a whole coherent system.

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.380
And then there are also
neurotransmitter systems,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.870
like epinephrine, as we
will soon see dopamine,

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:44.270
that get recruited as well

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.083
to place us into a
continual mode of action.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:52.010
This to me is a remarkable
feature of our physiology

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:53.630
and it gets right to the point

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.670
of some of the psychological phenomenon

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:56.930
that we were talking about earlier.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:58.370
Let's just recall what some of those are.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:59.203
I won't list them all,

00:49:59.203 --> 00:50:02.430
but, a goal has to be
significant, they say.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.610
All the psychologists, all
the popular stuff online says,

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:05.700
it has to be significant,

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.450
has to be inspirational

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.260
and has to be action oriented.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.550
So let's say you look
out into the landscape

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.900
of what's available to you,

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.270
whether or not it's just in your mind,

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.192
or you look at a specific point, you say,

00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:18.630
I want to go to that
particular restaurant,

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.050
to eat that particular food.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.220
And you orient towards it
and you move towards it.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.840
This is the way that your brain and body,

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.547
are coordinating their actions together.

00:50:26.547 --> 00:50:29.427
Conversely, when our visual system,

00:50:29.427 --> 00:50:31.780
is in a mode of looking at everything.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.533
When the aperture of our
visual system is very broad,

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.870
we know that there's also a reduction

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.270
in our goal directed behavior

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:42.300
and a reduction in the
systolic blood pressure.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.840
It's as if our peripersonal
space is sufficient,

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.920
we don't need to get
beyond our current state.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.240
We're not oriented toward
any one thing in particular.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.360
So I've now described
some of the psychology

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.470
and some of the underlying physiology.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.880
Now, I'd like to mesh
this within the context

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.600
of actual specific goal
setting and goal pursuit.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.600
Because what many of you
are probably thinking is,

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.410
well, that's some physiology,
there's some psychology,

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:07.350
but how do you actually apply this

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.120
towards setting and achieving goals?

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.630
Well, you do that, by understanding
that your mental frame

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.950
and your attention are
always either positioned,

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:18.610
to your peripersonal space,

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:22.190
focused on your immediate
possessions and state,

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.970
or towards things outside you.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.390
But then you also have the ability,

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:27.750
to dynamically travel back
and forth between those.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:28.960
And so next, we're going to talk about,

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.160
what the literature says about
things like visualization,

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.390
immediate and intermediate goals,

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.940
long-term goals and how
to best achieve those.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.350
And then we're going to move specifically

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:40.100
into the protocols that you can use.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.060
It's a protocol that I've
specifically developed

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.640
for you, the listeners,

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.320
in order to incorporate all
the signs into a best practice,

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.735
that you can do any time, any place,

00:51:48.735 --> 00:51:50.956
to really identify what
it is specifically,

00:51:50.956 --> 00:51:52.870
that you want to pursue

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:55.490
and the best route to pursue
and achieve that goal.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.610
Focusing our visual attention
on one particular point,

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.780
is incredibly effective for
all types of goal pursuit.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.020
And if you'd like to read
some of the scientific studies

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.810
or read a review of
the scientific studies,

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.910
that have looked at how,
narrowing one's visual attention,

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:13.600
can really enhance the
effectiveness of pursuing goals,

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.910
I'll put a link to this study.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.850
The title of the study is,
keeping the goal in sight,

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.370
testing the influence of
narrowed visual attention

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.750
on physical activity.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:24.980
And this is a paper from
Emily Balcetis's Lab,

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.810
focuses mainly on physical activities,

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.680
but it mentioned some
other things as well.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.618
This is an article published in

00:52:30.618 --> 00:52:33.255
Personality and Social
Psychology Bulletin in 2020,

00:52:33.255 --> 00:52:34.960
so it's recent.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.470
It's an exceptional paper in my opinion,

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:39.437
really gets to the heart
of how all this works

00:52:39.437 --> 00:52:41.820
and some of the examples of
where it's been implemented.

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:45.090
So let's apply this visual
tool, in a very simple way,

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:47.513
to any type of goal
that you want to pursue.

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.170
If you already know what
goal you want to pursue,

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.050
maybe it's a workout,

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.770
maybe it's a cognitive work
of some particular sort.

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.430
Again, the process is very simple.

00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:59.420
You're going to focus your
visual attention on one point

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.280
beyond your peripersonal space,

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.453
so it could be on your computer.
It could be on the wall,

00:53:03.453 --> 00:53:04.720
it could be a horizon.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.070
It could be at a distance

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.300
and you're going to focus
your visual attention there.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.600
And with some effort you're going
to hold your visual attention

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.130
for 30 to 60 seconds, you
might blink, that's okay,

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:14.963
but you're going to try

00:53:14.963 --> 00:53:16.100
and hold your visual attention there.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.790
So no moving your head around.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:19.790
No diverting your attention
to other locations.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:21.340
Some people will find it very easy to do.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.070
Other people will find it quite hard.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.700
Your mind may drift
cognitively, that's okay,

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.480
but try and bring your visual attention

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.653
to that common point.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.710
Several episodes ago, I talked about how,

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.970
there are actually studies
looking at developing this kind

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.360
of training in students, for ADHD

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.750
and the data on that are
actually quite encouraging.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.250
So for people who have ADHD

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.490
and focus issues and attentional issues,

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:43.370
this can be effective.

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:46.300
For people who don't, this
can also be effective.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.260
Again, it places your brain and body

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.460
into a state of readiness

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.510
and then the idea is to move
into the particular actions,

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.280
that bring you closer to your goal.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.270
We haven't yet talked
about how to set goals

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:57.470
and how to assess progress.

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.570
This is simply how to pursue goals.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.910
But the visual component is important,

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:05.790
in fact, I would argue
that the visual system

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:08.330
and harnessing your visual
attention to a narrow point,

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:09.891
is going to be the most effective way,

00:54:09.891 --> 00:54:12.740
to get your brain and body
into a mode of action,

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.850
to pursue whatever goal it
is you're trying to pursue.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.780
That practice is in stark
contrast to multitasking,

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.960
where by definition
your attention is moving

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.700
from place to place to place.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.800
I mentioned that
multitasking can be effective

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.670
in getting your system into somewhat

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:29.110
of an increased level of activation,

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:30.900
so that you can pursue
a more focused goal.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.220
But the visual attention
to a particular point,

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.600
is going to be the most effective
way to bring your system

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.210
into a state of readiness
and action for goal pursuit.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:39.860
There's another really interesting way,

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.395
that you can leverage your visual system

00:54:41.395 --> 00:54:43.653
toward long-term goals.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:46.430
The Balcetis Lab has also done,

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:47.900
some really interesting experiments,

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.650
looking at people's ability to set

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.300
and stick to long-term goals.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.630
And the long-term goal
that they looked at,

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.630
was one related to saving
money for later in life.

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:00.420
This is something that a
lot of people struggle with,

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.450
a lot of people have a
hard time investing money

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:04.130
or saving money for later in life.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.200
Simply because as human beings,

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.860
we vary in the extent to which we worry

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.840
about what's going to happen later.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.450
There's also a phenomenon of
so-called, delay discounting.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:17.210
Delay discounting, is the fact that goals,

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:20.100
become less rewarding when
they exist further out

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.320
in the future.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.490
You may have experienced this
walking past a donut shop.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:24.330
I love donuts

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.090
I'm just going to admit it,
over and over again on the spot.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:27.970
I love the smell of them.
I love the taste of them.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:28.803
I try to eat them

00:55:28.803 --> 00:55:30.167
'cause I'm told they're
not that good for me

00:55:30.167 --> 00:55:32.330
and indeed, I don't think they are.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:35.100
I occasionally cave and
I'll eat one or many.

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.320
But in general,

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.120
I try not to cave to the
immediately rewarding properties

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.890
of the smell and the taste of the donut.

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.520
But, what we know is
that if you smell a donut

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.990
or you smell a wonderful piece of food,

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.950
in the immediate term, it
brings your level of focus,

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:54.600
your mental focus to the immediate phase.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.960
And it feels very rewarding,

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.620
like if you had it now,
it would just be so good.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.500
But if you actually extend
that reward out to tomorrow

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.684
or the next thing you think,

00:56:02.684 --> 00:56:05.610
today happens to be a
Saturday, that we're recording,

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:08.500
but, on Tuesday morning,
I'm going to get a donut.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.810
It doesn't have the same value
because the reward system,

00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:15.680
doesn't work as well for long-term goals.

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.220
It's not as salient.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.980
It's not as tangible, a goal,

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.600
especially for something like a donut.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.550
Whereas the kinds of goals that work,

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:24.360
when you place them out to the longer term

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.420
and can create a heightened
sense of motivation,

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.640
tend to be things that are
much more rewarding to us.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.360
So delay discounting simply says that,

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.930
the further out in time
that a given goal is,

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.420
the less effective that reward will be

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.010
in motivating one's behavior.

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:39.750
And indeed you see this with
saving money for retirement,

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.363
you see this with all sorts
of long-term investment,

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.170
The Balcetis Lab, therefore
did an experiment,

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.714
where they looked at people's tendency

00:56:48.714 --> 00:56:52.220
to save money for later in life.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.790
But the groups that they
created in this study,

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:55.623
were really interesting.

00:56:55.623 --> 00:56:56.460
They had one group,

00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.766
imagine, what it would be like
to be 30 or 40 years older.

00:57:00.766 --> 00:57:03.880
And then to invest a
certain amount of money,

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.640
according to whatever it is they thought

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.473
that they would need.

00:57:06.473 --> 00:57:07.450
And they measured the amount

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:09.240
that they had set aside and saved

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.013
for later in life.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.550
The other group, actually
viewed photos of themselves,

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:17.520
so picture, images of themselves

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.930
that were artificially, digitally aged,

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:23.580
so that they could see
themselves 30 or 40 years

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.060
into the future.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:25.893
And it turns out

00:57:25.893 --> 00:57:27.570
that people in that second group,

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:32.470
simply by perceiving their
own image, in the future,

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:35.950
invested far more money into later life.

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.010
They set aside more money.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:38.500
Somehow it bridged the gap

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.530
between their immediate experience of life

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:42.680
and the longer arc

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.660
toward what it was going to
be like in 30 or 40 years.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.700
So very powerful result in my opinion,

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.190
because what it says again,

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.930
is that our visual
perception of the future

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.520
or our visual perception of the present,

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.520
is what allows us to anchor
our goal directed systems

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.343
and our motivation to take on things

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:03.230
that in the immediate term
might not seem that useful.

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:06.500
So, you can imagine all
sorts of variations on this.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.700
You can imagine that
every time I want a donut,

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.380
I'd see a vision of myself

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.415
or an actual physical picture of myself

00:58:13.415 --> 00:58:17.070
as a consequence of having
eaten many donuts every day

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:18.229
for the next 10 years.

00:58:18.229 --> 00:58:19.240
I don't know what that
image would look like

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.240
'cause I've never seen it.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.200
That's not an experiment

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.491
that I necessarily need to do

00:58:23.491 --> 00:58:25.620
because I'm not that
motivated to eat donuts,

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.840
but I have to confess, I am somebody

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.370
who I think I'm pretty
good at managing resources.

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:35.510
But I think if I were to see
an image of myself at 70 or 75,

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:36.343
there's so many things

00:58:36.343 --> 00:58:37.670
that are associated with visual images.

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:39.440
Like what our body must feel like,

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.730
what our needs are
probably going to be like

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:43.960
in that state or in that age.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.180
What sorts of things we may

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.810
or may not still be
able to do at that age.

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:49.120
And that anchors back

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.830
to immediate goal-directed behaviors,

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:52.860
such as setting aside
money for retirement.

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.419
Such as investing in
one's health practices.

00:58:56.419 --> 00:58:57.252
And indeed there's a study

00:58:57.252 --> 00:58:59.160
that has looked at how people will invest

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.093
in exercise and healthy eating.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.270
If they just think about the future

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.740
and what they might be like in the future

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.610
versus seeing images of
themselves in the future,

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:12.460
if they were to go down a
healthy or unhealthy route.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:13.690
So again, the point is

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:16.580
that the visual system, what we see,

00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.790
is principally important

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.930
in defining what we do
in the immediate term.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.560
Even if what we see relates to something

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.610
in the far off distance.

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:26.120
I think these are phenomenal studies

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.330
and they get right down
to an important issue

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.270
that's been kicked around

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:31.380
over and over in the literature

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.860
and in the discussion about goal seeking,

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.470
which is visualization.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.840
We here keep the big goal in mind,

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.430
focus on the big goal.

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:39.710
So now we're going to address,

00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:40.800
what does the science say

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.530
about visualizing big goals?

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:45.360
If you're somebody who's
interested in business,

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.550
or let's say you're
focused on relationship,

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.900
is thinking about the perfect relationship

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.990
and what that would look like

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:52.730
and the family that you would have

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:53.640
and where you would live.

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.970
Is that effective in generating the kinds

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:57.510
of behaviors that will lead you to that?

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:58.670
Is it effective to think

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.770
about the big win at the end?

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:02.650
Well, it turns out it is,

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.290
but you have to be very, very careful

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:07.060
with when and how you
implement that visualization.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.640
'Cause if you do it correctly,

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.710
it can really serve
your goal seeking well.

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:12.180
And if you do it incorrectly,

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.570
it can undermine the entire process.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:17.090
So, does visualization work?

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.530
Well, turns out,

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:22.010
that visualization of the
big win, the end goal.

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:23.523
So the Superbowl win

01:00:23.523 --> 01:00:26.520
or eight gold medals in the Olympics

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.060
or graduation from the
university of your choice

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.440
or making a certain amount of money

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.750
or finding the partner of
your choice, et cetera.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.120
That visualization is effective

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.400
in getting the goal
pursuit process started,

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.720
but it actually is a pretty lousy

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.810
and maybe even counterproductive way

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:48.080
of maintaining pursuit of that goal.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.330
Meaning continuing to
engage the sort of actions

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:54.220
that are going to get you to
eventually achieve that goal.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:57.470
I think this is going to be
surprising to people, at first,

01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:00.170
but if we think back to our discussion

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:03.180
about the physiology of
the blood pressure system,

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.993
it'll make sense.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.727
Good scientific studies have been done

01:01:08.727 --> 01:01:11.840
where people are told to imagine,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.200
or even script out

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.480
their long-term vision
and goal for themselves.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.857
What is the big goal?

01:01:16.857 --> 01:01:18.280
And they're talked to,

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.300
or told to imagine it with
a rich amount of detail.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.530
To think about how it's going to feel

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.200
in their body and the big win.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.910
And basically what happens is,

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:27.270
if you measure people's blood pressure

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.020
or other metrics of physiology,

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.390
you see an increase in that
systolic blood pressure.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:34.235
There's an kind of a
ramping up of the readiness

01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:36.940
and excitement for that goal,

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:40.140
but that increase in blood
pressure quickly wanes.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.580
And over time,

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.820
that visual of the long-term goal,

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.730
becomes a poor thing

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:49.369
to rely on in order to
generate the actions

01:01:49.369 --> 01:01:52.120
that are required to reach that goal.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.280
In fact, there's a much better way

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.730
to maintain ongoing action toward a goal

01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:00.150
that also involves visualization,

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.560
but it turns out it's not
about visualizing success.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.700
It's about visualizing failure.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.050
The Balcetis Lab and other labs

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.850
have looked at whether or
not people make progress

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:13.270
toward goals of different types.

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:16.060
Whether or not they're
thinking about the goal.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.380
They're thinking about that goal line

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.770
and what they want to achieve,

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:19.780
that long-term goal

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.960
and all the wonderful
things associated with it,

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.270
or whether or not they're thinking

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:25.113
about all the ways in
which they could fail,

01:02:25.113 --> 01:02:27.302
en route to that goal.

01:02:27.302 --> 01:02:30.630
This is not typically what
we are encouraged to do.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.900
Typically, we are told
don't imagine failure,

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.320
push failure out of your mind,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.230
only focus on success.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.340
Fake it till you make it,

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.650
or is a phrase that I
absolutely hate, frankly,

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.460
because it's not even
clear what that means.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.490
And it's not even clear

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:44.170
what the ethical form of that is.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:46.990
I think it means continue
despite any anxiety

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:48.720
or fear that things won't work out.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.590
But if you look at the literature,

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:52.260
the scientific literature,

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.210
what the Balcetis Lab and
other labs have shown,

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.760
is that there's a near
doubling, near doubling

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.830
in the probability of reaching one's goal,

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:05.830
if you focus routinely
on foreshadowing failure.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:09.250
You think about the ways
in which things could fail,

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.310
if you take action A or you take action B

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.500
and instead, therefore, you take action C.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.333
You're supposed to think

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.810
about how things could fail,

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:19.040
if you don't get up and run each morning,

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.740
if your goal is, say a fitness goal.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.500
So let's use that as an example,

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.030
because even though I realized,

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.869
people are in pursuit of many
things, not just fitness.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.430
Fitness goals and physical
goals are a very concrete thing

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:31.800
that we can all get on the same page about

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.890
'cause they're related to actions.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:36.610
Let's say, somebody sets a goal

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:40.320
of running five miles,
four times a week, minimum,

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.310
and as many as seven,
four times a week, minimum

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:43.660
before 8:00 AM.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.100
In a previous podcast on habits,

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.410
I talked about the benefits

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:48.282
of not necessarily setting specific times

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:49.390
that one will do things,

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.690
but setting time blocks

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:51.523
that one we'll do things.

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:52.510
So you say before 8:00 AM,

01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:54.330
you're going to run five miles

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.023
and that's going to happen
up to seven days a week.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.710
One version of this would be,

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:00.950
okay, sit back in a chair

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.770
and think about how great
you're going to feel and look,

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:04.830
if you're doing this every day.

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:06.330
How your health is going to improve.

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:07.163
How everything's going to be,

01:04:07.163 --> 01:04:08.830
your blood markers, of lipids, et cetera,

01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.460
are going to improve, okay, fine.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.359
That's the visualization goal

01:04:12.359 --> 01:04:14.870
of visualizing the end point.

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:16.790
It turns out that is far less effective

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.490
and maybe even counterproductive,

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:20.990
compared to thinking about
what's going to happen,

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.760
if you don't do this.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.060
The negative health outcomes
that are going to occur,

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.010
the disappointment you're
going to have in yourself.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.410
The fact that you're
going to wait until 7.30,

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:30.330
that's not long enough

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:32.170
for many people to run five miles.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.965
You got to put on your shoes
as there could be pouring rain

01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:35.798
or even hailing or snowing, outside.

01:04:35.798 --> 01:04:37.560
And now you're not going
outside unless you're somebody

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.300
who's particularly motivated to do that.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.870
So, foreshadowing failure turns out

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.470
to be the best way to
motivate toward goal pursuit.

01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:46.920
In fact, as I mentioned before,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.670
there's a near doubling in the likelihood

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:50.720
that people will reach goals of any kind.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.890
When they're constantly thinking

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:54.500
about how bad it's going
to be, if they fail.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.720
If we think back to the
neural circuit associated

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.090
with assessing value in our goal pursuits,

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:02.100
this makes perfect sense.

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.830
The amygdala, that center of the brain

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:06.330
that's involved in anxiety
and fear and worry.

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:09.400
Well, the amygdala, is one
of the four core components

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.580
of our goal setting and
goal pursuit circuitry.

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.130
And there's no bypassing that.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.750
there is no one listening to this

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.500
or watching this who's
amygdala is not involved

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.240
in their goal setting and
goal pursuit behavior.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.060
And so, while I'd love
to be able to tell you

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.880
that all you should think
about is rainbows and puppies

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.343
and all the wonderful, rewarding things

01:05:27.343 --> 01:05:30.430
that are going to happen
when you achieve your goals.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.760
The truth is, you should
be thinking mainly

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.200
about how bad it's really going to get,

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.033
if you don't do it.

01:05:36.033 --> 01:05:37.870
How disappointed in yourself,
you're going to feel.

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:40.450
How it will negatively impact you,

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:42.560
if not in the immediate
term, in the long-term,

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.030
if indeed your goal is to reach your goal.

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:47.210
So, I want to emphasize

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.410
that I'm not interested
in encouraging people

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:50.580
to flagellate themselves.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.310
I'm encouraging people
to achieve their goals.

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:55.810
And it turns out the best way to do that,

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.560
is by foreshadowing failure.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.010
And the more specific you can get

01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:01.470
by writing down or thinking about

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:02.530
or talking about,

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.810
how bad it will be if you
don't achieve your goals,

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.770
the more likely you are
to achieve those goals.

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:09.432
Part of the reason for that

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.820
almost certainly has to do with increases

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.130
in systolic blood pressure

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.730
and increases in readiness in your system,

01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:16.950
when you imagine failure.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:19.940
The brain and body are much better

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:22.090
at moving away from fearful things

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:23.400
than towards things we want.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.940
I wish I could tell you
that wasn't the case,

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.710
but there is a true asymmetry

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:27.960
in the way we are built.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.300
In fact, the brain and body can engage

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.680
in what's called, one trial learning.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.960
When something bad happens,

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.270
we eat a food that makes us sick.

01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:36.060
We have an interaction
with a person or place

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.460
that we really don't like.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.380
It only takes one trial to really...

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.470
One event, one time to reorient

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:43.840
or rewire our neural circuitry,

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.410
so that we have a bias toward moving away

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:46.810
from that thing in the future.

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:49.300
When things go well, unfortunately,

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.340
that doesn't often occur.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.850
If things go really, really well,

01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.260
it might orient our brain and body

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.540
toward wanting more of that thing.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.210
And we'll have neural circuitry changes

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.520
that will lead us to engage

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.150
in that particular behavior
or interaction again,

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.575
but it is never as effective

01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:04.330
as these avoidance circuits.

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:06.010
So again, foreshadow failure,

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:08.470
if you're going to
visualize in a positive way,

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.640
do that at the very beginning
of some goal pursuit.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.440
Maybe intermittently
every once in a while,

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.990
you imagine the big win

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:15.960
of scoring perfect on exam

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.120
or winning the championship
or the great relationship.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.370
But most of the time,

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.440
if you want to be effective,

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.530
you should be focusing on avoiding failure

01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:23.510
and you should be really clear

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:25.050
about what those failures would look like

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:25.910
and feel like.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:28.210
Now, let's talk about goal setting.

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.120
Going back to that prominent literature,

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.750
the psychology and popular literature,

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.319
again, we can hear some of
these themes start to emerge.

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:38.670
The goal should be
significant, we are told.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.550
It should be inspirational.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.280
It should be aggressive, yet realistic.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.630
Well, okay, that's all fine and good,

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.960
but let's get semi
quantitative about this.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.280
Let's at least get biological about this.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.833
How inspirational does it need to be?

01:07:51.833 --> 01:07:53.130
Does it need to be the kind of thing

01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:54.840
that is so inspiring to me

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.850
that I can't sleep at all?

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:56.683
Well, that wouldn't be good

01:07:56.683 --> 01:07:59.160
because as I believe and I know,

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.510
many of you have heard me
say many, many times before,

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:04.610
regular deep sleep, 80%
or more of the nights

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:05.443
that you go to sleep,

01:08:05.443 --> 01:08:06.670
is going to be crucial to your cognitive

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.010
and mental functioning and your ability

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:09.770
to achieve your goals in the long-term.

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:11.150
That's absolutely clear.

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:13.690
So, it's got to be,
inspirational and exciting,

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.240
but what does that really look like

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.690
and what does that correspond to

01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:18.820
and how do we actually make that happen?

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.650
Well, once again, there is a mismatch

01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:23.280
between what the real data show

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.033
and what we're most often told.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.660
Turns out, that again,
work in Balcetis Lab,

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.960
but also other laboratories,

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.298
has addressed whether
or not the probability

01:08:34.298 --> 01:08:38.780
of achieving a goal, goes up or down,

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.610
depending on whether or not one visualizes

01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:46.610
or sets a goal that is easy,
moderate or impossible.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.410
An impossible goal would
be, for instance, if I say,

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:53.202
I'm going to jump from my front driveway,

01:08:53.202 --> 01:08:55.210
all the way up to the road,

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:56.600
the road's, quite a distance away,

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.660
it's more than 20 meters away.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.600
It's just not going to happen.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.680
It's not going to happen in this lifetime,

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.670
it's not going to happen
in any other lifetime.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.240
Not unless it involves
some elaborate technology

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.270
that I'm not aware of,

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:06.400
a jet pack or something like that.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.857
It's just not going to happen.

01:09:07.857 --> 01:09:11.160
An easy goal would be
something like, can you jump?

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.890
Or could I jump, two feet in
front of me, obviously, yes.

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.500
Now I'm using a trivial example here,

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.540
but this could be translated
to any kind of goal,

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.883
school goal, physical goal, et cetera.

01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:22.240
It turns out that,

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.840
when people set goals,

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.965
whether or not they are nutritional goals,

01:09:25.965 --> 01:09:28.160
eat more of this or eat less of that.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.810
Whether or not they're fitness goals,

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.032
run more, lift more.

01:09:31.032 --> 01:09:33.062
Some other goals, swim less, swim more,

01:09:33.062 --> 01:09:35.480
whatever it is their goal happens to be.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.590
Some learning goal,

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.500
some relationship goal,

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.010
some attempt to modify their behavior.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.610
It turns out that if the goal is too easy,

01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:45.340
it's too within reach,

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.600
it doesn't recruit enough

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.300
of the autonomic nervous system

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.960
to make pursuit of that goal, likely.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.210
Now that might be surprising,

01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:55.760
at least it was surprising
to me, you think,

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.243
well, something is really, really easy.

01:09:57.243 --> 01:09:59.940
there's a very low bar to achieve it.

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.690
People are probably more likely to do it.

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:02.970
But turns out that's not the case,

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:05.030
when we hear that a goal
needs to be inspirational,

01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.950
what do we mean?

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.300
When we hear that something's too easy,

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.930
to recruit our action, what do we mean?

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:12.310
Well, Balcetis Lab measured,
systolic blood pressure,

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:13.143
and found that,

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:16.000
when goals were too easy
for people to attain,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.240
they didn't get that increase
in systolic blood pressure

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.710
and recruitment of the other
neural and vascular systems,

01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:22.740
meaning the blood systems
and the nervous system

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.620
that would place them into ongoing effort.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.020
And so they quickly gave up.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.910
Also, if a goal was too lofty,

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:32.409
if it was too far from
their current abilities,

01:10:32.409 --> 01:10:36.260
it didn't recruit enough
systolic blood pressure.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.410
Even if people could get very excited

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:39.820
about something mentally,

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.890
it simply didn't place their
body into a state of readiness

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.440
because it wasn't tangible

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.580
that they could actually
perhaps really achieve it.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.100
So it turns out that
when goals were moderate,

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.240
when they were just outside
of one's immediate abilities

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.480
or that one felt that yeah,

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.130
that would take a lot of effort.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.129
But it's within range or maybe in range,

01:11:00.129 --> 01:11:03.020
like maybe I can do it, maybe I can't.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.970
Then there was a near doubling

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:08.270
of the systolic blood
pressure in the good sense.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:10.280
It didn't go into the unhealthy range

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.690
and a doubling or more of the likelihood

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:17.040
that they would engage
in the ongoing pursuit

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.440
of that particular goal.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.800
So here we're talking about goal setting.,

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.030
what we're saying is, set
goals that are realistic,

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:26.510
but that aren't so
realistic, that they're easy.

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:29.930
The goals need to be realistic
and truly challenging.

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:33.140
Don't set goals that are
so challenging and so lofty

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:36.520
that they crash that blood pressure system

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.500
in the other direction and make you

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.290
or anyone feel unmotivated.

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:41.640
In hearing this, it makes sense,

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.170
but I don't think I
would have predicted it,

01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:45.760
had they not done this
very controlled study.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.690
I would have thought,

01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:48.870
the loftier the goal, the bigger the goal,

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:51.330
the more that it recruits
the autonomic system

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:52.680
and the more that people are likely,

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.230
to lean into the energy

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:57.060
and effort to pursue and attain that goal.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.100
I also would have thought

01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.780
that if a goal is really easy to achieve,

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.531
that it would engage the systems

01:12:02.531 --> 01:12:05.180
of action in the brain and body enough

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.800
that people would sort of get into motion

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.633
and pursue that goal.

01:12:07.633 --> 01:12:08.570
But neither is the case.

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:12.394
Again, set goals that
are difficult to achieve,

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:14.476
but that are not so lofty,

01:12:14.476 --> 01:12:17.220
that they collapse your system

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.500
and that you feel overwhelmed.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.830
And the important thing here,

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.250
is that how we perceive a goal,

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:24.360
whether or not we think
it's within reach or not,

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.410
of course will vary,

01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:27.300
depending on whether or not we are rested.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.920
Depending on whether or not other aspects

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.340
of our life are going well.

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.040
I mean, we can think that
we are hot on the heels

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.527
of a lifetime goal and
everything's going well,

01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:39.340
and then there'll be some
crisis interpersonal crisis,

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.590
or there'll be a health crisis
and you'll be shut down.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:44.170
And then that goal seems
very, very hard to attain.

01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.600
So we will talk about how to update goals

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.540
under different context in a few minutes.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.790
But, of course this is
going to be an averaging,

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:52.700
this isn't something
that you do just once.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.330
But the takeaway again is very simple,

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:57.030
set goals that are
moderately hard to hard,

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.490
but not so hard nor so easy

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.410
that they don't engage your
brain and body properly.

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:04.250
Moderate goals are best,

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.250
if you want to achieve your goals.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.440
Now I'd like to talk about
three particular areas

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.990
of scientific study,

01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:12.240
that point to goal pursuit,

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.253
goal assessment and goal achievement.

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.670
Previously I told you,

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:20.570
that it's great to foreshadow failure.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.150
That that's a great way to get your system

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:23.470
into a state of activation.

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.710
I also told you

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.090
that you want to set goals,

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:27.570
that are challenging but possible.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.210
And again, here, I'm paraphrasing

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.710
from the work of Emily Balcetis.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:31.810
I want to be very clear.

01:13:32.798 --> 01:13:35.660
There are a few other
things that one can do

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.090
in order to bias the likelihood,

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:41.150
that you will succeed in
trying to achieve your goals.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.550
First of all, limit your options,

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.820
trying to pursue too many goals at once,

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.420
can definitely be counter productive.

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.820
Now I realized that life is complicated.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.270
We all have multiple goals
that we're trying to pursue,

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.230
but if we have particular
goals that are important to us,

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:59.340
we have to be careful to not
get distracted by other goals.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.100
And many people run into this problem.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.300
So setting one or two

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.450
or maybe three major
goals for a given year,

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.730
is going to be more than
enough for most people

01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:11.110
and is actually going to be
challenging for most people.

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:13.010
Now, of course we have daily
goals and monthly goals

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:15.870
and yearly goals, but if
we have big lofty goals,

01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:18.700
we need to be careful not to
contaminate our mental space

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.590
and our visual space with too many goals.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.234
And why do I say visual goals? Well,

01:14:23.234 --> 01:14:25.670
what various department stores

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:28.510
and supermarkets have discovered is that,

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:32.750
the greater, the number of
things in our visual attention,

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:35.540
the more that we can draw our attention

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.690
and our goals off a line of pursuit.

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:38.790
What does that mean?

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.660
Well, let's think about it
in the practical context.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.230
This has actually been done.

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:44.030
Big department stores have figured out

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:46.500
that if they stock their
shelves, chock-a-block

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.060
with many, many options of food

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.990
or clothing items or objects
or anything like that,

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.920
people simply buy more stuff.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.710
People are very prone to
orienting their attention

01:14:58.710 --> 01:14:59.820
to whatever's in front of them.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.020
You put a lot of stuff in front of them,

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.860
their attention drifts,

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.763
you put fewer things in front of them,

01:15:04.603 --> 01:15:05.960
their attention is more narrow.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.040
In a later episode, we'll talk
about designing a workspace,

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.060
that's optimized on the basis of this.

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.310
It doesn't mean being in a room

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.800
with nothing except just
your desk and a computer.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.970
Doesn't have to be that sparse,

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:18.990
but visual sparseness,

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:23.130
actually can help us orient
our focus and our behavior.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:25.130
When we have a lot of things
in our visual environment,

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:27.150
or a lot of things in our
cognitive environment.

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:28.360
It's the same thing.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.960
And so if you're going to try
and pursue a fitness goal,

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.950
a relationship goal, an academic goal,

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:35.330
and a longterm life
financial goal all at once,

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.490
that's four things.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.180
And you're going to have
to come up with systems

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:42.560
that allow you to isolate those
goals in a very rigid way.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.070
And if you do have
multiple interleaving goals

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.850
and overlapping goals
and simultaneous goals,

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:48.970
in a few minutes, we're going to talk

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:50.430
about a process that will allow you

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:52.120
to use your visual system,

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.040
to align towards each of
those goals, sequentially,

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.860
in a way that makes it much more likely

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.990
that you'll achieve them.

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:01.200
So now let's talk about
specificity of goals.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.730
We've all heard that the
more specific a goal is,

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.080
and the more specific we are

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.243
about when and how we are
going to execute that goal,

01:16:08.243 --> 01:16:09.620
the higher probability

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.360
that we will actually achieve that goal.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.460
And indeed that's the case,

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.010
but there's an additional feature,

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.770
that's not often discussed.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.270
That is vitally important.

01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:20.430
And in fact, maybe more important

01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:23.250
than having a specific time of day

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.123
or a specific end point in mind.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:26.873
There's a really nice study,

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:29.460
that was done looking at recycling.

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.560
This is something that a number of groups,

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.660
businesses, households,

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.730
and individuals are trying to do more of.

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:36.240
They're trying to lower carbon footprint

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.460
or contribute to the
world in some general way

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.810
by throwing away fewer things

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.870
that could potentially be recycled.

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:45.900
So this has been studied

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.140
in the context of the work environment,

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:52.035
where a business decides
and lets everybody know,

01:16:52.035 --> 01:16:54.650
that there's going to be a greater effort

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:57.030
toward recycling cans or bottles

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.740
or bottles and cans, et cetera.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:01.758
And then, the way these studies were done,

01:17:01.758 --> 01:17:04.980
is that the janitorial staff
was swapped out temporarily

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.780
for researchers that actually measured

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.190
the number of recyclable items

01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:11.142
that showed up in the trash

01:17:11.142 --> 01:17:13.310
and not in the recycle,

01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:14.820
as a function of the
total amount of trash.

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.380
Why'd I say, as a function
of the total amount of trash?

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.350
What's a way of controlling

01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.570
for differences in beverage consumption

01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:20.490
from one week to the next?

01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:22.640
Anyway, the point is they were able

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.311
to very carefully measure,

01:17:24.311 --> 01:17:26.507
how much people are recycling

01:17:26.507 --> 01:17:31.017
before and after this call
to action to recycle more.

01:17:31.017 --> 01:17:32.990
And what they found was,

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.500
if they said, we are going
to try and recycle more,

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.220
try not to put cans and
bottles in the trash.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:41.410
There of course was an
improvement in recycling,

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:43.290
but it was pretty modest.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:46.620
Whereas when there was
a very concrete plan

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.770
and everyone knew what
that concrete plan was,

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.880
for instance, to place all bottles

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.370
and cans into the recycle, not the trash

01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:57.850
or to limit the amount of trash by 50%,

01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:01.210
or to eliminate all recyclable
items from the trash.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:02.950
So when they made it very concrete,

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:05.900
exactly what the action steps were,

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.490
there was a remarkable,

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:08.970
I mean, close to a hundred fold

01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:12.690
or more improvement in recycling behavior

01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:14.870
that lasted many months

01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:17.660
after this call to action was made.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.500
The takeaway from this
is quite straightforward.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.770
It means that having a
concrete plan is essential.

01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:23.800
You can't just say,

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.230
I'm going to become a better recycler

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:26.170
or I'm going to do things

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:27.310
that are better for the environment

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:29.670
or I'm going to become
more physically fit.

01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:32.990
It has to be a specific
set of action steps

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:35.150
that get right down to details

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:37.810
about what success would look like.

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:39.090
I've heard this before described

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.880
as what does right look like?

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.510
What is the actual outcome

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:44.070
that one would like to achieve

01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:45.760
in terms of action steps?

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.520
So not necessarily feeling states,

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.890
it wasn't that they all
sat around and said,

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.820
how great we're all going to feel

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.330
about ourselves in the world

01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:52.520
when we accomplish this goal?

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.360
It was very concrete
statements, very concrete plans

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.570
about action steps that would
deliver one to one's goal.

01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:01.570
Somewhat straightforward and intuitive,

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.330
but nonetheless worthwhile.

01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:05.850
What it suggests is that for all of us,

01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:08.060
if we have certain goals
that we want to achieve,

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.870
we need to be exquisitely detailed

01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:12.690
about what the action steps are,

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:13.600
that we are going to take

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.930
and to constantly update
those action steps,

01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:17.450
so that we have a higher probability

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.230
of meeting those action steps.

01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:20.500
Some of you may be asking,

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.715
how often should one assess progress?

01:19:23.715 --> 01:19:26.360
Well, that of course will
depend on the given goal

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.690
that you're trying to pursue.

01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:28.840
But in the studies

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.379
that I've been referring to here,

01:19:30.379 --> 01:19:32.520
the assessment of progress

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.920
and the updating of concrete
plans was done weekly.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.810
So it seems like weekly
is a good starting place,

01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:41.150
to address how well one performed

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:42.120
in the previous week.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.000
And then based on that performance

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.730
to update the action plan
for the upcoming week.

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:49.940
So weekly seems like a
good solid rule of thumb

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.935
for setting particular action goals

01:19:51.935 --> 01:19:54.750
and assessing one's progress

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:57.420
towards the immediate
and longer term goals.

01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.400
Any discussion about
goals and goal pursuit,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.370
would be incomplete without a discussion

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:04.043
about the molecule, dopamine.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.690
Dopamine is often thought of

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:09.040
as the molecule of pleasure and reward,

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.600
but actually it is the
molecule of motivation.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.799
This is best illustrated

01:20:13.799 --> 01:20:15.610
by a classic set of studies,

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:18.680
that have been carried out in
both animals and in humans.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:22.110
The animal study can be
described the following way,

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:24.600
two rats, each in a separate cage.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.760
You can provide those rats

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.790
with the opportunity to indulge

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:29.270
in something that they like,

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:30.992
like food or mating.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:34.300
Or heat, if it's cold in the environment,

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.332
or a cool spot in the cage,

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.030
if it's warm in the
environment and so forth.

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:40.674
And what you find is that,

01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:45.674
rats will very readily
approach the rewarding thing.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.150
They will, mate.

01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:47.983
They will eat.

01:20:47.983 --> 01:20:51.930
They will pursue something
that is of pleasure.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.320
Now, if you are to take one of those rats

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.240
and deplete its dopamine neurons,

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.830
you can eliminate it's dopamine neurons

01:20:57.830 --> 01:21:00.000
or block dopamine in the brain.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.833
What you find,

01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:05.750
is that those animals
will still enjoy pleasure.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:08.610
They will consume the food,
they will mate, et cetera.

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.800
However, their motivation,

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.750
to achieve pleasure is vastly reduced.

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.280
In fact, if you place
the item of pleasure,

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.370
the mate, the food, et cetera,

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:22.640
even just one rat's
length away from that rat,

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.750
the rat without dopamine
will not even move one length

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:29.070
of its own body in order
to achieve that pleasure.

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:30.750
And there are naturally
occurring experiments

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:34.093
in humans that mimic that
result, very accurately.

01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:36.250
There are certain conditions in humans

01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:37.850
where there's a depletion of dopamine.

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:39.560
And what you find is that,

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.770
the depletion of dopamine
does not inhibit an ability

01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:45.150
to experience pleasure, necessarily.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.490
It inhibits an ability to pursue

01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:49.930
or go through the series of action steps

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:52.110
in order to achieve pleasure.

01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:53.510
So dopamine, really sits

01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:56.440
at the heart of our motivational state,

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.130
to seek out goals and to seek pleasure.

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.280
And this is true for immediate goals

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.936
that take place within
a timeframe of minutes

01:22:03.936 --> 01:22:05.700
or a timeframe of a day,

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.050
or the timeframe of a week or
the timeframe of a lifetime.

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:13.010
Dopamine, is the common currency
by which we pursue goals.

01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:15.140
Now, dopamine does a number of things

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.650
that are very interesting.

01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:17.970
I'm going to describe a few of them

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:20.780
as they relate to goal seeking behavior.

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.600
First of all, there's
a fundamental feature

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.720
of how our brain releases
and uses dopamine,

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.670
that's called, reward prediction error.

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:30.870
And the simplest way to think

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:33.210
about dopamine reward prediction error,

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:36.800
is that dopamine is released
in the greatest amount

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.470
and places us into a
greater state of motivation,

01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:44.670
when something happens
that's positive and novel.

01:22:44.670 --> 01:22:46.880
Now, an important thing to
understand about dopamine,

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.350
is that it's not always released

01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:51.560
on the same schedule.

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.500
There are a couple of different ways

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.620
that dopamine is released.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.680
And when it is released
relative to your anticipation

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.223
of a reward, is key.

01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:03.040
If you don't expect
something positive to happen,

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.260
you're just going about your day

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.950
and something positive happens,

01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:09.430
dopamine and a lot of
dopamine is released.

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:11.600
I had this happen recently.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.433
I had no idea

01:23:12.433 --> 01:23:14.460
that I was going to be
receiving something in the mail,

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.120
but I went to the mail.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.770
I looked in the mail and I
got something very positive.

01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:20.083
And I was really, really
excited about this.

01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:23.120
This is a real event that
happened, just today.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.930
However, if we anticipate
something positive

01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:28.260
is going to happen

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:29.773
and then that thing happens,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.360
we experience dopamine as
part of the anticipation.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.500
So even before we get the reward,

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.330
there's an increase in dopamine.

01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:40.180
It's not as high as it would be,

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.840
if something really novel and unexpected

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.820
and positive happened,

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.480
but we do get an increase in dopamine.

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:49.380
And then, when we actually
experience the reward,

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.140
we experience the positive thing,

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.400
there's a smaller increase in dopamine.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.010
So again, the biggest increases
in dopamine are response

01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:59.563
to things that are
positive and unexpected.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.930
Lesser dopamine is released

01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:04.880
when we anticipate
something good will happen

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.310
and when that happens,
yes, we get some dopamine.

01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:08.590
And we also get some dopamine

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.760
when the positive thing happens,

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.060
think about anticipating
a great meal with friends.

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.410
We have some dopamine churning,
our friends come over,

01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:15.450
then we have the meal

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.960
and we also get some dopamine from that,

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.220
but not nearly as much as we would,

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:22.510
if it had all happened as
a part of a big surprise.

01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:24.950
Then, there's also the
case in which we predict

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.150
that something good will happen,

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:29.250
when that happens, there's
an increase in dopamine just

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.670
as it was before,

01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.240
but then if that thing doesn't happen,

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.340
for instance, our friends
don't show up for dinner,

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:38.430
then there's a drop in dopamine
below our initial baseline.

01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:39.480
That drop in dopamine,

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.650
is the chemical essence of
what we call, disappointment.

01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:47.700
Now, this dopamine reward
prediction error, as it's called,

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.960
can be leveraged toward
trying to reach our goals

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.610
because it tells us

01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:55.145
where we should set our milestones.

01:24:55.145 --> 01:24:58.710
We can't be in a mode
of simply being focused

01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:00.280
on the finish line.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.080
Very few people can do that

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.370
over long periods of time

01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:05.203
in a way that's effective.

01:25:05.203 --> 01:25:06.810
Now, earlier I talked about a study

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.140
where people were focused
on a finish line visually,

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.430
and they were moving through space

01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:11.580
with these ankle weights on,

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.810
but that was a very short-term goal.

01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:16.320
So, if a goal is within minutes,

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.530
or maybe even within an hour

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:20.410
or as in with our immediate
visuals environment,

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:21.650
maybe we can do that.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:23.160
But most goals of the sort

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.100
that most people are
pursuing, fitness goals,

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.350
academic goals, business goals,

01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:29.980
relationship goals, et cetera,
involve some milestones.

01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.010
So, understanding what we know

01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:35.870
about reward prediction error,
we can make better choices

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:37.970
about where to place the milestones,

01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:41.220
how far out in the future
to place milestones.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.480
So then the question becomes,

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.300
how often or at what intervals
should one assess progress?

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.140
And it turns out this is very subjective,

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.810
but that there's a way
to make it objective.

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:56.310
Now, in a previous episode of
the "Huberman Lab Podcast",

01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:58.717
I had a discussion with
the great Robert Sapolsky

01:25:58.717 --> 01:26:00.470
and we were talking about,

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:03.130
how the brain can subjectively change

01:26:03.130 --> 01:26:05.350
whether or not a given
behavior or experience,

01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:06.550
is positive or negative.

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:09.440
And the example that Robert gave,

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440
is a really phenomenal one.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.300
It's a study that's been done in rats

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.170
and also in humans

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:14.290
where they took a rat

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:17.051
and they had a rat run on a running wheel.

01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:18.760
Rats turns out like to
run them running wheels

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.890
and the blood pressure of that animal,

01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:22.510
the health metrics for that animal,

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.480
the lipid profiles, many,
many things improved.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.540
The rat was exercising
and it got healthier

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.610
and presumably happier,

01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:30.130
we don't know, we could've asked it,

01:26:30.130 --> 01:26:32.263
but we wouldn't know. It
doesn't know how to tell us,

01:26:32.263 --> 01:26:33.750
but we can measure blood lipids.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:36.200
We can measure blood pressure
and all sorts of things.

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.280
And indeed, when that rat
exercised or when people exercise,

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.130
they generally get healthier.

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.290
Except, in that particular experiment,

01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:46.850
they had another animal

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:50.760
where every time rat number one, ran,

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.520
rat number two was forced to run.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.430
It was on a running wheel

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:56.820
and it was forced to run,
not because it wanted to,

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.690
but because it was forced to.

01:26:58.690 --> 01:27:00.020
And what was remarkable,

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.770
is that the physiological effects

01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:03.740
of being forced to do something,

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.600
were in the complete opposite
direction as they were

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.620
when those same behaviors
were undertaken voluntarily.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:12.220
In other words, the rat
that was choosing to run,

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.100
got healthier

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.520
and the rat that was forced
to run became unhealthy,

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.140
blood pressure went up in a direction

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:19.750
that wasn't effective and useful.

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:20.890
Blood lipids got worse.

01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:22.920
Stress hormones went up,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.070
And you see the same thing in humans.

01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.110
Now, what this says,

01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:29.950
is that our subjective understanding

01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:31.870
of why we are doing something,

01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:34.680
is fundamentally important for the effects

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.400
that we will get from that behavior.

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.600
And indeed the effects of
that behavior will have on us.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.530
So this has two major implications.

01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.070
First of all, in terms
of reward schedules,

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:47.271
we can decide to use any
reward schedule that we want

01:27:47.271 --> 01:27:48.470
for a given behavior.

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:50.858
We can decide that the milestones for a...

01:27:50.858 --> 01:27:53.170
Let's say a plan of getting

01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:56.130
in really terrific cardiovascular
shape over the next year.

01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:58.650
We can decide to assess every day

01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:01.590
and ask ourselves how
good was our progress.

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:03.790
And if we made progress, then
we're going to reward ourselves.

01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:05.450
We could do that every third day.

01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:06.790
We could do it every week.

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:08.180
We could do it every five minutes,

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.240
if we actually had the time to do that.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.800
The reward schedule, the dopamine system,

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.000
is highly susceptible to
the subjective effects.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.410
These so-called, top-down effects

01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:20.690
of when we decide that something
is going to be good for us,

01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:23.210
if we analyze it on a given timeframe,

01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.370
well, then it's going to be good for us.

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:27.170
So, what I suggest people do

01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:29.060
is pick a particular interval

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.090
at which they are going
to assess progress.

01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:34.360
And if you've been making
regular progress towards a goal

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.217
that you reward yourself

01:28:35.217 --> 01:28:38.510
and the reward indeed is all cognitive.

01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:39.370
It's all mental.

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:42.140
It's telling yourself, yes,
I'm on the right track.

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.380
Now, some people will say, wait,

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.810
but I want to know exactly
how often I should do that.

01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:49.100
You need to do that at an interval

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.730
that you can maintain consistently.

01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:54.580
So you're not going to
reward yourself every minute

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.900
or every step of every jog that you take,

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.820
unless you can do it,
every minute of every step

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.070
of every jog that you take.

01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:02.398
For that reason, I think that daily

01:29:02.398 --> 01:29:05.830
or ideally, weekly assessments
are going to be best.

01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:07.410
I think that checking
in at the end of a week,

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:08.870
looking back on the previous week

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:11.180
and assessing how well you performed

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.780
in pursuit of a given goal.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.540
How many times a week you ran,

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:15.810
or how many times you studied,

01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:17.790
or how many times you did
something that you wanted to do

01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:19.800
or avoided something that
you didn't want to do.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.380
I think that's a reasonable
and tractable schedule

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.670
to assess once a week.

01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:27.690
So that's one point,

01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:31.670
that pick a milestone that
you can maintain consistently

01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:33.910
throughout the pursuit of a goal.

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:37.610
The second thing, is that
the subjective effects

01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:40.120
that were described by that Sapolsky study

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.900
or that Sapolsky described
rather, are absolutely essential

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.410
for all aspects of goal seeking behavior.

01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:49.480
We cannot underestimate the extent

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.620
to which the dopamine system and our sense

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.560
of whether or not we
are on the right track,

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.060
is under our cognitive control.

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.490
If we constantly place ourselves

01:29:58.490 --> 01:30:01.890
into a mode of thinking
that we are failing, well,

01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:05.030
then indeed, we are not going
to churn out much dopamine.

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:07.200
Now, earlier, I said, we need to predict

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.900
and visualize failure,

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.720
but that is not the same thing

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.330
as thinking about ourselves as failing.

01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:17.000
We need to predict what the
outcome would be if we failed,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.930
but then encountering that

01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:20.367
and in behaving in a certain way,

01:30:20.367 --> 01:30:21.580
and thinking in a certain way,

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.730
in pursuing our goals in an effective way.

01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:26.520
Maybe checking in on that each week,

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.670
we definitely need to
reward ourselves cognitively

01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:32.730
for the correct and successful pursuit.

01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:35.700
What this means is that
anticipate and think about failure

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.100
as a mechanism of generating motivation

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.670
and indeed fear and anxiety,

01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:41.620
so that you lean into
the correct behaviors

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.680
and you lean away from
the incorrect behaviors

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:44.840
to reach your goal.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.150
But then weekly or so,

01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:48.364
whatever you can maintain consistently,

01:30:48.364 --> 01:30:51.530
you absolutely want to
reward yourself cognitively

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:53.530
by telling yourself,
I'm on the right track.

01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:55.660
I got another week where I accomplish,

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.840
whatever it is that I'm
trying to accomplish.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.580
A concrete example that I'm following now,

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.540
is this 150 to 200 minutes
of zone two cardio per week,

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:05.352
because that's shown to be very effective

01:31:05.352 --> 01:31:07.121
in improving mental and
physical health metrics.

01:31:07.121 --> 01:31:09.240
So once a week, I'll check in with myself.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.280
If I reach that 150 to
200 minutes threshold,

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.600
then I'll reward myself simply

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.260
by checking off a box and
saying, okay, I'm on track.

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:18.093
I'm on track.

01:31:18.093 --> 01:31:19.070
I'm on track.

01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:22.200
This dopamine system is critical to re-up,

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.050
to remind ourselves that we are on track,

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:25.710
if indeed we are on track

01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:29.917
because dopamine itself
provides a state of motivation

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.680
and readiness to continue

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.513
in the regular pursuit of our goals.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.310
Dopamine, the molecule, is actually used

01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:40.840
to manufacture epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.040
Which are other molecules
in our brain and body,

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.470
which put us into that
readiness and action state.

01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:46.570
There are actually the molecules

01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:48.020
that help generate that increase

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.330
in systolic blood pressure,

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.900
that puts us into a state of readiness.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.630
So you can think about dopamine

01:31:53.630 --> 01:31:55.780
as a self amplifying system,

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:59.680
provided that you are
leveraging the dopamine system

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.469
on a consistent schedule.

01:32:01.469 --> 01:32:05.230
Now, by also following a
consistent schedule of self reward,

01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:09.640
you set yourself up for any
positive unanticipated rewards,

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.590
that may happen.

01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:13.440
So for instance, if you're
checking in with yourself weekly,

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:14.710
telling yourself that you're doing well,

01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:15.810
if indeed you are.

01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:17.600
And then out of nowhere,

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.180
for instance, you're out on a run

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.060
or you're doing something,

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.320
I'm using fitness as an example.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.153
But you're doing something,

01:32:22.153 --> 01:32:24.230
you find yourself performing
particularly well,

01:32:24.230 --> 01:32:27.000
that's a unexpected dopamine reward

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.420
that will further amplify the system.

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.040
Now I know many people out there,

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.350
having heard me talk about
dopamine before, worry,

01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:35.380
well, can I release too much dopamine

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.800
and then the whole system will crash

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.560
and then I'll run out of motivation?

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.360
In general, that doesn't happen

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.900
unless people are using pharmacology,

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.160
supplements or prescription
drugs or illicit drugs

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.680
to increase dopamine.

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:50.030
This is why I'm a big fan
of things like, cold showers

01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:51.770
and cold water exposure,

01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:52.900
which has been shown to lead

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:57.520
to long-lasting 2.5 X
increases in dopamine,

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.500
or in some cases,

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.400
supplementation with
things like L-Tyrosine,

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.010
which are precursors to dopamine.

01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:03.120
Or in some cases, caffeine,

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.220
which can increase the number

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.980
of dopamine receptors that we have,

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:08.100
so that whatever dopamine
we have floating around

01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.280
can be more effective

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.960
in activating these motivational states.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.950
But things that really increase dopamine

01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:17.510
and then cause it to
crash, can be problematic.

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:19.160
One way to conceive of dopamine,

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.420
is as a sort of dopamine wave pool.

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.680
You've probably seen these wave pools,

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.980
where some pressure is
pushed into the pool

01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:26.420
and then you get these waves going.

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.520
If those waves are consistent enough,

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.070
and they're are of high enough amplitude,

01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:35.140
the waves can continue to go
up and down and up and down.

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.600
But if it's a giant wave,

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.040
if you get a huge blast of dopamine,

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.850
well then a bunch of the water
sloshes out of the wave pool

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.440
and then you basically
have to take some time off,

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:45.820
reset that dopamine level.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.030
That's what happens in addiction

01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:50.830
and when people start
pushing in a lot of drugs

01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:51.940
or other things into the system

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.870
that increase dopamine too much.

01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:55.860
So today we've almost
exclusively been talking

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.298
about behavioral tools.

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.770
It is possible to incorporate supplements

01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:02.594
and things of that sort, that
can increase dopamine as a way

01:34:02.594 --> 01:34:06.140
to getting into ongoing
motivational states.

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:09.850
But I caution people about
relying on those too much.

01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:11.410
Really what you want,

01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:14.540
is you want a situation where
your own positive feedback,

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:15.500
your own understanding,

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.110
that you are reaching the milestones

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:19.210
that you've set out for yourself.

01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:20.670
That you're achieving those,

01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:22.540
and that is what's causing these waves

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:23.890
or these increases in dopamine

01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:26.930
that will further amplify
your motivational states.

01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:29.300
Another very interesting
aspect of dopamine

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:30.850
that I've not talked about at all

01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:32.410
on this podcast before,

01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:35.260
is actually how the
dopamine system interacts

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.730
with the visual system.

01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:38.592
We've talked a lot about

01:34:38.592 --> 01:34:39.425
how harnessing your visual attention,

01:34:39.425 --> 01:34:41.460
to a particular point is great

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:45.790
and can help serve your
ability to both set

01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:46.993
and achieve goals.

01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:50.860
Really wonderful work that
was done by Wolfram Schultz,

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.500
who's one of the great pioneers

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.730
in this area of dopamine

01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:55.740
and dopamine reward prediction error,

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.920
showed that for people that
have normal levels of dopamine,

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.010
their visual search,

01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:01.750
meaning how they scanned
visual environments,

01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:03.050
tends to be pretty constrained.

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:04.070
They might move their eyes

01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:07.093
around a particular visual
environment, searching somewhat.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.800
For people that lack dopamine,

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.350
they actually have very
little movement of their eyes.

01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:16.340
They don't actually tend to
look very far into the horizon.

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.690
They're don't have that
very focused vergence point

01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:19.970
that we're talking about that kind of a...

01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:21.240
I guess for lack of a better phrase,

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.500
that kind of eye of the
tiger, focus on a goal.

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.770
Rather, their eye movements are depleted

01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:29.210
and they're not actually
evaluating horizons

01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:30.130
off in their future,

01:35:30.130 --> 01:35:34.250
they're not focused so much
on the extrapersonal space.

01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.800
And this actually can be restored

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.410
and some of these took place
in Parkinson's patients

01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:40.400
and other people who
have dopamine depleted,

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.520
that when dopamine is
restored pharmacologically,

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.930
their visual focus is re-enhanced again.

01:35:46.930 --> 01:35:48.740
Now, there are a lot of
details to this study

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.330
that don't map perfectly onto everything

01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:51.250
that I've talked about.

01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:54.210
But the point is this, when we are focused

01:35:54.210 --> 01:35:55.950
on a particular point in visual space

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.578
or a particular goal or horizon.

01:35:58.578 --> 01:36:01.260
All those systems, our
blood pressure, epinephrine

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.890
and indeed dopamine, get recruited

01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:05.970
to put us into a state of readiness

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:07.720
and willingness to go pursue things

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.040
in that extrapersonal space.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.230
When our visual attention is very diffuse,

01:36:13.230 --> 01:36:14.440
all of that relaxes,

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.380
and we tend to be more comfortable staying

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.950
in the place that we are,
in our peripersonal space

01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:22.602
and the effect works in
the other direction too.

01:36:22.602 --> 01:36:24.820
When dopamine is increased,

01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.660
our visual attention for
particular things out in space,

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:28.493
increase.

01:36:28.493 --> 01:36:30.970
So the way it works is reciprocal.

01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:34.080
When we use our visual system
and in a particular way,

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.250
bring it to a point of focus,

01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:37.290
it recruits chemical and neural systems

01:36:37.290 --> 01:36:38.123
in our brain and body

01:36:38.123 --> 01:36:40.880
that put us into a state
of readiness and pursuit.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.640
And, when we increase certain chemicals

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.340
in our brain and body, like
epinephrine, like dopamine,

01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:50.480
then we also allow our visual system

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.150
to be in a state of looking
out at particular locations

01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:55.320
in our visual world.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.440
So the system works in both directions

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.350
and some people leverage this
by using things like caffeine

01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:03.060
or taking things like
L-Tyrosine to increase dopamine.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.550
And again, it works both ways,

01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:06.420
there's no right or wrong way to do it.

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:09.630
I'm a particular fan of
using behavioral tools,

01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:12.970
always prior to using supplementation

01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:14.410
or any kinds of other tools

01:37:14.410 --> 01:37:16.940
because behavioral tools
have a very unique feature

01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:20.300
that supplementation and
other chemical tools don't.

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.929
Which is that behavioral
tools used over time,

01:37:22.929 --> 01:37:24.630
engage neuroplasticity.

01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:26.590
As we start to practice,

01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:28.580
using our visual system
to harness our attention

01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.720
to particular locations

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.970
and in that way, move
to our particular goals,

01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:34.170
we get better and better
at using those systems.

01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:36.880
In fact, the systems for
focus and motivation,

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.180
themselves have plasticity,

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:40.980
so we get better at being
motivated and focused

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.420
when we place our visual
attention at a given location.

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.130
Using chemical assistance of a safe kind,

01:37:47.130 --> 01:37:48.260
of course, check with your doctor.

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.840
But things like L-Tyrosine or
caffeine or those combined,

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.067
yes, it will increase dopamine

01:37:52.067 --> 01:37:53.880
and will increase our ability,

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.713
to engage in visual focus somewhat.

01:37:55.713 --> 01:37:57.810
But those compounds alone,

01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:00.530
don't modify the circuitry
in the way that we want.

01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:02.870
So I always say, behavioral tools first,

01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:04.967
then nutritional tools,
then supplementation tools

01:38:04.967 --> 01:38:06.970
and then if it's right for you and safe,

01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:08.050
maybe you advance into some

01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:09.960
of the other more sophisticated tools.

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.410
I'd like to just briefly recap

01:38:11.410 --> 01:38:13.050
what I've covered up until now.

01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:14.300
And again, emphasize that much

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.660
of what I've covered has been based

01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.260
on the beautiful work of
Emily Balcetis and colleagues.

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:21.400
I do hope to get her as a guest
on the podcast, by the way.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.530
First of all, set goals that
are challenging, but possible,

01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:27.810
those moderate goals, not super
easy, not super difficult.

01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.770
But moderately challenging goals,

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:31.230
seem to be the most effective

01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:33.210
in moving people towards their goals

01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:34.740
over the short and longterm.

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.546
Second, plan concretely,

01:38:36.546 --> 01:38:38.300
you need a concrete set of actions

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.296
that you're going to follow
in order to reach your goals.

01:38:41.296 --> 01:38:44.220
Third, foreshadow failure.

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:46.610
This is a somewhat surprising one to me.

01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:47.920
I would have anticipated,

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:50.830
that imagining success is the way to go.

01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:54.010
It turns out that imagining
success and visualizing success,

01:38:54.010 --> 01:38:56.400
can be useful at the outset of a goal

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.000
and maybe every once in a while

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.620
in pursuit of that goal.

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:02.170
But that it's not terrific for putting you

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:04.150
in constant pursuit of that goal,

01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:06.870
rather, foreshadowing
failure, visualizing failure

01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:07.780
and all the terrible things

01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.150
that it's going to bring,

01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:09.983
seems to be more effective.

01:39:09.983 --> 01:39:11.700
And that maps very well to what's known

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:12.533
about the neural circuitry

01:39:12.533 --> 01:39:14.323
and the involvement of the amygdala.

01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:18.320
Focus on particular visual points

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.070
as a way to harness your attention

01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:22.363
and to remove distractors.

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.810
Removing distractors and
getting your body and brain

01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:27.240
into a mode of activation.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.760
Getting that healthy increase
in systolic blood pressure,

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.920
that puts you into forward motion

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.950
towards your goals, is absolutely key.

01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:35.410
So that's a brief summary

01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:37.210
of what I've covered up until now.

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:39.570
There were other things too,
of course, the dopamine system

01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:44.570
and the power of
subjective top-down control

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:47.010
in regulating that dopamine system.

01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:49.710
But I want to be sure to include a tool,

01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:51.620
that's been especially powerful for me,

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.840
that's grounded in the
neuroscience research

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.740
and in the psychology research.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.910
And as I describe this tool next,

01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:59.050
I think you'll see the ways

01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:00.880
in which it measures nicely

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.440
with the work that Emily Balcetis
and colleagues have done.

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.810
This is something that,

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:07.810
I've personally been doing for many years,

01:40:07.810 --> 01:40:10.580
based on my understanding
of the visual system

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.091
and the understanding that

01:40:12.091 --> 01:40:14.513
indeed we can move our cognition

01:40:14.513 --> 01:40:18.502
and our perception from
a place of interoception

01:40:18.502 --> 01:40:21.410
and focusing on our peripersonal space.

01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:23.950
That space within us and
immediately around us

01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:27.150
and on the things that are
immediately accessible to us.

01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:28.740
That we can shift from that mode

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.050
to this mode of exteroception

01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:34.480
of focusing on things outside
the confines of our skin

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.120
and that are beyond our reach,

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.220
that are literally goal directed behaviors

01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.150
and goal directed thoughts.

01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:42.100
And this is something that in the past,

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:43.930
I have talked about a little bit

01:40:43.930 --> 01:40:46.070
and I've talked about something
called, space-time bridging.

01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:47.180
And we haven't talked too much

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:50.220
about the time domain of
the visual system today.

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:53.460
But space-time bridging, is simply a way

01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.340
of using one's visual system

01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.610
to focus on the peripersonal
space and interoception.

01:40:58.610 --> 01:41:00.760
And then gradually in a deliberate way,

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.140
stepping one's focus into
the extra personal space

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.190
and then back to the peripersonal space

01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:09.890
in a way that gives you a lot
of flexibility and control

01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:13.260
over that ability in your daily life.

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:15.610
So, I'm going to first describe the tool,

01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:18.420
and then I will explain more
about the underlying science

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.870
and the underlying mechanism.

01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:22.400
Here's how you would do this.

01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:25.710
You could do this indoors or outdoors,

01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:28.410
although, ideally, you
would do it in a location

01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:29.610
where you could view a horizon.

01:41:29.610 --> 01:41:30.570
It could be through a window

01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:32.483
or ideally outdoors, without a window.

01:41:33.461 --> 01:41:35.198
It could be done anytime of day.

01:41:35.198 --> 01:41:36.210
At night, it might be a
little more challenging,

01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:38.540
but it goes the following way.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.993
What you first do, is you
would close your eyes,

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:43.180
this could be done sitting or standing.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.590
But you would close your eyes

01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:48.018
and you would focus as
much of your attention,

01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:50.018
including your visual attention

01:41:50.018 --> 01:41:53.010
on your inner landscape,
on your interoception.

01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:54.850
So that would be your
breathing, your heart rate,

01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:56.250
maybe even the surface of your skin,

01:41:56.250 --> 01:41:58.010
but really focusing internally.

01:41:58.010 --> 01:42:00.140
Now, how can you focus your
visual attention internally,

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.290
if your eyes are closed?

01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:04.940
Well, you do that by imagining
your inner landscape.

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.480
So you don't have to
imagine your heart beating

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.313
and so forth.

01:42:07.313 --> 01:42:08.940
But what you're trying to
do is eliminate perception

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.230
of the outside world.

01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:11.820
You're eliminating exteroception

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.900
and you're focusing all of
your cognitive attention

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.250
and your perceptual attention

01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:17.380
on what you're experiencing

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:19.680
within the confines of your skin

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.020
or at the level of the
surface of your skin

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:23.200
and inside your body.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.890
And you would do that for a duration

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:29.340
of approximately three slow breaths.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:30.230
So close your eyes.

01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:34.480
You do breath one, breath
two and breath three,

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.720
concentrating all your attention

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.350
on your internal landscape.

01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:39.500
Then you would open your eyes

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.160
and you would focus your visual attention

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.470
on some area on the surface of your body.

01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:44.940
So for me, the way that
I typically do this,

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:47.410
will be to focus on,
say the palm of my hand.

01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:49.580
So I'll focus my visual
attention on the palm of my hand.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.960
And I then do three breaths again,

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.140
focusing on my internal state,

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.300
but now I'm splitting out a little bit

01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:00.250
of my attention from
interoception to exteroception.

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.970
I'm focusing on something outside me,

01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:05.630
the ratio or the split of
attention is about 90, 10,

01:43:05.630 --> 01:43:08.430
about 90% of my attention
is focused internally,

01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:12.630
but I'm also focusing some
of my attention externally.

01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:14.580
Most people can do this pretty easily.

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.060
Then, there's a third,
what I call, station.

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.680
I now move my visual
attention to outside my body,

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.260
to some location in the room,

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:24.060
or if I'm outside in the
external environment,

01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:26.830
something in the range
of five to 15 feet away.

01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:30.000
And I'm trying to move 90% of my attention

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.220
to that external object.

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:34.100
So now I'm really biasing my
perception and my attention

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:35.833
towards exteroception.

01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:39.860
As I breathe, I'm paying
attention to those three breaths,

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.210
so that's why there's still 10%,

01:43:41.210 --> 01:43:43.060
that's focused on my internal landscape

01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:45.070
because I want to pay attention
to those three breasts.

01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:47.060
But I'm focusing as much of my attention,

01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.479
outside of myself,
maintaining just a little bit

01:43:50.479 --> 01:43:51.730
on my internal state,

01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:55.190
so I can measure the cadence
of those three breaths.

01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:58.050
Then I move my visual attention
to yet another station,

01:43:58.050 --> 01:44:00.010
which is further away,
typically, a horizon

01:44:00.010 --> 01:44:01.980
or something as far off in the distance,

01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:03.380
as I can possibly see.

01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:05.883
Again for the duration of three breaths.

01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:10.550
And at that point, I'm trying
my very best to move 99,

01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:14.453
if not 100% of my attention
to that external location.

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.740
And then, what I typically will do,

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:22.750
is I will try and expand both my vision

01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:25.160
and my cognition to a much broader sphere.

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.620
This is that, magnocellular vision

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:28.100
that we talked about before,

01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:29.230
where I'm not focusing

01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:30.720
on a particular location on the horizon.

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.030
I'm trying to dilate the
aperture of my field of view,

01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:35.420
so I can see as much
of the visual landscape

01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:36.800
as I'm in as possible.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.570
If you're in an internal, excuse me,

01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:41.240
if you're in indoors,

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.450
then that might be the ceiling, the walls

01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:45.080
and the floor of the
environment you're in.

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.770
If you're outdoors, it would
be to expand your visual focus

01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:50.060
as broadly as you possibly can.

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.760
Again, for the duration of three breaths,

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:56.900
then I would return immediately
to my internal landscape.

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:57.950
I would close my eyes

01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:01.370
and I would do three more
breasts focusing entirely

01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:05.160
on my interoception, on
my internal landscape

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.970
or what we called before,
my peripersonal space.

01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:09.693
And I would then repeat that,

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.860
peripersonal space, 100%,

01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.910
focus on my hand, 90%,

01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:18.800
10% on my peripersonal space
or my internal landscape.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.500
Stepping out to another location

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.620
where it's mostly exteroception,

01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:25.640
maybe a little bit of
recognition of my internal state,

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.810
then to the horizon,

01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:29.670
then to this broader visual
sphere, then back into my body.

01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:31.900
And I would work through
each of those stations,

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.200
maybe two or three times.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.640
The entire thing takes about
90 seconds to three minutes,

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.630
depending on how many breaths you do.

01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:39.463
I said three,

01:45:39.463 --> 01:45:41.040
but you could do one or 10.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.500
It doesn't really matter.

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:45.500
Or, it's also going to depend on,

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.460
for instance, how slowly your breathing.

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.730
'Cause your breathing might be faster

01:45:48.730 --> 01:45:49.973
than mine or vice versa.

01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:52.170
What is all of this doing?

01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:54.200
Why do I call this space-time bridging?

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.600
And why is this useful for goal setting?

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.720
The reason I call it space-time bridging,

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:00.410
is that the visual system,

01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:03.120
is not just about analyzing space.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.330
It's actually how we batch time.

01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:06.870
It's how we carve up time.

01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:08.900
And the simple way to state this is that,

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.510
when we focus our visual attention

01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:12.780
on a very narrow point,

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:14.710
that's close to our body

01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:16.440
and our immediate experience.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.250
We tend to slice up time, very finely.

01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:20.870
We're focused on our breathing.

01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:22.840
We're focused on our heartbeats.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.070
In fact, our breathing
and our internal landscape

01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.903
and our heartbeats

01:46:25.903 --> 01:46:28.530
become the sort of
seconds hand, if you will

01:46:28.530 --> 01:46:29.510
on our experience.

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:30.820
We are carving up time,

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:34.320
according to our immediate
physiological experience.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.000
Whereas when we focus our visual
attention outside our body,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.690
not only do we engage that exteroceptive,

01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:42.150
extra personal space system,

01:46:42.150 --> 01:46:43.930
and we start to engage
the dopamine system,

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.820
the goal-directed system,

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:49.310
but we also start
batching time differently.

01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:50.930
When we focus our visual system

01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:53.710
into a broader sphere
of space or into a space

01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:55.520
beyond the confines of our skin,

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.879
we start carving up time,
our frame rate changes.

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:02.520
Now this is useful in the
context of goal setting,

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.240
goal assessment and goal pursuit.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.240
Because with the exception of
a very few isolated examples,

01:47:09.367 --> 01:47:13.293
almost all goals, involve
setting some goal,

01:47:13.293 --> 01:47:15.620
that's off in the future,

01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:17.980
and then carving up the time between now

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.710
and the achievement of
that goal into milestones,

01:47:20.710 --> 01:47:23.190
that range in duration.

01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:25.360
And the rewards, even if we try

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.680
and just make them every week,

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.760
are going to come at
some unexpected intervals

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.950
and that's actually can be helpful

01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:33.480
for reinforcing behavior,
intermittent reward.

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.740
That's intermittent

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.913
and random is the most effective
reward schedule we know,

01:47:39.450 --> 01:47:40.660
but the problem is always,

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.380
how do we keep our cognition

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:43.940
in line with the long-term goal

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.180
while also being focused

01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:46.430
on these more immediate goals?

01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:47.880
And so this particular practice,

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.170
that I call space-time bridging,

01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:50.560
but we could give it a different name.

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.560
I'm sure there are better names.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:52.430
Maybe you can suggest some

01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:54.570
in the comment section on YouTube,

01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:57.350
that are more accurate
or map to it better.

01:47:57.350 --> 01:48:00.310
But this behavior or this practice rather,

01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:02.750
is teaching us to use our visual system

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:04.680
and thereby our cognitive system

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:07.230
and thereby our reward systems,

01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:09.840
to orient to different locations in space

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.880
and therefore different locations in time.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.300
And that is the essence
of goal directed behavior.

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.550
That is the essence of setting a goal.

01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:20.520
It's about thinking about what you want.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.410
Then it's about setting milestones

01:48:23.410 --> 01:48:25.730
that are intermediate to that goal.

01:48:25.730 --> 01:48:27.210
Then it's about assessing whether

01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:28.860
or not you're reaching those milestones.

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:31.250
And then, it's of course
about updating your goals,

01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:33.030
if you need to update your goals.

01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:37.050
All of that is an enormously
confusing batch of challenges,

01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:38.690
if you think about it all at once,

01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:40.820
but if you break it down
into these elements,

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:43.130
that the visual system can help you find

01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:44.650
and move towards those milestones.

01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:46.600
I think there's ample
evidence to support that

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:49.180
and that your control
over your visual system,

01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:50.140
is indeed yours,

01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:52.400
that you can deliberately set
it to different locations.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.540
And then you make a practice

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.410
of stepping through
these different stations

01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:58.380
on a regular basis.

01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.750
Again, I do this each morning.

01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:01.784
I do this once a day.

01:49:01.784 --> 01:49:03.570
Rarely have I done it twice a day.

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:04.970
Rarely have I missed a day.

01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:07.520
But by doing that, you
can be very effective

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:09.930
in teaching the systems of your brain

01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:11.880
that are related to
goal setting and reward,

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.890
to map to different timeframes.

01:49:13.890 --> 01:49:16.930
So, I found this to be a
very effective protocol,

01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:19.281
the Balcetis work has mainly focused

01:49:19.281 --> 01:49:23.560
on visual tools that
are of a single horizon.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:24.960
Here I'm talking about multiple

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.190
what I called stations or horizons.

01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:30.370
But what's very clear, is
that an ability to move

01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:32.330
from different visual stations

01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:34.410
and to do that in a deliberate way

01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:36.389
in a focused and conscious way.

01:49:36.389 --> 01:49:38.660
Clearly maps to an ability,

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.290
to conceive of different goals

01:49:40.290 --> 01:49:41.850
over different periods of time.

01:49:41.850 --> 01:49:44.310
And I do believe can be greatly beneficial

01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:47.130
in allowing one to set particular goals

01:49:47.130 --> 01:49:49.400
and then move through the
milestones to those goals

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.700
and to constantly update one's pursuit

01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.700
and reward in reaching those milestones

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.930
and eventually, the overall goal.

01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:58.050
Per usual, I covered a
lot of material today.

01:49:58.050 --> 01:50:00.150
We talked about some of the neuroscience

01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:02.900
and psychology and popular understanding

01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:05.430
of goal seeking behavior.

01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:07.400
How to assess goals, et cetera.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.350
Talked about the beautiful
work of Emily Balcetis

01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:11.330
at New York University

01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:14.660
and her work on the use
of the visual system,

01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:16.650
to better achieve goals.

01:50:16.650 --> 01:50:19.390
And indeed things like visualization

01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:21.570
and why forecasting failure
can be more effective

01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:23.130
than forecasting success

01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:25.360
as counter intuitive as that might seem.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.950
That's what the data point to.

01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:29.800
And we talked about the importance
of setting concrete plans

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.430
and really what that means.

01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:34.890
And what intervals at
which to assess progress.

01:50:34.890 --> 01:50:37.560
And what intervals at
which to assess reward

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.600
and how the dopamine system is involved.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.690
And in addition, I described this practice

01:50:41.690 --> 01:50:44.080
that one can incorporate as a daily

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.960
or semi-daily practice of
so-called, space-time bridging

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.540
of using the visual system

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:51.830
and your ability to deliberately
step your visual system

01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:54.330
from stations that are within your body.

01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:57.430
So-called peripersonal or
interoceptive space out

01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:58.670
into the world further and further.

01:50:58.670 --> 01:51:00.450
And then back again in sequence

01:51:00.450 --> 01:51:02.960
as a way to harness and cultivate

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:05.757
and build up these
systems that link vision,

01:51:05.757 --> 01:51:09.228
space, time, reward systems and so forth.

01:51:09.228 --> 01:51:13.450
Ultimately, as you set out
to accomplish your goals,

01:51:13.450 --> 01:51:15.680
there are going to be
a number of basic steps

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.940
that everyone will have to follow.

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:18.350
You have to clearly identify,

01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:20.690
what the long arching ultimate goal is.

01:51:20.690 --> 01:51:23.910
You have to identify what
the milestones will be.

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:25.520
You might not know all
of them at the outset,

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.880
but you ought to have some idea

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.700
about the intervals at which you are going

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:31.020
to set those milestones

01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:35.160
and set your reward schedule
for assessing progress

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:38.010
in route to those milestones
in your ultimate goal.

01:51:38.010 --> 01:51:40.570
My hope is that you'll be able
to incorporate these tools,

01:51:40.570 --> 01:51:42.240
if not all of them,

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:44.150
perhaps just one of them or two of them

01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:46.240
in pursuit of whatever particular goals,

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.420
you happen to be focused on at this point

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:49.930
and in the future.

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.150
In today's episode and
in previous episodes

01:52:30.150 --> 01:52:32.730
of the "Huberman Lab Podcast",
we talked about supplements,

01:52:32.730 --> 01:52:34.810
while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

01:52:34.810 --> 01:52:36.950
many people drive tremendous
benefit from them.

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:39.460
For things like sleep
and focus and so forth.

01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.614
It's really important that if
you're going to take supplements,

01:52:41.614 --> 01:52:43.920
that they be of the
absolute highest quality.

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:46.550
For that reason, we
partner Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E

01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:47.870
because Thorne supplements,

01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:49.440
have the highest levels of stringency

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.250
with respect to the
ingredients they include

01:52:51.250 --> 01:52:52.690
and the precision of the amounts

01:52:52.690 --> 01:52:55.160
of the ingredients they
include in their products.

01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.910
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

01:52:56.910 --> 01:53:01.910
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:03.530
And you can see the
supplements that I take

01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:05.820
and get 20% off any of those supplements.

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:08.070
And if you navigate further
into the Thorne site

01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:11.020
through thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:13.690
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

01:53:13.690 --> 01:53:14.850
that Thorne makes.

01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:32.690
at Neural Network Newsletter.

01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:34.100
The Neural Network Newsletter,

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.840
is a monthly zero-cost newsletter

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.390
where I very succinctly spell
out or list out protocols

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:41.950
for things like sleep, learning,

01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:44.890
neuroplasticity and other topics as well.

01:53:44.890 --> 01:53:46.860
You can go to hubermanlab.com,

01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:48.600
click on the menu, go to newsletter.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.370
It's a simple signup.

01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:52.840
We will not give out your
email information to anybody.

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.330
All our privacy policy is there,

01:53:54.330 --> 01:53:56.690
again at zero cost and
the tools that are there,

01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:58.840
very cleanly spell out a
number of the protocols,

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.870
that you can hear about on the podcast.

01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:03.340
And in closing, I want
to thank you once again

01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.520
for joining me in this discussion

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.450
about the biology-science

01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:10.440
and in particular, the
neuroscience of goal setting,

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.818
goal assessment and achieving goals.

01:54:12.818 --> 01:54:15.508
And last, but certainly not least,

01:54:15.508 --> 01:54:17.224
thank you for your interest in science.

01:54:17.224 --> 01:54:19.807
