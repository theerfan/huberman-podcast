00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.410
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.740
where we discuss science

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.915
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.498
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.920
My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.590
and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.970
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.150
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.510
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.560
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.310
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.440
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.610
In keeping with that theme

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.540
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.740
Our first sponsor today is Theragun.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.890
Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.440
that releases deep muscle tension.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.060
I was first introduced to Theragun in 2017

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.915
while on a laboratory expedition.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:45.840
We were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.900
filming great white sharks

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.770
for my laboratory studies on
fear using virtual reality

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.770
we were working very hard around the clock

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.190
and I and other people on the
trip were picking up a lot

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.460
of aches and pains and just
kind of chronic soreness.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.720
Couple of people had
injuries that were flaring up

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.530
because of all the hard
work and lack of sleep.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.990
Someone had a Theragun

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.760
and pretty soon it was
getting passed around.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.780
It became the most
coveted device on board.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.840
Everyone was using it to work

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.500
on these different sites of soreness.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.330
And I really fell in love
with the thing so much

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.767
so that when I got back, I
immediately purchased one

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.966
and I've used it almost daily ever since,

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:20.290
I use it on muscles that are sore,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.600
I use it on areas that
I'm really working on to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.150
release tension and improve
tissue quality and so forth.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.220
The great thing about
Theragun is it's really quiet

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.170
so you can use it while you're

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.298
in a conversation or while
you're watching a movie

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:34.490
and it doesn't disrupt
those activities at all.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.927
If you want to try Theragun

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:40.927
you can try Theragun by going
to theragun.com/huberman

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.490
to get your gen four
Theragun, they start at $199.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.250
But if you think about it, a
massage, which is an hour long

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.670
or 90 minutes long is typically
in that range of costs.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.470
And this is something
you can use every day

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.200
whenever you want, and even
while enjoying other activities.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.060
So that's theragun.com/huberman.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.103
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is InsideTracker.

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:04.480
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.970
platform that analyzes
data from your blood

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.420
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690
and help you reach your health goals.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.150
The great thing about InsideTracker

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.980
is that it gives you data
that you can make sense of.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.240
I've long been a believer in
getting blood samples taken

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.980
and more recently I've become a believer

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.730
in getting DNA samples taken

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.130
in order to understand what's going

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.660
on at the level of
hormones, metabolic factors

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.600
and other things that profoundly
influence our immediate

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.110
and long-term health.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.480
The problem always has been
getting those samples taken

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.700
and making sense of those samples.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.210
InsideTracker makes all
of that really easy.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.620
They'll even come to your
home to take the samples.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.260
Then you get the information back.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.920
And while typically after
getting information back

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.270
there's these long lists of numbers

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.890
and nobody knows what to do with them,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.370
InsideTracker makes it really easy to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.440
interpret what those numbers mean.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.430
And it points to things

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.710
in terms of lifestyle, exercise,
nutrition, and so forth

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.860
that can help you adjust some

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.510
of the numbers that
you might need to bring

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.380
down or up to put into the
appropriate normal range.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.800
So I find this whole process
to be immensely valuable

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.020
for guiding my health
choices and also just

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.062
for giving me peace of
mind about how my body

00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:14.280
and the rest of my health
are doing internally.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.300
Something you just can't know
without a blood and DNA test.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.193
If you want to try
InsideTracker, you can go

00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:24.106
to insidetracker.com/huberman,
and you'll get 25% off any

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:27.580
of their programs, you want
to put Huberman at checkout.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.170
So that's insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 25% off any

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.680
of InsideTracker's plans and
put Huberman at checkout.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.760
The third sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.300
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.670
probiotic drink.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.172
I started using Athletic Greens in 2012.

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:48.330
So I'm delighted that they're
a sponsor of the podcast.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.140
The reason I started using Athletic Greens

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.820
and the reason I still take
it once or twice per day,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.430
is that I find it very
hard to know what vitamins

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.000
and minerals I need to take.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.130
And by drinking Athletic
Greens, I get it all in one

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.480
easy to consume great tasting formula.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.710
I really do like the way it tastes.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.060
I mix mine with water

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.230
and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.936
And to me it's delicious.

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:11.634
The other thing about Athletic Greens

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:13.812
that I really like are the probiotics

00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:17.570
there are so much data
out there now telling us,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.370
and I certainly believe based
on the data that I've seen

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.030
that probiotics are really
important for support

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.230
of the gut microbiome, the gut
brain axis, the immune system

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.550
and many other aspects of our biology.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.210
So with Athletic Greens,
I get the vitamins

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.720
the minerals and the
probiotics that I need.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.310
If you want to try Athletic Greens

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.880
you can go to athletigreens.com/huberman.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.070
And if you do that, they'll
also give you a year supply

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.180
of vitamin D3K2.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.430
Vitamin D3 we also know
is really important

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.390
for things like immune
system and metabolic support.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.550
So that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman to get

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.460
Athletic Greens and a year's supply

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:58.199
of vitamin D3K2.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.590
And they'll give you
five free travel packs.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.340
Today we're talking all about emotions,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.040
and emotions are central to
our entire experience of life.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.630
Whether or not we're happy or sad

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.280
or depressed or angry
is our life experience.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.930
And yet I think with all the importance

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.180
we've placed on emotions.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.376
Very few people actually
understand how emotions arise

00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:21.210
in our brain and body.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.302
And I mentioned brain and body
because as you'll see today

00:05:24.302 --> 00:05:28.320
emotions really capture the
brain body relationship.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.900
We cannot say that emotions
arise just from what

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.760
happens in our head.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.900
It also involves events, biological events

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.163
chemical events within our body.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.610
The other thing about emotions

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.740
is that there's no real agreement

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.509
as to what's a good
emotion or a bad emotion.

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.720
Today we're gonna talk about the biology

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.920
of the chemicals and pathways
that give rise to emotions.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.619
And I'm going to equip you with several,

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:55.530
if not many tools that
will allow you to regulate

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.538
and change and steer your
emotions should you want,

00:05:57.538 --> 00:06:00.100
but not using the typical advice.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.770
You know, everyone's
probably heard of this thing.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.830
Oh if you're feeling
depressed, just smile,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.230
you know, it's impossible to
be depressed while smiling.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.280
Look, if that were true

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.860
we wouldn't have any depressed people

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.490
because depressed people
don't want to be depressed.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.049
And it is not the case
that simply smiling will

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:17.490
reverse depression or sadness.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.060
And it's simply not the case

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.680
that smiling can inhibit sadness.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.410
It just doesn't work that way.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.860
However, it is the case

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.210
that certain things that are happening

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.060
in our body influence
how our brain functions

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.804
and the chemicals that are released.

00:06:31.804 --> 00:06:35.137
And today we're gonna talk
a lot about how the brain

00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:38.530
and body interact to create
these things called emotions

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.910
in the context of food and nutrition.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.710
And the reason we're doing that is not

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.620
because I am beating the drum

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.680
about particular diet
regimens or anything.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.990
In fact, I'm not gonna do any of that.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.320
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna review some

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.540
of the most important
scientific data that point

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.570
to how ingesting certain
nutrients, both macro nutrients

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.580
like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.850
as well as micronutrients
can impact the chemicals

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.610
in our brain that give rise
to the feelings of being happy

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.920
or sad or sleepy or alert
when you want to be sleepy

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.780
or sleepy when you want to be alert.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.510
So this is sure to be a broad discussion

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.140
and yet we're gonna get very specific

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.313
about what emotions are,
how they arise in the body,

00:07:21.218 --> 00:07:23.093
tools that one can use in order

00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:24.650
to better control their emotions,

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.370
tools that people can
use to believe it or not

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.010
feel happier or feel calmer.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.920
And that's because in
the last 20 years or so

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.580
there's been an explosion
of scientific studies

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.080
exploring how the brain and body interact

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.580
to support certain neurochemicals

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.960
that give us these feelings

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.130
of being alert and happy
or depressed or certain

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.610
that our life is gonna be terrible

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.790
or certain that our life
is going to be great.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.670
So as mysterious as all that might sound

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.080
and confusing as all that might sound

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.870
we're gonna make it very clear today.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.860
And you're gonna come away
from this conversation

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.225
with a lot of tools that
you can act on immediately.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:03.930
And those tools are
grounded in scientific data.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.080
We are gonna provide links

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.044
to several of the studies,
and I'm gonna mention

00:08:07.044 --> 00:08:10.060
several of those studies as we go along.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.640
But overall, the goal today is

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.104
for you to understand how
moods and emotions arise

00:08:14.104 --> 00:08:16.227
and the different pathways in your brain

00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:18.210
and body that allow them to happen

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.580
and how you can use those
pathways to change those emotions

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.070
and the tools that you can rely

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.020
on in very specific ways to shift

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.260
from being, say, slightly
depressed, to feeling happier.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.695
There actually are ways to do that,

00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:35.520
or from feeling too alert and
anxious to feeling calmer.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.577
And these are tools that are distinct

00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:39.690
from the tools I've talked
about in previous episodes.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.485
The discussion around emotions has a long

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:44.390
and rich history going back to Darwin.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.620
And even long before Darwin,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.700
this is a conversation that philosophers

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.180
and scientists have
been having for hundreds

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.763
if not thousands of years.

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:56.000
The idea that Darwin put forth

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.360
and that was really attractive

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.430
for about the last hundred years was

00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:02.070
that emotions are universal and that some

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.790
of the facial expressions
around emotion are universal

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.207
and other people have
capitalized on that idea.

00:09:08.207 --> 00:09:10.200
And to some extent it's true.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.640
I mean, I think that the
two most robust examples

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.440
of that would be when we see something

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.971
or we smell something or we
taste something that we like,

00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.650
there does tend to be
a postural leaning in.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.110
We tend to inhale air at
that time, we tend to bring

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.530
in more of whatever chemical
substances there is.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.860
We tend to these mm's and kind

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.790
of lean in closer to things
that are attractive to us.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.310
And when we see and experience
things that we don't like

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.890
sometimes it's a mild aversion.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.640
We just kind of lean back or look away.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.020
Other times it's an intensive version

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.380
of disgust and we tend to cringe our face.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.740
We tend to avoid inhaling
any of the chemicals.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.740
This probably has roots

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.580
in ancient biological mechanisms
that are to prevent us

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.620
from ingesting things that are bad for us,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.500
chemical compounds and tastes
that might be poisonous.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.441
So much of the foundation
of any discussion

00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:07.970
about emotion has to center
around this kind of push pull

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.750
of attraction to things
or aversion from things.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.600
Now that's a very basic way
of thinking about emotions

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.810
but if you think about
it, it works for a lot

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.720
of different circumstances
and in the brain everywhere

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.980
from the deep circuits of
the brain to the more kind

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.070
of what we call higher order
evolved centers of the brain.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.059
We have this push pull thing where

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.890
either a previous episode,
I talked about go,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.470
the circuits that allow
you to emphasize action

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.910
and then no go circuits, the
circuits and the basal ganglia

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.330
that allow you to de-emphasize
action and prevent action.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.120
We talked about how that's a push pull.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.900
So aversion and attraction
is a push pull too.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.219
Delight or happiness or
excitement are attractions

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:52.663
to certain things and ideas,
songs, people, places, foods

00:10:52.663 --> 00:10:55.168
aversion is a leaning out.

00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:57.576
It's a disgust, it's an avoidance.

00:10:57.576 --> 00:11:01.145
And so we can break down the
discussion about emotions

00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:04.540
into these simpler versions of themselves,

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.997
but at the core of that
of attraction or aversion

00:11:07.997 --> 00:11:11.930
is an important theme that
you might realize already.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.256
But most people tend to overlook

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.200
which is that there's an action there

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.378
you're either moving forward

00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:19.880
or you're moving away from something.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.338
And any time you're talking about action

00:11:21.338 --> 00:11:24.860
in the nervous system, you're
talking about motor behaviors.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.180
You're talking about
literally the contraction

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.660
of muscles to move you
toward or away from things.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.437
And any time you're talking about nerve

00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:35.230
to muscle and action, you're
talking about the brain

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.944
and the body, because the
brain can't move itself

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:43.620
that the brain has a body so
that the organism can move.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.208
And the body has a brain so

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:47.880
that the organism, you,
can move toward or away

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.430
from things that you deem
to be good or bad for you.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.650
Now, some of these things that
we're attracted to and some

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.410
of them that we avoid are what
we call innate or hardwired.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.940
You know, when we taste bitter compounds,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.810
I'm not saying about bitter

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.310
like a little bit of a
bitters in your drink

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.420
or something like that, but
really bitter compounds.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.460
We tend to avoid those

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.520
because they're associated with poisons.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.397
When we taste things that
are sweet or that are savory

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:15.740
we tend to pursue more of those.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.831
We tend to lean toward those so to speak

00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.130
and we tend to not avoid them.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.430
So there are circuits in the brain

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.640
for aversion and for
attraction toward things.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.240
And the body is governing a lot of that.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.200
And so immediately in this conversation

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.056
I want to raise an important point

00:12:31.056 --> 00:12:34.008
which is about a nerve pathway that many,

00:12:34.008 --> 00:12:37.220
many people have heard of that
gets discussed all the time.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.834
And that is one of the
most kind of oversold

00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:43.480
for the wrong reasons and
undersold, unfortunately,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.890
for its real power,
which is the vagus nerve.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.580
So the vagus nerve is one, not the only,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.230
but one way in which our brain

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.223
and body are connected and
regulates our emotional states.

00:12:56.223 --> 00:12:59.560
Now, many of you have probably
heard about polyvagal theory.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.070
I'm gonna talk about this today.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.906
Polyvagal theory was
popularized by Stephen Porges

00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:06.289
and it's an interesting theory,

00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:10.170
certain aspects of it, frankly,
hold up to the science,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.820
some of it doesn't.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.495
And I'm gonna discuss all of that today.

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:17.070
A lot of the vagus and the excitement

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.620
about the vagus, V-A-G-U-S,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.970
is because it's somehow got
into the mind of the public

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.180
that the vagus is involved
in calming us down.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.580
So what is the vagus nerve?

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.960
Okay, we're gonna make this really simple,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.280
in particular for those
that are just listening,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.310
you can just imagine this,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.840
for those are watching I'll
point to the various areas,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.860
but basically vagus is
the 10th cranial nerve

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.376
which basically means that the neurons,

00:13:43.376 --> 00:13:46.210
the control center of
each of those neurons

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.120
in the vagus lives just kind
of near the neck, right?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.600
And a branch of the vagus
goes into the brain.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.220
They send a little wire into the brain.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.270
The other branch goes into the periphery

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.970
but not just the gut.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.080
It goes into the stomach, the intestines

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.690
the heart, the lungs,
and the immune system.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.720
So this vagus nerve is incredible

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.240
because it's taking information

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.360
from the body and it has two directions.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.240
The first is what we call sensory.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.130
So it's sensing things that
are happening in the gut

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.660
in the lungs, everything,
for example, in the lungs

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.190
when our lungs are distended,
the vagus nerve senses that

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.650
and sends that information
up into the brain.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.560
It also consents things in
the gut like how distended

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.950
or empty your stomach happens to be,

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.320
it can sense heart rate.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.330
It can sense your immune
system, whether or not

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.620
you have bacteria or things
invading you in your body.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.550
So it sends that
information up to the brain.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.520
So it's a two-way street

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.780
and sensory information
is going up to the brain.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.157
That's all vagus.

00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:44.190
So it's like a super
highway sensory information

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.160
going one way and in the other
direction is motor control.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.190
So the vagus is not
just for sensing things.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.560
It's actually for controlling things.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.033
It's got a sensory pathway
and a motor pathway.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.784
So that's the first thing I
think everyone should know

00:14:56.784 --> 00:14:58.020
about the vagus.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.770
In fact, it's so important
that I feel like this is as

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.120
important as people knowing

00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:05.840
that walking involves
flexors and extensors.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.200
And if you don't think that's
important, it's as important

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.730
as walking, frankly,
because the vagus is the way

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.670
in which you can govern
the brain body connection.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.180
And in which you can steer
various aspects of your mood

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.340
and wellbeing, but most people

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.240
just don't understand how to use it.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.970
So first you got to understand what it is.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.570
So you've got sensory information coming

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.665
from all these different organs
of the body up to the brain.

00:15:25.665 --> 00:15:27.500
You've got motor information going

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.150
from the brain back to the body.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.580
And so you've got this
super highway within you.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.130
Now what actually regulates the vagus.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.460
Oftentimes you'll hear things

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.220
like, oh this particular behavior

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.670
rubbing your face at a
particular location or breathing

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.960
in a particular way, or
a warm bath or something

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.580
stimulates the vagus.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.776
Well, right now, I want
everyone to know that,

00:15:49.776 --> 00:15:53.680
quote unquote, stimulating
the vagus broadly speaking

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.970
is a terrible way to think about the vagus

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.460
because do you know what,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.300
if you have a contaminant inside your body

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.640
the vagus senses that and
projects that information

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.640
to your brain, and you
start to generate a fever

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.020
you start to try and kill
that contaminant in your body.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.410
So I don't know that you want
to stimulate the vagus just

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.960
as a general theme today,
we're going to get specific

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.924
about how you can activate
particular circuits,

00:16:17.924 --> 00:16:21.220
certain pathways from
certain organs to the brain

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.740
in order to feel better or
relieve certain conditions.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.920
But you certainly don't want
to just stimulate the vagus.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.969
Now excitement about the vagus in part

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:34.710
is because of what quite honestly,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.810
was a fairly pioneering
theory about the vagus

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.330
which is his polyvagal theory.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.170
So polyvagal, the word poly means many,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.320
is cool because it acknowledges

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.200
that the vagus has a lot
of different branches.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.790
It's not just one thing.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.150
And so I really liked that.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.130
I liked the naming polyvagal.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.172
The idea that Porges has
put forward was that there's

00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:58.280
a dorsal vagus, which is
kind of runs in the back

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.720
of the spinal cord, which
is involved in alertness

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.610
and activation and kind of
fight or flight type stuff.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.640
And that there's a ventral pathway

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.957
and that that's involved in
more kind of empathic behaviors.

00:17:09.957 --> 00:17:13.240
That is not quite in agreement

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.520
with the modern anatomy,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.750
but he was doing the best
with what he had at the time.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.290
So, okay.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.870
The problem I have with
the polyvagal theory

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.630
is the way that it's
discussed people often say,

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.680
oh if your dorsal vagus is too active

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.202
then you tend to be someone
who's a little too keyed

00:17:30.202 --> 00:17:32.470
up and people who are kind
of in a state of freeze

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.190
or kind of flacid and kind of

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.056
like just not really active

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:40.000
and they're just lethargic.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.030
Well, then that pathway is hypoactive.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.290
It should be more active.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.918
So there are a lot

00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:46.720
of theories about how
psychology maps onto the vagus.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.380
That as far as I know, don't
map to any real physiology.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.130
Now, the other problem with this kind

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.770
of the way that the
polyvagal theory is discussed

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.200
probably not by the real
experts, but by a lot of people

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.290
is that people start to
diagnose different psychological

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.780
and physical manifestations
through the vagus.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.130
They would say things like, Oh

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.090
this person is hyper
flexible at the joints

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.050
and therefore their dorsal
vagus isn't active enough

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.150
or something like that.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.120
And it's really kind of gone
way outside the lane lines.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.320
So today we're gonna
clean up a lot of that.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.500
Let's make it really simple

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.190
about how the vagus actually works.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.080
At least as we understand
it today in 2021.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.410
First of all, as I mentioned,
you have sensory information

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.470
the same way that you
detect light with your eyes

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.980
or you hear sounds with
your ears, you have sensors

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.630
in your gut that sense how
full or empty your gut is.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.550
It can also sense how acidic your gut is.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.650
It can sense various
things within your gut.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.780
Your heart is doing the same.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.850
It's informing the brain how
fast your heart is beating,

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.080
how full your lungs are
has been communicated

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.100
and then the status of your immune system.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.690
So the way to think

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.420
about the vagus is the
same way I would think

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.870
about the eyes.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.820
The eyes are looking at colors,
they're looking at motion

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.117
they're looking how bright it is.

00:19:01.117 --> 00:19:03.130
And each one of those things,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.380
those features is telling the
brain something different.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.730
So the brain can decide
when to be awake or asleep

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.563
whether or not it's looking

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:11.720
at somebody's attractive or unattractive.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.549
The vagus nerve is also
analyzing many features

00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:17.360
within the body and informing the brain

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.910
of how to feel about that and what to do.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.127
So a really good example that
I think is an exciting one is

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:26.970
as it relates to sugar.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.390
So we all know that sweet
things generally tastes good.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.210
I'm not particularly a
fan of very sweet things.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.720
You know, I'd much rather have

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.470
cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.350
I like savory fatty foods,
but I do like sweet foods.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.030
And most people find sweet
foods to be attractive.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.620
They want them, they might

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.700
or they might not be able
to regulate their behavior

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.570
around them, but they want them.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.970
And what's really interesting
is that for hundreds of years

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.010
people have thought that that's

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.750
because of the way that sweet foods taste.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.820
So that makes sense, right?

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.100
You eat something that tastes sweet.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.470
You want more of it.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.990
Well, it turns out

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.860
that it's much more interesting than that.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.570
When you eat something sweet

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.320
within your stomach,
you have cells, neurons,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.290
that sense the presence of sugary foods

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.770
independent of their taste
and signal to the brain.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.320
So those sensors, those
neurons send information

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.170
up the vagus to your brain

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.780
goes through a series of stations.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.580
And then you release dopamine.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.705
This molecule that makes you want more

00:20:31.705 --> 00:20:34.410
of whatever it is that you just ingested.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.480
In fact, this pathway is so powerful

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.960
that they've done experiments

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.440
where they completely numb all the taste

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.500
and feeling in somebody's
mouth they're blindfolded.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.490
So they don't know what they're eating

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.840
and they're eating a food.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.970
That's either sugary or not sugary.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.160
And what they find is

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.870
that even though people
can't taste the sugary food

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.730
they crave more of the
food that contains sugar

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.500
because of the sensors in
the gut, that sense sugar.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.690
So to put this differently,
you actually have sensors

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.160
within your body that make you crave sugar

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.300
independent of the sweet
taste of those things.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.570
Now that's incredible.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.840
And what it does, and what it tells us is

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.840
that we have circuits in
our body that are driving us

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.906
towards certain behaviors
and making us feel good

00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:22.250
even though we can't perceive them.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.970
Now, for those of you
that are really interested

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.830
in gut intuition and kind of gut feelings

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.310
this is a gut feeling except
this is a chemical gut feeling.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.640
This is a particular set of
neurons detecting that something

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.595
in your body has a particular feature,

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:38.829
in this case the presence of sugars,

00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:41.059
and sending information to the brain

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:44.040
essentially to control your behavior.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.960
And I find this remarkable,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.410
because what it means is
that what we call attractive

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.500
isn't always coming from our thoughts

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.630
about that or our feelings,
or even our perception.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.400
We are drawn to particular
foods and we're drawn

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.490
to perhaps also to
particular people, places

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.320
and other things because of information

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.940
that's coming from our body.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.063
And we're gonna talk about

00:22:07.063 --> 00:22:08.040
what one can do with this information.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.400
I know many people are thoughtful
or concerned about sugars

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.760
these days thinking we
all ingest too much sugar.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.120
There's sugar snuck into
all the things we eat.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.190
And indeed, that's true.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.750
I mean, this should completely
reframe the way that we think

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.050
about the sort of so-called
hidden sugars in foods.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.810
What this means is that even
if a food is very savory

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.700
like a piece of pizza or a piece of bread

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.520
or even like a salad dressing

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.180
if there's sugar snuck into
that and you can't taste it

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.370
you will still crave more of that thing

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.600
without knowing that you
crave it because it has sugar.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.028
In other words,

00:22:44.028 --> 00:22:45.160
you might find yourself
wanting certain foods

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.570
and not knowing why you want those foods.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.600
So I find this to be a fascinating aspect

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.524
of our biology and yes, it
relates to mood and emotion.

00:22:52.524 --> 00:22:55.250
And we'll talk about
how that is in a moment.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.984
So let's just back up a
bit and ask the question

00:22:57.984 --> 00:23:00.660
why do we eat certain things?

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.480
And why do certain
foods make us feel good?

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.070
And other foods actually
make us feel anxious.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.710
I think some people may
be familiar with this.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.090
Other people might not,

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:13.740
but most people don't realize
that as you approach eating

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.290
there's an anxiety associated with that.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.903
It's an alertness.

00:23:17.903 --> 00:23:19.420
Remember in the previous discussions,

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.030
or even if you don't and
you haven't seen those,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.656
all of your moods and feelings
of wellbeing are anchored

00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:28.370
on this continuum of
alertness versus calmness.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.890
And we hear so often
about rest and digest.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.180
You know that, oh, after
we eat, we feel really nice

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.087
and full, hopefully comfortably
full and not too full.

00:23:36.087 --> 00:23:37.530
And we're relaxing.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.630
And we feel satiated, it's
associated with serotonin

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.480
this molecule of satiation.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.130
That's all true.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.400
But what most people don't
know is that there's an area

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.250
of the hypothalamus.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.780
So deepen the brain kind of
in the middle deep portion

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.650
of the brain called the
lateral hypothalamus.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.220
And the lateral hypothalamus
is really interesting

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.580
because it controls feeding,
but it inhibits feeding.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.990
It stops us from feeding.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.150
And there's another area in the brain.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.510
If you want names, I'll give them to you.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.180
If you don't want names, just ignore them,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.306
delete them from your
memory and awareness,

00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:12.160
called the locus coeruleus,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.011
now the locus coeruleus sits back further

00:24:14.011 --> 00:24:16.670
in the brainstem and it
releases norepinephrine

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.520
which is essentially adrenaline.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.727
It makes us feel alert.

00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:22.540
Now, locus coeruleus has a
lot of different functions

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.690
in the brain, but when we are going to eat

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.150
let's say we walk into a
restaurant, we sit down

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.990
or we're preparing a meal,

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.810
locus coeruleus is known

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.120
to release noradrenaline in the brain.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.190
It's creating a kind of alertness.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.350
This has ancient utility, but
it's creating this alertness.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.980
And for many people, they experience

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.110
that as they approach
food as stress as anxiety.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.850
But what's interesting is
that as we approach food

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.787
locus coeruleus is releasing
all these molecules

00:24:51.787 --> 00:24:54.510
that make us feel more anxious and alert

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.130
sometimes it's felt as excitement.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.360
And that asks probably to do
with how we feel about food

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.597
generally, are we happy with
our relationship with food?

00:25:00.597 --> 00:25:02.880
Are we trying to restrict
our relationship to food,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.070
are people coming over for
dinner, all that will play

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.190
in of course, but there's a certain stress

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.920
and anxiety upon approach to food.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.220
And as we approach food
and we feel that anxiety

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.769
locus coeruleus activates
the lateral hypothalamus

00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:20.883
in a way that inhibits feeding

00:25:20.883 --> 00:25:23.210
that makes us not want to eat.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.680
So a lot of people who have kind

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.720
of pre-meal anxiety or anxiety around food

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.730
and they can't seem to just calm down

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.220
and have a good meal to access
that later rest and digest.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.580
A lot of that is because

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.640
of this heightened stress upon
approach to food and a lot

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.900
of the tools that are out
there, both for eating disorders

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.700
and for just kind of the general
public who isn't suffering

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.040
from eating disorders, things
like mindfulness around meals.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.873
You know, they always tell you

00:25:48.873 --> 00:25:50.510
you should never eat when stressed.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.280
I'm sorry, but my life is not organized

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.310
in a way that I can do that.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.450
I would never eat.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.200
Right because I eat when I'm awake

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.100
and I don't know if I'm stressed,

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.336
but I don't think I am but I tend to

00:26:00.336 --> 00:26:02.300
run around a lot during the day.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.750
I don't generally take time to do two

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.360
or three deep breaths before I eat.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.363
I generally will just eat.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.433
That can be healthy

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:13.180
or unhealthy depending on the
quality of your digestion.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.377
I think using digestion
as a guide is good,

00:26:15.377 --> 00:26:19.740
but a lot of people aren't
aware that this interaction

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.890
between locus coeruleus
and lateral hypothalamus

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.770
is a basic mechanism
where we are supposed to

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.920
get a little bit alert and
anxious around mealtime.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.740
And then as we eat, the mechanisms

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.810
for calming and satiation
are supposed to kick in

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.620
and those mechanisms involve

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.060
as I mentioned earlier, two things.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.490
One is how things taste,
digestion starts in the mouth.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.393
Of course, we taste our food.

00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:45.130
Everyone tells us we
should chew our food more.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.480
Yes, that can improve digestion.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.640
We're not supposed to drink
too many fluids as we eat.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.447
That's true too, but a lot
of how we feel while we eat

00:26:53.447 --> 00:26:56.870
and after we eat is because

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.480
of this vagus sensing
of what's in our gut.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.920
It's sending information all the time.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.181
Is there sugar?

00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:06.200
Are there fats?

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.260
Are there contaminants?

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.640
There are a lot of information.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.440
These so-called parallel
pathways that are going

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.150
up into our brain that regulate whether

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.400
or not we want to eat
more of something or not.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.890
And there are accelerators,

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.536
things that make us want to
eat more, like sugar and fats

00:27:20.536 --> 00:27:22.430
because those are nutrient dense.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.670
And they helps generally,
at least in the short term

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.170
support the survival of animals,

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.130
but also amino acids.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.928
And this is very important.

00:27:30.928 --> 00:27:33.130
There are a lot of data,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:38.130
but much of what comes from
the data on what people eat

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.052
and how much they eat is
from a subconscious detection

00:27:42.052 --> 00:27:47.052
of how many amino acids
and what the array,

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.700
meaning the constellation of
amino acids is in a given food.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.780
And it's fair to say that the sum total

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.730
of these studies pointing
in a direction where

00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.730
people will basically eat, not
until their stomach is full

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.530
but until the brain perceives

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.880
that they have adequate
intake of amino acids.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.450
Now, this is a conversation
that comes up in the context of

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.780
you know, the meat, only the keto,

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.810
the kind of zone diet,

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.620
the Mediterranean diet, the vegan diet.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.620
I'm largely going to ignore
the kind of strict camps today.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.140
I will talk a little bit about it,

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.937
because I think each one
of them actually taps

00:28:26.937 --> 00:28:28.880
into something important about this brain

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.600
body relationship that
the other ones don't.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.450
But I don't want to get
into a discussion about

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.470
the ethics of different foods

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.900
of animal based or non animal based.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.310
'Cause that's not the topic today.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.780
It's really about nutrient
sensing and amino acid sensing.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.200
So we generally will eat

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.490
until our gut tells our brain
that we have adequate amounts

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.510
of these amino acids.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.360
Amino acids of course are important

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.500
because they are the building
blocks of sure, muscle,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.530
and the other things in
our body that need repair.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.113
But what most people don't realize

00:28:58.113 --> 00:29:02.640
is that amino acids are
what the neurochemicals

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.433
in the brain are made from.

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:06.720
Now, this is vitally important.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.110
Okay, so we've heard
dopamine is this molecule

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.210
that makes you feel good.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.800
Actually dopamine is a molecule
that makes you feel good.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.317
It's released within the brain.

00:29:15.317 --> 00:29:18.734
And it does feel very good
when you have dopamine release,

00:29:18.734 --> 00:29:22.760
dopamine releases caused
by surprise, excitement,

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.236
events that you're looking
forward to and they turnout well,

00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:28.250
it is inhibited by events
you're looking forward

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.540
to that don't work out when someone says

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.690
they're going to call that you're really

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.600
really excited to talk
to, and then they don't,

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.790
or you thought a movie
was gonna be really great

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.450
and it's not, or you expect a
meal to be really delicious.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.260
And it's kind of, eh, and we actually

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.093
there's a name for that.

00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:44.710
It's called reward prediction error.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.110
And you can actually
use this in the context

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.420
of meals and plans in a
way that's very useful

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.860
with yourself and people you know,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.280
essentially if you expect
something to be really terrific

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.249
it really does place a higher expectation

00:29:59.249 --> 00:30:01.120
at the chemical level.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.630
So if you don't get as much dopamine

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.762
as you're expecting from something,

00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:07.910
so you you hear about a
really great restaurant

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.208
or a place that has a really, in my case,

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.165
I have, I wouldn't call it an addiction.

00:30:12.165 --> 00:30:14.060
I would call it more of an
affliction for croissants.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.300
The best vegetable of
course, is the croissant.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.590
And I get really excited

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.530
about the fact that someone will tell me,

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.850
oh there's this place and they
have incredible croissants.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.820
You gotta go there.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.380
So I get really excited, and I'll go.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.920
And just them telling me

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.300
that it's gonna be really terrific

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.820
raises an expectation,
a dopamine expectation.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.020
And unless those croissants are amazing

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.460
chances are I'm going to experience them

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.350
as less good, less satisfying.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.210
I will truly release less
dopamine than I would

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.260
had they just said, oh yeah,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.150
I think that there are
croissants down the street.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.760
Or if I just tried one at random,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.310
and that's because of this
reward prediction error

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.238
your expectation of
something releases dopamine

00:30:54.238 --> 00:30:58.070
and the actual event releases dopamine.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.950
And if the event related dopamine does not

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.280
exceed the expectation or

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.290
at least match it, there's
a much higher tendency

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.550
that you won't pursue that thing again.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.150
So dopamine is really powerful

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.360
and it's not just the molecule of reward.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.010
It is the molecule of desire.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.784
It's the molecule of wanting

00:31:15.784 --> 00:31:18.450
not just the molecule of having.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.119
And a book, since people often
ask for book recommendations.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:23.800
I don't know the author
personally, but I love the book.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.370
It's called "The Molecule Of More".

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.750
It's a terrific book.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.238
I wish I had written it, frankly,

00:31:28.238 --> 00:31:29.920
but if you want to learn more

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.690
about dopamine reward prediction error

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.880
and how dopamine regulates
various aspects of your emotional

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.080
and motivational life,
it's a terrific read.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.710
Dopamine is what's going to
lead us to want to eat more

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.190
of something or to not
want more of something,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.180
because dopamine really is about craving.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.150
It's about motivation
and it's about desire.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.470
And as I mentioned,
these amino acid sensors

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.810
in our gut are detecting
how many amino acids

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.340
but they're also detecting
which amino acids.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.320
And there's a particular
amino acid called L-tyrosine

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.970
which comes from food.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.510
You can look up online, which
foods contain L-tyrosine.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.740
It is in meats.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.700
It is in nuts.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.564
It is also in some plant-based foods.

00:32:10.564 --> 00:32:15.564
L-tyrosine is the precursor
to a couple other molecules

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.650
like L-DOPA, et cetera,
that make dopamine.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.294
And so there's a misconception
out there that most

00:32:22.294 --> 00:32:25.147
of the serotonin is in our gut.

00:32:25.147 --> 00:32:27.277
And most of the dopamine is in our gut.

00:32:27.277 --> 00:32:29.930
And therefore our mood is in our gut.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:31.650
That's not quite the way it works.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.530
Okay. we'll talk about
serotonin in a moment

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.190
but dopamine is synthesized

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.920
from the amino acids that you eat.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.240
However, the dopamine
neurons that give rise

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.999
to these feelings of good or wanting more

00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:48.680
or desire and motivation,
those reside in the brain.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.950
So we don't want to get too confused.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.070
We want to respect and honor the power

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.050
of the gut and this vagal
pathway, but it's really neurons

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.530
within your brain that drive the pursuit

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.660
and decision-making,
so what does this mean?

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.500
Well, some people make
too little dopamine.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.560
Some people make so
little dopamine that they

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.340
need prescription dopamine.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.450
They need L-DOPA, people
with Parkinson's take L-DOPA

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.450
and other compounds to increase dopamine

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.950
because Parkinson's is associated
with deficits in movement,

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.690
starts as a tremor,

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.490
actually starts with some other
things that are interesting.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.480
We'll talk about in a moment,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.570
but Parkinson's is a depression.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.070
It's a blunting of motivation

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.570
and mood and effect, and it's a tremor.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.250
And then eventually in severe conditions

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.640
it's challenges in speaking and walking so

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.470
that some famous examples
would be Muhammad Ali,

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:41.330
Michael J. Fox, the great
boxing trainer, Freddie Roach,

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.030
like these people have
Parkinson's and they

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.810
at least later in their life
had challenges speaking.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.949
Now it's not just fighters
that develop Parkinson's as far

00:33:49.949 --> 00:33:54.279
as I know, Michael J.
Fox wasn't a fighter.

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:55.980
People can develop Parkinson's

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.690
and Parkinson's is a depletion

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.200
of dopamine neurons in the brain.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.120
And it's not just movement challenges.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.650
It's challenges with mood.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:03.920
Now, hopefully most of you

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.970
all of you don't have Parkinson's,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:09.390
but it's clear that dietary L-tyrosine

00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:14.390
supports the healthy production
of things like dopamine

00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:17.370
and as well as other
factors within the brain.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:19.924
Now, some people immediately ask,

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:20.860
well should I supplement L-tyrosine?

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.050
So let's just talk about that

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.190
because that's gonna come up.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.640
Full disclosure, I
sometimes take L-tyrosine.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.680
I'm not taking it right now,

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.550
but I take it only occasionally,

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.580
you can buy this in capsule form.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.600
It does increase kind of a mood
and elevation and alertness.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.720
It is over the counter.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.960
You have to check with your doctor.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.470
I'm not responsible for your healthcare

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.010
and I'm not a doctor, whether
or not it's safe for you,

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.960
people with preexisting
hyper dopaminergic conditions

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.458
like mania should probably
not take L-tyrosine.

00:34:48.458 --> 00:34:49.410
The other thing

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.100
about taking L-tyrosine
is there is a crash, okay?

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.910
It's not a massive crash if you take it

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:56.260
at appropriate doses
and it's right for you

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.060
but it can produce a crash and a lethargy

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.590
and a kind of brain fog
after the next day or so.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:07.590
And so L-tyrosine however
can be ingested through foods

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.910
or through supplementation
to increase dopamine levels.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.306
That's well-known, taken
chronically however,

00:35:12.306 --> 00:35:14.940
it can disrupt those dopamine pathways.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.100
Now there are other drugs
that will increase L-tyrosine

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.580
and dopamine as well.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.660
But those are severe enough

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.720
that they generally tend to
have addictive properties.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.190
So things like methamphetamine,

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.680
things like cocaine are terrible
because they really ramp

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.200
up the dopamine system so much

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.090
that people really can't
achieve dopamine release

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.700
through any other mechanisms.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.170
But food and the ingestion

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.130
of L-tyrosine has a profound effect

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.541
on our levels of dopamine.

00:35:38.541 --> 00:35:39.889
It takes a little while

00:35:39.889 --> 00:35:43.430
but that really will impact level of mood.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.696
Certain antidepressants fall

00:35:44.696 --> 00:35:48.050
into the category of
dopaminergic antidepressants.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.060
One of the most famous ones
of course is Wellbutrin.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.600
Wellbutrin with developed

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.649
because a lot of the other antidepressants

00:35:54.649 --> 00:35:57.100
tend to make people feel kind of lethargic

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.900
or they had side effect profiles
that people didn't like.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.120
So they developed this thing that,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.100
the generic name is different,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.780
but it's generally called Wellbutrin.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.630
Wellbutrin activates dopamine

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.660
and epinephrin, which is
a substrate of dopamine.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.800
And both of those are involved

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.420
in motivation and alertness and effort.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.280
So you might say, wow, this
sounds like a great drug.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.032
However, this drug,

00:36:18.032 --> 00:36:20.560
the side effect profile
tends to be the things

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.020
that are associated with
elevated mood and alertness.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.150
So this isn't like taking some L-tyrosine.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.230
This isn't like eating
some tyrosine rich foods.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:29.760
This is really a much greater release

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.650
of dopamine and epinephrin,
and it increases things

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.410
like anxiety, sweating, the pupils dilate.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.060
It has certain effects
on, in particular people

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.120
with epilepsy, it's been
used somewhat successfully

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.420
for smoking cessation, but
again, it's not for everybody

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.130
and I'm not here to encourage
the use of these things.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.500
I'm just describing the biology

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.700
and the rationale for why
these drugs were developed.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.430
So let's back up a second.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.070
Let's just kind of take
stock of where we're at.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.600
We have a brain body connection.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.940
There are many of them, but one

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.610
of the main ones is the vagus nerve.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.110
The vagus collects information

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.060
about a lot of things,
breathing, heart rate stuff

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.030
that's happening in the gut, et cetera,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.460
and gut by the way, includes
the stomach and the intestines,

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.750
sends that information up to the brain.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.440
The brain is using that information

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.170
to decide one of two things,

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.660
move toward something or move away.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.670
It can also pause,

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.500
but essentially pausing
is not moving toward.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.760
So that's the dopamine
pathway and foods rich

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.550
in L-tyrosine generally
give us an elevated mood

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.930
and make us want to do more

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.390
of whatever it is that we
happen to be doing as well

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.260
as other things, motivation, generalizes

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.290
to other things it's not
unique to just ingesting foods

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.300
but foods that give us a big pulse

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.615
of dopamine will make us
crave more of that food.

00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:44.080
It will make us crave more

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.950
of the activity that led to
the ingestion of that food.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.320
And as I mentioned earlier,
a lot of that is happening

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.150
at a subconscious level that
you're not even aware of.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.076
And this is why I think the
concern about hidden sugars

00:37:55.076 --> 00:37:57.880
and over ingestion of sugars

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.084
is serious because it's not just

00:38:00.084 --> 00:38:01.793
that the sugars are impacting

00:38:01.793 --> 00:38:04.210
our blood glucose in negative ways.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.420
Although often it is,

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.290
it's not just the obesity
crisis that's happening.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.300
It's also the fact

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.260
that it's disrupting our dopamine systems.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.390
Now that doesn't mean all sugar is bad.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.460
Some people have a quite
healthy relationship to sugar

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.120
but I think most people are just not aware

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.030
that sugar isn't just
operating at the level

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.720
of taste it's operating at the level

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.980
of neurochemicals and it's
doing it subconsciously.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.160
So I'd like to talk about
some of the other pathways

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.750
between brain and body that
regulate our moods and emotions

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.309
but also are actionable.

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:35.435
So the other neuromodulator
that's really interesting

00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:39.320
in the context of the vagus is serotonin.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.720
Serotonin, just to remind
you is a neuromodulator

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.190
therefore it creates a bias
in which neural circuits

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.180
which neurons in the brain and
body are going to be active

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.080
and it makes it less likely the other ones

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.040
are going to be active.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.268
I think it's fair to say
without ever having measured it

00:38:55.268 --> 00:38:58.947
that my bulldog Costello, just his brain

00:38:58.947 --> 00:39:01.530
and body must be swimming in serotonin,

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.660
because he's very calm and he eats a lot

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.340
but he generally feels pretty sated.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.720
He's kind of an animal that's
obsessed with comforts.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.850
He's a bit of a hedonist, and
serotonin when it's elevated

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.140
tends to make us feel really comfortable

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.030
and kind of blissed out wherever we are.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.490
And that contrast with
dopamine and epinephrin

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.210
which mainly put us in pursuit of things.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.290
Motivation is pursuit.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.750
Serotonin is more about
feeling really comfy

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.583
where we are.

00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:34.900
The conversation around the
brain body relationship and mood

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.920
and serotonin for many years
was, well, you eat a big meal.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.040
The gut is distended.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.340
You've got all the nutrients you need

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.870
you rest and digest and
serotonin is released.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.985
That's sorta true, but
there's a lot more going

00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:48.776
on and a lot more that's interesting

00:39:48.776 --> 00:39:51.100
and actionable that's going on.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.920
First of all, some of you,

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.120
but perhaps not all have heard that more

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.080
than 90% of the serotonin
that we make is in our gut.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.900
And indeed we have a lot
of serotonin in our gut.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.210
We have neurons in our
gut that makes serotonin.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.960
We have neurons in our
brain that make serotonin,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.960
but here's the deal.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.590
Most of the serotonin
that impacts our mood

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.620
and our mental state is not in our gut.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.249
Most of it is in the neurons of the brain

00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:19.090
in an area called the
raphae nucleus of the brain,

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.890
there are a few other locations too,

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.360
and those are the neurons that control

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.740
whether or not we feel satiated or not.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.451
Whether or not we feel happy and calm.

00:40:27.451 --> 00:40:29.820
You can't have a
discussion about serotonin

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.430
without having discussion
about antidepressants.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.450
Because during the late
eighties and early nineties

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.920
there was this explosion

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.470
in the number of prescription
drugs that were released.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.760
Things like first one and most
famous one is Prozac, Zoloft

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.300
and Paxil, a number of other
ones that are so-called SSRI

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.443
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.760
That's a long acronym, but
basically those drugs work

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.760
by preventing the gobbling
up of serotonin or re-uptake

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.430
of serotonin into neurons
after it's been released

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.600
which leads to more serotonin overall

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.150
which means to elevate serotonin.

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:11.240
And indeed those drugs
were and can be very useful

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.130
for certain people to feel better in cases

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.130
of depression and some other
clinical disorders as well.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.180
So I really don't want to dismiss them

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.720
as useless or dangerous for everybody.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.660
They can be quite useful for many people.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.540
Not everyone responds well to them

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.180
as I'm sure you've all heard.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.760
And their side effect profile has affects

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.820
like blunting affect.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.160
It can make people feel kind of flat,

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.830
kinda meh, it can reduce
appetite for food.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.350
It can reduce appetite for sex.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.440
It can do all sorts of things,
or it can work really well.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.770
Sometimes it's a dose-related
issue, et cetera.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.050
Serotonin is fascinating however,

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.470
because how well those neurons

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:55.920
in the raphe work is impacted
by some events within the gut.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.150
Although you might be surprised to find

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.320
out what those events are.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.130
So let's go a little
bit deeper into the gut.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.780
And again, the gut includes the stomach

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.900
and then the small intestine
in the large intestine

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.946
and ask like, what is going
on with serotonin in the gut?

00:42:09.946 --> 00:42:12.633
How is it impacting
serotonin in the brain?

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.010
And let's think about this in the context

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.520
of how some of us might want to increase

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.330
or decrease our serotonin levels.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:25.330
So as far as I know, there
aren't any really good

00:42:25.353 --> 00:42:29.280
at home blood tests for things
like serotonin and dopamine.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.940
There's some commercial
products out there.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.950
But to me, just to me, I'm
not particularly impressed.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:35.783
You know, it's not the same

00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:37.990
as getting your hormones levels measured

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.280
or your metabolic factors
measured, that's can be daunting.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.981
It can be done rigorously.

00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:44.470
There are tests out there.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.010
There are even some, believe it or not.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.700
There's some questionnaires that,

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.460
and I think actually
last year it made some

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.580
of the bigger newspapers,

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.830
are you more of a dopamine or a serotonin?

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.320
Are you a this or that?

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.860
I find that stuff to be a little silly

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.190
although I do appreciate,
and like the fact

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.640
that people are thinking about and talking

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.390
about neuromodulators there aren't really

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.730
great ways to measure these
things outside the clinic.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.870
There's some great clinical
tools that you can get inside

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.970
of a hospital or from a
proper endocrinologist

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.430
or neurologist, but no great at-home tool.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.650
So maybe that's a call to arms

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:15.900
for some of you entrepreneurial folks

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.160
out there to create these
tests, accurate tests please,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.720
that could be done at home.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.680
But some people feel
like they're too anxious

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.960
or they're always in a motivated state

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.710
and they're trying to
adjust their serotonin.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.020
Many people adjust their
serotonin by just eating more food

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.180
and carbohydrate rich foods
will increase serotonin.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.970
I've talked about this
on a previous podcast

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.140
but I personally am a big fan

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.580
at least for me is I usually fast

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.830
and exercise in the early part of the day

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.830
I eat a relatively high protein
and moderate fat zero carb

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.500
or low carb meal at lunch in
the afternoon to stay alert

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.790
because those foods tend to
favor dopamine production

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:57.980
acetylcholine production,

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.000
epinephrin production and alertness.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.520
My mood is generally pretty
good most of the time.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.030
And then as evening comes
around and I'm concerned

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.735
about sleep and a good
night's sleep, not concerned

00:44:08.735 --> 00:44:11.670
in an anxious way, but I want
to get a good night's sleep.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.640
I will ingest foods that
promote serotonin release

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.550
because they contain a lot of tryptophan.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.530
So if I do eat meat,

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.130
it would be like a
white meat, turkey meat.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.530
I don't tend to, I've never liked turkey.

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.570
I don't mind the animal

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.602
but I don't like ingesting the meat,

00:44:24.602 --> 00:44:28.890
but starchy carbohydrates
will increase serotonin.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:32.250
Some people also will take serotonin.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.945
You can now buy 5-HTP supplements.

00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:36.387
This is a little bit tricky.

00:44:36.387 --> 00:44:40.750
5-HTP supplements can of
course increase 5-HTP.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.196
It is 5-HTP or serotonin

00:44:43.196 --> 00:44:46.400
but that sometimes can create problems

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.700
in endogenous or self-made
production of serotonin.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.870
So I'm never a fan

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.470
of taking things very
close to the chemical

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:55.990
you're trying to increase for
very long periods of time.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.840
Maybe for occasional use.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.070
I have the problem that

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.880
if I take serotonin supplements,
5-HTP, I fall asleep.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.170
The sleep I have is very intense

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.670
and I wake up three or four hours later.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:09.130
And we know based on sleep
studies with good measurements

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.070
in the lab that serotonin
release tends to be

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:13.570
in the later part of the night.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.240
And so by taking it early in the night

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.880
it really can disrupt the pattern

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.490
of sleep in the depth of sleep.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.580
Nonetheless, some people are interested

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.920
in taking serotonin to get some

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.470
of the more blissed out effects.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.280
You can achieve that with foods.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.048
As I mentioned, that
are carbohydrate rich.

00:45:27.048 --> 00:45:28.370
So as you're seeing this

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.450
isn't really a discussion
about nutrition per se.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.625
This is discussion about food

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:34.560
which contains amino acids, amino acids

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.620
being the precursors to
neuromodulators and neuromodulators

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.940
having a profound effect
on your overall state

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.470
of alertness or calmness,
happiness, sadness, and wellbeing.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.650
So there are a number of
things that one can take.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.190
As I mentioned, one of
them being 5-HTP itself.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.178
Now I'm not recommending
people take anything,

00:45:52.178 --> 00:45:53.520
but if you're interested

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.680
in what this does and
you want to explore this

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.800
of course you'd want
permission from your doctor.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.161
You can go to this free website.

00:46:00.161 --> 00:46:01.638
I love this resource.

00:46:01.638 --> 00:46:03.100
They don't pay me to say that,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.710
but I just love this resource.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.800
I've followed it for a long
time called examine.com.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.670
Thank you folks at examine.com

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:11.880
for putting this free resource

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.570
out on the web that has links

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:16.070
through what they call
the human effect matrix.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:16.903
So it's links

00:46:16.903 --> 00:46:19.230
to all the PubMed studies
for particular effects

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.980
of particular compounds that one combined

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.960
and just incredible as well
as important health warnings.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.210
So I'm not gonna read through everything

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:27.770
but if you were to go to
examine.com as I have now

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.330
and you put in 5-HTP

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.600
they're only looking at things
that have strong evidence.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.240
PubMed articles,

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.540
articles that are in the PubMed archive.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.550
So for instance, I didn't know this,

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:44.030
but 5-HTP produces a notable
decrease in appetite,

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.400
three studies.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.050
And this appetite suppression
makes sense, of course,

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.480
because we ingest foods to get serotonin.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.869
And if we have enough serotonin

00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:55.730
then there's no reason
to ingest more foods.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.464
It tends to have a blunting of appetite.

00:46:58.464 --> 00:46:59.670
It probably does that also
through other mechanisms.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.190
So I'm not saying you should do this

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.140
but if someone's trying to blunt

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.770
their appetite could
be a interesting route,

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.833
although I don't recommend chronic use,

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.770
not surprisingly there's
a decrease in body weight

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.160
as a consequence, an increase in cortisol.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.980
So that's kind of important to note

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.790
that when you typically
in biology, if you pull

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:20.620
on one string really
hard and other one moves

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.230
it's a little bit like a puppet in there.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.140
It's more than one string on the puppet.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.660
So it does seem to
increase cortisol though

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.900
they report as a minor effect.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.483
Again, links to all those are there

00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:32.510
which is why I'm not listing
them out in our caption notes.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.310
You can go and get them at examine.com,

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.720
put in serotonin and you'll find that.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.795
So I find it fascinating

00:47:38.795 --> 00:47:42.160
that nowadays there are
things that are somewhere

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.990
between doing nothing, getting serotonin

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.620
from tryptophan and foods
and prescription drugs.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.060
There's this other category

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.390
of supplements that are really interesting

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.260
for modulating these
chemicals in the body.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.220
And I should mention before I move on,

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.720
because I mentioned L-tyrosine

00:47:59.586 --> 00:48:00.540
I neglected to mention earlier

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.670
in our discussion about
dopamine, if you're interested

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.600
in the dopamine pathway,
go to examine.com,

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.600
put in Mucuna pruriens, it's M-U-C-U-N-A,

00:48:11.448 --> 00:48:16.023
separate word, P-R-U-R-I-E-N S.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.100
It is a velvet bean that grows from vines

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.490
and is very itchy to touch due
to serotonin on its surface.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.930
Amazing, this bean has
serotonin on its surface

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.460
and indeed serotonin at
if you were to put it

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:29.670
on your skin would cause

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.650
some irritation of the skin, amazing.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:36.650
Inside the bean is L-DOPA,
Mucuna pruriens is not

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.660
just something that
promotes dopamine release

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.511
because of some weird mystical

00:48:41.511 --> 00:48:44.570
ancient thing or whatever, or sorcery.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:49.360
It is chemically L-DOPA
the precursor to dopamine.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.520
It contains some other molecules as well

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.850
and low levels of other psychoactives.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.630
This stuff is available over the counter.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:58.238
Incredible. I personally
find it incredible.

00:48:58.238 --> 00:49:00.620
Its effects are really interesting.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.980
I'm not gonna read them all off

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.500
but I mentioned these effects

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.270
not because I'm encouraging you to take it

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.810
but because you get a window

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:10.380
into what dopamine, acute
dopamine increase does

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.890
in the non-Parkinsonian context.

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.070
And you can start to think
about foods that are rich

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:20.070
in L-tyrosine as biasing
certain effects or not others.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.450
So when you hear food is medicine,

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.370
food isn't really medicine.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.930
Food is food, but food has
these chemical effects as well.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.260
So first one listed is three studies

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:34.260
with very high rigor that
overall have a minor effect

00:49:35.026 --> 00:49:37.340
on of all things, sperm quality.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.345
So it appears that sperm motility itself,

00:49:39.345 --> 00:49:42.221
I'm assuming when they say sperm quality

00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:44.075
I don't know what features
of sperm of quality

00:49:44.075 --> 00:49:45.083
they looked at with sperm,

00:49:45.083 --> 00:49:45.916
that's not discussion I want to have,

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.280
but I'm assuming it's motility

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.970
because I know enough
about reproductive biology

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:53.390
to know that sperm ability to swim depends

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.880
on some proteins that are present

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.610
in the front of the sperm, et cetera

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:59.430
things like contractions
and sperm motility

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.140
is generally associated
with sperm quality.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.640
Sperm that don't move are
generally not very useful sperm.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.302
Symptoms of Parkinson disease are

00:50:07.302 --> 00:50:10.240
are notably degraded with Mucuna pruriens.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.150
So fascinating. That's not surprising.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:13.880
And there are a lot of other effects here.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.450
Feelings of subjective wellbeing,

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:18.880
testosterone, reductions in
prolactin, not surprising.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.060
Prolactin is a hormone that's involved

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.550
in milk letdown, it's
in lactating mothers.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:28.690
It's involved in feelings
of peace and generally

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:33.300
is antagonistic to sexual
desire in both men and female.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:37.230
So it's really interesting that
things like Mucuna pruriens

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:40.300
which are L-DOPA reduce prolactin,
increased sperm motility,

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.210
increased testosterone,
subjective wellbeing.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.040
So you're starting to see a theme, right?

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.240
Dopamine really makes us motivated.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.260
Feel in pursuit, makes us feel good.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.800
Serotonin makes us feel
more relaxed and calm.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.520
Now this whole month is about emotion.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.990
So you might be thinking, well, wait

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.280
where are we going with all
this as it relates to emotions.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.040
But in the last episode I said something

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.893
I'm gonna repeat it now
briefly, which is that much

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:06.090
of what we talk about is good
emotions or bad emotions.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.310
There's a context to that.

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:08.720
There's a social context.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.430
We can't really say an
emotion is good or bad.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:13.731
Grieving at a funeral is healthy.

00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:16.530
Being happy at a funeral,

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.620
assuming you loved the person that died

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.620
is most people probably
wouldn't think that was healthy.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.273
So we can't really say that certain

00:51:23.273 --> 00:51:26.890
emotions like sadness or
happiness are healthy.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:28.200
It's context is important.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.970
Cultural context is important.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.960
Many of you have asked
for book recommendations.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.140
This is an opportunity to raise
a mention of another book.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.310
Again, I don't have any
financial affiliation or anything

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.330
but if you want to read
more about emotions

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:44.410
and how the context and cultural
things impact our emotions

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.727
I'm a huge fan of Lisa Feldman Barrett.

00:51:46.727 --> 00:51:49.343
I learned about her from
the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.750
I've had discussions with
her on my Instagram Live,

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.380
she's at Northeastern University,

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.090
a world expert in emotions.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.460
Her first book is "How Emotions Are Made"

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.620
This is not a book she sent me.

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.670
I paid for this with
my own money years ago,

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.780
bought it, read it, loved
it long before I met Lisa,

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.613
I'm just delighted

00:52:06.613 --> 00:52:08.100
that we've got to known
each other a little bit.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.370
It's a really interesting
read into the psychology

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.760
of emotions and some of the
subjectivity of emotions.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.513
So, whereas I'm talking about
mainly the biology of emotions

00:52:16.513 --> 00:52:18.867
this gets a little bit
more into the psychology

00:52:18.867 --> 00:52:21.200
and the biology as well.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.250
And Lisa's just terrific.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.083
She's also putting a lot

00:52:24.083 --> 00:52:25.900
of information out into
the world about emotion.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.731
So if you want to learn more about that

00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:32.060
check out her work, again,
it's Lisa Feldman Barrett.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.762
And that book is "How Emotions Are Made"

00:52:33.762 --> 00:52:36.312
Hopefully she'll continue
to write many more books.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:41.330
So now you understand the relationship

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:46.240
I hope between foods and
dopamine, foods and serotonin

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.950
and that they're both being communicated

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.670
to the brain via the vagus, right?

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.140
We ingest these foods,

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.120
these supplements are things people take,

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.560
they don't put them
directly into the brain.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.470
They put them in our gut.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.690
So yes, there's a gut brain connection

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.910
but it's not about the serotonin

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:04.190
in the gut that makes
you feel calm and placid.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.413
It's not about the dopamine in the gut.

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:09.810
It's just been oversold that way

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.760
because I think there's
something really attractive.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.627
And I understand about the idea

00:53:13.627 --> 00:53:17.700
that because certain
things about our experience

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.660
of life and our emotions
is happening in our body.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.770
That maybe we have a
little more control, right?

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.440
Because this thing is a hard container.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.390
We can't just stuff
some dopamine in there.

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.790
I could probably take
a Mucuna pruriens bean

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:30.590
and stuff it in my ear,
please don't do that.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:31.530
It'd make my ear itchy

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.000
because of the serotonin on the outside.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.223
But you can't get stuff in there.

00:53:34.223 --> 00:53:37.200
What you have to do is ingest
things that are metabolized

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.769
in certain ways that
communicate to the brain

00:53:39.769 --> 00:53:43.340
or so maybe they pass
into the brain themselves

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.720
across what's called
the blood brain barrier.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.330
I'll talk about the blood
brain barrier in a minute.

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:49.830
It's actually called the BBB.

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.833
So it ends up sounding like baby, BBB.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.154
I guess that's like BB, anyway,

00:53:56.154 --> 00:53:59.350
BBB, but they're also nerves

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:02.730
in the gut that are sensing
the nutrient contents of food

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.210
and then saying, oh, you should
feel better and want more.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:09.910
Oh, that's got a lot of
bitterness and acid taste to it.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:11.784
You should want less of that.

00:54:11.784 --> 00:54:13.310
So as I transitioned out

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:16.910
of the discussion about dopamine
and serotonin in the gut

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.210
hopefully you've got some
actionable items there

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:21.420
under your belt, pun intended,

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:24.010
where you can understand how certain foods

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:24.843
and certain nutrients

00:54:24.843 --> 00:54:27.870
and you can look these up,
might impact your mood.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:30.660
If you're somebody who's really
anxious and really wired.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.930
Well, then the dopamine adrenaline pathway

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.720
epinephrine pathway is
probably not one that you

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.930
want to lean on any harder.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.360
If you tend to be someone
who's pretty passive

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.790
and you're having trouble with motivation.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.030
Well then think about ramping

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:45.540
up the dopamine pathway through,
I always think behaviors

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.240
and proper food choices
is the best way to start.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.380
And behaviors include things
like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:52.360
But one of the problems

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.362
with the discussion
around mood and exercise

00:54:55.362 --> 00:54:59.520
or mood and meditation is
that it's so subjective.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.950
It's like, I love certain forms
of exercise and not others.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.370
Certain ones are aversive to me.

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:05.040
Certain ones are attractive to me,

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.040
and it's never really clear.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.873
No one's ever told me.

00:55:06.873 --> 00:55:09.250
Okay, you have to do 10 minutes

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.010
on the bike at X number
of RPM at so-and-so

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:14.500
or on the skier in order
to get your dopamine up.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.710
But we can actually say, if
you ingest more L-tyrosine

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.430
there's a high probability
that you're going

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.280
to make more dopamine.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.190
And I'm talking about ingesting it

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.500
through food or through
supplementation if you like.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.310
Mucuna pruriens, I've tried.

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:30.430
I should just mention it
was too dopaminergic for me.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:33.310
I got really, really jazzed up

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:36.580
and then a severe crash
for me the next day.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.360
But that's, I think because
I tend to ride pretty high

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.360
on the kind of alertness
and motivation scale.

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.180
I'm always being told by
Costello and other people

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.680
in the podcast studio
to slow my speech down.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.616
This is me uncaffeinated,
and I could probably

00:55:48.616 --> 00:55:51.800
afford a little more serotonin in my life.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.232
So, whereas Costello,

00:55:54.232 --> 00:55:57.490
he can afford to wake
up every couple of days

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:58.690
and just say hello to us.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.560
This dog sleeps more
than any other creature.

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.693
It's remarkable.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:07.010
So there are things that we
can do and they're actionable.

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:09.570
And they are in some
ways they're quantitative

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:11.140
because you can regulate dosages

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.540
and you can regulate amounts
and you can regulate timing.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.840
And everyone has to play with these things

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.420
and figure out what's right
for them in terms of feeding.

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.720
And everyone has to explore

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.810
and understand what's
safe and right for them.

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:25.050
But, and of course, exercise
is still very important.

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:27.350
I talked about social
connection in the last episode

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.211
super important for
activation of serotonin

00:56:30.211 --> 00:56:32.752
but when it comes to this gut brain,

00:56:32.752 --> 00:56:36.470
body brain relationship,
what we eat really matters

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.010
in terms of the
neurochemicals that we make.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.860
So let's talk a little bit more
about things that we ingest

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:44.978
in our body and then allow
our body to inform our brain

00:56:44.978 --> 00:56:46.320
to shift our mood.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.840
And this is something
I've been doing for years.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.140
And I just want to say

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.600
I've found to be a complete game changer.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.832
There's excellent science to support it.

00:56:54.832 --> 00:56:58.100
And I think most people are familiar

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.140
with it in a different context

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:03.490
but I don't think most
people know this simple fact

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:08.490
which is that the omega-3
to omega-6 fatty acid ratio

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.650
has a profound effect on depression.

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:15.937
It has a profound effect
on mood so much so

00:57:15.937 --> 00:57:20.080
that in a double-blind
placebo controlled study

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.260
that I will provide the link too,

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.330
this was a study first published in 2008

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.230
but there've been many others as well.

00:57:26.655 --> 00:57:29.750
First of all, an
experiment done in animals.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.050
They found there's a model

00:57:31.973 --> 00:57:33.560
of learned helplessness in animals.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.285
It's not very kind to the animals,

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:36.713
but they put rats or mice in a jar.

00:57:36.713 --> 00:57:38.260
They let them swim and they'll swim, swim,

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.341
swim to try and save their life.

00:57:40.341 --> 00:57:41.500
And eventually they give up,
it's a learned helplessness.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.693
They don't let them
drown, they take them out.

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.310
Adjusting the omega-3 omega-6 ratio so

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:51.010
that the omega-3's are higher led to less

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.660
learned helplessness,
meaning these animals

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.880
would swim longer.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.860
Now that's an animal.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.923
That's a rat, not a
particularly kind study,

00:57:56.923 --> 00:58:01.490
but that same study was
essentially done in humans

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:03.230
although they didn't have
them swim to the point

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.530
of near drowning.

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:08.600
What they did is they took
people who were clinically

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.640
depressed, major depression.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.161
Major depression is
severe maladaptive state

00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:16.735
meaning it inhibits job,
relationships, appetite,

00:58:16.735 --> 00:58:19.823
all sorts of negative health effects.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.218
And they did a comparison of

00:58:23.218 --> 00:58:26.350
a thousand milligrams a day of EPA.

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:30.470
So EPA is one of the elements
that contains high levels

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.770
of omega-3's that's in
things like fish oil,

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.100
I'll talk about other
sources in a little bit

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.540
but it wasn't a thousand
milligrams of fish oil.

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.810
It was a thousand milligrams of EPA.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:44.420
Compared that to 20
milligrams of Fluoxetine

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:47.520
which is Prozac, okay.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.460
Really increases serotonin.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:52.780
And in this study of
60 individuals, again,

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.719
I'll provide the links to the study.

00:58:55.719 --> 00:58:59.135
They found that they
were equally effective

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:01.290
in reducing depressive symptoms.

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:02.481
So imagine that,

00:59:02.481 --> 00:59:07.481
a food-based compound that
you can't make without,

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.330
right, this is not a situation

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.010
where you can make your own omega-3s.

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:12.390
You have to get them from food sources

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:16.220
or from supplementation, was
as effective as 20 milligrams

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.400
of fluoxetine over the
course of eight weeks.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.727
And what was really
interesting in addition

00:59:21.727 --> 00:59:25.027
to that is that the combination
of a thousand milligrams

00:59:25.027 --> 00:59:28.530
of EPA and Fluoxetine
had a synergistic effect

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.350
in lowering depressive symptoms.

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:31.570
I find this remarkable.

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:33.880
I heard about this when it first came

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.070
out and I wasn't sure what to make of it.

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.369
'Cause there are a lot
of studies that come out

00:59:39.369 --> 00:59:41.780
and I generally like to
focus my changes in behavior

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.760
around things where there's
a large center of mass.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.213
There's a lot of information.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:47.666
A couple years later, I did in fact

00:59:47.666 --> 00:59:50.360
start taking a thousand milligrams

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.340
per day of EPA in fish oil.

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.490
Now there are a few side
effects of fish oil.

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:59.860
People who have blood, who are bleeders

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.320
who have Factor V Leiden mutations

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.660
or in women who are taking birth control,

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.740
which can affect blood clotting and things

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.380
of that sort really
should talk to your doctor

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.120
make sure it's okay for you.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.930
Fish oil also can give people fishy breath

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.100
which is pretty gross, frankly,

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.830
but there are now fish oils that

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:21.233
either because of the
Encapsulations or because

01:00:21.233 --> 01:00:25.000
they put some lemon flavoring in there

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.660
doesn't have that effect.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.090
In any event, a thousand
milligrams per day of EPA.

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.760
I started ingesting that regularly.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.670
I just felt better.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.661
I wasn't clinically
depressed, but I generally,

01:00:34.661 --> 01:00:37.820
I did feel at least for me, an
increase in mood and affect.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.090
And a number of other things

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.380
it's supposed to reduce inflammation.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.370
The cardiovascular
effects are controversial

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:44.740
for a long time everyone
thought the effects

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.110
on platelets were really terrific.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.150
Then there were articles that came

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:50.700
out in major newspapers
saying maybe not so much

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.850
but the effects on mood
are really profound.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.170
And now there are lots of studies.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:57.510
If you go into PubMed

01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:01.310
and you were to put EPA
or fish oil and depression

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.090
you would find that there were a number

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:05.010
of really impressive results showing

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:06.750
that it's at least as effective

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:10.173
as certain SSRI antidepressants
at these dosages

01:01:10.173 --> 01:01:13.860
and it can amplify or improve the effect

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.310
of low dosages of some of these SSRIs.

01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:18.260
So I feel like more people
should know about this.

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.270
This is nutrition, but it's
profoundly affecting mood

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.190
and depression is terrible, right?

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.880
Depression can have a component

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.240
of anxiety in some cases where people are

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.358
they feel lousy and very uncertain.

01:01:30.358 --> 01:01:32.750
That's kind of how I talk
about depression with anxiety

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.550
is you talk to someone who is anxious

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.320
and you can tell them
everything's gonna be okay.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.460
And they're always concerned

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.410
about what they might not know.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.340
You don't really know the
plane isn't gonna crash.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.920
You don't really know that
life is gonna go okay.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.980
And in some sense, they're right,

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.410
no one has a crystal ball
or can predict the future,

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:50.980
but they tend to perseverate
or fixate on the uncertainty.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.450
And then of course there are the versions

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.120
of depression that involve certainty.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.340
People are lethargic and
they're certain they say, yeah,

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.000
I'm certain, I'm never
gonna get another job.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.620
I'm certain, I'm never
gonna meet anyone new.

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.770
I'm certain I'm gonna fail.

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:04.960
So there's this kind of
a divide in the sphere

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.870
of depression around
certainty and uncertainty.

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:10.710
But what's interesting is this
thousand milligrams per day

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:12.910
or more of EPA has been shown

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:16.330
to relieve both forms of depression.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:18.530
Now, does that mean it's
gonna work for everybody?

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.690
No, I'm not here to try
and play psychiatrist.

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:23.550
I want to point you in the
direction of these manuscripts

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.190
so that you can make informed
choices for yourself.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.610
You can discuss it with your doctor

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:30.460
and family and make the
choices that are right for you.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.580
But here's what's especially interesting

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.510
about the heart effects,

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.900
because we've heard that these omega-3s,

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.920
which of course you can
get from other sources too,

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.280
you can get from fatty fish,

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.883
they're in flax seeds, hemp seeds.

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:47.458
There are a number of chia
seeds, these kinds of things

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:51.360
but the levels of EPA that
are required are quite high.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.560
So this thousand milligrams

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.180
per day is that's pretty
hard to get from food

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.380
although it can be done depending

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.523
on what you're eating.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:03.490
What's interesting is that the
heart effects that are solid

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.411
that really stand up in the literature

01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:06.950
have a lot more to do

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.840
with something we talked
about in a previous episode.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.670
And I'll mention again, which
is heart rate variability.

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:14.020
So we know that having a
heart rate that's really high

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.630
or heart rate, that's really low.

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:16.880
Neither of those are good.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.713
A lot of people think, oh

01:03:17.713 --> 01:03:20.126
you just want a low heart
rate, big stroke volume.

01:03:20.126 --> 01:03:22.090
You know, if you're running a lot

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.210
you may have 30 or 40 beats per minute.

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.500
That's great to be in shape

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.221
but you still want heart rate variability.

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:29.360
It has a lot to do with the tone

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.190
of the autonomic nervous
system talked about last time.

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.310
How, when you inhale,
it speeds up heart rate.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.890
When you exhale, it decreases heart rate.

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:38.640
That's called respiratory
sinus arrhythmia.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.300
That's the basis of
heart rate variability.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.530
We'll maybe do a short post about this.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.370
So you can get all the mechanism

01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:46.520
and the behaviors that spill

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.240
out of that that might be useful for you.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.050
But the point is heart rate variability.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:51.800
HRV is good.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.870
And what's interesting
is that there was a study

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:58.870
in 2009 that showed that people
who eat a diet where they

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.250
fail to supplement in a way that there's

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.270
a high omega-6 to three ratio,

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.660
so not enough omega-3s,
not only are there markers

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.047
of an inflammatory cytokines,
elevated things like IL-6

01:04:09.047 --> 01:04:11.540
and TNF-alpha,

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.573
but they tend to be
non-responders to antidepressants.

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:18.390
Shifting that omega-3 omega-6

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:19.930
ratio did a couple things.

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.950
First of all, increasing the amount

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:23.810
of EPA shifted the ratio.

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:27.520
So it was higher omega-3 to
omega-6 ratio, which was good,

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.410
lowered the inflammation markers,

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:32.440
and then allowed antidepressants
to have their effect,

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.040
even at low doses.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.100
And here's the really interesting thing.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:40.070
It worked by increasing
heart rate variability,

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.730
and you think, well, how in
the world would this happen?

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.280
But you know how I mean,
that's a ton of effects

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.230
but the way it works is because
of the way that these things

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:52.020
are impacting the gut and
the autonomic nervous system.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.240
Remember earlier, I said, the
vagus includes connections

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.830
from the heart signaling
about sensory information

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:00.400
about how fast the heart
is beating to the brain

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.902
not just stuff on the lungs,
but information from the heart

01:05:02.902 --> 01:05:05.430
and the brain then adjusts heart rate

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.170
by heart rate variability.

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.730
So it's incredible that
there's a way that one

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:13.877
can use the gut, the ingestion
of more of these EPA's,

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:15.857
either through food or supplementation

01:05:15.857 --> 01:05:18.182
to increase rate variability

01:05:18.182 --> 01:05:21.905
and thereby to improve symptoms,

01:05:21.905 --> 01:05:25.110
meaning reduce symptoms of depression,

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:28.590
and to even make low
levels of antidepressants

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:30.500
that wouldn't otherwise work work.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.680
And I think I like this study so much

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.450
because a, it's super cool.

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.180
It bridges the brain body access.

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:39.460
It incorporates nutrition and
micronutrients in the brain

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.120
but also because it
really points to something

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.500
that we hear all the time,

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.180
which is our body is a whole system.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.290
It's working as a whole system
and the brain isn't working

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.440
in isolation up there in the skull.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.830
It's reacting to things that
are happening in the body

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:54.420
in the gut and in the heart
rate and heart rate variability.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.137
And that the things we ingest can have

01:05:57.137 --> 01:05:57.970
a profound effect on them.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:00.290
Now, of course, I really
want to emphasize something

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:04.830
which is that no one compound or nutrient

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:08.610
or supplement or drug or
behavior for that matter

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.430
is going to be the be all end all

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.870
of shifting out of depression

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.800
or improving one's mood
or improving sleep.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.400
It's a constellation of things.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.180
And this is especially true

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.760
when people start to get excited
about supplements and drugs

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.330
of all kinds and their
potential for various things.

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.530
Right now, there's a lot of
excitement about psychedelics

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:28.550
and their therapeutic uses.

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.840
And I think great, but
as a good friend of mine

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.595
who's a physician clinician says

01:06:33.595 --> 01:06:36.380
better living through chemistry

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.253
still requires better living.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.300
You cannot expect to take a compound

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.349
regardless of source or potency

01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:46.790
and have it completely shift
your experience of life

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:48.710
without having to continue to engage

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.910
in the proper behaviors,
all the things we know

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:53.919
proper sleep, exercise, social
connection, food, et cetera.

01:06:53.919 --> 01:06:56.440
There are many others as well.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.230
So I still find that this collection

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.710
of studies about omega-3 to omega-6 ratios

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.360
to be profoundly important so
much so that it's completely

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.620
changed the way that I think about food,

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.300
the foods I eat, I do supplement.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.830
I don't necessarily that
think that's for everybody

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:14.465
but I really think it's incredible

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.730
that there are these compounds

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:17.160
that have these robust effects

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.990
on our feelings of wellbeing.

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:20.670
And there are others too.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.400
So that thousand milligram per day

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.620
threshold of fish oil that's beneficial

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.360
requires that one take a reasonable amount

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.650
of these things, either through food

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.003
or through supplementation.

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.623
I acknowledge that not everyone
wants to take fish oil.

01:07:34.623 --> 01:07:35.870
There are a couple of reasons

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:37.580
why one might want to avoid that.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.734
One would be for ethical reasons.

01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:43.450
You have an emotional
relationship or a relationship

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:44.920
to the environment that makes you not want

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.720
to ingest fish related products.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.910
There's krill oil.

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:50.000
Krill is still an organism.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.290
It's a little tiny thing
that whales eat a lot

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:54.120
of and people generally
eat very little of.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.860
So krill is out there,
I personally, just me,

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.790
I don't know why, I didn't
react well to krill.

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:02.090
It didn't make me feel very good.

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:04.879
I had some like kind of skin
itches and things like that.

01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:06.970
And they stopped when I stopped taking it

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:09.010
but I don't want to bias you against it.

01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:09.960
If that's your preference.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.880
Some people really like krill oil

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.300
as a source of omega-3s.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.364
I did mention some of the other sources

01:08:15.364 --> 01:08:19.030
like chia seeds and flax
seeds, but as you'll notice

01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:21.330
these are not things that
we tend to ingest a lot

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.630
of on a regular basis.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.680
It is possible to get omega-3s from meats.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.880
If the animals have grazed

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.763
on grasses that contain a lot of omega-3s.

01:08:29.763 --> 01:08:33.167
So for those of you that ingest meat

01:08:33.167 --> 01:08:36.330
you're the source of those meat is gonna

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:38.640
be very important as
it relates to omega-3s.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.301
Even within the category of fish oil

01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:44.180
there's a concern sometimes

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.612
about mercury and other contaminants.

01:08:46.612 --> 01:08:49.740
You want to go with a
brand that emphasizes

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.870
that they've gone to really good sources

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:55.687
and that they decontaminate regardless.

01:08:55.687 --> 01:08:58.720
And so you have to
search out those brands.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.020
There is a test that you can do as

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.360
to whether or not the fish
oil is a rancid or not.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.030
Some people take it in liquid form.

01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:06.410
Some people take in capsule form.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.174
The liquid form is gonna
be more affordable.

01:09:08.174 --> 01:09:09.814
The capsule form is more

01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:13.377
is a little easier and
a little more portable.

01:09:13.377 --> 01:09:18.377
You can actually just chew
one of the gel tablets.

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.840
And if it tastes really
fishy kind of rancid,

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.100
you'll know it's disgusting.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.440
You want to spit it out.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.380
And if it doesn't and it's tolerable

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.900
then you'll know that that it's okay.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.980
Unfortunately you have to buy
it first in order to do that.

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.350
Although, I don't know, maybe
you can get them to open

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:32.950
up the bottle for you in the store

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:34.660
and tell them you want to try it.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.470
Someday perhaps fish oil and omega-3,

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:38.560
it'll be like tasting wine

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.890
at a restaurant where you
can send it back for now.

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:42.280
I think you have to purchase it first,

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.290
but find a brand you trust in
like, and then work with them.

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.550
If you decide to go that route of course.

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.735
There are other compounds
that are also interesting

01:09:50.735 --> 01:09:55.735
for mood elevation that
are essentially like foods

01:09:56.350 --> 01:10:00.520
or are supplement based
that now, fortunately,

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.190
there are really good data
from peer reviewed studies.

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:05.008
And the next one I want to mention

01:10:05.008 --> 01:10:08.400
because I think it's really
interesting is L-carnitine.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.360
Now, L-carnitine has
been around a long time

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.930
and it's been discussed in the context

01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:14.610
of heart health and a
number of other things.

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.500
It was actually being touted
as a bit of a weight loss agent

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:21.613
in the early nineties,
but L-carnitine actually

01:10:21.613 --> 01:10:25.267
has some really impressive
effects on depression.

01:10:25.267 --> 01:10:29.040
And again, we will look to PubMed

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.010
because looking at examine.com
is essentially for me anyway

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:34.770
looking at PubMed, what
is L-carnitine okay.

01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:36.334
L-carnitine is most prevalent in meat

01:10:36.334 --> 01:10:38.690
and in beef in particular.

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:41.510
Now for the vegans, please
know that L-carnitine

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.160
is available through
non-meat sources as well.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.980
Although it's not as
enriched in non-meat sources.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.880
It's a really interesting
molecule because acetylcarnitine

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:53.590
is essentially what's
made from L-carnitine

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:55.460
but it's acetylated.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.950
If you're interested in the biochemistry,

01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:57.783
you can look that up,

01:10:57.783 --> 01:11:00.470
it's acetylated into a form that can cross

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:01.420
the blood-brain barrier.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.063
The blood-brain barrier
or BBB is a barrier.

01:11:04.063 --> 01:11:08.300
It's a wall around the brain
and you have this barrier

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.310
because the brain is so important.

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:13.320
And it has this feature
that the neurons there

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.045
don't recreate themselves after injury,

01:11:15.045 --> 01:11:17.020
like other organs of the body.

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.420
There's not a lot of
turnover of cells despite

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.390
what you might've heard.

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:22.464
And so nature has created this BBB,

01:11:22.464 --> 01:11:26.430
this blood brain barrier to
make sure that certain molecules

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.550
in particular, large
molecules don't get across

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.940
the blood-brain barrier.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.643
'Cause it can be damaging
to those tissues.

01:11:31.643 --> 01:11:32.750
Incidentally,

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:36.922
you also have a very
rigid or stringent barrier

01:11:36.922 --> 01:11:39.160
around other organs, which are the gonads.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.130
So the ovaries and the testes

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.140
and the brain are the organs

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.138
of the body that nature has gone out

01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:49.190
of its way to protect,
give this additional layer

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:50.940
of the blood-brain barrier

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.370
or as you might imagine for the testes

01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.480
and the ovaries, it's going to be

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.560
the blood gonadal barrier.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.900
So these barriers exist

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.670
to make it such that just
because you eat something,

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.320
just because you ingest
it doesn't mean it's going

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.950
to cross the blood-brain barrier,

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:07.760
but L-carnitine when taken is

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.042
acetylated and converted into this form

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:12.347
that gets across the blood-brain barrier.

01:12:12.347 --> 01:12:14.700
And it has a lot of effects, it's involved

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.340
in mitochondrial activation
of long chain fatty acids

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.489
which that's a big mouthful,

01:12:18.489 --> 01:12:20.220
that we'll get into some time when

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.680
we're talking about metabolic,

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.820
but it has some interesting
effects on the neuro side.

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:28.650
So if you decide to check
it out on examine.com

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:29.810
you'll see some really interesting things,

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.507
lots of effects on ammonia,
C-reactive proteins,

01:12:32.507 --> 01:12:36.010
things of that sort, blood
glucose is lowered, et cetera.

01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:39.192
That's all stuff that's the
level of blood and periphery,

01:12:39.192 --> 01:12:41.548
slight effects in lowering cholesterol.

01:12:41.548 --> 01:12:44.374
Here's some interesting ones.

01:12:44.374 --> 01:12:48.691
Rates of pregnancy go way up when people

01:12:48.691 --> 01:12:52.890
are taking L-carnitine both
the father and the mother

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:57.112
but the source of sperm and
the source of egg are affected

01:12:57.112 --> 01:12:59.700
in ways that favors pregnancy.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.740
It does increase,

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.180
here we go again with sperm
quality sperm motility

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:07.600
in males and it seems
to have positive effects

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.120
on females that have
polycystic ovary syndrome.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.880
So check that out.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.820
You know, the effects are very strong.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.360
There are three studies listed there.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.705
Again, I'm not promoting this,

01:13:17.705 --> 01:13:20.370
but that that people take L-carnitine,

01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:22.210
especially if you're
trying to get pregnant

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:24.867
but check it out because the effects there

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:27.553
and the studies that are
mentioned are published

01:13:27.553 --> 01:13:29.663
in peer reviewed rigorous journals.

01:13:29.663 --> 01:13:32.710
In terms of the neural effects.

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:34.270
Those are quite interesting.

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:37.210
The effects on depression
are still emerging

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:38.830
but they do seem to exist

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:42.980
that people feel a notable
decrease in depressive symptoms.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.537
There are seven studies
listed on examine.com

01:13:45.537 --> 01:13:47.730
that it has a notable benefit

01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:49.691
in a variety of circumstances
where participants

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.780
have heightened depression already.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.460
They start taking L-carnitine
and they start feeling better.

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.810
And they talk about dosages
in those various studies.

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.020
It also has been shown to
have a notable decrease

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.090
in the symptoms of autism,
which I find fascinating.

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:06.864
Also again, the things we ingest impact

01:14:06.864 --> 01:14:09.330
the chemicals in our brain

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.590
and how they impact the rest of our body.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:14.050
There's other things that's
been used to treat certain forms

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.520
of alcohol dependence.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.708
I think this is going to be a
very exciting emerging area.

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:20.980
We're gonna do a whole
month about addiction.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.300
I've got a great guest
lined up for that month,

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:28.300
but there's now an emerging
field about what people can take

01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:31.830
and supplement to help ease the cravings

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:34.980
and the withdrawal when
trying to quit drugs of abuse,

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:37.850
like cocaine, alcohol, heroin, and smoking

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.130
and things of that sort.

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:41.740
So really interesting area.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.770
This is, I like to think is the early days

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:44.930
and we're gonna discover a lot more.

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:46.369
There's a huge list of things here.

01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:49.230
Since we talked about
pain on a previous episode

01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:50.063
and I know a lot

01:14:50.063 --> 01:14:53.156
of people have written
to me about fibromyalgia.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.742
It does L carnitine has been shown

01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:57.690
to reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.994
Again, all the links to
studies are on examine.com,

01:15:00.994 --> 01:15:02.760
totally free site.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.680
And that was my bulldog
being a battering ram.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.680
There's nothing graceful
about this bulldog.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.860
He's decided he wanted to leave
to go get a drink of water.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.009
And so please forgive the noise.

01:15:12.009 --> 01:15:12.842
Okay.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.250
So now let's turn to another aspect

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:19.421
of the gut-brain relationship
that will surprise you,

01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:22.140
in some cases might shock you.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:25.790
And that has some really
cool and actionable biology.

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:30.790
And that's the gut microbiome,
probiotics and prebiotics.

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:34.260
I know today we're talking
about emotions and not pain

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.620
but I'd be remiss if I
didn't mention another effect

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.741
of acetylcarnitine that's been reported

01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:40.990
and that you can find listed with link

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.472
to study on examine.com

01:15:42.472 --> 01:15:47.200
which is its effect in reducing
the symptoms of migraine.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.780
This was a randomized controlled trial

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.947
with 133 participants who
had frequent migraines.

01:15:52.947 --> 01:15:55.250
They were taking 500 milligrams

01:15:55.250 --> 01:16:00.250
of L-carnitine or nothing for 12 weeks.

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:02.250
So the control is a little bit,

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.160
the control experiment
there is a little bit tricky

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.070
but it had a significant effect

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.370
on reducing the number of
migraine attacks per month.

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:09.779
So I find that really interesting

01:16:09.779 --> 01:16:12.622
and there's a lot more
listed there about the study.

01:16:12.622 --> 01:16:16.534
And I think these compounds are powerful.

01:16:16.534 --> 01:16:19.730
They carry risks for certain
people, not for others.

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:22.652
So again, you have to find
out what's right for you

01:16:22.652 --> 01:16:25.493
but I do think they are super interesting

01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:28.823
as potential therapeutics
for various people.

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:30.503
So what's the deal

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:34.350
with the gut microbiome
and the gut brain axis.

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:36.549
Today we've actually been
talking a lot already about

01:16:36.549 --> 01:16:40.295
the gut brain axis that has
nothing to do with microbiomes.

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:42.845
We've been talking about this vagus nerve

01:16:42.845 --> 01:16:46.805
that connects providing
sensory information

01:16:46.805 --> 01:16:48.860
from the body to the brain.

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:53.300
And then the brain also
sends in the same nerve motor

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.530
information to control the
motility that got the heart rate

01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:01.350
how fast we breathe and
deployment of immune stuff

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.675
killer cells and things of that sort.

01:17:03.675 --> 01:17:08.540
But oftentimes when we hear
about the gut brain axis

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:13.120
these days, it's a discussion
about the gut microbiome.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.195
And once again, we're in a situation where

01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:16.895
there's incredible biology,

01:17:16.895 --> 01:17:19.649
I'm very happy there's so much discussion

01:17:19.649 --> 01:17:21.820
about the gut microbiome.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.840
I am somewhat dismayed
and concerned that most

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.470
of what I hear out there is
either false or partially false.

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.940
So we're gonna clear up some

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:34.175
of the misconceptions, first
by understanding the biology.

01:17:34.175 --> 01:17:35.008
And then we're going to talk

01:17:35.008 --> 01:17:36.560
about some of the actionable items.

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:42.393
It is true that we have
a lot of these little

01:17:42.393 --> 01:17:46.428
microorganisms living in our gut.

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:49.420
They're not there because
they want to help us.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.480
They don't have brains,
they are adaptive however,

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.780
they try and find and create environments

01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.190
that make it easier for
them to proliferate.

01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:01.380
So they don't care about you and me

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.620
but they are perfectly
willing to exploit you

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.783
and me in order to make more

01:18:05.783 --> 01:18:06.616
of themselves the same way viruses are,

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:10.610
viruses don't have a
mind, they infect cells,

01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:11.690
they hijack the genome,

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:14.290
and they use that genome
to make more of themselves.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.650
The microbiota that live in us

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:22.168
vary along the length
of our digestive tract.

01:18:22.168 --> 01:18:23.790
But let's just take a step back

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:26.770
and think about how our body plan is made.

01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:28.700
We are actually a series of tubes.

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:29.990
Our brain is actually a tube.

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:31.810
You see, it's all squishy on the outside.

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.020
And then it's got that long thing.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.020
The spinal cord that goes
down to the base of the spine.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.470
That's the central nervous system

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:37.980
that all started out as a tube.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.010
It just looks like a
cauliflower on the other end

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:45.240
up in the brain because the tube is so big

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.700
and it has to be crammed into the skull.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.240
So it gets all wrinkled up.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.760
But if we were to splay it out

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.947
you'd find that it's just one big tube.

01:18:51.947 --> 01:18:54.490
Similarly, our digestive tract

01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:57.700
and our airways are
essentially one big tube.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.270
It starts with our mouth, also our nose.

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:01.670
And then we have all these other tubes.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.760
They go down through our throat and then

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.340
into our stomach and then
into our various intestines.

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.510
And then the tube ends out the other end.

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:12.800
So we are one long tube for digestion.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.520
And inside of that tube
is a mucosal lining.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.370
It's these little microvilli,
tiny, tiny, tiny little

01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:24.030
like velvety ends of cells
that are able to move

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:28.327
and move things along and mucus mucosa.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.950
And the conditions

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:34.700
of that mucosal lining set a
number of different things.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.050
It sets the rate

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.940
of our digestion and the
quality of our digestion.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.400
It sets for instance, our immune system.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.916
Most people probably don't
realize this, but most infections

01:19:43.916 --> 01:19:47.130
in the environment have to
get into our body somehow.

01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:49.440
Some of them are inhaled.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.220
A lot of them go into our mouth

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.780
and lodge in the mucosal
lining of the mouth.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.010
And then infection start there.

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.060
You probably had the
experience, unfortunately,

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.100
of you know, feeling like you
have a tick in your throat,

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.390
like something's irritating your throat.

01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.675
And then it kind of
migrates up into a head cold

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:06.170
or runny nose.

01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:07.550
Sometimes it'll start as headache.

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:11.060
Sometimes it won't, but
things that are inert

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.720
can migrate down into the gut.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.760
So we're ingesting things all the time.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.580
Think about air, bacteria, viruses,

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.500
they're making their way into our gut.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.970
And some of those
bacteria live in the gut.

01:20:21.970 --> 01:20:26.460
And some of those bacteria
bias the mucosal lining

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.840
in the gut, stomach and intestines

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.552
to be more acidic or more basic

01:20:33.552 --> 01:20:36.190
so that they can make more of themselves

01:20:36.190 --> 01:20:37.023
so they can replicate.

01:20:37.023 --> 01:20:38.440
They like a particular comfort.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.050
It's like they like a particular kind

01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:44.720
of bedding to lie down in and
create more of themselves.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.210
Now, some of those those mucosal linings

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.240
that they promote make us feel better.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.440
They make us feel more alert.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.780
They bolster our immune system

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.560
and others make us feel worse.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.560
So first rule, the
microbiome isn't good or bad.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.650
Some of these little bugs

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.640
that live in us do bad things to us.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.170
They make us feel worse.

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:06.560
They lower our immunity.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.890
They affect us in negative ways.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:11.470
Some of them make us feel
better and they do that mainly

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:16.470
by changing the conditions
of our gut environment.

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.067
In addition to that, they do impact

01:21:19.067 --> 01:21:24.067
the neurotransmitters and the
neurons that live in the gut.

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:27.760
And that signal up to the
brain to impact things

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.990
like dopamine and serotonin

01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:31.300
that we've been talking about previously.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.820
So there's a vast world now

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:38.560
devoted to try and understand
what sources of food

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.310
what kinds of foods are good or not good

01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:42.500
for the gut microbiome?

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.290
So let's just talk about some
general rules of thumb related

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:48.000
to the research quality
research that's peer reviewed.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.590
And then in a future episode

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:52.590
we will go far deeper
into the gut microbiome

01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:54.090
and gut brain axis.

01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:56.190
But here's a few things

01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:58.814
that I think you might find surprising.

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.230
First of all,

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:04.330
supporting a healthy gut
microbiome is good for mood,

01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:08.583
great for digestion and great
for immune system function.

01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:13.290
However, that does not mean maxing out

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.640
or taking the most probiotic

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.250
and prebiotic that you
can possibly manage.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:19.770
As I mentioned many times before

01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:22.509
I do believe in probiotics,
I take probiotics

01:22:22.509 --> 01:22:24.120
but there are studies that show that

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.360
if you take lots and lots
of certain probiotics

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.086
like lactobacillus and you
really ramp up the levels more

01:22:30.086 --> 01:22:32.468
it is not a case of more is better.

01:22:32.468 --> 01:22:37.180
There are things like brain
fog that can come from that,

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.440
brain fog is just this inability to focus.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.335
People feel really not well generally.

01:22:41.335 --> 01:22:43.590
Some of those studies are
a little bit controversial

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:44.660
but I think it's fair to say

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:48.000
that if people really increase the amount

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.171
of probiotic that they're
taking beyond a certain amount

01:22:52.171 --> 01:22:55.460
then they start feeling foggy in the mind.

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.190
Now what's too much?

01:22:57.190 --> 01:22:59.910
Well I get probiotics

01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:01.790
I mentioned before from Athletic Greens,

01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:03.430
you can get them from fermented foods

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:07.108
like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,

01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:09.950
these are different sources
from around the world.

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:11.040
Actually, I'd love to hear some

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.140
of the other sources that
people know other foods

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.582
from around the world.

01:23:14.582 --> 01:23:16.080
I'm fascinated by the way

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:19.020
in which different
cultures have all arrived

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.051
at these foods that provide

01:23:22.051 --> 01:23:26.410
and support healthy microbiomes
because they're fermented.

01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:28.780
I have a colleague at
Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg,

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.810
and he and I have talked about this.

01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:33.930
I don't want to quote him inappropriately,

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:35.460
but we've had discussions about it,

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.160
and they've published that the ingestion

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.350
of fermented foods is one

01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:41.310
of the best ways to support healthy levels

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:45.500
of gut microbiota without
exceeding the threshold

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.980
that would cause things like brain fog.

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.252
So foods and fermented foods

01:23:50.252 --> 01:23:51.280
are going to be the best source.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.630
And there are a number

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:54.700
of different ways that one could do that.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.971
Some people don't like fermented foods,

01:23:56.971 --> 01:23:58.751
however some people supplement it.

01:23:58.751 --> 01:24:00.950
So it isn't a case of more is better.

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.270
So we know that.

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.200
The other is that it is true

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.650
that healthy gut microbiota
have been shown to

01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:11.190
improve symptoms of certain
psychiatric illnesses

01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:15.630
as well as certain conditions
like particular features

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:17.817
along the autism spectrum,
which is interesting.

01:24:17.817 --> 01:24:21.920
And those effects are probably
due to not just improvement

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.356
of immune system function,

01:24:24.356 --> 01:24:27.550
but to the the conditions
in which the neurons

01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:30.750
that sense nutrients convey
information to the brain

01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:34.340
and increase levels of
serotonin and or dopamine.

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:37.460
So gut microbiome provides
kind of a foundation

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:41.200
for healthy gut and
healthy gut brain access

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.900
so much so that some people report

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.060
that when they start eating small bits

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.680
'cause it doesn't require
a lot of fermented foods,

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.100
that their overall mood is better,

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.600
not unlike the effects of EPA.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.900
Although I don't think it's been looked

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:55.810
at directly in the context
of clinical depression yet.

01:24:55.810 --> 01:24:57.470
And if someone knows of a study

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:58.750
please mention it in the comments.

01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:59.900
That would be terrific.

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.580
There are some things
that you can do to really

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.580
damage your gut microbiome.

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.495
And this is where there's
a huge misconception

01:25:06.495 --> 01:25:08.530
that I want to clear up.

01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:09.529
There was a study that
was published in "Nature",

01:25:09.529 --> 01:25:10.362
which is among the three top journals

01:25:10.362 --> 01:25:13.880
that we have in science.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.470
You know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:17.500
and "Cell" are considered the top tops,

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.300
but excellent journal that showed

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.930
that artificial sweeteners

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:23.750
but a particular artificial sweetener

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:28.275
which was saccharin can
disrupt the gut microbiome

01:25:28.275 --> 01:25:30.100
in ways that is detrimental

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.150
to a number of different health markers,

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:34.540
increasing inflammatory cytokines

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.826
and all the other bad
things that happen when

01:25:36.826 --> 01:25:41.460
the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.770
That study was widely discussed

01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:46.451
but there were a few things that were not

01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:47.730
mentioned there that are really important.

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:50.903
That study was about
saccharin in particular.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:56.050
Saccharin is not the
most typical artificial

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.416
sweetener that's used, the most typical

01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:00.971
artificial sweeteners
that are used are things

01:26:00.971 --> 01:26:04.370
like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet or Sucralose,

01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:07.910
or these days Stevia, there's
monk fruits, to my knowledge

01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:10.722
and please correct me if
anyone knows of any studies,

01:26:10.722 --> 01:26:13.450
to my knowledge, the negative effects

01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:15.950
of these artificial sweeteners

01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:20.130
on the gut microbiome were
restricted to saccharin.

01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:22.610
Now there is enough chemical similarity

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:23.930
between saccharin and some

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:25.940
of the other ones that I
mentioned, but not all of them.

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.700
For instance, Stevia,
monk fruit are distinct

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.512
in their chemical makeup so
that they probably don't have

01:26:34.512 --> 01:26:37.850
if they have any, have lower
effects, negative effects

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:40.600
on the gut microbiome, but
it should still be tested.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.820
So saccharin is really,
it was shown in this study

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.077
and several other studies
can really negatively

01:26:46.077 --> 01:26:50.703
impact the quality of the gut microbiome.

01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:54.420
Interestingly, the narrative
around artificial sweeteners

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:58.491
and gut microbiome is incorrect.

01:26:58.491 --> 01:26:59.940
Most people thought,

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:02.930
oh, saccharin is bad for the microbiome.

01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:04.880
It must kill the microbiome.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.150
And so you hear people saying,

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:08.340
oh, artificial sweeteners
kill the microbiome.

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:09.180
That's not true at all.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.780
In fact, in that very same
study published in nature

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.640
they showed that the negative affects

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.273
of saccharin on the
microbiome could be blocked

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:19.670
or eliminated by giving antibiotics.

01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:22.290
So what happens is certain
artificial sweeteners

01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:25.646
in particular saccharin
disrupt the microbiome

01:27:25.646 --> 01:27:28.200
and make the environment

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.250
within the gut that mucosal
lining more favorable

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:37.250
to bacteria microbiota that
are not good for the organism.

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.310
This is an important distinction.

01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:42.830
It's not just a language
thing where people say,

01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:44.900
oh, you know, it kills the microbiome.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:45.990
It doesn't kill the microbiome.

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:49.190
It shifts the microbiome and shifts

01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:51.370
in the microbiome can be
good or they can be bad.

01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:52.998
And that takes us to another topic

01:27:52.998 --> 01:27:54.910
that's a bit of a hot button topic

01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:55.830
but I'm willing to go there.

01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:57.863
'Cause I think it deserves conversation,

01:27:58.977 --> 01:28:01.660
which is nowadays there
are many examples out there

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:04.670
where people have switched
from a kind of standard diet

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:09.670
or even a vegetarian diet to
a vegan diet, to a keto diet.

01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:11.420
Now keto doesn't necessarily have to mean

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.891
the ingestion of meats, but it can.

01:28:13.891 --> 01:28:17.080
And they experience positive
effects for themselves.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:17.913
Not everybody.

01:28:17.913 --> 01:28:20.050
And I've talked previously
about some of the

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.530
kind of the incorrect,

01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:25.790
what I believe is
incorrect marketing of keto

01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:28.070
as it relates to the cosmetic effects

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:30.080
and some of the challenges with
sleep that some people have

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.400
but some people love keto
and it works great for them.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.380
But the ketogenic diet is interesting

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.920
because when one shifts
to the ketogenic diet

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.760
there is a shift in the gut microbiome.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.610
And some people end up feeling better.

01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:44.890
Some people end up feeling worse.

01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:49.310
Likewise, some people go from
ingesting animal products

01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:52.910
including meat or they're
vegetarian and they go to vegan

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:57.910
and they experience positive
shifts in mood and affect.

01:28:58.049 --> 01:29:00.260
And we know that the transition to a more

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:04.450
plant-based diet and especially
the enrichment of fiber

01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:08.710
that's present in those diets
also creates dramatic shifts

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.970
in the gut microbiome.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.730
Some people feel better doing that.

01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:12.780
Some people feel worse.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.400
And of course, it's
gonna depend on whether

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.350
or not you're ingesting a lot
of processed foods or not.

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:18.045
There was a paper published in "Cell",

01:29:18.045 --> 01:29:21.170
"Cell Press" journal
obviously, excellent journal,

01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:23.235
showing that ingestion of processed foods,

01:29:23.235 --> 01:29:25.120
regardless of whether or not they come

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.662
from animal sources or non-animal sources

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:31.470
the processed foods themselves
tend to create activity

01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:34.300
within the body and this surely has roots

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:35.390
in the nervous system that lead

01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:38.568
to over-consumption of
calories and weight gain.

01:29:38.568 --> 01:29:40.980
Even some weight gain
that couldn't be explained

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.850
by increased calories.

01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:44.020
In other words, processed
foods are bad, regardless of

01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.890
whether or not you're
talking about animal products

01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:48.750
or non animal products,
probably not surprising

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.740
given what you know
about these sugar sensing

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.830
and other amino acid sensing cells

01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:54.860
in the gut that we talked about earlier.

01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:58.070
So the point of all this is
that when I say you have to

01:29:58.070 --> 01:30:00.708
find what's right for you,
that's not a throwaway statement.

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:04.344
Some people's microbiome and the lining

01:30:04.344 --> 01:30:09.323
of their mucosa, excuse me,

01:30:09.323 --> 01:30:10.840
their mucosa lining of their throat,

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.050
of their gut, of their nose,

01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:16.430
everything is improved by diets
that are heavily meat based

01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:17.510
and don't have many plants.

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:19.893
Other people do much better
on a plant-based diet

01:30:19.893 --> 01:30:22.530
without many meat products
or animal products.

01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:23.960
It's highly individual.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.319
And this probably has
roots in genetic makeup.

01:30:26.319 --> 01:30:30.050
This probably has roots
in what people were raised

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:32.950
on because remember the
nervous system of course

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:35.640
is set up by your genetic, your
genes, your genetic program

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.010
but your nervous system adapts early

01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:40.320
in life to your conditions.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.180
That's what it's for,

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:43.815
the reason you have a
nervous system is to move

01:30:43.815 --> 01:30:45.650
your body appropriately
towards things that are good

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.130
for you and away from things that are not.

01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:50.200
But also it was designed to adapt.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.320
The early life period
has this incredible thing

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.130
about plasticity that
we spent a whole month

01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:56.230
on so that it can change so that yes

01:30:56.230 --> 01:30:58.010
indeed some people may like certain foods

01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:59.651
and react to certain
foods better than others

01:30:59.651 --> 01:31:03.320
because of the way that their
nervous system was wired.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.139
This enteric as it's called nervous system

01:31:05.139 --> 01:31:08.360
that lines the gut and the
communicates with the brain.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.500
So most of what I've talked

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:12.590
about today is kind of black and white.

01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:14.210
These are things that
are present in all of us,

01:31:14.210 --> 01:31:15.600
the sugar sensing neurons of the gut,

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.300
the way the vagus is wired.

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:20.090
The fact that omega-3
omega-6 is tend to improve.

01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:22.950
The ratios tend to impact
mood with high omega-3.

01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:25.270
omega-6 ratios improving mood.

01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:28.500
We talked about all sorts
of things in the gut brain

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.914
and body brain axis, but when
it comes to the microbiome

01:31:31.914 --> 01:31:34.790
the key thing is that we
all have a microbiome.

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:36.992
You want a microbiome, but you want to

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:40.310
promote the microbiome
that is right for you.

01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:42.771
And that can be shifted and steered

01:31:42.771 --> 01:31:46.899
by ingesting certain categories
of foods and not others.

01:31:46.899 --> 01:31:49.676
And one thing that really
frustrates me is when

01:31:49.676 --> 01:31:51.553
the people show up with an agenda,

01:31:52.505 --> 01:31:54.570
like all meat agenda or a vegan agenda

01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:57.360
or a keto agenda, and they talk
about these positive effects

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.600
on the gut microbiome.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.280
And it's all true, frankly.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.480
And so it's highly individual.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:03.630
Now this doesn't get to
any of the ethical issues

01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:05.080
around animals or the planet,

01:32:06.122 --> 01:32:10.274
and you hear rabid debates
about that on both sides.

01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:13.740
And I am not qualified or equipped to talk

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.753
about whether or not
regenerative agriculture,

01:32:15.753 --> 01:32:18.430
animal products, or farming
or any of these things,

01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:20.570
how those actually impact the environment,

01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:21.730
that is not my expertise,

01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:24.248
but when it comes to your
health and your microbiome

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:26.060
you want to support the microbiome.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.400
It's very clear

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.070
that these fermented foods
support the microbiome

01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:33.690
that we should be ingesting
at least two servings per day.

01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:36.611
Which is quite a lot that supplementation

01:32:36.611 --> 01:32:38.485
at low levels can be good.

01:32:38.485 --> 01:32:41.330
Supplementation at high levels
can create this brain fog

01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:43.328
even though some people say
that result is controversial.

01:32:43.328 --> 01:32:46.830
I've experienced this
myself and the data looked

01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:49.130
to me pretty darn solid.

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:52.021
So that's one thing to
think about as well.

01:32:52.021 --> 01:32:55.530
And the other thing
about the gut microbiome

01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:57.470
is that it's highly contextual based

01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:58.740
on other things that you're doing.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.490
So even things like exercise
and social well-being

01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:03.520
and connection, those
things are also impacting

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.124
the gut microbiome.

01:33:05.124 --> 01:33:06.310
So find the diet that's right for you.

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:09.936
And that works for you in the
context of the other ethical

01:33:09.936 --> 01:33:12.420
and lifestyle choices
that are important to you.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.490
That's my advice.

01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:15.030
A note about fasting.

01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:16.940
I have a colleague at
Yale, who's an expert

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.926
in the gut microbiome.

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:20.600
And he told me something
really interesting,

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.033
which is when we fast,

01:33:24.690 --> 01:33:27.920
we actually digest certain components

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.030
within our dietary tract.

01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:33.380
It actually depletes a good
amount of the gut microbiome.

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:35.181
And this is interesting.

01:33:35.181 --> 01:33:36.014
I've had good results

01:33:36.014 --> 01:33:38.410
from I guess you would call
it intermittent or kind

01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:41.440
of circadian type fasting where
I've never done long fast,

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.890
but where I push out my
first meal by a few hours

01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:46.209
my first meal is generally
around lunchtime or so

01:33:46.209 --> 01:33:50.130
but the longer periods of
fasting that go for a day

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:52.477
or two or three days are known to deplete

01:33:52.477 --> 01:33:56.220
the gut microbiome in major ways.

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.170
But that's not always
necessarily a bad thing

01:33:58.170 --> 01:34:02.096
because when it's replenished,
it often is replenished

01:34:02.096 --> 01:34:05.640
at levels that exceeded
its previous level.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.790
But I think that some of
the GI tract and even some

01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:12.630
of the mental effects of
returning to eating after feeding

01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:14.670
sometimes people don't feel so
good when they start eating.

01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:17.288
They really want food, but
then they start eating again.

01:34:17.288 --> 01:34:18.270
They don't feel as good
as they did on the fast.

01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:20.494
Some of that may be
related to the depletion

01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:23.140
of the microbiome that
occurs during long fast.

01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:25.279
So again, this is something
to think about and talk about

01:34:25.279 --> 01:34:28.283
with your doctor, but
the idea that fasting

01:34:28.283 --> 01:34:30.357
across the board is good.

01:34:30.357 --> 01:34:32.970
There may be some merits
to that, and certainly

01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:36.680
in some cases, but it does
deplete the microbiome

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.010
and that depletion of the
microbiome is significant

01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:41.720
because it means when you return
to eating, you're actually

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.549
not in the same position to digest

01:34:43.549 --> 01:34:45.240
and assimilate those foods.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.250
And those foods are not
in the same position to

01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:48.790
impact your brain and body the same way

01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:50.930
they were prior to the fast.

01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:52.790
And this is, I think why
people suggest a kind

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:54.820
of gradual transition back

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:58.320
to consuming nutrients after a fast.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.974
So as we round up, I want to
share some results with you

01:35:00.974 --> 01:35:05.545
That without question will
impact the way that you respond

01:35:05.545 --> 01:35:08.810
to food mentally and even physically.

01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:11.550
And I know that because
that's the central theme

01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:13.890
of the studies I'm
about to tell you about.

01:35:13.890 --> 01:35:16.700
I have a colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum,

01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:20.913
who's done some remarkable
experiments on mindset.

01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:24.660
And some people could think
about these as placebo effects

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.823
or belief effects,

01:35:27.076 --> 01:35:29.490
but they actually go
way beyond those terms.

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:31.990
And there are a number
of different examples

01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:33.410
of this that Aaliyah's lab

01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:35.470
and her coworkers have demonstrated.

01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:38.957
But two that are particularly
interesting to me

01:35:38.957 --> 01:35:40.750
I Want to share with you now

01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:42.900
because they really emphasize how

01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:45.807
our beliefs can really
impact the way that our brain

01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:47.600
and body work together.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.120
I think the most famous of
these is an experiment they did

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.150
where they had two groups of individuals.

01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:57.150
They were each given a milkshake
and they had some factors

01:35:58.178 --> 01:36:01.370
measured from their
blood by an IV while they

01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:02.300
ingested the milkshake.

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.370
And then afterwards as well.

01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:06.220
And one of the factors
that they were looking

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:10.780
at was something called
grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:13.850
Grehlin is a peptide that
increases with hunger.

01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:16.320
So the longer you haven't
eaten that grehlin goes up.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.780
And I know some of you say,
well, I fast, I fast, I fast

01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.020
and I eventually lose my appetite.

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.180
Well, grehlin still goes
up and then it drops.

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:25.180
So if you were one of these
people that eats every three

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.050
hours regularly, grehlin
kind of gets a little pulse

01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:30.580
as you get to that two
hour and 50 minute mark.

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.390
So it's a little bit of a timer as well.

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:34.451
It's really interesting peptide.

01:36:34.451 --> 01:36:39.080
In any event, what they did is
they gave people milkshakes,

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.650
two groups, one group got
a shake that they were told

01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:44.720
it was a low calorie, healthy shake.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.310
The other got a milkshake
that they were told

01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:52.210
it was the very decadent
high calorie shake.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:54.560
I think it was something
like two or maybe even two

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.410
and a half times as many
calories as the other.

01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:59.730
Perhaps even more, I
don't recall the details,

01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:00.650
but you got a high calorie

01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:02.260
and a low calorie condition.

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.610
And then they drank the shake

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:08.460
and then they measured grehlin
in these subjects' blood.

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:12.110
And what they found was
that the high calorie shake

01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.831
had a much more robust effect

01:37:13.831 --> 01:37:18.412
on blunting grehlin and reducing grehlin.

01:37:18.412 --> 01:37:21.150
But the interesting thing you
probably guessed already is

01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:24.630
that it was the exact same
shake given to both groups.

01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:27.330
So people's belief about the content

01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:30.430
of something impacted their physiology.

01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:33.060
And this speaks to the so-called top

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.830
down mechanisms or
modulation of our physiology.

01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:38.770
In a previous episode about pain

01:37:38.770 --> 01:37:41.692
we talked about the effects of obsessive

01:37:41.692 --> 01:37:44.394
believe it or not, it was
an obsessive infatuation

01:37:44.394 --> 01:37:47.690
and love on pain responses
and pain thresholds.

01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:49.673
This is yet another example where beliefs

01:37:49.673 --> 01:37:52.970
or subjective feelings
can impact physiology

01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.120
at the level of the periphery,

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.700
because grehlin is released
in the periphery in the body.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.080
Now, these beliefs affects

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.720
extend beyond examples like this,

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.470
another good example
that I'd like to share

01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:07.240
is Alia, Dr. Crum,

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.940
and her colleagues did an experiment where

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.901
they took housekeepers,

01:38:11.901 --> 01:38:13.685
they were essentially hotel workers,

01:38:13.685 --> 01:38:15.440
divide them into two groups.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.180
They had them watch a short film.

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.779
In one case, the film was about how

01:38:18.779 --> 01:38:21.810
their work was important to
help people feel comfortable

01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.780
in the hotel, et cetera, et cetera.

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:26.130
The other group heard that
the activity that they were

01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:27.610
doing cleaning and taking care

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.240
of the hotel was good for them.

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.790
It was good for their
health, et cetera, et cetera.

01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:34.970
They controlled very nicely in the study

01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:39.000
for health parameters, for
individual differences.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.430
And for the behaviors of
these people in the period

01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.860
that followed this short tutorial.

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.085
And what they found was eight weeks later,

01:38:47.085 --> 01:38:51.130
the group that had been told
that the activity was good

01:38:51.130 --> 01:38:53.530
for them showed lower blood pressure.

01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:56.100
They had lost a significant
amount of body fat

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.330
and they reported enjoying
their work far more

01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:00.163
than the other group.

01:39:00.163 --> 01:39:03.428
The same work, simply biased mentally

01:39:03.428 --> 01:39:06.560
by the information that they were given,

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.630
but their physiology
followed that information.

01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:14.190
And so this is not just
the placebo effect.

01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:15.669
This is an incredible set

01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:18.410
of findings that illustrate
the extent to which whether

01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:20.490
or not we believe a food is gonna be good

01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:22.147
for us or not good for us.

01:39:22.147 --> 01:39:24.660
Well, we can't escape the reality.

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:26.790
You can't tell yourself that
a poison is gonna be good

01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:27.960
for you and ingest that poison

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.010
and expect it to not kill you,

01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:34.890
nor can you tell yourself
that eating 12 croissants,

01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:36.290
I confess I've done it,

01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:39.140
it was after a very long
run, a long time ago

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.120
but you can't tell yourself

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.500
that that's necessarily going to be good

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.990
for you or that it's gonna
make you lose weight.

01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:47.330
These belief effects are not about lying

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:49.810
to yourself in these
cases, in these experiments

01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:53.780
as you'll notice that subjects
didn't have prior knowledge

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.550
about grehlin or about the effects

01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:58.980
of their daily routine on
weight loss and blood pressure.

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:00.120
So in order for them to work

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.740
you have to be naive to
the information, right?

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.340
You can't simply lie to yourself

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.381
and tell yourself what you want to believe

01:40:07.381 --> 01:40:12.350
and that's important, but also
important is that the mind

01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:14.850
and the body are in this
fascinating interplay.

01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:17.246
And today we've talked
mainly about how the body

01:40:17.246 --> 01:40:20.620
and things that we put inside this tube,

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:24.890
that runs from our mouth to
the other end to our rectum,

01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:28.080
basically is impacting all these cells,

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.702
these neurons, microbiota
in their mucosal lining,

01:40:32.702 --> 01:40:35.610
heart, lungs and how all
that information is feeding

01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:38.120
up to the brain to impact
how we feel up here.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.464
But also how we feel up here is impacting

01:40:40.464 --> 01:40:43.100
how our body reacts at levels

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.382
of very core physiology that
you couldn't just tell yourself

01:40:46.382 --> 01:40:49.016
that this was gonna work,
but what you believe

01:40:49.016 --> 01:40:51.800
about certain substances, certain foods,

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.530
certain nutrients does
have a profound effect

01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:57.270
on the magnitude of their impact

01:40:57.270 --> 01:41:01.360
and sometimes even the quality
and direction of that impact.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.870
Well, first of all,

01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:05.270
I want to thank everybody for
their support of this podcast.

01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:07.780
The response that we've
received since releasing

01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.300
at the beginning of the new
year has been tremendous.

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.856
And we're so grateful for it.

01:41:11.856 --> 01:41:14.163
I know some of you and people I've said,

01:41:14.163 --> 01:41:16.460
well, it's a lot of information.

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.310
It's like a college lecture.

01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:20.010
Indeed, there's a lot of information,

01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:23.473
but I believe very strongly
that if you learn mechanism

01:41:23.473 --> 01:41:26.268
and maybe even if you
hear it several times over

01:41:26.268 --> 01:41:28.660
eventually those
mechanisms become embedded

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:31.051
into the way that you
view an entire topic.

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:33.840
As well, I always try and put tools

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.051
as I go along that you
can look to immediately.

01:41:36.051 --> 01:41:37.920
Some of them might be right for you.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.190
Others might not,

01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:41.930
try them if you like and
don't if you don't want to,

01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:44.383
and if they don't work for
you, then discard them.

01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:46.630
If however, you are finding benefits

01:41:46.630 --> 01:41:49.300
from the information and
from the tools and you know

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:51.520
others that you think
could benefit from it,

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.070
please pass along information
about the podcast.

please give us a
five-star review on Apple.

01:42:07.610 --> 01:42:09.210
All those things really help us.

01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:12.690
In addition, if you'd like to
support the podcast further

01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:14.270
we've set up a Patreon account.

01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:17.570
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:20.402
It allows you to support the
podcast at a variety of levels.

01:42:20.402 --> 01:42:24.500
We have the 5-HTP
serotonin for $5 a month,

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.670
the Costello, $10 a month

01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:28.035
in honor of Costello, et cetera.

01:42:28.035 --> 01:42:30.270
You don't have to but if you'd like to,

01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:31.660
that would be terrific.

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:34.310
In addition, please check out our sponsors

01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:35.640
that we've mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.920
That's one of the best
ways to help support us.

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.520
And we do believe in all
the products that we support

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.530
and our sponsors very much otherwise

01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:45.780
we wouldn't be working with them.

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.930
So much so that when I
mentioned supplements

01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:50.870
and I talk about supplements
throughout the course

01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:53.850
of the episodes, I don't
mention specific brands,

01:42:53.850 --> 01:42:56.750
but I would be remiss if
I didn't mention the fact

01:42:56.750 --> 01:43:01.118
that we have partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

01:43:01.118 --> 01:43:03.260
And we've done that because we know

01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.770
that Thorne uses the highest levels

01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:09.400
of stringency in terms of
the products they produce.

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.320
What they say is in each capsule

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.010
and tablet actually is,

01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:14.370
they're used by the Mayo Clinic,

01:43:14.370 --> 01:43:15.740
by all the major sports teams

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:18.520
because of their level
of stringency and rigor.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.630
If you want to know
what supplements I take

01:43:20.630 --> 01:43:25.630
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:27.280
And you can see the
supplements that I take

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.810
and you can get those as well

01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:30.550
as any of the other supplements

01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:33.180
and products that Thorne
makes for 20% off.

01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:38.180
So it's thorne.com/u/huberman to get 20%

01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:41.920
off any supplements that Thorne makes.

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.350
So in today's episode,
we took a full journey

01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:45.980
into the brain body relationship

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.840
and discussed a lot of the mechanisms

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.790
and the actionable items
that you can approach

01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:52.500
if you want to explore this aspect

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:54.780
of your biology and psychology further.

01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:56.950
Last, but certainly not least,

01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:58.200
I want to thank everybody

01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.610
for your time and attention today,

01:43:59.610 --> 01:44:03.051
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

01:44:03.051 --> 01:44:05.634
