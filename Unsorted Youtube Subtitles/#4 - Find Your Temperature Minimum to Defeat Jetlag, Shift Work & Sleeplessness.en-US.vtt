00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.380
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.790
where we discuss science,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.220
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.803
[bright music]

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.750
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.870
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.040
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.280
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.610
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.160
It is however, part of my desire

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.010
to bring you zero cost to
consumer information about science

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.340
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.173
Along those lines,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.120
I want to thank today's
sponsors of the podcast.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.460
The first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.770
Athletic Greens is a product

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.190
that I've been using since 2012,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.750
long before I launched this podcast.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.350
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.340
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.210
vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.540
It's a greens drink
that you mix with water,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.890
I add lemon juice to mine
because I like the way it tastes

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.750
and it gets you all the
vitamins and minerals you need

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.030
as well as probiotics, and
probiotics are important to me

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.410
because there are a lot of data
now showing that gut health

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.300
is important for the gut brain access,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.690
things like mood, immunity, etc.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.240
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.140
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.270
and if you do that, they'll
send you a year supply

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.550
of liquid vitamin D3 and K2.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.630
Vitamin D3, as many of
you probably already know,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.030
it has been shown to be important

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.590
for various aspects of
immune system function,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.530
as well as other biological pathways,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.650
metabolic function, etc.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.650
So once again, if you want
to try Athletic Greens,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.380
you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.883
and they will send you a
year supply of the D3 K2.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.430
This podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.660
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.090
I've been meditating on and off

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.390
since I was in my teens
with more off than on,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.820
mainly because meditation
can be hard to stick to.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.920
Some people are very good

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.040
at maintaining a meditation practice,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.830
others not so much, I'm
in the latter category.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.810
However, I find that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.230
when I have something
to guide my meditation

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.470
such as Headspace, it makes it much easier

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.520
for me to be consistent
about my meditation practice.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.600
There is now tons of data out there

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.160
in quality peer review journals,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.090
showing that meditative
states can facilitate

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.240
cognition, recovery of mental function,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.150
recovery of physical ability, etc.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.100
So there are a lot of reasons

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.770
to take up a meditation practice.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.690
Headspace and the
Headspace app makes it easy

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.640
to learn and maintain
a meditation practice.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.250
If you want to try Headspace,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.201
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:41.160
And if you do that, they
will let you try Headspace

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.870
for an entire month for free.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.770
So zero risk there, that's
headspace.com/specialoffer

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.850
to try Headspace, the meditation app,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.950
for one month for free.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.950
Today's podcast episode is
about sleep and wakefulness.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.060
We are going to discuss
jet lag, shift work,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.500
babies, kids and the elderly,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.720
and we are going to discuss protocols

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.710
that are backed by science.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.500
That means quality peer reviewed papers

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.140
published in excellent journals

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.220
that can support particular tools

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.570
that you can use to combat
things like jet lag,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.950
offset some of the negative
effects of shift work

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.040
and make life easier for the new parent

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.620
as well as for the newborn
child, the adolescent,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.220
anyone that wants to sleep better,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.150
feel better when they're awake, etc.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.740
If you've listened to the previous

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.090
three episodes of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.600
we've been exploring these themes

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.620
of wakefulness and sleepiness,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.000
how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.890
And we've been discussing
parameters like light,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.540
exercise, temperature, etc.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.290
If you've had a chance to
listen to those episodes, great.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.260
Today's discussion will be
even more digestible for you.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.230
If you haven't, that's okay.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.410
I will provide a little bit
of background here or there

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.450
so that it's not necessary

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.710
that you have listened to
those previous episodes.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.290
But if you get a chance to listen to them,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.200
please do it,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.610
I think it will help you
digest the information better.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.990
Let's just take a step back for a moment

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.500
and remind everybody
what we're talking about.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.240
We're talking about an
endogenous, meaning within us,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.890
rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.230
The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.340
in all sorts of functions.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.780
The most prominent one is a rhythm

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.280
in our feelings of
wakefulness and sleepiness.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.920
So believe it or not,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.360
the experiment has been
done throughout history,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.760
not often, but it's been done

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.130
where people would go down into a cave

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.560
and will exist in constant
darkness for some period of time.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.393
There are also cases

00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:47.730
where people have been in constant light

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.390
for some period of time.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.130
But because people can close their eyes,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.200
it's actually easier to do the experiment

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.610
where you're in constant darkness

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.320
to address the question
of what is the endogenous,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.720
meaning, the internal
rhythm that we all have.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.410
And it turns out we all have
this rhythm of about 24 hours,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.170
although it's not exactly 24 hours.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.030
Meaning, every 24 hours
your body temperature

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.050
goes from low to high and
back down to low again.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.090
And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.643
Not 18, not six, 24 plus
or minus a couple hours.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.870
You also have a rhythm in
sleepiness and wakefulness

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.790
that correlates with that.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.280
We tend to be sleepy as
our temperature is falling,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.280
getting lower, and we tend
to be more awake or waking

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.840
when our temperature is increasing.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.440
This is a biological fact.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.940
It is right down to our DNA.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.410
We actually have genes in
every single one of our cells

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.550
that ensure that every cell
is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.723
close to 24 hours.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.160
We have a clock over
the roof of our mouth,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.210
a group of neurons called
the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.010
That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.800
And that clock is in-trained,
meaning it is matched,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.950
to the external light-dark cycle,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.140
which is no surprise, 24 hours.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.550
Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.060
So, our cells, our organs,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.670
our wakefulness, our temperature,

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.720
but also our metabolism,
our immune system, our mood,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.610
all of that is tethered to
the outside light-dark cycle.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.030
And if we are living our
life in a perfect way,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.300
where we wake up in the morning,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.660
and we view sunlight as
it crosses the horizon,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.280
and then by evening, we
catch a little sunlight

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.020
and then at night we're
in complete darkness,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.240
we will be more or less perfectly matched

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.893
to the external or
ambient light-dark cycle.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.810
Very few of us do that

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.800
because of these things that
we call artificial lights,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.110
and this other thing that
we call life demands.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.210
So today we're going to talk about

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.060
when we get pulled away from that rhythm.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.290
Now you may immediately be thinking,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.120
well, I've heard there are night owls

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.790
and there are mornings larks,
they're sometimes called

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.580
and their genetic polymorphisms,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.050
that's just a fancy name for

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.590
genetic variations that make
some people want to wake up early

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.647
and other people want to stay up late

00:07:14.647 --> 00:07:16.490
and teens want to sleep in more.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.390
Sure, that's all true.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.830
That's all true regardless
of what names we give those.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.730
However, there's no escaping the fact

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.170
that human beings are a diurnal species.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.710
We were designed, literally,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.840
our cells and the circuits of our body

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.250
were constructed to be
awake during the daytime

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.600
and asleep at night.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600
How do I know that?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.160
Well, I wasn't consulted
at the design phase,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.020
but I'm certain of that
because many studies have shown

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.340
that when we deviate too
far from a diurnal schedule

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.720
and we try and become
nocturnal, we can pull it off,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.560
but serious health effects,
both mental and physical,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.270
start to arise.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.060
I'm not going to spend much of today

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.220
talking about all the
negative effects of jet lag

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.970
I'll talk a little bit about it,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.630
or the negative effects of shift work,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.050
or trying to scare you

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.920
by telling you about the quite valid data

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.770
around depression, amnesia,

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.980
dementia, all the terrible
things that happen

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.060
when you're not sleeping well,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.870
rather I'd like to
focus on what you can do

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.670
and arm you with tools.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.840
So let's talk about that
perfect schedule for a moment.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.550
And then let's talk about jet lag

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.200
and what jet lag really represents

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.200
and how to push back on jet
lag, shift your clock faster,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.550
and escape some of the severe bad things

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.910
that can happen with jet lag.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.700
Including just feeling miserable

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.890
when you're traveling
for work or vacation.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.030
So what is the perfect day?

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.070
What does that look
like from our circadian

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.340
sleep-wakefulness standpoint?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.930
I'm about to summarize what I've said in

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.790
the three previous podcast episodes,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.593
as well as now countless Instagram posts.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.230
Here's the deal.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.230
You basically want to get as
much light, ideally sunlight,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.090
but as much light into your eyes

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.340
during the period of each 24 hour cycle

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.830
when you want to be awake,
when you want to be alert.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.440
And you want to get as
little light into your eyes

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.167
at the times of that 24 hour cycle

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:20.923
when you want to be asleep
or drowsy and falling asleep.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.200
How much is enough?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.700
Well, you don't want to go so high

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.670
with the light exposure
that you damage your eyes

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.090
because as many of you
have heard me say before,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.460
the eyes are actually
two pieces of your brain,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.380
your central nervous system

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.120
that were extruded out of your skull.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.240
And as pieces of the central
nervous system, aka your brain,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.300
they will not regenerate.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.230
At least right now, the
technologies don't exist

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.630
to regenerate those neurons in humans

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.450
you do not want to damage them.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.820
So what is too bright?

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.400
Well, when it's painful to look at.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.760
When you have to blink or close your eyes

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.593
in order to bear it.

00:09:51.593 --> 00:09:54.780
So please don't look
at very bright lights,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.463
so painful that they're likely
going to damage your eyes.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.540
However, if you get up in the morning,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.010
and it's still dark out
and you want to be awake,

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.370
you would be wise to turn
on artificial lights,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.590
in particular, overhead lights

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.130
for reasons I've discussed previously.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.410
But those overhead lights will

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.920
optimally trigger the neurons,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.580
these melanopsin cells in the retina

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.230
that will activate your circadian clock.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.850
When the sun comes out,
even if there's cloud cover,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.070
the sun does come out every day

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.480
regardless of where you live,
unless you live in a cave.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.313
People have said to me,

00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:32.520
well, I live in an area where
I can't really see the sun.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.193
Well, the sun is there,

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.120
it might be hiding behind clouds,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.100
unless it's very very dark where you live

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.490
like Scandinavia in the depths of winter

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.270
in which case you might
want some artificial light.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.060
Get some sunlight in
your eyes when you can.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.960
Here's the deal with
sunlight and artificial light

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.810
that I have not discussed previously.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.060
A lot of photon energy,

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.150
a high amount of lux, L-U-X,
comes through even cloud cover.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.430
A good number to shoot
for as a rule of thumb,

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.890
is to try and get exposure

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.890
to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM.

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:14.380
10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.380
assuming you're waking up
sometime between five and 8:00 AM.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.380
Okay, so get 100,000 lux.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.100
Now you do not, I want to repeat,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.010
you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.570
or a 100,000 lux light.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.823
It's very, very bright.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.020
The mechanism of circadian clock setting

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.830
and this is very important,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.810
the mechanism of circadian clock setting

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.280
involves these neurons in your eye

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.730
that send electrical signals

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.140
to this clock above the roof of your mouth

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.990
and that system sums,
meaning it adds photons,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.800
it's a very slow system.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.780
So let's say that I wake up

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.700
and I look at my computer screen
briefly or my phone screen.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.850
That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.610
If I were to look at
that for a full minute,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.840
I would get that photon energy

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.870
transferred into electrical
energy of neurons

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.970
and it would be communicated
to my circadian clock.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.960
However, the signal that it's morning

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.360
will not have registered
with the circadian clock

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.030
unless I looked at that for
a hundred minutes or more,

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.920
so 100,000.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.910
Now the problem is if you
wake up at eight o'clock,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.780
you're not going to get enough
light from artificial light

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.040
before you reach what's called
the circadian dead zone.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.960
So you have this opportunity
before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.080
to capture enough photons,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.760
and you have to do it with your eyes.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.450
I've discussed why that's important

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.050
in previous episodes of the podcast,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.350
we have to do it with your eyes.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.550
There is no extra ocular photo reception.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.280
This is not about vitamin D in your skin.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.450
This is about setting your circadian clock

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.810
which is paramount for
mental and physical health.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.240
So here we're talking
about trying to get that

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.730
at least 100,000 photons
but not all at once,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.350
but you got to get them before
9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.183
So what do you do?

00:12:57.183 --> 00:12:58.300
You go outside.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.250
If you want to get nerdy
about this quantitative,

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.820
you could download a
free app like Light Meter

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.300
and take a look around
your house with Light Meter

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.890
and you'll notice that
even bright overhead lights

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.260
are only emitting about
4,000 or 5,000 lux.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.390
It's going to take a long while
of looking at those lights

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.840
with eyes open in order to
set your circadian clock

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.190
and tell your brain and
body that it's morning.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.450
Going outside even on a cloudy day

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.540
could be 7,000, 10,000 lux.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.070
It's really remarkable how bright it is,

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.010
meaning how much photon
energy is coming through.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.870
So try and get 100,000
lux before that 9:00 AM.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.980
Now, if you can't do that

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.840
because you live in an area of the world

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.410
where it's just not bright enough.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.900
Some people have sent me
pictures from Northern England.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.990
It's just not bright enough in winter.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.870
Then sure, you can resort
to using artificial lights

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.400
in order to get enough photons.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.850
And I'm putting out this
100,000 lux number as a target

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.653
to get each day before 9:00 AM.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.440
You can in theory, get it
all from artificial lights,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.500
but there are some special
qualities about sunlight

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.670
that make sunlight the better stimulus.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.733
First of all, it's free
if it's available outside.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.100
There is a number of different...

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.150
There are, excuse me, a number
of different technologies

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.270
kind of like this one like a light pad

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.330
that this one says it's a 930 lux.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.940
I'm covering this up 'cause
I'm not trying to promote

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.860
any specific products.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.790
I actually bought this just
with my own money on Amazon,

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.040
they're not a sponsor.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.570
And it lets you toggle the brightness,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.470
I think by holding this on,
holding down this button,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.820
you can make it dimmer or brighter.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.940
There's about 1,000 lux,
it seems really bright,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.240
but a cloudy day outside

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.113
will have five times more
photon energy coming through.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.870
So some people set these
lights or ring lights

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.530
that they use for selfies
and that kind of thing

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.700
near their coffee or workstation
first thing in the morning

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.910
but you really want to get sunlight, okay?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.830
So those things are kind of
nice because they'll travel

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.850
and we're going to talk about jet lag.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.310
But I can't emphasize this enough

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.460
that light has to be captured and summed

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.350
before you enter the circadian dead zone

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.833
which is the middle of the day.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.490
This is again, trying to achieve
kind of perfect schedule.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.140
Then I've recommended, based
on scientific literature,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.750
that you look at sunlight sometime around

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.970
the time when the sun is setting

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.320
and the reason for that of course

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.230
is because it adjusts down
the sensitivity of your eyes

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.740
because here's the diabolical thing.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.900
While we need a lot of photon
energy early in the day

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.070
to wake up our system and
set our circadian clock,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.590
and prepare us for a good night's sleep

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.700
14 to 16 hours later,

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.040
it takes very little photon energy

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.110
to reset and shift our
clock after 8:00 PM.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.960
And that's why you want to,
as much as you safely can,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.550
avoid bright light and
even not so bright light

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.363
between the hours of 10
or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.150
A number of people have asked
me some questions about this.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.170
And the last episode I
went into red lights,

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.030
I went ahead and discussed blue blockers,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.320
all that kind of stuff, so I'm
not going to repeat all that.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.440
But here's the thing, if
you see afternoon light,

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.580
you're going to adjust down
the sensitivity of your eyes

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.010
so that you have a little
bit more wiggle room,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.880
a little bit more leeway

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.630
to view lights from screens
and overhead lights even

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.790
late at night without
disrupting your circadian clock.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.880
But it is a kind of a double-edged sword

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.040
where you need a lot of
light early in the day

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.590
and you need to avoid bright
lights later in the day.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.730
I've mentioned studies on here,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.160
a number of you have asked
about getting the references.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.300
We are in the process of
trying to get a webpage

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.360
going with full links.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.940
There's some copyright issues
that we have to deal with.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.530
But wherever possible, I'll
try and reference these studies

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.270
and when people ask
I'll generally put them

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.793
in the response to their
comments on YouTube or Instagram.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.310
There have been two studies

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.770
done from University of Colorado,

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.530
both published in Current Biology.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.030
You can easily find these online

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.130
by just googling the
words, Current Biology,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.240
camping and reset circadian clocks,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.830
that have shown that two days
of waking up with the sun

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.490
and avoiding light at night,

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.987
they actually took
graduate students camping,

00:17:05.987 --> 00:17:08.130
what a cool experiment to be a part of,

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.350
reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.990
for these people that had otherwise

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.240
drifted quite far from
their natural rhythms.

00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:19.260
There're other things that
you can do to shift your clock

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.480
and to reinforce your clock.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.200
Like exercising more
or less the same time,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.230
eating more or less the same time, etc.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.680
That's not what today's episode is about.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.040
So I just described perfect schedule.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.470
Get at least 100,000 lux of
light exposure to the eyes

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.510
not all at once, but
summing across the morning.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.710
Again you know when it's too much

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.280
because it's painful to look at,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.130
so that's obviously something to avoid.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.090
But then once the middle of the day,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.540
let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.260
you go outside the sun's
overhead, forget it,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.210
you're not going to shift
your clock, you're just not.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.460
It doesn't work that way.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.360
In the evening, you see the evening light

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.740
and you want to get that light

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.690
to adjust down your retinal sensitivity

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.850
to afford you a bit of a
buffer so that late at night,

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:01.970
if you happen to look at screens

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.230
or go to the bathroom in
the middle of the night,

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.190
it's not going to shift your clock

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.853
because it takes probably only about

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:11.330
1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.120
to shift your clock in
the middle of the night.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.600
So let's talk about shifting clocks

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.543
because for the jet lagged person,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.810
this ability to shift the clock

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.270
with light, temperature,
exercise, and food

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.810
is vitally important

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.010
for getting onto the new local schedule.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.990
And there's so much out
there about jet lag today.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.000
I'm going to dial it down to
one very specific parameter

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.300
that all of you can figure out

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.040
without any technology or devices

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:42.040
and can apply for when you
travel for work or pleasure,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.860
or anytime you're jet lagged,

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.460
and I want to absolutely emphasize

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.850
that you don't have to
travel to get jet lagged.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.800
Many of you are jet lagged.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.770
You're jet lagged because

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.370
you're looking at your phone
in the middle of the night,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.510
you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.130
at different times a day,
you're jet lagged because

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.150
your exercise is on a
kind of chaotic regime,

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.680
some days at this time,
some days at that time.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.770
And if that works for you, great.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.370
I want to be really clear that

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.340
a number of people always say,
well, I know so and so that

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.600
you know only needed
four hours of sleep and,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.240
or they're just fine,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.100
they traveled to Europe
and they're just fine.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.650
There's a lot of individual variability.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.483
And we're going to talk about

00:19:18.483 --> 00:19:20.320
the origins of some of that variability.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.050
I mean, I know people
that can eat anything

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.010
and somehow seem to maintain
great lipid profiles

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:31.010
and you know, body weight
and fitness ability.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.920
And I know some people
that they eat one cracker

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.320
and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.390
kind of tears, right, because
they think that that's going to

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.820
throw them off and maybe
it does, I don't know.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.790
There's a tremendous amount
of variability out there.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:49.790
So, this is really about
optimal and what's possible.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.440
And you have to ask,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.170
I can just say from personal experience,

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.180
I suffer terribly from jet lag,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.920
traveling in certain
directions but not others.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.780
Some people don't have
trouble with jet lag.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.180
Many people will travel to a new location,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.840
they feel great for
the first day and night

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.140
and then they crash and
they have trouble sleeping.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.460
Or they travel back and
they have a terrible time

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.350
getting back onto a normal schedule.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.547
And some of this varies with age

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.930
and some of it varies with genetics

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.530
and there is no simple pill
or anything that you can take

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.450
to just get rid of jet lag.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.283
It doesn't work that way.

00:20:23.283 --> 00:20:26.120
If it worked that way, I would tell you.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.620
But there are some simple
things that you can do.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.810
I'm going to arm you with the knowledge

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.450
of what jet lag is and how it works.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.060
And contrary to what many people
out there say and believe,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.130
I know that understanding mechanism

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.963
affords you more flexibility.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.040
Why understand mechanism as just opposed

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.450
to me just writing up a PDF

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.780
and giving you a list of things to do?

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.840
Well, what happens when
you can't do those things

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.290
in exactly the way they're written down.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.900
When you understand mechanism,

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.950
you understand how to control the machine

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.360
that is your biological
system, your nervous system.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.300
So a little bit of
understanding about mechanism

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.860
goes a really long way.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.720
So that's where we're headed.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.920
Let's talk about what jet lag is.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.460
Okay well, I promised that
I wouldn't get too dark

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.150
with all the terrible things
that can happen with jet lag,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.863
but I'm about to get dark.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.110
There are quality peer reviewed papers

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.903
showing that jet lag
will shorten your life.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.493
It will kill you earlier.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.450
I guess it means you'll die earlier.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.110
It doesn't actually kill you necessarily.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.860
Although there are many
cases where tourists

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.550
end up stepping in front of buses,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.080
especially in countries
where the cars and buses

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.550
drive on the opposite side of the street

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.120
that they're used to,

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.030
who are jet lagged and
lose their life that way.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.710
Jet lag is a serious thing.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.257
Sure we have a family story about this.

00:21:43.257 --> 00:21:44.710
When I was growing up,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.620
I had a family member
travel overseas for work

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.020
and take a sleeping pill, I
won't name the sleeping pill,

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.240
though at the end I'm going
to talk about sleeping pills,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.233
and had a case of total
amnesia for a week.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.460
That's not entirely uncommon.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.000
If you've ever been really
jet lagged and fallen asleep,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.690
doesn't even have to be in the
middle of the day, woken up,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.530
you might not know where you are.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.910
And that's because time and space

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.270
are really linked in the brain,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.610
wasn't designed to be
transported four, five six hours

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.200
into a new time zone, it just wasn't.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.530
Our brain and the biological mechanisms

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.610
that govern circadian timing

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.070
were designed to be
shifted by a couple hours,

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.280
not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.830
So you can really mess yourself up.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.740
I've had that experience,

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.400
I usually experience it
as fluctuations in mood.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.150
I flew 12 hours out of phase,

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.100
to Abu Dhabi once, to give
a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.970
and it was a mess.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.833
I actually was getting vertigo.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.740
I wasn't hallucinating but
I was really out of it.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.390
And my mood was just all over the place.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.100
And it was very bizarre.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.670
Jet lag, even if you don't experience it

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.120
as mood shifts or amnesia,
it can shorten your life.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.190
Now here's what's interesting.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.890
Traveling westward on the globe

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.890
is always easier than
traveling eastward, okay?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.930
It's interesting because

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.230
the effects of jet lag on longevity,

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.080
have shown that traveling east

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.743
takes more years off your
life than traveling west.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.700
Now, of course, traveling 30
minutes into a new time zone

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:30.410
or just one time zone over,
or two times zone over rather,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.270
is far less detrimental to
your biology and psychology

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.640
than a eight hour shift
or a nine hour shift.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.313
Now, here's what's interesting.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.050
When we think about the
effects of jet lag on longevity

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.253
or this idea that it
can shorten our lives,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.100
we have to ask ourselves why, why is that?

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.680
And it turns out there's a pretty simple

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.830
explanation for this.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.020
We've talked before about
the autonomic nervous system,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.240
this set of neurons in our
spinal cord and body and brain

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.690
that regulate our wakefulness
and our sleepiness.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.470
Turns out that human beings,
and probably most species,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.110
are better able to activate and stay alert

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.120
than they are to shut
down their nervous system

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.500
and go to sleep on demand.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.620
So if you really have to push,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.340
and you really have to
stay awake, you can do it,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.050
you can stay up later.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.760
But falling asleep earlier is harder.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.340
And that's why traveling east

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.550
has a number of different
features associated with it,

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.690
that because you're traveling east

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.440
you're trying to go to
bed earlier, you know.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.360
As a Californian, if
I go to New York city,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.940
I've got to get to bed three hours early

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.160
and wake up three hours early,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.580
much harder than coming back to California

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.490
and just staying up a few more hours.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:48.210
And this probably has roots in

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.300
evolutionary adaptation where

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.870
under conditions where we need
to suddenly gather up and go

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.270
or forge for food, or fight,

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.640
or do any number of different things,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.850
that we can push ourselves

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.580
through the release of
adrenaline and epinephrin

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.480
to stay awake.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.700
Whereas being able to slow down
and deliberately fall asleep

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.690
is actually much harder to do.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.890
So there's an asymmetry to
our autonomic nervous system

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.303
that plays out in the
asymmetry of jet lag.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.410
So, if you want to read up on this,

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.350
because people have asked me
about papers, you can look,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.970
there's a paper published
by Davidson and colleagues,

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.480
2006, in Current Biology that talks about

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.850
the differences in life span

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.960
for frequent eastward versus westward,

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.120
versus no travel and longevity and etc.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.500
A number of different
biological markers of longevity.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.880
So going east is harder

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.740
because going to sleep earlier is harder,

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.200
if you're trying to do that on demand.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.700
Many people have turned to melatonin

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.150
as a way to try and induce sleepiness.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.190
I'm going to talk about
melatonin at the end.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.010
I've mentioned on previous podcasts,

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.040
a number of you have
asked for the evidence

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.930
that melatonin is potentially detrimental

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.660
to some hormone systems,
melatonin is a hormone.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.560
And I'll discuss that at the end,

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.140
in particular, the role of melatonin

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.250
in suppressing a hormone pathway

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.120
that involves luteinizing hormone

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.680
testosterone in men and
estrogen in females.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.554
As well as a really
interesting peptide called

00:26:13.554 --> 00:26:15.720
kisspeptin, that's a cool name.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.070
All right, well, let's think
about travel and what happens.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.640
Let's say you're not
going eastward or westward

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.740
but you're going north or south.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.230
So if you go from for instance,

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.713
Washington DC to Santiago Chile,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.680
or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel,
to Cape town, South Africa,

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.030
you're just north and south, right?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.400
And not either direction.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.830
You're not really moving
into a different time zone,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.820
you're not shifting.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.060
So you will experience travel fatigue.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.960
And turns out that jet
lag has two elements,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.980
travel fatigue and time zone jet lag.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.690
Time zone jet lag is simply

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.190
the inability of local
sunlight and local darkness

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.670
to match to your internal rhythm,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.520
this endogenous rhythm that you have.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.330
So before we get too complicated

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.820
and too down in the weeds about this,

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.130
I want to just throw out
a couple important things.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.810
First of all, I mentioned this earlier,

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.010
but some people suffer from jet lag a lot,

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.050
other people not so much.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.290
Most people experience worse
jet lag as they get older.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.930
There are reasons for that
because early in life,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.520
patterns of melatonin release

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.440
are very stable and flat and
very high actually in children.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.000
It's one of the reasons why
they don't undergo puberty.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.680
Then it becomes cyclical during puberty,

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.600
meaning it comes on once every 24 hours

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.230
and turns off once every 24
hours, it cycles, cyclic.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.540
And then as we get older,
the cycles get more disrupted

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.210
and we become more vulnerable

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:53.650
to even small changes in
schedule, etc, meal times, right?

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:57.483
So, jet lag gets worse as we age.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.480
In addition, there are other
things that happen with age

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.810
that people start doing less exercise,

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.310
their digestion can get worse, etc.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.010
So some of the effects of age

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.800
might not be direct
effects of getting older

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.320
but some of the things that are
correlated with being older.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.770
Like people who are willing

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.370
to have a regular exercise regime

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.490
can use that exercise regime
to shift their circadian clock.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.410
And I have a good friend,
his father is in his 80s.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.410
He's still pushing out 25,
30 push-ups each morning,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.640
he's on the Peloton or whatever it is,

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.473
doing a lot of cycling.

00:28:32.473 --> 00:28:35.330
So some 80-year olds are
doing that, many are not,

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.280
many 30 year olds are not.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.380
But if you have a
regular exercise program,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.800
that's going to make it easier

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.940
to shift your circadian clock
for the sake of jet lag.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.820
And it's actually a knob you can turn

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.260
and you can leverage
for shifting your clock.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.390
Before we go any further,

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:57.390
I want to make changing your
internal rhythm really easy.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.030
Or at least as easy

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.143
and as simple as one could
possibly make it, I believe.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.370
What I want to talk about

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.030
is perhaps one of the most
important things to know

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.560
about your body and brain,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.930
which is called your
temperature minimum, okay?

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.900
Most of you know your approximate weight,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.180
some of you might even
know your blood pressure,

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.570
some of you might even
know your body mass index,

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.670
some of you might know other
things about your biology

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.380
that have fancy names,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.963
but everyone should know
their temperature minimum.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.630
Your temperature minimum

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.550
doesn't require a thermometer to measure,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.420
although you could measure it.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.940
Your temperature minimum is the
point in every 24 hour cycle

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.540
when your temperature is lowest.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.000
Now, how do you measure
that without a thermometer?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.380
It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.040
before your average waking time.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.930
So I want to repeat that,
your temperature minimum

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.770
tends to fall 90 minutes
to two hours before

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.063
your average waking time.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.350
So let's say you're not traveling

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.980
and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.950
Your temperature minimum is
very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.760
If you want, if any of you want to,

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.300
you can measure your temperature minimum.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.210
You can get a thermometer

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.960
and you can measure your
temperature every couple hours

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.750
for 24 hours, and you can
find your temperature minimum.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.110
What you're going to find is that

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.260
you have a low point,
the temperature minimum,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.930
and then your temperature
will start to rise,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.700
you'll wake up about two hours later.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.530
Then your temperature
will continue to rise

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.390
into the afternoon it will peak,

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:28.830
maybe a little trough,
sometimes that happens,

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:33.220
and then it'll start declining slowly

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.520
as you approach nighttime.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.320
There are things that will
disrupt that temperature pattern.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.890
Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.820
Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.030
that increases temperature
slightly little blips,

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.340
but the overall cycle 24
hour cycle of temperature

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.060
has this pattern.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.320
And last time I talked
about the seminal work

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.660
of Joe Takahashi and others,
who have shown that temperature

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.740
actually is the signal by which

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.890
this clock above the roof of your mouth

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.360
in-trains or collectively

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.840
pushes all the cells
and tissues of our body

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.750
to be on the same schedule.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.590
Temperature is the effector.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.630
And once you hear that there
should be an immediate,

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.880
oh, of course, because
how else would you get

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.270
all these different diverse cell types

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.030
to follow one pattern, right?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.230
A pancreatic cell does
something very different

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.970
than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.350
They're all doing different
things at different rates.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.880
So the temperature signal can go out

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.720
and then each one of those

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.100
can interpret the temperature signal

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.840
as one unified and consistent
theme of their environment.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.400
So temperatures vary
from person to person.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.510
Some people are 98.6, some
people run a little colder, etc.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.810
But you have a low point,
and you have a high point.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.160
Know your temperature minimum.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.780
How are you going to figure
out this temperature minimum?

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.320
The temperature minimum can be determined

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.660
by taking the last three
to five wake up times.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.410
So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM,

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.713
8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.450
Take those, add them
together, average them

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.050
by adding them up and dividing
by the number of days,

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.040
that'll give you the average.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.020
If you're one of these people
that wakes up at 3:00 AM

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.940
and then goes back to
sleep and sleep till 10,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.230
your wake up time was 10:00 AM.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.720
If you use an alarm clock,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.203
your wake-up time is still
when you get up, okay?

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.970
I know alarm clocks have
been kind of demonized

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.340
but in my world

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.770
being late and missing
appointments is also demonized,

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:33.743
so I use an alarm clock.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.600
Many people will wake up at
exactly the same time each day,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.130
there tends to some variation for people.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.840
Some people it's going to vary
depending on life circumstances.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.363
But average that for
three to seven days or so.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.370
Take that wake up time,
you can then get an average

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.620
or sort of typical temperature minimum.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.790
Okay, so now you know how to
get your temperature minimum.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:00.790
Your temperature minimum is
your absolute reference point

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.750
for shifting your circadian clock.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.430
Whether or not it's for
jet lag, or shift work,

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.030
or some other purpose.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:07.993
Here's the deal.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.970
If you expose your eyes to bright light

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.350
in the four hours, maybe five or six,

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.313
but in the four hours after
your temperature minimum,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.430
your circadian clock

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.920
will shift so that you
will tend to get up earlier

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.930
and go to sleep earlier in
the subsequent days, okay?

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.010
So it's called a phase advance,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.940
if you'd like to read up on this further.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.040
You advance your clock, okay?

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.660
However, if you view bright light

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.973
in the four to six hours before
your temperature minimum,

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.050
you will tend to phase delay your clock.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:54.400
You will tend to wake up
later and go to sleep later.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.320
Okay, I'm going to repeat this

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.910
because there's so much
confusion out there

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.880
and people talk about
circadian time and all this.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.240
Find your temperature minimum.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.910
I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM,

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.670
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.780
It depends a lot on what I
was doing the night before

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.250
as I'm guessing it does for you.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.220
But that means that my temperature minimum

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.220
is probably somewhere
right around 4:30 AM.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.700
Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.953
and I were to view
bright light at 4:35 AM,

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.440
I'm going to advance my clock.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.150
I'm going to want to go to bed
earlier the subsequent night

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.300
and wake up earlier
the subsequent morning.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.950
And as I shift my wake-up time,

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.040
my temperature minimum shifts too, right?

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.260
Because each time we
shift our wake-up time

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.960
our temperature minimum shifts,

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.400
assuming that wake up time

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.913
shifts more than 30
minutes or an hour, okay.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.920
If I were to view bright light

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.110
in the four to six hours
before 4:30 AM, guess what?

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.460
The next night I'm going
to want to stay up later

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.543
and I'm going to want to wake
up later the subsequent morning.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.840
Your temperature minimum
is a reference point

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.980
not a temperature reading.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.560
Again, if you want to measure
your temperature minimum

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.640
and figure out what it is,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.720
98 point whatever or 96
point whatever, that's fine.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.553
You can do that.

00:35:11.553 --> 00:35:12.630
But that information won't help you.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.990
What you need to know is what time

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.280
your body temperature is lowest

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.920
and understand that in
the four hours or so

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.320
just after that time,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.810
viewing light will advance your clock

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.510
to make you want to get up earlier.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.100
And the four hours before
your temperature minimum,

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.520
viewing light will make
you want to stay up later.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.620
Now, some people might be saying,

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.870
well, I wake up early and
I want to stay up late

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.610
and I'm sleepy all day and
I'm a mess or I feel fine.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.970
Look, let's talk about feeling fine.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.860
Turns out the definition of insomnia

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.640
is when you're experiencing

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.880
excessive sleepiness during the day.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.730
Sleepiness and fatigue
are different, okay?

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.470
So in the world of sleep medicine

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.090
fatigue is a physical exhaustion,

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.690
sleepiness is falling asleep.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.670
Like falling asleep at your desk

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.050
or falling asleep during lectures,

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.500
or there seems to be something
special about my lectures

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.610
that makes people want to fall asleep.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.480
So if this cures your insomnia fantastic,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.203
however, in all seriousness,

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.180
sleepiness during the day time

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.320
unless it's around your temperature peak

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.890
and only lasts about 90 minutes or so,

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.140
is a sign of insomnia.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.663
It's a sign of lack of sleep.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.710
I want to be very, very clear that

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.640
if you know your temperature minimum,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.160
you can shift your clock using light.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.390
You can also shift your
clock by engaging in exercise

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.360
in the four hours after
your temperature minimum

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.160
to wake up earlier on subsequent nights,

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.440
or exercise before then
to delay your clock, okay?

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.900
So now you can start to see and understand

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.400
the logic of the system.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.080
And we'll talk about why this works

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.290
and the underlying biology,

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:58.180
but understanding that
temperature is the effector

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.790
and understanding that
you have this low point

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.160
that reflects your most sleepy point,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.420
essentially right before waking up,

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.570
and then temperature rises,

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.510
you can now start to
shift that temperature

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.290
according to your travel needs.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:14.730
Here's one way in which you might do that.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.840
Let's say I am going to travel to Europe,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.973
which is nine hours ahead
typically, from California.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.530
I would want to determine
my temperature minimum

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.630
which for me is about
4:30 AM maybe 5:00 AM,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.980
and I would want to start getting up

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:35.980
at about 5:30 AM and getting
some bright light exposure,

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.640
presumably from artificial sources

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.260
because the sunlight isn't
going to be out at that time.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.680
Maybe even exercising as well,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.240
maybe even eating a meal at that time

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.083
if that's in your practice.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.770
You would want to start doing that

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.503
two or three days before travel.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.053
Because, once you land
in or I land in Europe,

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.680
chances are just viewing the
sunrise or sunset in Europe

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.460
is not going to allow me to
shift my circadian clock.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.610
Some people say get sunlight
in your eyes when you land

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.790
but that's not going to work

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:13.070
because one of two things
is likely to happen.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.470
With a nine hour shift like that

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.390
either I'm going to view sunlight

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.100
at a time that corresponds
to the circadian dead zone,

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.530
the time in which my circadian
clock can't be shifted,

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.980
or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.690
at a time that corresponds to
the four to six hour window

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.700
before my temperature minimum.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.800
So it's going to shift me in
exactly the opposite direction

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.210
that I want to go.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.870
So it can be very, very challenging

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:41.980
for people to adjust to jet lag.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.280
So you need to ask, am I traveling east

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.140
or am I traveling west?

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.990
Am I trying to advance my
clock or delay my clock?

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:51.820
Remember viewing light,
exercise and eating

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.130
in the four to six hours
before your temperature minimum

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.150
will delay your clock.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.290
Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.320
you don't have to do all three

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.080
but some combination of those

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.700
in the four to six hours
after your temperature minimum

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.090
will advance your clock.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.710
And this is a powerful mechanism

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.710
by which you can shift your clock anywhere

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.180
from one to three hours per
day, which is remarkable.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.250
That means your temperature
minimum is going to shift out

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:19.510
as much as three hours, which
can make it such that you can

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.840
travel all the way to Europe

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.970
and in as long as you've
prepared for a day or so

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:27.850
by doing what I described back home

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:30.210
and then doing it when you arrive,

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.020
you can potentially accomplish
the entire shift within

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.363
anywhere from 24 to 36 hours.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:40.120
And this is really important to emphasize

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.640
that once you arrive in your new location

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.070
and here I'm talking
about traveling eastward,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.393
California to Europe, once you
arrive in your new location,

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.070
you have to keep track

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.310
of what your temperature
minimum was back home

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.510
and how it's being
shifted during your trip.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.730
Now it's much easier to do than you think.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.000
One of the unfortunate consequences

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.040
of the smartphone is that

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.450
you can't do something goofy
like wearing two watches.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.460
One watch that corresponds
to the time back home

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.120
and another one that
corresponds to the local time.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.120
Typically it updates
automatically based on wifi, etc.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.320
But if you can keep track
of the time back home

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.560
then you can easily shift
your clock going forward.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.170
I'm hoping this will makes sense.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.100
I really want to emphasize

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.640
that you don't have to be
precise down to the minute.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.330
Some of you may be asking, well,

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.410
what about you've got
this temperature minimum

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.500
and if I view light one minute before it

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.660
then I'm going to delay my
clock and one minute after it

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.640
I'm going to advance my clock.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.220
It doesn't quite work like that, okay.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.790
But it's very important to understand

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.160
that light is the primary way

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.390
in which we can shift our clock.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.150
And now you should also
be able to understand

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.560
things like the circadian
dead zone from about

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.150
9:30, 10:00 AM all the way until

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.810
six hours before your temperature minimum.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.290
You're not going to shift your clock.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.570
Nothing that you do in that time

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.770
in terms of light viewing
behavior, feeding, etc,

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.200
is going to shift your clock.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.320
And so a lot of people
are landing in Europe

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.270
getting sunlight in their eyes

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.860
and throwing their clock out of whack

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.150
or not shifting their clock at all.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:18.410
This brings me to the other
thing that's highly recommended.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.440
And I've mentioned this before,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.810
but you want to eat on
the local meal schedule.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.260
If it's in your practice
to fast, fast, that's fine.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.300
But when you eat, you want to eat

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.600
within the local schedule for alertness.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.433
Okay.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.960
That means if you arrive and
everyone's eating breakfast

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.290
and you can't stomach
the idea of breakfast

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.150
in your new location 'cause
your appetite isn't there.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.670
That means the clock in your liver,

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.520
you have a clock in your
liver, biological clock,

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.743
has not caught up to the new time zone.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.260
You can force yourself to eat if you like,

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.240
or you can skip that meal.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.780
But what you don't want to do

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.490
is stay on your home meal schedule,

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.880
waking up in the middle
of the night and eating.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.450
That is really going to throw things off

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.640
because a lot of the
clocks in the periphery

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.680
like from the liver, the peripheral body,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.160
will send information back to the brain

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.420
and then the brain is getting
really conflicted signals.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.300
So the temperature minimum
is really your anchor point

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.220
for shifting your clock best.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.100
I don't know why this
information really hasn't made it

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.190
into the popular sphere, quite so much.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.600
There's all sorts of stuff about

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.830
taking things like melatonin,
using binaural beats,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:28.280
a lot of kind of like more
sophisticated, complicated,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.850
and potentially problematic

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.670
ways of trying to shift the clock.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.920
Let's talk about melatonin
but first I just want to pause

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.960
and shift gears a little bit

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.640
because I talked about traveling eastward,

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.020
but we haven't talked
about traveling westward.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.420
So I want to do that now.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.700
Let's say you're raveling
from New York to California

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.840
or from Europe to California.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.270
The challenge there tends to be,

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.260
how can you stay up late enough?

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.310
Now, some people are able to do this

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.720
because as I mentioned earlier,

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.840
the autonomic nervous system
is asymmetrically wired

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.060
such that it's easier to stay up late

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.250
later than we would naturally want to

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.730
than it is to go to sleep earlier.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.860
So let's say you land and it's 4:00 PM

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.360
and you're just dying,
you're in California,

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.670
you came from Europe, it's 4:00 PM

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.570
and you really, really
want to go to sleep.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:19.980
That's where the use of things
like caffeine, exercise,

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.450
and sunlight can shift you, right?

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.770
If it's after your temperature peak

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.700
then viewing sunlight
around 6:00 PM or 8:00 PM

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.200
or artificial light, if
there isn't sunlight,

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.540
will help shift you later, right?

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.222
It's going to delay your clock

00:43:35.222 --> 00:43:37.293
and you're going to be
able to stay up later.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.180
The worst thing you can do is take a nap

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.150
that was intended to last
20 minutes or an hour.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:46.130
I do this routinely and then
wake up four hours later

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.320
or you wake up and it's midnight

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.500
and you can't fall back asleep.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.090
You really want to avoid doing that.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.130
So provided it's not excessive amounts,

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.760
stimulants like caffeine and coffee or tea

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.960
can really help you push
past that afternoon barrier

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.070
and get you to sleep more
like on the local schedule.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.963
And eating on the local schedule as well.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.130
A number of people have asked about

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.930
the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.780
All right, well let's think
about what melatonin is.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.020
Melatonin is this hormone

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.310
that's released from the pineal
gland, which is this gland.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.090
A couple of notes about the pineal,

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.160
'cause I've been getting a
lot of questions about this.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.690
I'm probably going to
draw some fire for this

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:31.690
but I'd be happy to have a
thoughtful, considerate debate,

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.820
with some peer reviewed
papers in front of us.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.910
The pineal does make this
hallucinogenic molecule

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:39.710
they call DMT,

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.720
but in such a minuscule amounts
that it is not responsible

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.240
for the hallucinations you
see in sleep and dreaming.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.140
Sorry, folks.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.170
It's also not responsible

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.880
for the hallucinations you might see

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.140
through other approaches to DMT.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.710
It's just not, that's not
where the DMT comes from.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:56.463
It's infinitesimally small amounts.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.970
There are a lot of kind
of wacky claims out there

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.430
about calcification of
the pineal and fluoride

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:04.580
and this kind of thing.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.680
Look, the pineal sits
in an area of the brain

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.290
near the fourth ventricle,

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:16.320
where the skull is not terribly far away

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.660
although there's some
overlap in neural tissue

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.210
and with age there's some aggregation

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.020
of some of the meninges and
other things around there

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.320
that stick to the skull.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.900
Young brains don't look like old brains

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.930
but there's no calcification
of the pineal, all right?

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.550
So you can forget about
calcification of the pineal

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.210
as a problem.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.970
I don't know where that
whole thing got started

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.020
but that's not an issue.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:43.260
Your pineal will churn out
melatonin your whole life.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.700
Melatonin induces sleepiness.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.670
Melatonin during development
is also responsible

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.340
for timing the secretion
of certain hormones

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:55.273
that are vitally important for puberty.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.940
Does melatonin control
the onset of puberty?

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.540
Not directly, but indirectly.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.670
Melatonin inhibits something called

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.210
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.380
which is a hormone that's
released from your hypothalamus

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.150
also roughly above the roof
of your mouth in your brain.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:11.990
Gonadotropin-releasing
hormone is really interesting

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.370
'cause it stimulates the
release of another hormone

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.850
called luteinizing hormone,
which in females causes

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.570
estrogen to be released
within the ovaries,

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.290
it's involved in reproductive cycles,

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.380
and in males stimulates testosterone

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.443
from the sertoli cells of the testes.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.640
Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH,

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.930
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.640
and therefore is inhibitory
to LH, luteinizing hormone,

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.610
and therefore is inhibitory
to testosterone and estrogen.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.310
There's just no two ways about it.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.500
There is immense amount
of data on the fact that

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.400
high levels of melatonin in
seasonally breeding animals,

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.040
takes the ovaries from
nice and robust ovaries

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.170
that are capable of deploying
eggs and this kind of thing

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:02.060
and literally shrinking them

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.400
and making these animals infertile.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.810
These are very high levels of melatonin

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.403
in seasonal breeders in winter.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.570
Melatonin in males of seasonal breeders

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.930
takes the testes and shrinks them.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.760
Long ago when I was at UC,
Berkeley as a master's student,

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.880
I was working on neuroendocrinology,

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.630
and we were working on

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.530
this hamster species of seasonal breeders.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:27.520
And basically when days are
long, which inhibits melatonin,

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.870
these little Siberian
hamsters as they're called,

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:34.780
have testes about the size of,
sort of typical table grapes,

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.680
although that's a weird way to put it.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.040
When days get shorter and the
melatonin signal gets longer

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.400
because light inhibits melatonin,

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.970
days get shorter, melatonin gets longer.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.710
Those same hamsters would have testes

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.480
that would involute to the
size of about a grain of rice.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.820
Now this does not happen
in humans in short days.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.230
But nonetheless, the melatonin
signal really does have

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.130
a ton of effects on the hormone system.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.150
Now, does that mean that if
you've been taking melatonin

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.260
you've really screwed up your hormones?

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.093
Not necessarily.

00:48:04.093 --> 00:48:05.810
Does it mean if a kid
has been taking melatonin

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.370
that's really screwing up their puberty?

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.143
Not necessarily and here's why.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:15.620
Melatonin operates on
a concentration level.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.600
So in a child that's very, very small

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.250
that has high levels of melatonin,

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.388
it actually can inhibit GnRH, LH,

00:48:24.388 --> 00:48:28.000
testosterone or estrogen
depending on the sex of the child.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.350
But as that child grows
through other mechanisms,

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.100
like growth hormone release, etc,

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.450
that same amount of melatonin
released from the pineal

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.730
is now diluted over a much larger body

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:40.850
so that the concentration
actually goes way, way down, okay?

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.240
But here's the problem with
supplementing melatonin.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.260
As I mentioned in the previous episode,

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.320
concentrations of melatonin
in many commercial supplements

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.460
have been shown to be
anywhere from 85% to 400%

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.520
of what's listed on the bottle.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.330
So when you take melatonin
or a child takes melatonin

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.500
oftentimes they are
taking super physiological

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.870
levels of melatonin,

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:06.540
which at least by my
read, and the literature,

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.820
says that it could have dramatic effects

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:12.680
on timing and course
of things like puberty.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.190
So it's not so much that the
journals have come out saying,

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.550
oh, taking that melatonin
inhibits puberty,

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:21.320
it's that no single study has been done

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.820
with the super physiological
levels of melatonin

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.150
that are present in a
lot of these supplements

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:29.100
in developing children.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:33.760
So melatonin is used widely
for inducing sleepiness

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.900
when you want to fall asleep

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.390
in the new location that
you've arrived, right?

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.940
You can't fall asleep, you take melatonin,

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.530
it helps you fall asleep.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.950
It does not help you stay asleep.

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:46.810
In addition to that, melatonin
has been kind of touted

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.510
as the best way to shift
your circadian clock.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.300
I'm happy to go on record saying,

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.440
look, if you need melatonin,
you can work with a doctor

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.600
or somebody who really understands

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.980
circadian and sleep biology go
for it, if that's your thing.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.730
But I, as always on this
podcast and elsewhere,

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.710
I have a bias toward behavioral things

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.010
that you can titrate and control

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.910
like exposure to light
exercise, temperature, etc,

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.710
that have much bigger margins for safety

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:14.730
and certainly don't have
these other endocrine effects

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.420
that we've been thinking
about and talking about.

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.730
So if you want to take
melatonin in the afternoon

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.840
in order to fall asleep or in the evening,

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.890
be my guest, that's up to you.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.750
Again, you're responsible
for your health, not me.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.670
But for many people

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.310
melatonin is not going
to be the best solution.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.760
The best solution is going to be to use

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.960
light and temperature, and exercise

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.220
on either side of the temperature minimum

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.090
to shift your clock both before your trip

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.810
and when you land in your new location

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.690
and your clock starts to shift.

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:47.840
Okay, so now you know my
opinions about melatonin,

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.950
feel free to filter them through

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:53.360
your own opinions and
experiences with melatonin.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.320
And now you also understand

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.940
what your temperature minimum is

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.610
and how it represents
an important landmark

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.070
either side of which you can use

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:05.530
light, temperature, and
exercise to shift your clock.

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.140
Just to remind you a little
bit about temperature,

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.890
if you want to shift your clock,

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.160
typically you would do that
by you can take a hot shower

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.230
and then that will have a cooling effect

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.593
after the hot shower.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.140
And if you were to get into a cold shower

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.270
or an ice bath if you have access to one,

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.560
afterward there's going
to be a thermogenic effect

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.750
of your body increasing temperature.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:30.090
And if you just think about
your natural rhythm back home

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.343
when everything's stable,

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.870
you have an idea a low point

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:36.660
in which is your temperature minimum,

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.010
and then you have a peak,

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.810
and you think about when you're doing this

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:42.610
hot or cold shower in that rhythm,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.040
now you should be able to understand

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.740
how you're shifting your rhythm.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.090
That temperature rhythm is
the one that's going to move.

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.480
Give you an example.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.780
If I were to wake up in the morning

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.490
and let's say I wake up at 6:00 AM.

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:55.990
My temperature I know is rising,

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.660
I've passed my temperature minimum.

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.283
If I were to get into a hot shower,

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.460
that would then lower my body
temperature when I got out,

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.440
that is not normally what's happening

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.190
first thing in the morning, and therefore

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.500
my clock would very likely
get phase delayed, right?

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.180
It's going to delay the
increase in temperature.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.400
Whereas if I got into a cold shower,

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.680
something I don't personally like to do,

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.610
but I've done from time
to time or an ice bath

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:22.480
that's going to then

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.900
have a rebound increase
in body temperature

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.730
and is going to phase advance my clock.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.920
That peak in the
afternoon is going to come

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.400
about an hour earlier.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.030
I'm going to want to go to
bed earlier, later that night.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.340
So you can start to play these games

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.450
with timing and hot and cold,

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.970
with meals whether or not
you eat, or you don't eat,

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:40.180
and with light exposure,

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.660
whether or not you view light
or you don't view light.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:44.630
So now you can start to
see why understanding

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.700
the core mechanics of a system

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.100
can really give you the
most flexibility because

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.230
I could spend the next 25 years of my life

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.410
answering every question about every

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:56.770
nuance pattern of travel.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.740
Well, we're going to Sydney
and then we're going there,

00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.650
what should I do?

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:00.810
But that's on you.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.020
You need to figure out

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.920
your temperature minimum
and your temperature peak,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.200
if you like, and then
use these parameters to

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.460
it gives you flexibility.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.490
And that really underscores
the most important thing

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.490
is that when you understand
mechanism it's not about

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.700
being neurotically attached
to a specific protocol,

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.830
it's the opposite.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.650
It gives you power to not
be neurotically attached

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:20.030
to a specific protocol.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.700
It can give you great
confidence and flexibility

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.770
in being able to shift your
body rhythms however you want.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:25.750
And when things get out of whack

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:27.750
you can tuck them right back into place.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.710
One thing that's common

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:32.680
is that people need to do a quick trip.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.460
It's not always that
you're going to go to,

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.810
you know on vacation for two weeks or,

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.113
you know, work someplace
else for weeks on end.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:44.690
If your trip is 48 hours or less,

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:46.610
stay on your home schedule.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:50.130
This can be tough and it may
require scheduling meetings

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.260
according to your home schedule,

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.470
but if you can somehow manage that

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.050
the best thing to do would be
to stay on your home schedule.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.500
Your clock is not going to
shift more than a couple hours,

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.340
even if you do everything correctly

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:06.100
in one day, okay?

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.230
So if I were to travel, say to Europe,

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.110
I've actually done this,

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.310
I did a 24 hour trip
to Basel, Switzerland,

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:15.590
gave a talk and came back,
people thought I was crazy but,

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:16.870
I had a little bit of travel fatigue

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:17.850
'cause remember there's fatigue

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:19.840
from the actual travel experience.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.710
The novelty of it, the air
is never great on the planes,

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:25.920
this was even true before
there were mask requirements

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.130
and things like that.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.280
There's the travel fatigue

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.720
but you don't throw your clock off.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.180
If you stay 48 hours,

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.480
then you start to shift a little bit.

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.890
72, that's when you start
running into trouble.

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.210
The transit time is also important

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.610
but I would say if it's
three days or less,

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.850
stay on your home schedule
as much as you can.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:49.970
And because sunlight
isn't under your control

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.000
unless there's something
about you I don't know,

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.620
that's when traveling with
some sort of bright light

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.550
like the light pad that I have

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.750
down there that I showed earlier,

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.120
for those of you listening just on audio,

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.360
it sort of looks like an eight
and a half by 11 inch pad.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.870
It's actually not designed for wake up,

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.020
it's actually designed,
it's a drawing pad,

00:55:07.942 --> 00:55:12.180
and it emits about 1,000 lux of light.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.120
And so if you want to travel
with something like that,

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.850
you can use that in your hotel room

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:19.300
to wake up when you like.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.230
Some people will use night shades,

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.670
you know, not the night
shades that you eat

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.129
or that some people say
you're not supposed to eat,

00:55:26.129 --> 00:55:27.110
I don't know anything about that,

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:32.110
but the eye covers to keep light out.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.530
Those can be very useful on
planes and in hotels and so on.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:38.650
So you can use light and dark

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:42.340
or you can travel with
your light and dark devices

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.270
so that you can stay on your home schedule

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:45.300
and get most of your light

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.730
when it would be your normal
wake up time back home.

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:50.783
And what's kind of nice is if you know

00:55:50.783 --> 00:55:53.380
when your circadian
dead zone is back home,

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.880
which is generally for most people around

00:55:56.948 --> 00:55:59.660
10:00 AM to about 3:00 PM,

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:02.950
so basically the rising
phase of your temperature,

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:06.670
then you can also feel free to be outside

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:08.020
without having to wear sunglasses

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.910
or you don't have to worry
about light exposure.

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:14.520
But if you know that window
before your temperature minimum,

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.950
that four to six hour window,

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:17.990
that's the time when if
you're viewing a lot of light

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.510
in your new location,

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.980
you are going to shift your
clock pretty considerably

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.710
and then you can come back
home and have a terrible time.

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:27.760
At the end of graduate
school, I went to Australia,

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.880
remarkable country, incredible
people, incredible wildlife,

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.400
had amazing time, I came back

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.240
and it was the first time in my life

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.540
where I couldn't sleep
on a regular schedule.

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.580
I was sleeping in like

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.910
hour long increments throughout
the day, it was a nightmare.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:44.490
And it took me weeks
to get back on target.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:46.170
And the way I was able to do that

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:50.620
was exercising consistently at
the same time every 24 hours,

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:54.810
turning my home into
essentially a cave at night,

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:56.440
even covering up the windows

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.530
and then getting as much
bright light in my eyes

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:01.980
as I possibly could during
the day, no sunglasses, etc.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.230
So it can take some real work

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.560
if your clock gets thrown out of whack.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.630
There's a phenomenon called ICU psychosis,

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.080
where people that are in

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.780
the intensive care unit in hospitals

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.470
actually lose their mind.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:18.033
They become psychotic,
hallucinations, etc.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.280
And it's because of
altered circadian cycles.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.757
We know this 'cause they're
exposed to these lights

00:57:23.757 --> 00:57:26.050
and these sounds, people
coming in and checking on them.

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:28.220
They leave the hospital or in some cases,

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.520
there have been experiments
where people are placed

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.580
near a window where they
get some natural light

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.810
and the psychotic symptoms disappear,

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:37.250
presuming there weren't
psychotic symptoms beforehand,

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.810
before they entered the hospital.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:42.830
So it's pretty dramatic what light can do

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:44.890
to the psyche and to the body.

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.490
So let's talk a little bit

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:49.180
about a different form of jet lag

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.970
that requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.463
and that's shift work.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.223
Shift work is becoming
increasingly common.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.090
Many of us are shift working
even though we don't have to.

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:03.950
We're doing work in the
middle of the night,

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:08.240
we are, you know, working on
our computers at odd hours,

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.290
sleeping during the day.

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:13.520
A lot of people who are under
shelter and place type stuff,

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.180
are doing more of this.

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.090
Kids with the drifting school schedules.

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:19.800
Here's the deal with shift work.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.700
If there's one rule of
thumb for shift work,

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.053
it's that if at all possible,

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.860
you want to stay on the same
schedule for at least 14 days,

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.690
including weekends.

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:34.950
Now that should immediately
cue the non shift workers

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.670
to the importance of not
getting too far off track

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:39.390
on the weekend, even if
you're not a shift worker.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:43.033
So sleeping in on Sunday
is not a good idea.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.470
The most important thing about shift work

00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:49.170
is to stay consistent with your schedule.

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:52.100
Now, I had a conversation
on an Instagram live

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.010
with Samer Hattar, who's a neuroscientist

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.670
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:59.690
he's actually the head of
the chronobiology unit there.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:03.620
And he was really emphasizing
this point because shift work

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.380
where people are doing
the so-called swing shift,

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.040
where they're working
four days on one shift

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.650
and four days on or another,

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:11.590
is extremely detrimental to a
number of health parameters.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:14.930
It gets the cortisol
release from the adrenals

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.280
really out of whack.

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.880
And there're these cortisol spikes at

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.570
various hours of the day,
it messes up learning,

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:24.690
it really disrupts the
dopamine system and wellbeing.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:26.580
It is a serious, serious problem.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.640
So if you can negotiate with your employer

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:34.230
to stay on the same shift
for two weeks at a time,

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:35.860
that's going to be immensely beneficial

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.800
and will help you offset

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.000
a lot of the negative
effects of shift work.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.320
Now, I don't presume that

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.290
all of you are going
to be able to do that.

00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:46.440
Some of you just don't
have that level of control.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.990
And of course, I want to acknowledge that

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:51.550
shift workers are essential, right?

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.490
Of course, first responders, firefighters,

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:55.750
police officers, paramedics, etc,

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:58.700
but also pilots, night nurses,

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:02.610
people working on the hospital wards,

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.170
people picking up trash.

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:06.140
These night shifts are critical

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.930
to our functioning as a society,

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.913
as I'm sure all of you can appreciate.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.820
If you're going to work a shift where

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.840
let's say, you start at 4:00
PM and you end at 2:00 AM,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.900
excuse me, then there's some
important questions that arise.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.320
For instance, should you
see light during your shift?

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.650
Well, this is a matter of personal choice

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:32.330
but ideally you want to view
as much light as possible

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:35.300
and as is safely possible
when you need to be alert.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.150
So that would mean from 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.223
and then you would want to sleep.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.940
So using light as a correlate of alertness

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.970
and using darkness as a
correlate of sleepiness,

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.520
what this means is see as
much light as you safely can

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.130
during the phase of your day
when you want to be awake.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.040
So it's the same thing I said

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.560
way back at the beginning
of this podcast episode.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.830
And see as little light as safely possible

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.000
and it allows you to
function during the time

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.360
when you want to be asleep.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.900
So if you're finishing
out that 2:00 AM shift,

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.800
that's when you would want to
avoid bright light exposure,

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.900
you'd want to go home,

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.650
you'd really want to avoid
watching TV if possible.

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.240
If you need that in order to fall asleep,

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.760
that would be a case where

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.640
something like dimming the
screen, plus blue blockers,

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.160
if that's in your practice

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.820
or you want to do that would be helpful

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.610
and then going to sleep and
then you'll probably wake up

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.070
late in the afternoon or early afternoon.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.520
Some of you might say, wait,

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.150
Huberman, I thought you
don't like blue blockers.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.470
I never said I don't like blue blockers.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:38.880
I don't like people wearing blue blockers

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.550
at the time of day when
they want to be alert.

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:43.240
And I don't like people
asserting that blue blockers

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.080
can prevent circadian shifts

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.410
simply because people are wearing them.

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.640
The brightness of light
is what's important

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.740
it's not about the blue.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.550
So if you want to wear them, wear them,

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:56.220
or just dim the lights
or turn the lights off.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.180
So let's say you go to sleep at,

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:02.620
you get home after this
4:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.530
you maybe eat something, you go to sleep,

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:10.530
and you wake up and it's noon or 1:00 PM.

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:13.090
Should you get light in your eyes?

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:14.660
Well, your first assumption

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.310
based on what I've said
previously might be

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:17.730
that you're in the circadian dead zone

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.320
that you can't because it's noon 1:00 PM.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.850
But you're not in the circadian dead zone

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:23.900
because you're somebody who goes to sleep

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.340
early in the morning at 2:00 AM.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.780
So it's not like the circadian dead zone

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.060
is a strict time of day, it's
an internal biological clock.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.130
So what do you need to know?

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:39.220
You guessed it, you need to
know your temperature minimum.

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.910
You need to know whether not

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:43.760
your temperature is
increasing or decreasing.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.860
And now we can make this
whole thing even simpler

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.693
and just say,

01:02:46.693 --> 01:02:50.513
if your temperature is
decreasing, avoid light.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.563
If your temperature is
increasing, get light.

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:58.510
It's that simple, okay?

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:01.170
If your temperature is
decreasing, avoid light,

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:03.653
if your temperature is
increasing, get light.

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:09.960
The shift worker who works
from 4:00 PM until 2:00 AM

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.910
has a temperature rhythm
that's very different than mine

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:15.640
where I wake up around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM,

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.760
and I go to sleep around 11:00 PM, okay?

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.610
We both have a 24
hour-ish circadian cycle,

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:26.020
except mine is more aligned to the rise

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.950
and setting of the sun
and there's is not, right?

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.410
So you have to know your
internal temperature rhythm.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.930
And no you don't have to

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.260
walk around with a thermometer wherever,

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.390
taking your temperature.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.223
Although it'd be great

01:03:40.223 --> 01:03:42.010
if some of the devices that are out there,

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:43.470
you know, people are counting their steps,

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.090
I think it'd be great if people had

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:47.010
a circadian body temperature measurement.

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:48.930
I'm not involved in any
of this device development

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:52.100
but I think it's a real
call to arms, pun intended,

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.100
to have a wristband that
would measure temperature

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.540
and would tell you your
temperature minimum

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.620
when you travel or whatnot.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.280
I don't know, maybe some of
these devices already do that.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.530
But if they don't, they should.

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:03.640
It's absolutely absurd to me

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.100
why we wouldn't have
the simple measurement,

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.430
very easy to get that kind of information.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.520
You don't even need the
exact temperature read

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.160
all you need to know is
the high and low point.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.930
So let's say you're a shift worker

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.270
who really is nocturnal, you're flipped.

01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:20.960
Well, you want to stay on
that nocturnal schedule.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.790
Now that can be very hard on families

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:25.040
and social life of all kinds.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.393
But the person who is working say from,

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.013
you know, 8:00 PM, like
sundown to sunrise,

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:34.440
this raises a question.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.220
Should they be looking at the sunrise

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.530
and should they be watching the sunset?

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:43.090
Waking up with a sunset,
going asleep at the sunrise.

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.710
You think, well, is that
light going to throw them off?

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:47.210
Ah, probably not.

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:50.240
It's just actually going to invert
what sunrise and sunset are.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.650
When they're waking up in the morning,

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.420
if they look at the, you know,

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.580
they get some sunlight in their
eyes, they look at the sun

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.560
and get some bright light from devices

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.090
or overhead lights in
their apartment or home,

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:03.040
well, that's going to tend to wake them up

01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:06.270
if it's in the evening, right?

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:08.800
So it's, you know I don't
know if I stated that clearly,

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.390
but if in the evening the sun is setting

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.840
and they're looking at that setting sun,

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.470
that is the morning sun for that person

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:18.550
and it will wake them up
for their night shift.

01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:20.310
So temperature rising.

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.640
Then toward morning, what's happening?

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.450
Okay, well, they're closing
out their work shift.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:27.010
You're going home, the sun is rising.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.480
Do you look at the rising sun?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.310
Well, based on what you now know

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:32.740
your eyes are very sensitive

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.080
to resetting of circadian clocks.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.410
What will it do at that time?

01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.300
If this were a classroom,

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.340
I would either cold call on somebody

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.580
or I'd wait for the oh, oh, oh, oh person

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.947
in the audience that inevitably exists.

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:46.790
So temperature is for that person,

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:48.090
they've been up for a while,

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.340
temperature is falling, not rising.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.420
For me it will be rising.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:56.560
But 'cause I'm diurnal,
I'm awake during the day.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.290
For that person the temperature's falling

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:01.170
and so they view light while
temperature is falling.

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:02.030
What's it going to do?

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:03.423
It's going to phase delay them.

01:06:03.423 --> 01:06:06.290
It's going to make it harder
for them to get to sleep

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.290
the following night.

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:10.550
So you would say that person
should watch the setting sun

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.180
to help them wake up

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.610
'cause they're going to
work the night shift,

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:15.240
but should probably have sunglasses on

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.200
or avoid viewing bright light
before they go to sleep.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.240
So it's the same thing.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.500
They're just on an inverted
as a typical person

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.630
who's diurnal, but they're
on an inverted schedule.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.900
And so I'm really trying hard here

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.160
to make this all really clear.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.650
There are kind of two patterns
of requests in the world

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:38.080
I'm noticing as I've
kind of ventured into the

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.890
this landscape of social
media and podcasts.

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:42.520
There are people who
want to know every detail

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.660
and want to quantify everything

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.060
'cause they want to get exactly right.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.410
These are like the graduate students

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:49.220
and students that don't
want to make a mistake.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.280
And to quote my graduate advisor,

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.650
provided the mistakes are not dangerous,

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:55.853
certainly not lethal,

01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:59.770
you kind of want to make
a few little mistakes

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:01.650
so that you can adjust, right?

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.130
You don't want to endanger yourself.

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:05.990
But it's actually, you're not
going to get things perfect,

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.823
that's called learning.

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:08.957
Learning is when you realize,
ah, I viewed the sun this time

01:07:08.957 --> 01:07:11.210
and then I stayed up and
it really messed me up,

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:12.460
I'll never do that again.

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:18.080
The other category of people seem to want

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.210
the one size fits all kind of like

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.860
give me this pill or
give me this protocol.

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.040
And those things generally work

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.610
but they don't afford people flexibility.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.620
And if there's anything like that,

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.730
it's this temperature minimum
thing that I've been just

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.740
hammering on again and
again and again today

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.870
because it's something that you own

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:38.760
and that you can really use

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.810
as a key landmark for shifting your clock.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:44.170
I suppose there's a third category,

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:47.100
which is, people accept that

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.650
biological systems are
actually much more forgiving

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.010
than the way they're sometimes described.

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:53.810
And I'm going to use
this as an opportunity

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:56.160
to editorialize a little bit.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.570
You know, there's so
much made of sleep debt.

01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:01.500
Look there isn't an IRS
equivalent for sleep.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.580
They're not going to come around

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.550
and try and collect all the
sleep that you didn't get.

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:09.600
No one really knows what the
consequences are going to be

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.040
for you and for me and for the next person

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.060
for the sleep you didn't get.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.940
You can't really recover
the sleep you missed out on,

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.450
but you also don't want to get

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:19.970
neurotically attached to a schedule

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.740
because there's this
thing called sleep anxiety

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.600
and then people have trouble

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.120
falling asleep and staying asleep.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.890
So I want to spend a moment on that

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:29.230
and go back to a theme that
I've said many times before,

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:31.000
because these tools work

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.500
what I called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.540
So this would be hypnosis,
I gave you the link,

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.580
but I'll say it again, reveriehealth.com

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.110
for clinically tested,
research tested free hypnosis

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.760
for anxiety but also for sleep.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.190
Those are very beneficial people.

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.460
NSDR protocols, non-sleep
deep rest protocols

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.250
for things like yoga nidra, I
provided some links to those

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.320
in the caption for episode two.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.280
These things really work.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.220
Last night, I woke up, I
went to bed about 10:30,

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.160
I woke up at three in the morning,

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.400
I knew I wasn't feeling rested.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.320
I did a NSDR protocol, I fell back asleep,

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.560
I woke up at 6:30, okay.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.490
You need to teach your brain
and your nervous system

01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:15.740
how to turn off your
thoughts and go to sleep.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.370
And ideally you do that without medication

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.790
unless there's a real need,

01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:20.430
you do that through these
behavioral protocols.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.970
They work because they involve

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:24.490
using the body to shift the mind

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:26.040
not trying to just turn off your thoughts

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.470
in the middle of the night.

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:28.980
Now there are periods of life

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.790
where things are stressful
and people are concerned

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:35.280
and you will have some struggle
getting and staying asleep.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.050
And there's, that really
has to do more with anxiety

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:42.560
which NSDR protocols also can help with.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.990
As I always say, do them
in the middle of the night

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:45.460
if you wake up and you
want to go back to sleep

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.293
during the middle of the day,

01:09:46.293 --> 01:09:47.307
to teach your nervous system to calm down

01:09:47.307 --> 01:09:48.590
and do them first thing in the morning

01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.840
if you didn't feel you got enough sleep.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.210
In other words, do them whenever

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:52.910
you have an opportunity to do them

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:57.070
because they really can help
you learn how to turn on

01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:00.220
the parasympathetic/calming arm

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.870
of your autonomic nervous system.

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:05.560
There's no other way that I'm aware of

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.810
to teach your system to slow down

01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:09.500
and turn off your thoughts
and go back to sleep.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.690
But these are powerful protocols,

01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:12.170
and there's a lot of research now

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.150
to support the fact that
they can really help.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:17.063
Meditation would be another example.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:23.210
Certain kinds of meditation
involve focus and alertness.

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.710
Those are slightly different
than meditations that involve

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:29.283
lack of focus and attention
to say internal states.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:31.643
I'm going to pause there,

01:10:31.643 --> 01:10:34.060
and then I want to talk
about kids and the elderly.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.150
In other words, how do we control

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.790
sleep and circadian
rhythms and wakefulness

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:44.033
in babies, adolescents,
teens, and aged folks.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:49.090
All right, before we
talk about sleep in kids,

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:50.640
I want to tell a little story.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.120
It's not a joke, many
of you will be relieved

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.020
that I'm not going to try and
tell another joke this episode.

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:59.333
Which is the relationship between light,

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.723
skin and pelage color,

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:08.900
dopamine and reproduction, mating.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:14.040
So many seasonally breeding animals,

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.080
Siberian hamsters which
I mentioned earlier,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.950
rabbits, fox, other animals,

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:21.223
change their color of their coat.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.200
In the winter they tend
to be a lighter color,

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.750
sometimes pure white,

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.113
sometimes with flecks of black or brown.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.760
And in the summer their
pelage changes to a color of

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.453
you know, brown or red, some
other vastly different color.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:43.623
That shift is controlled
by light and by melatonin.

01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:48.720
This has an interesting
correlate in humans.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.670
So humans obviously have
different skin tones

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:56.200
just genetically because
of the amount of melanin

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.223
in one skin, depending
on genetic background.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.660
But of course sunlight will
increase the amount of melanin

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.690
in the skin regardless, right?

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:09.423
This is suntan, sunburn,
etc, bronzing, whatever.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:16.550
The whole system is wired
so that shifts in skin color

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:20.950
and shifts in these cells
within the eye and melatonin

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:22.480
are actually very closely linked.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.493
So here's the story.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:29.910
Many years ago, meaning about
10 years ago, 15 years ago,

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.090
let's see it was 20 years ago, forgive me.

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.290
A guy named Iggy Provencio

01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:42.260
who was running his own lab
at uniformed armed services,

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.070
this is a standard biological laboratory,

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:50.070
discovered that there
was an opsin in the eye

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.290
in the cells of the eye

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:54.700
that connect to the rest of
the brain called melanopsin.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.340
Melanopsin, as many of you now know

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.833
is the opsin, it's like a
pigment, it absorbs light.

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:03.720
It is the opsin that converts
light into electrical signals

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.323
to then set the circadian clock.

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.680
Iggy discovered melanopsin

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.080
because it was similar in form

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.560
to what was in frog melanophores.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.020
It was actually in the skin of frogs

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.350
that allowed those frogs to go from

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.030
pale white, when it was dark,

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:28.310
for most of the 24 hour cycle,

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:33.123
to pigmented green or brown for a frog.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.870
So there's this relationship
between the cells in our eye

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:39.653
and the pigment cells of our skin.

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:44.320
And we also know that in long
days, there's more breeding.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.153
How does that work?

01:13:45.153 --> 01:13:47.530
Well that's actually from dopamine

01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:51.340
triggering increases in
testosterone, mainly in males,

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.700
and estrogen mainly in
females although of course,

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.230
there's testosterone
estrogen in both sexes.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:14:01.470
So we have this kind of
pathway where it's light,

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.270
increases in the melanin,

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.690
dopamine and reproduction on the one hand

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:08.133
and lack of light, melatonin,

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.890
decreases in the darkness of skin,

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:14.400
less melanin in the skin,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.320
or in the case of an animal with fur,

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.803
white fur and no reproduction
on the other hand.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:24.820
And humans don't actually
shift their breeding patterns

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:28.440
tremendously from long
days and short days,

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.670
although there are some data
that there's some shifts.

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:34.600
We also don't radically
change our skin color

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.580
depending on how much
sunlight exposure we have.

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.540
But the simple way to put this is,

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.720
when days are long,

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.420
there's a lot more dopamine

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.800
and we feel really good

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.000
and there's a lot more breeding
and breeding-like behavior.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.700
When days are short,
there's a lot less dopamine

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.480
and a lot less breeding behavior

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.690
because these pathways
are very highly conserved.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.960
Now what's interesting is that,

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.480
as we've moved into a modern society

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.270
where much of our waking days

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:08.070
we are looking at screens, which is fine,

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:09.440
'cause we're getting a
lot of light that way

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.170
although not as much as sunlight.

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.210
But also at night,

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:15.550
we're getting a lot of light from screens.

01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:18.013
What's happened is all these path ways,

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:23.090
melanin in the skin, turnover
of skin cells, dopamine,

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:26.670
all of this stuff has
become completely disrupted.

01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:28.290
Now that's not to say
that we should go back

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.650
to a time in which we didn't
use artificial lights.

01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:32.430
But I think the important thing to realize

01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:36.383
is that feeling good with
getting a lot of light,

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:42.610
the relationship to dopamine
and melanin in the skin,

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.490
and the good feelings of
getting light also on our skin

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:48.030
provided you're not getting burned

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:50.590
or you're not getting
excessive UV exposure,

01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.200
those are not just coincidences.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.440
Those are hard-wired biological mechanisms

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.500
that exist in everybody

01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.093
regardless of how light or dark
your skin is to begin with.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.270
There's another point, which is important,

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:05.800
which is that the dopamine system

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.940
which is this feel-good molecule

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.930
is very closely related

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.730
to the testosterone and
estrogen in reproductive cycles.

01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:16.710
Remember melatonin inhibits
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:19.500
luteinizing hormone, and the
production of these hormones,

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.560
and melatonin is the effector.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.490
It is the hormone of darkness.

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:27.960
So, I just threw a lot of biology at you.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.850
And I'm not saying you're
like a Siberian hamster,

01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:32.840
at least not in ways that I'm aware of.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.160
I'm not saying that your pelage
color is going to change.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.870
Actually the reason people go gray

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:40.343
is because when you're really
stressed, did you know this,

01:16:40.343 --> 01:16:42.480
that when you're really stressed,

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.720
there's an increase in the nerve fibers

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.360
that release adrenaline
to the hair follicle

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.890
and that activates peroxide
groups in the hair follicle

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:55.640
that cause the hair to
actually go gray or white.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.790
So actually stress does make
your hair gray or white.

01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:59.883
Aging does it too.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.180
That was a brief aside,

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.390
but for those of you
that are interested in

01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.680
the relationship between
light and skin tone

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.100
and all that kind of stuff,
I thought you might find it

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.770
interesting that the cells in your eye

01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:15.400
are a lot like these skin
cells in frogs or in animals

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.390
that shift their entire color
and sometimes metamorphosize.

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:21.810
You know, there are some
species that literally

01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:23.520
change shape in their reproductive organs.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.970
In fact, if that wasn't weird enough,

01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:27.730
when I was in graduate school at Berkeley,

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:30.920
there was another graduate
student studying a species

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.350
of hermaphroditic mole, right,
those little things that dig,

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.790
hermaphrodite mole that would change

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:41.950
from having ovaries to
testes and back again

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:43.920
depending on day life.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.193
Super cool, super different,

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.033
and wild biological mechanism.

01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:52.910
If you're wondering how
those animals reproduce

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:55.050
they actually adjust the
numbers of males and females

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:56.810
depending on the density
of males and females.

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.453
So if there are too many males,

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.960
some of the males turn
their testes into ovaries.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.010
And if there're too many females,

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:05.690
they turn their ovaries into testes.

01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:08.680
They actually are true
hermaphroditic animals

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.810
as opposed to as pseudo
hermaphrodite animals.

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:13.980
Okay, let's get back on track.

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.200
Let's talk about the animal
that most of you care about

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.603
which is the human animal.

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.150
New parents and babies.

01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:23.630
All right, as I mentioned earlier,

01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:28.470
melatonin is not cyclic,
it's not cycling in babies,

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.610
it's more phasic.

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:32.740
It's being released at a
kind of a constant level.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:35.950
And babies tend to be smaller
than adults, they are.

01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:38.780
And so those concentrations
of melatonin are very high.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.820
As the baby grows, those concentrations

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.683
per unit volume are going to go down.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.370
Babies are not born with a
typical sleep wake cycle.

01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:49.000
And now all the parents are saying,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.600
tell me something I didn't know.

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:55.470
They also have, and I really
want to emphasize this,

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:59.820
they also have much more
sensitive optics of the eye.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.220
So a number of people
have asked me, you know,

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.820
should I be exposing my baby to sunlight?

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:06.280
You don't want to avoid sunlight,

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.290
but their eyes are very sensitive,

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.610
the optics of their eyes
aren't quite developed

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:14.530
so much so that you know when
you look at a newborn baby

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:16.760
and they look a little glassy-eyed

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.640
and they're kind of looking through you

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.150
or even a young child.

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:21.620
A lot of people think
that they're seeing you

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.070
the way that you're seeing them.

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:27.800
Hate to break it to you, but
if you ever can just google

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:32.290
visual image of a like a one month old.

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:34.400
The optics of their eyes are so poor

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.990
that you're a cloudy image.

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:38.220
They're not seeing your fine detail.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.883
As the optics get better,

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:43.330
then they will see you
with more and more clarity.

01:19:43.330 --> 01:19:45.090
But a lot of that is clearing of the lens

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:48.910
and some of the other aqueous
features of the newborn eye,

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:50.513
they don't see very well.

01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:54.290
But they also don't have such great ways

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.740
of adjusting to bright light.

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.370
And so babies have a natural
aversion to bright lights.

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.310
So you really want to avoid

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:02.400
trying to use sunlight
or really bright light

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.300
in the same way that
you would for an adult

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.123
on a young baby or child.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.170
As children get older however,

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:13.250
melatonin does start to
become slightly more cyclic,

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.460
slightly more cycled,

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.360
and their body temperature
rhythms also start to

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.960
fall into a more regular,
not quite 24 hour rhythm,

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.500
they're more of these ultradian rhythms.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.740
So in episode, I think it was
one or two of the podcast,

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.900
or maybe both, we talked
about these 90 minute

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.090
so-called ultradian rhythms,
where every 90 minutes

01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:37.660
babies are going through a
cycle of body temperature

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.190
and some other hormonal features.

01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:42.140
I mean, so much is
changing in their system.

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:45.690
So what to do if a child isn't sleeping?

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:49.490
You can use phases of
darkness and phases of light

01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:50.940
but they're going to have to be shortened

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.460
in order to try and encourage sleep

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:53.640
when you want the child to sleep.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.720
It's not that they're
just not going to fall

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.570
into an adult-like regime

01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:00.150
of a temperature minimum
and a temperature maximum.

01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:01.730
Their temperature minimums and maximums

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:03.840
are fluctuating much more quickly.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.433
And it varies tremendously.

01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:08.690
Actually there's an interesting literature

01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:10.090
of whether or not they have siblings,

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:11.050
whether or not they're twins,

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:13.160
whether or not they're
in a nursery environment,

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.850
whether or not they're alone,

01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.173
hopefully the baby's not alone,
but you know what I mean,

01:21:16.173 --> 01:21:17.640
that they're sleeping alone in a room

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.670
while you're in the other room.

01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:21.660
There are a couple of
things that seem to help

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.600
which is getting the overall environment

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.220
into a 24 hour schedule.

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:27.850
So having the room slightly colder,

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:30.000
obviously you want babies
to be nice and cozy,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.790
slightly colder when you
would like them to be asleep,

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:34.140
slightly warmer for the times

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.150
you would like them to be awake.

01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:38.053
Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.040
And obviously you want to be very careful

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.253
about avoiding all extremes
of temperature, cold or hot.

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:51.010
So if they're going through
these 90 minute cycles,

01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:52.310
you're going to have to adjust

01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:53.860
to those 90 minute cycles as well.

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:55.840
So then people say, well, that's
not going to help me at all

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.330
because how do I deal with the fact

01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:59.480
that I need to be up
every 90 minutes at night?

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.200
There are a couple tools
that can be helpful.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.360
The first one is going to
be to try and understand

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.680
the relationship between
calm and deep sleep.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.750
So the autonomic nervous system

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:14.300
can put us into states of panic,

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:16.750
where that's kind of seesaw
of autonomic alertness,

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:18.080
goes all the way to panic.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.590
Or it can be alertness, or it
can be alert and calm, right?

01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:23.170
So there's a range
there, it's a continuum.

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:26.070
It can also be that you're in deep sleep,

01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:27.750
so the other end of the seesaw is way up

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.160
or you're your in light sleep
or you're kind of sleepy,

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.163
or you're just feeling kind of relaxed.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:36.320
Perhaps the most important thing

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.550
if you're having to map to a baby schedule

01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:41.120
in order to make sure that they're getting

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.370
changings, and nursing, etc,
at the appropriate times,

01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:48.370
is to try and maintain,

01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:51.860
if you can't sleep or you
can't sleep continuously,

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:56.090
to try and maintain your
autonomic nervous system

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:58.100
in a place where you're not

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:00.450
going into heightened states of alertness

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:03.140
when you would ideally be sleeping.

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:06.110
Now, I realize that this
could be translated to

01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:07.930
try and stay calm while
you're sleep deprived,

01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:10.030
which is very hard for people to do.

01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:11.410
But this is where

01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:13.760
the non-sleep deep rest
protocols surface again

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.160
and can potentially be very beneficial

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.970
for people to be able to
recover, not necessarily sleep,

01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:21.680
but for them to maintain

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.030
a certain amount of autonomic regulation.

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:25.100
So what would this look like?

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.240
This would look like, the baby goes down,

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.610
maybe it's only going to
go down for 45 minutes.

01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:33.510
If you can capture sleep, capture sleep.

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:35.990
There are some data showing
what's called polyphasic sleep.

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:39.020
If you can sleep in 45
minute increments or batches,

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:40.650
even if it's spread throughout the day

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:42.160
with periods of wakefulness in between,

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.270
as miserable as that sound,

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:44.960
there are actually some adults that have

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.110
deliberately employed that,

01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:49.420
who don't have children for
the sake of work productivity.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.710
And it does tend to reduce

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:53.600
the total overall amount
of sleep that you need.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.810
It is a very hard schedule
for most people to maintain

01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.590
but if you have a baby, the
baby may be throwing you

01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:58.880
into that kind of schedule anyway.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.070
So if you can get 45 minutes
sleep while they sleep, great.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.990
If you can get another
45 minutes after waking

01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:05.840
and then they go back
down to sleep, great.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.840
So as many phases of sleep as you can get.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.650
But if you can't sleep

01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:12.520
the data on non-sleep
deep rest type protocols

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.380
does show that at least
from a neurochemical level,

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.860
I want to be clear what that means,

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:20.470
reset of things like dopamine
levels in the basal ganglia

01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:23.700
measured by things like positron
emission tomography, etc.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.690
Those things tend to reset
themselves pretty well

01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:29.160
if you can access these deep rest state.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.310
So that means not being alert

01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:34.230
throughout the entire time
that the baby is sleeping.

01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:37.470
Trying to sort of mirror
the baby's sleep cycle

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:39.130
which can be brutal for certain people,

01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:40.870
and especially if you're
trying to prepare meals

01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:41.703
and do all these things.

01:24:41.703 --> 01:24:42.536
So I do recognize

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:43.880
that there are a lot of
constraints on parenting

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.400
not just mapping on your
baby's sleep schedule.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.000
As children approach ages
one, two, three, four,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.480
that's when certainly the
optics of the eyes have improved

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.480
but you don't want to
damage the eyes of course,

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.010
with very bright light.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.730
They are much more sensitive even until

01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:02.993
they're kind of 10, 11 years old.

01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:06.480
And we'll talk about vision
in children in a moment.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.040
But trying to get longer
and longer batches of sleep

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.270
through, hopefully not through the use

01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:15.480
of administering melatonin to the kids

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.780
'cause that's what I talked about before

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.580
why that could potentially be detrimental

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:21.140
talk about that with your doctor.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:25.880
But more so trying to get
longer blocks of sleep

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.010
that map onto these ultradian cycles.

01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:30.610
So it would be better
off to get a three hour,

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:34.300
like two-90 minute cycles,
than a four hour batch of sleep

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.860
because waking up in the middle
of those ultradian cycles

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.470
can just be brutal for parent and kid.

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:42.700
So if one can't get a full six or 10,

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.650
or some kids should even
be sleeping 12 hours

01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:45.830
when they're growing quickly,

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:47.950
trying to get batches of sleep

01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:51.050
even if they're fractured
throughout the 24 hour cycle

01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:54.020
that are matched more to
these 90 minute cycles,

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.650
meaning maybe one ultradian
cycle of 90 minutes,

01:25:56.650 --> 01:26:01.100
or two back to back, or
three back to back to back.

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:02.580
That's going to be better than waking up

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.270
in the middle of an ultradian cycle.

01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:06.910
It's just going to set
any number of other things

01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:10.790
in a better direction than
were you to try to say,

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:15.070
just enforce or force a full
eight or 10 hours of sleep.

01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:17.410
That's at least what the literature shows.

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.200
Some kids sleep great through the night,

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.970
starting at a very
young age, others don't.

01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:22.460
I typically hear from people

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.350
who are struggling tremendously,

01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:26.370
they're losing their mind understandably,

01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:29.520
because they're not sleeping,
their kid's not sleeping and,

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.330
or their kid is sleeping
for such brief periods.

01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:33.700
So in other words, try
and access deep calm

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.960
if you can't sleep, try and
access sleep, if you can sleep

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.280
even if it's fractured.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.470
And then you say, well, what
about all the sunlight viewing

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:40.733
and the exercise stuff?

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:46.160
When sleep is really, really dismantled,

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.470
meaning it's happening in
various times of day or night,

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:52.323
that's especially, at those times

01:26:52.323 --> 01:26:54.990
it's going to be especially
important for the parent

01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:56.650
to get morning and evening sunlight

01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:59.560
because your circadian clock
is going into a tailspin

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.520
and it basically wants
to anchor to something.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.130
So you want to give it two
anchors, morning and evening light.

01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:07.590
Okay, so this is rather different

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:09.210
than what I described for shift work,

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.820
this is when things are really chaotic

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.110
and you're just not able to sleep.

01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:13.640
Similar circumstances can arise

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.540
if you're taking care of
a very sick loved one,

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.890
you're up all night.

01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:19.460
Try and stay calm using NSDR protocols,

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.660
I know it's harder to do than to say,

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:24.940
but those protocols are
there, they're free,

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.660
there's research to support them.

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.650
Try and get sleep whenever you can

01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:31.950
but also try to get morning sunlight

01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:34.200
and evening sunlight
in your eyes if you can

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.383
and if you can't get that,
use artificial light, okay?

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.990
What about later life?

01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:42.190
So kids now, adolescents, teens,

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:46.300
it is true that teens have
a tendency to wake up later

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.730
and go to sleep later.

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:50.610
In part, just because
they're sleeping a lot more.

01:27:50.610 --> 01:27:52.820
They're churning out
gonadotropin-releasing hormone

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:53.880
and luteinizing hormone.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.480
Their whole bodies are changing.

01:27:56.370 --> 01:27:58.460
I don't know whether or
not people realize this,

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:00.520
but the fastest rate of aging

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.513
that any of us will
ever undergo is puberty.

01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:06.220
That is the fastest rate of aging.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.650
And so there's a huge number
of biological processes

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.200
that are happening during puberty,

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.870
probably devote a whole episode

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:16.690
to puberty as a fascinating
aspect to the life course

01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:19.390
but it is accelerated period of aging.

01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:21.510
And the circadian clock mechanisms

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:24.530
sometimes are very intact,

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:25.950
and sometimes they're a little dismantled

01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:27.730
and going through some change,

01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:31.300
but prioritize the duration of sleep

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.070
for adolescents and teens.

01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:35.010
Now, if that means they're
sleeping until 2:00 PM,

01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:36.730
and then waking up and
then they're up all night,

01:28:36.730 --> 01:28:38.560
the up all night part can become a problem

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.870
especially with all the devices,

01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:43.270
texting in their rooms
or playing video games.

01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:45.110
Morning and evening
sunlight would be ideal

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:46.530
but some kids are just going to sleep

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:47.840
through the morning sunlight.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.670
However, if you were to
measure their temperature,

01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:52.200
what you would find is that
their temperature minimum

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.150
would come later in the morning.

01:28:54.150 --> 01:28:57.150
It's not going to be 8:00 AM.

01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:58.680
It's going to be maybe even 10:00 AM,

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.230
if they're sleeping until 11 or 12.

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:03.900
Or it might be 8:00 AM if
they're sleeping until 10.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.540
Remember temperature minimum is two hours

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.360
before your average
waking time, typically.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.260
So in teens, it maximizes
the total amount of sleep.

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:13.980
Try and get regular sunlight
either in the morning

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:15.600
or in the evening or both.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.280
But if they're sleeping
through the morning sunrise,

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.480
that's probably not as much of an issue,

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.320
waking them up and depriving them of sleep

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.500
is probably worse because their T-min,

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.020
their temperature minimum,
is actually falling later.

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.790
So their circadian dead
zone is later, etc.

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:32.770
So I think with adolescents and teens

01:29:32.770 --> 01:29:35.970
it makes sense to kind of give
them a little bit more rope

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.090
in terms of allowing them some leeway

01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:40.220
to adjust their own schedule.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:42.240
Some schools are even
starting classes later

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.120
on the basis of some very good biology

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.697
to support this late shifted rhythm

01:29:46.697 --> 01:29:48.513
and this extended sleep phase.

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:53.320
There are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.890
Department of Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences,

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.700
and others at Stanford, showing
that turning on the lights

01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:59.840
in the room of a teen before they wake up

01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:03.680
helps them get more sleep
the subsequent night,

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.640
it also tricks them

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.040
into going to sleep a little bit earlier.

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.160
But it gives them about 45
minutes more of deep sleep.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.020
And that's been shown statistically,

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.370
total sleep time increases as well.

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:15.170
If they're hiding under the
covers, that's not going to work,

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.090
but their eyes don't have to be open.

01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:18.420
I know a few parents now

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:19.590
that are coming in with a flashlight

01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:22.800
and flashing their kids over their eyelids

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.980
before they wake up in hopes
of getting this to work,

01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.360
some have told me this is working.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.713
That's not part of a standard study.

01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:35.070
But it does seem to work
because, now you should know why,

01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:37.230
because if light's getting
through the eyelids,

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:40.390
and it's say 8:00 AM and
the kid is still asleep

01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:41.830
and they're going to wake up at 10,

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:43.110
you're giving them light

01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:47.370
just after or around
their temperature minimum,

01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:50.170
which is going to make them
want to go to sleep earlier.

01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:51.590
And in the case of teens,

01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:53.050
for some reason we don't quite understand,

01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:55.810
sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer,

01:30:55.810 --> 01:30:57.330
spend more time in deep sleep.

01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:59.480
Adults can do this too, if
you can persuade someone

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.700
or put your lights on timer

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.000
for lights to go on before you wake up,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.230
that's really going to help
you wake up earlier, okay.

01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:07.780
So if you're starting to hear

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:11.210
some themes are really
resounding over and over again,

01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:12.993
that should be reassuring to you, right.

01:31:12.993 --> 01:31:15.780
That these are core mechanisms.

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.740
Fortunately, there aren't
1,000 different mechanisms.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:21.343
Now in the elderly,

01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:25.380
there's a real tendency to
want to go to sleep very early

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.330
and wake up very early.

01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:31.240
And people should talk to their physician.

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:33.850
There is some evidence
that melatonin levels

01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:36.230
and patterns of melatonin secretion

01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:39.690
can become a little
chaotic in elderly folks.

01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:40.690
What do I mean by elderly?

01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:41.590
Well, it's going to differ.

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:43.010
Rates of aging differ, right?

01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:47.240
You see some 65 year olds
that are struggling to move

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.870
and seem much older than
some 65 year olds that are,

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:54.170
you know, still hustling
around and have tons of energy.

01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:55.140
There's a lot of variation,

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:58.770
some of it's genetic, some
of it's lifestyle factors,

01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:00.740
you know, it really varies.

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.500
Certainly lifestyle factors
can play an important role

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.693
in rates of aging.

01:32:06.110 --> 01:32:09.820
I think that the most prominent results

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.760
from sleep and circadian
rhythms in the elderly are

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.840
they need to get as much natural light,

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.990
even if it's through windows.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:19.230
I realize that some elderly folks

01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:20.770
can't get outside as easily.

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:22.020
It's not safe for them to do it,

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:23.993
they can't move around as easily.

01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:26.960
Exercise can come in various forms

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.420
for people that can't get outside

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:32.120
and get a ton of sunlight
by jogging or cycling.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.370
If they're not able to do that,

01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:35.860
light through window in that
case, open window ideally,

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:37.750
but for temperature reasons, etc,

01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:39.550
sometimes the window has to be closed.

01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:40.950
Getting people near that window

01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:43.610
and away from artificial
light early in the day,

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:46.780
and away from artificial
lights during the night phase

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.480
can have a tremendous effect.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.240
And in the elderly that's when melatonin

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.220
might be a viable option.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.050
And this should be discussed
with a physician, of course,

01:32:57.050 --> 01:33:00.950
but you know, you're way
past the puberty time point.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:04.337
In most cases, people who
are in their 70s, and 80s,

01:33:04.337 --> 01:33:06.000
and 90s, are not churning out

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.960
a lot of GnRH and luteinizing
hormone to begin with.

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.700
And that's where struggles

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.980
with falling asleep and staying asleep,

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.190
all the same parameters

01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:17.340
and things we've described
before still apply,

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.600
light, exercise, temperature, etc,

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.990
but that's where melatonin
might be of greatest benefit.

01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:24.730
And again, I'm not pushing melatonin here

01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:26.240
but I think for elderly folks

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.060
who are having trouble
falling and staying asleep,

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:29.763
that might be worthwhile.

01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.820
There are, and I should
just also mention that

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.360
regular schedule for
folks that are elderly

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.900
and as much natural
light as safely possible,

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.810
those are going to be the key levers

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:46.203
for adjusting sleep in
circadian schedules.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.480
I've mentioned before
in previous podcasts,

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.440
other supplements besides melatonin.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.717
And some of those supplements
are quite good for sleep.

01:33:54.717 --> 01:33:56.640
You know, I'm not a supplement pusher,

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.313
I am somebody who takes
supplements, I believe in them,

01:34:01.190 --> 01:34:03.880
some have worked for me some
have not worked as well,

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.850
but I certainly believe in
getting the behaviors right.

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:11.040
Whether or not it's NSDR
protocols, viewing natural light,

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.800
exercise, hot baths, or cold
showers, or what have you,

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.160
behavioral protocols first.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.710
There are some supplements that

01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:21.000
I've mentioned in previous podcasts

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.630
but I've seemed to get a
lot of questions about.

01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:24.760
So I just want to take a couple
minutes and just talk about

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.850
some of the supplements
that can be beneficial

01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:30.870
for helping turning off
thinking, accessing deeper sleep,

01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:33.910
and even being able to
compact your sleep schedule

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:35.240
into a shorter period of hours,

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.640
meaning getting by well with less sleep.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.600
People take a lot of sleeping pills.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.320
I'm not going to tell people
not to take sleeping pills.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.583
They can be very
problematic, habit-forming,

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:49.410
high side-effect incidents in many cases,

01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:51.700
some people can handle them just fine.

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:54.380
Again, I'm no physician,

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.637
I'm not prescribing anything.

01:34:55.637 --> 01:34:58.280
I'm a professor, so I
profess a lot of things

01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.830
some of which are my opinion.

01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:02.100
Although, if you look at
the scientific literature,

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:04.710
there are some impressive data around some

01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:06.820
non-prescription drug type supplements

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:09.510
that have fairly high safety margins

01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:10.343
that you might consider

01:35:10.343 --> 01:35:11.940
but you should talk to your doctor always

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.750
before adding or taking anything

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.740
out of your health regimes, right?

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.470
Your health is not my responsibility,

01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:20.220
it's your responsibility,
so be a stringent filter.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:23.210
Along those lines, one of the
most powerful and useful tools

01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:24.490
that I've mentioned here on many times

01:35:24.490 --> 01:35:26.580
and I plan to mention
many many more times,

01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:29.630
is the website examine.com

01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:31.820
which I have no affiliation with

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.410
but is a wonderful site that links you to

01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:35.860
quality peer reviewed studies

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.410
relating to just about any supplement

01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:40.480
including some safety warnings.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.990
Will also tell you what subjects,

01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:45.433
whether or not it was rats,
cats, elderly folks or kids,

01:35:45.433 --> 01:35:47.150
that a given study was done on,

01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:50.340
which is important, can be
kind of hard to pull from

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:52.720
sites where people are just
advertising supplements, right?

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.700
They usually don't tell
you what the study was

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:58.760
and who were these rats,
who were these kids, etc.

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.170
There are three supplements
that at least for me

01:36:04.170 --> 01:36:08.150
have had a tremendously
positive effect on my sleep

01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:10.253
that some of you might consider.

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.690
I would say,

01:36:12.690 --> 01:36:15.440
if you're doing everything
properly behaviorally

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.240
and you're still having issues,

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.870
then supplements might
be a good thing for you.

01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:21.620
Or if you are traveling

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.740
and you want a little bit of extra help

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.233
in buffering your sleep
wakefulness protocols.

01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:29.150
Some people like to go
just to the supplements.

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.110
They're like, what should I take?

01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:32.010
I have people in my life that are like,

01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:33.250
just tell me what to take, you know.

01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:35.900
I'm more of, here's what you
might want to do or not do

01:36:37.049 --> 01:36:39.150
and then think about what you
might want to take or not take.

01:36:39.150 --> 01:36:42.740
But personal preference
and it's a free country,

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.113
so you can do what you like.

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:48.810
Magnesium.

01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:53.330
So magnesium has been shown
to increase the depth of sleep

01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:56.650
and has been shown to
decrease the amount of time

01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:59.970
that it takes to access
sleep, to fall asleep.

01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:01.680
It comes in various forms.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.940
I've talked a bunch of times
about magnesium threonate,

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.233
T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.180
which seems to be the more
bioavailable form of magnesium.

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:16.460
And magnesium threonate it seems

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.400
is shadowed preferentially to the brain

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.930
which is where you want it.

01:37:21.930 --> 01:37:23.670
And there's certain transporters,

01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:26.100
it actually engages the GABA pathway

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.330
which tends to turn off
certain areas of the forebrain

01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:30.230
and allows you to kind of fall asleep.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.110
There is a study, if
you'd like to explore it

01:37:34.110 --> 01:37:36.520
since people serious about supplementation

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.360
might want to explore the study,

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:41.060
which is Ates et al, A-T-E-S

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.620
Dose-Dependent Absorption Profile

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.010
of Different Magnesium Compounds.

01:37:45.010 --> 01:37:47.720
Looks to me like a quality
peer reviewed paper.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.220
I can put the link in the caption,

01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.973
and it explores all the
different forms of magnesium.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.110
It does seem like magnesium glycinate

01:37:56.110 --> 01:37:57.850
can be similar to magnesium threonate

01:37:57.850 --> 01:37:59.570
in terms of which tissues it is shadow to.

01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:02.370
Magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,

01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:04.550
is preferentially shadow
to the muscle, it appears,

01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:05.383
as opposed to the brain.

01:38:05.383 --> 01:38:08.290
So it's going to be more of
a muscle repair type thing

01:38:08.290 --> 01:38:10.830
or restoring magnesium
stores in the periphery

01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:11.950
as opposed to the brain.

01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:15.520
Magnesium citrate has another
name that I won't mention

01:38:16.650 --> 01:38:20.180
ingest, because magnesium
citrate's main effect,

01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.940
at least on me and the people I know,

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:24.130
seems to be a laxative effect

01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:25.720
as opposed to a cognitive effect.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.390
There's also some evidence
that magnesium threonate

01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:29.900
can be neuroprotective.

01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.410
Those data come from quality labs,

01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:34.350
mostly rodent studies, not human studies,

01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.190
but it's kind of interesting.

01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:37.920
And again, the safety
margins for these things

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.210
tend to be pretty high,

01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:41.100
but anytime you're going
to take something new

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:42.500
you should approach it with caution,

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.680
especially since magnesium
could be involved

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:47.350
in heart rhythm and things of that sort.

01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:49.260
The other supplement that

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.250
has been very beneficial
for me is theanine.

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:55.860
So this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.610
T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.

01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:02.950
Theanine activates certain GABA pathways

01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:04.630
which are involved in turning off

01:39:04.630 --> 01:39:06.220
top-down processing and thinking,

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.780
making it easier to fall asleep.

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:13.450
And theanine, 100
milligrams to 300 milligrams

01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:15.140
has a calming effect.

01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.280
Theanine is now showing up
in a number of different

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.900
energy drinks and even some coffees

01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.880
as a way to try and get
people to ingest more

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.922
of a given type of coffee 'cause

01:39:24.922 --> 01:39:27.970
the idea is it will take away
the jitters and the anxiety,

01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:29.700
allowing people to drink more coffee.

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:33.260
I'm talking about taking
magnesium and theanine

01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:35.060
30 to 60 minutes before bedtime

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.570
not during the day to quell anxiety,

01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:40.140
but rather 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.410
with or without food, for
me hasn't made a difference.

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.950
And the combination of those
two things has really helped.

01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:49.220
Theanine for sleepwalkers
can be a problem.

01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.660
It does increase the
intensity of your dreams,

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.970
it gives you very vivid dreams.

01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:56.070
So for sleep walkers or
people that get night terrors

01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:59.130
stay away from theanine is my advice.

01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:01.360
Magnesium theanine might
be something to explore

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.610
for those of you that
don't have those issues.

01:40:03.610 --> 01:40:05.570
With the emphasis on might.

01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:07.440
And then I've talked about a compound,

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.630
and last time I talked about
the mechanisms of apigenin

01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:14.800
which is a derivative of
chamomile, A-P-I-G-E-N,

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.660
which acts as a little bit of a hypnotic

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:19.270
by activating chloride channels,
hyperpolarized neurons,

01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:20.910
increases GABA in the brain,

01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:23.760
basically makes you feel a little sleepy.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.540
And chamomile, for those
of you that read your

01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:29.260
what was it that Peter Rabbits

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:31.240
snuck into Mr. McGregor's garden,

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.760
ate the chamomile, fell
asleep, Mr. Gregory came back.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.950
Okay, anyone flashing
back to elementary school?

01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:36.783
Okay.

01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:38.260
There's a story about chamomile

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:40.040
having these kind of
sedative-like effects,

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:42.120
apigenin is highly concentrated chamomile

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.540
also has intra-estrogenic effects.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:46.770
So if you want to keep your estrogen up

01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:49.170
you might want to be
cautious about apigenin.

01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:52.170
That's where things like
examine.com become really useful

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:54.560
because you can go to
examine you put in apigenin,

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.260
and it'll tell you all
the things that it does

01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:58.340
and all the things that it
does can sometimes include

01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.530
things that you had no idea,

01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:04.530
like reducing conversion of
certain androgens to estrogens

01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:07.600
which you might like or
you might want to avoid.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.700
That's up to you and where
you want your estrogen levels

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.770
depending on who you
are and what your life

01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.273
circumstances and goals are.

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:18.310
A few other things that can
help the transition to sleep,

01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:20.840
are things like 5-HTP L-tryptophan.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.810
I've talked about why I'm
not a fan of those for me,

01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:25.740
they tend to throw me into deep sleep

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:27.630
and then I wake up and I
can't fall back asleep.

01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:30.400
So I don't like to tinker
with my serotonin system,

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.700
I don't like to tinker
with my dopamine system,

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.540
for entirely other reasons but

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.290
none of which are particularly concerning

01:41:38.290 --> 01:41:40.400
it's just that I find that
if I increase my dopamine

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.040
by taking L-Tyrosine in pill form,

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.700
then I crash really hard the next day.

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.020
Or if I take 5-HTP L-tryptophan

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.750
I fall deeply asleep and then I wake up.

01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:51.920
But I didn't mention
that there might be ways

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:53.860
to make sleep more compact.

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.220
And so this is actually a request to you.

01:41:56.220 --> 01:42:00.040
I had a really interesting
experience when I was a postdoc.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.910
I went for the first
time to an acupuncturist.

01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:04.620
I know there're varying

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.120
thoughts and opinions out
there about acupuncture.

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.910
I can't say that I've benefit
so much from the acupuncture.

01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:14.860
There are now quality peer
reviewed studies showing

01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:17.430
publishing neuron, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal,

01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:20.320
showing that acupuncture can stimulate

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.620
some anti-inflammatory compounds

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.547
depending on where the
acupuncture is done.

01:42:23.547 --> 01:42:26.320
These are really good
studies, came out last year.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.750
I talked about this on Instagram,
I may talk about it again.

01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.930
As well as certain acupuncture sites

01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:32.620
that increase inflammation.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:36.530
So, you know, you can get
different types of effects,

01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:39.500
you can't just say acupuncture
is great across the board.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.930
And I'm assuming that
the acupuncturist know

01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:43.790
which sites are good for
increasing inflammation,

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:46.680
which ones are good for
decreasing inflammation.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.430
However, this acupuncturist that I went to

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:52.070
gave me these red pills.

01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:53.840
He said, these are minerals for sleep,

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.710
and it was remarkable.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.280
I took the red pills.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.310
Isn't that a thing now?

01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:58.143
Take the red pill.

01:42:58.143 --> 01:42:59.230
I don't know what that means, right,

01:42:59.230 --> 01:43:00.780
'cause I'm not tuned in.

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.370
But these red pills
looked like little M&amp;Ms,

01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:05.490
I took a couple of them on his suggestion

01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:06.990
and I fell deeply asleep

01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:09.960
and four hours later woke up
feeling incredibly rested,

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:12.050
more rested than I had
ever felt in my entire life

01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:14.000
and I never required more
than four hours sleep.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.280
Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away,

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.580
I never figured out what
was in those red pills.

01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:20.930
I didn't get a chance to
do the mass spectroscopy,

01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:24.040
and I still wonder, he
said they were minerals.

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.380
So somebody out there knows
what these red pills are

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:28.640
and what this compound is.

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.950
And it was incredible,

01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:33.690
and I would love to know what those are.

01:43:33.690 --> 01:43:35.620
So if you know,

01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.460
please don't go taking red pills at random

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.920
to try and recreate this
non-experiment experience of mine.

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.980
But please do contact me if you find out

01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.813
or if you're an acupuncturist

01:43:45.813 --> 01:43:48.610
and you know what these
mysterious red pills were,

01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:51.780
because they were pretty awesome.

01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.740
Once again, I've thrown

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.650
a tremendous amount of information at you.

01:43:55.650 --> 01:43:58.230
I hope you will figure out
your temperature minimum

01:43:58.230 --> 01:43:59.840
and start working with that

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.930
to access the sleep and wakeful cycles

01:44:03.930 --> 01:44:04.860
that you want to access.

01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:07.460
I hope that you will explore NSDR.

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:10.620
You might want to explore supplementation

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:11.940
if that's your thing.

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:14.960
You have now access to a lot of mechanism

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.670
about sleep and wakefulness.

01:44:16.670 --> 01:44:18.620
But in keeping with the
theme of this podcast,

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.230
where we stay on topic

01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:22.570
for an entire month or even slightly more,

01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:24.970
we are not done with
sleep and wakefulness.

01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:26.760
I know this is very different

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.290
than the typical podcast format,

01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:31.550
where one week it's how
to become superhuman

01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:34.770
and the next week it's how to, you know,

01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:37.100
develop growth mindset and
it's kind of all over the place

01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.100
with episode to episode.

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.930
We are staying on track
because I really believe

01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:43.760
that as we drill deeper and
deeper into these mechanisms,

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.650
and you start hearing
some of the same themes

01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:46.637
again and again,

01:44:46.637 --> 01:44:49.400
you're going to start
to develop an intuition

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.730
and an understanding of how
these systems work in you

01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:53.800
and your particular life circumstances.

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.850
And my goal is really to
eventually become obsolete.

01:44:56.850 --> 01:44:58.660
It's what my graduate advisor used to call

01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.480
the hit by a bus principle.

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:04.260
She had a somewhat morbid
sense of humor and used to be,

01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:05.660
well, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow,

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:09.250
what are you going to do
without me blabbing at you here?

01:45:09.250 --> 01:45:11.430
So I don't want to get hit by a bus,

01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:13.040
I plan on living a very long time,

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.870
if I have anything to say about it.

01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:17.670
But were I to get hit by a bus tomorrow,

01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:19.970
what would you do for your
sleep and wakefulness, right?

01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:21.360
You could put a comment on YouTube,

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.480
which I hope you will do.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.140
But if I were hit by a bus and killed

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.833
then I wouldn't be able
to answer your question.

01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:29.760
So know your temperature minimum,

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:32.880
understand light in the early
part of the day is valuable.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.040
Light when you want to be awake,

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.670
provided it's not so bright it's damaging.

01:45:35.670 --> 01:45:37.380
It's great for you whether
or not it comes from screens

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:39.370
or sunlight but sunlight's better.

01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:42.240
Avoid light in the four to six hours

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.590
before your temperature minimum

01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:45.020
or else you're going to delay your clock

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.070
unless you're traveling and
that's what you want to do.

01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.903
Okay?

01:45:48.903 --> 01:45:52.020
Use temperature, increase
temperature to shift your clock,

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:56.210
decrease temperature to
delay your clock, okay?

01:45:56.210 --> 01:45:58.160
Map out your temperature
and understand it.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:01.010
You don't have to know degree
by degree across the day,

01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:03.100
know your minimum, know
your maximum temperature

01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:04.230
in your 24 hour cycle

01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:07.170
and you'll feel great power through that

01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:10.630
because then you'll know also
about these ultradian cycles,

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:13.400
these 90 minute cycles within
which you can do focused work.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.040
Don't expect the focus to come early,

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.200
expect focus to come in the middle

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.140
and then kind of taper off.

01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:19.336
I talked a little bit about kids,

01:46:19.336 --> 01:46:21.140
a little bit about
elderly, about parenting,

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.410
we are going to continue,
there's going to be more.

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:25.700
But now shift workers, travelers,

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.780
people that are jet
lagging themselves at home,

01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.630
you now have levers in place.

01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:33.740
Information can be powerful
but you have to implement it

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:36.500
in ways, obviously safe
ways and reasonable ways.

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.490
But implementing this knowledge

01:46:38.490 --> 01:46:41.360
in the ways that you trust are
safe and reasonable for you

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.080
is going to be the way that you can

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.610
develop a bit of a
laboratory about yourself.

01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:49.110
I loath the term biohacking,
sorry, biohackers.

01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.700
I don't believe in hacking anything.

01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.290
I believe in understanding mechanism

01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:54.410
and applying the principles of mechanism

01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:56.320
for which there are large bodies

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.350
of quality peer reviewed data,

01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:00.830
and even a whole center of mass around

01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:02.270
certain biological principles,

01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:04.130
like the effects of light and temperature,

01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:06.070
temperature minimums, that will allow you

01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:08.470
to shift your biology in the
ways that you want it to go.

01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:10.460
That will allow you to
shift your psychology

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:12.560
in the ways you want to go.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.590
Next podcast episode,

01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:17.870
we are going to talk
more about a few things.

01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:20.160
First of all, we're going to
answer more of your questions

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.270
'cause during office hours,

01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:23.490
I didn't get to all your questions from

01:47:23.490 --> 01:47:24.630
the previous episode.

01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:27.760
So I do read the comments
and we're paying attention

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.720
and figuring out the
most common questions.

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.410
We are going to get to
some of the harder topics.

01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:32.420
Someone came at me,

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:34.650
it's always fun when somebody
does this, they said, well,

01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:37.030
these are just the kind of
basal low-level questions.

01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:38.050
What about the big stuff?

01:47:38.050 --> 01:47:40.590
What about dreaming and lucid
dreaming and consciousness?

01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:42.480
Look, I'll talk about that stuff.

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.200
And I'm planning to do that,

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.410
some of which in the next episode

01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:47.380
and the following episode maybe even.

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:49.930
But I want to give you data.

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:52.370
I want to give you things
that are supported by data.

01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:56.720
So I will try to speculate
as little as possible

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.070
because this is a podcast about science

01:47:59.070 --> 01:48:01.200
and science-based tools for everyday life.

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.780
This is not about me speculating.

01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.740
Many people have speculated
about the role of sleep,

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:06.810
dreaming and consciousness.

01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:11.210
Fascinating topics, and a rather
circular argument frankly,

01:48:11.210 --> 01:48:12.860
it's been going on for centuries.

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.330
Someday we'll get there,
right now we're concentrating

01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:17.060
on these deep biological mechanisms

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:18.440
that make you who you are

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:21.500
and allow you to feel
certain ways, good or bad,

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:25.080
allow you to function
physically in certain ways,

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.740
good or bad, and give you
more of a sense of control.

01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:29.240
That's my goal here.

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.260
Many people have quite graciously asked

01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:33.830
how they can help support the podcast.

01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:36.820
First of all, thank you,
we appreciate the question.

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.410
You can support the podcast

01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:41.650
by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube,

01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:45.090
as well as subscribing
on Apple or Spotify.

01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:47.320
And you can also leave us comments

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:51.540
and feedback on YouTube and
at Apple that really helps.

01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:53.340
We would hope the feedback
would be positive,

01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:56.180
but nonetheless, leave us
feedback, ask questions,

01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:57.510
we will use those questions

01:48:57.510 --> 01:49:00.320
to create future content for the podcast.

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.170
As well, if you can recommend the podcast

01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:04.340
to friends and family and
other people that you think

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:07.060
might find the information
of use, that's terrific.

01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:08.470
And check out our sponsors

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:10.080
that we mentioned at the beginning.

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.370
That's a really great
way to help support us

01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:15.050
and our ability to bring
you this information.

01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:17.760
Along those lines, a lot
of people have asked me

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.520
about supplements and
supplement companies.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.400
So up until now I've been reluctant

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.800
to recommend specific supplement brands.

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.020
The supplement industry
is kind of a wild west

01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:32.540
of different brands,

01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.330
different levels of
quality and stringency.

01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:37.130
It can be very complicated

01:49:37.130 --> 01:49:40.070
and what's on the bottle is
not always what you're getting.

01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:41.440
The quality of what you're getting

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.940
varies from company to company,

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:46.030
and even from substance to
substance, batch to batch.

01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:50.030
So I'm pleased to say that
I'm partnering with Thorne,

01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:53.160
Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:56.870
is a supplement company that
works with the Mayo Clinic,

01:49:56.870 --> 01:50:00.180
and with pretty much all the
major sports team organizations

01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:03.710
and that I know to have the
highest levels of stringency

01:50:03.710 --> 01:50:05.950
in terms of what's in the bottle

01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:08.720
matches what's listed on the bottle,

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.050
and in terms of the quality

01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:12.220
of what they put in those supplements.

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.500
So, while I mentioned earlier,

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.230
that supplements aren't for everybody.

01:50:16.230 --> 01:50:18.380
If you're interested in trying
some of these supplements

01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:20.170
you might want to check out Thorne.

01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:21.520
If you want to do that you can go to

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.500
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:50:27.130 --> 01:50:31.760
So it's t-h-o-r-n-e.com,

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.050
c-o-m slash the letter u slash huberman,

01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:38.760
and if you do that,
they'll give you 20% off

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:39.790
any of the supplements

01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:42.070
that you happen to purchase from Thorne.

01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:43.710
Thanks so much for your
time and attention.

01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:45.070
I really appreciate it.

01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:47.880
See you next time on the
Huberman Lab Podcast.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.753
And as always, thanks for
your interest in science.

01:50:50.753 --> 01:50:53.420
