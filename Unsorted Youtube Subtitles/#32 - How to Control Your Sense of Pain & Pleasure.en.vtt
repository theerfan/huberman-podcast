00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.290
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.878
for everyday life.

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:09.490
[bright upbeat music]

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.580
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.070
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.260
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.710
Today, we continue our
discussion of the senses.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.930
And the senses we are going to discuss

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.530
are pain and pleasure.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.410
Pain and pleasure reflect two
opposite ends of a continuum,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.230
a continuum that involves
detection of things in our skin

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.780
and the perception, the understanding

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.310
of what those events are.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.490
Our skin is our largest sensory organ

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.650
and our largest organ indeed.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.210
It is much larger than any of
the other organs in our body.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.360
And it's an odd organ
if you think about it,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.200
it has so many functions.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.197
It acts as a barrier between our organs

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:54.230
and the outside world,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.210
it harbors neurons nerve
cells that allow us

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.440
to detect things like
light touch, or temperature

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.900
or pressure of various kinds.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.890
And it's an organ that
we hang ornaments on.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.230
People put earrings in their ears.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.330
People decorate their
skin with tattoos and inks

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.760
and other things.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.940
And it's an organ that
allows us to experience

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.760
either great pain or great pleasure.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.800
So it's a multifaceted organ and it's one

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.030
that our brain needs to make
sense of in a multifaceted way.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.596
So today we're going to discuss all that.

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:34.550
And most importantly, how you
can experience more pleasure

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
and less pain by
understanding these pathways.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.200
We will also discuss things you can do,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800
and if you wish things you can take

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.740
that will allow you to
experience more pleasure

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.210
and less pain in response

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.010
to a variety of different experiences.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.330
Before I go any further,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.810
I want to highlight a particularly
exciting area of science

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.643
that relates to the skin and to sensing

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:58.620
of pleasure and pain,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.040
but has everything to do with motivation.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.570
Motivation is something that
many people struggle with,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.300
not everybody, but most
people experience dips

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.460
and peaks in their motivation

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.370
even if they really want something.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.930
How should we think about
these changes in motivation?

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.550
What do they reflect?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.360
Well at a very basic level,
they reflect fluctuations

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.240
changes in the levels of a
chemical called dopamine.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.460
Most of us have heard of dopamine.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.510
Dopamine is a neuromodulator
meaning it modulates

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.430
or changes the way that
neurons nerve cells work.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.590
Most of us have heard that dopamine

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.840
is the molecule of pleasure.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900
However, that is incorrect.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.693
Dopamine is a molecule of
motivation and anticipation.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.770
To illustrate how dopamine works,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.220
I want to highlight
some very important work

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430
largely carried out by the laboratory

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.400
of a guy named Wolfram Schultz.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.093
The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:03.100
of excellent experiments
on the dopamine system

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.770
and have identified something called

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.380
reward prediction error.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.880
Although in some sense
you can think about it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.110
as reward prediction variance.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.500
Changes in the levels
of dopamine depending

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.960
on whether or not you expect a reward

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.710
and whether or not you get the reward.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.460
So I'm going to make this very simple.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.410
Dopamine is released
into the brain and body

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.220
and generally makes us feel
activated and motivated,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.410
as if we have energy to pursue a goal.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.830
And it is released into the brain and body

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.420
in anticipation of a reward.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.080
Measurements of dopamine have been made

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.480
in animals and humans.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.920
And what you find is that
when we anticipate a reward,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.680
dopamine is released,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.330
we will put in the work
to achieve that reward.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.770
That work could be mental
work or physical work,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.490
but when the reward arrives,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.350
dopamine levels drop
back down to baseline.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.183
That's right.

00:03:58.183 --> 00:03:59.230
When we receive a reward,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.500
dopamine levels go back down to baseline.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.190
So the way to envision this
as you can just imagine

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.040
a sort of increase in dopamine
as we anticipate something

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.690
we're working towards it,
we're working towards a goal.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.480
We're excited about seeing
somebody or meeting somebody

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.580
or receiving some reward
and then the reward comes

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.570
and dopamine goes down.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.063
Now that's all fine and good,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.450
but there is a way to
get much more dopamine

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.340
out of that process and therefore a way

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.310
to have much more
motivation, energy, and focus

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.420
because those are the
consequences of elevated dopamine.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.040
The way to do that is to
not deliver the reward

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.120
on an expected schedule.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.610
So experiments have been done
where there's an anticipation

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.160
of a reward, there's work,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.970
and then the reward
only arrives every other

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.324
or every third about of work, okay?

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.630
So this would be like
getting a pat on the head.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.970
If you're a dog or a,
perhaps a child or an adult,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.950
or getting a monetary reward
only for every third project

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.550
or every third race that you win.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.810
Pick any kind of goal.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.643
It doesn't matter.

00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:07.630
These molecules don't care
about what you're pursuing.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.760
They are a common currency of
different types of activities.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.190
That's a regular reward schedule,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.727
and it will not alter the
pattern of dopamine release

00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:18.700
that I described before.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.460
However, if the reward
arrives intermittently

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.340
almost randomly, so
you anticipate a reward

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.740
as a maybe it might come, it might come.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.940
Then you work, work, work,
work, work, no reward.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.270
You repeat the work, work,
work, work, work, work,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.310
and then you get a reward.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.620
So some trials, you do
some trials, you don't,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.190
and it's completely random.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.670
Under those conditions, the amplitude,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.560
the amount of dopamine that's
released into your system

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.890
and the motivation to
continue working hard

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.500
or playing whatever kind
of game you're playing,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.180
doubles or triples.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.330
And this is the basis of
things like slot machines

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.163
and gambling.

00:05:57.163 --> 00:05:59.680
And this is why so many
people will give so much

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.680
of their money up to casinos
and the casinos always win.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.670
Sometimes people walk away with more money

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.400
than they came to the casino with,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.750
but the vast majority of the time,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.570
the house wins as they say.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.130
And it's because they understand

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.610
intermittent reward schedules.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.080
And you can apply this to stay motivated

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.120
in your own pursuits.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.500
Rather than thinking about
the pleasure of a reward,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.130
understand that dopamine
is released in response

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.130
to anticipation reward, and
that is the fuel for work.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.010
And every once in awhile at
random remove the reward.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.100
That's the way to continue
to stay motivated.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.500
Not to reward every action or every goal.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500
And this is also true,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.700
if you're trying to train up
children or train up players

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.280
on a team, you should
not celebrate every win.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.920
I know that's a little counter-intuitive,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.730
we're going to go more into
the biology of dopamine

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.680
and how it relates to the pleasure system

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.150
later on in the podcast,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.080
but for now understand
intermittent reward schedules

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.840
harness the biology of dopamine
in ways that can allow you

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.490
essentially infinite motivation over time.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.570
Before I go any further,

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.387
I want to acknowledge that
this podcast is separate

00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:18.090
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.190
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.570
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.750
about science and science-related tools

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.200
to the general public.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.740
In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.400
of today's podcast.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.311
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:35.860
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.490
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.330
to help you better understand your body

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.600
and help you reach your health goals.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.270
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.920
for the simple reason that
many, if not all of the factors

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.340
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.230
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.480
And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.480
you can get further
knowledge into the mechanisms

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.040
that are going on in your body

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.900
and how those mechanisms are changing

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.230
as they relate to metabolism and hormones

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.270
and other aspects that
profoundly impact your wellbeing.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.230
The problem with most
blood tests, however,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.783
is that you get information
back and it will tell you

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:15.680
whether or not your levels
of something are higher, low,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.900
or within range, but it doesn't
give you any directives.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.450
It doesn't tell you what to
do with that information.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.490
With InsideTracker has
this wonderful feature.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.880
It's a very easy to use
dashboard that has suggestions

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.780
about lifestyle factors, exercise,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.660
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.740
that one could take in order
to adjust those numbers

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.550
according to your personal goals.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.980
So the whole thing is made very easy.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.920
In fact, they can come to
your home to do the blood test

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.780
and DNA test if you like.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.520
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.940
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.100
And if you do that you'll get 25% off

and through August 15th, you
can get a free inner age test.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.310
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.150
Helix makes mattresses and pillows

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.140
that are ideally suited
to your sleep needs.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.210
Everybody's different.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.610
Some people sleep on their sides,

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.750
some people sleep on their stomach,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.200
some people sleep on their back,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.760
some people run warm during the night,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.210
some people run cold.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.850
If you go to the Helix's
website, helixsleep.com,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.030
you can take a quick two-minute quiz,

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.670
and then it will tell you
what your ideal mattress is.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.250
It will match you to your ideal mattress.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.860
I did this and I matched to
the so-called Dusk mattress.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.040
I like a mattress that's
not too firm nor too soft.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.750
I tend to run hot during the night

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.940
and I tend to sleep on
my side or on my stomach.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.780
I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.890
about nine months ago,
and I'm sleeping better

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.810
than I ever have before.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.530
So if you're interested
in upgrading your mattress

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.950
to one that's ideally
suited to your sleep needs,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.840
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.200
take their two-minutes sleep quiz,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.100
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.990
And you'll get up to $200
off that mattress order,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.880
and two free pillows.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.770
They have a 10-year warranty
and you get to try out

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.690
the mattress for a 100 nights risk-free,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.360
they'll even pick it up for
you if you don't love it,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.100
but I think you really will love it.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.130
So again, if you're interested,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.750
go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.360
and two free pillows.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.450
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.510
Athletic Greens is an

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.490
all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.837
I started drinking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

00:10:40.837 --> 00:10:43.640
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.327
The reason I started
drinking Athletic Greens

00:10:45.327 --> 00:10:48.800
and the reason why I still drink
it once or even twice a day

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.600
is because it takes care of all

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.330
my foundational nutritional needs.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.820
It includes vitamins,
minerals, and probiotics

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.540
which are important
for the gut microbiome,

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.210
this colony of bacteria,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.760
healthy bacteria that we
all have living in our guts.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.029
And when that bacteria is healthy,

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:07.620
our brain functions better,

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.010
our immune system functions better.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.880
There is now a lot of
research to support that.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.650
Athletic Greens taste delicious.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.480
I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.940
And as I mentioned, I drink
it once or twice a day,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.670
usually in the morning and
again in the afternoon.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.480
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.790
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.130
and claim a special offer.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.360
That special offer is a
year supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.440
There's now a robust literature
showing that vitamin D3

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.470
is critical for various
aspects of our health,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.220
metabolic health, endocrine
health, et cetera.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.810
And you'll also get
five free travel packs.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.580
When you travel mixing up Athletic Greens

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.590
is made really easy by
these little travel packs.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.550
You just put them in a jar
or other a water bottle,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.500
mix it with water.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.130
It's very easy to do on a
plane or in the et cetera.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.860
Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.340
to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.350
and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.510
So let's talk about pleasure and pain.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.400
I think we all intuitively understand

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.560
what pleasure and pain are.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.220
Pleasure generally is
a sensation in the body

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.280
and in the mind that
leads us to pursue more

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.500
of whatever is bringing
about that sensation.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.500
And pain is also a sensation
in the body and in the mind

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.170
that in general leads
us to want to withdraw

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.870
or move away from some
activity or interaction.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.120
That's not always the case.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.490
Some people actively seek out pain.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.420
Some people somehow
can't seem to engage with

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.900
or experience pleasure,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.130
but most people operate on this
basis of pleasure and pain.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.320
Scientists would call
this appetitive behaviors,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.730
meaning behaviors that lead
us to create an appetite

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.610
for more of those behaviors
and aversive behaviors,

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.800
behaviors that make us want
to move away from something.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.140
The simplest example of
that would be putting your

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.800
hand near a hot flame, at some point,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.570
there would be a reflex or a deep desire

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.770
to withdraw your hand.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.290
Tasting something delicious
in general makes us want

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.120
to eat more of that thing.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.030
Interactions with other
people that we find delicious,

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.750
also make us want to interact
with those people more.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.330
None of this is complicated
or sophisticated.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.640
This is simply to illustrate
the fact that pleasure and pain

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.720
tend to evoke opposite responses,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.350
opposite behavioral responses

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.490
and opposite emotional responses.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.180
So how does that come about?

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.120
Well, it really comes
about by an interaction

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.220
that starts at one end of
our body, meaning our skin

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.970
and the other end of
the organs of our body,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.690
which is deep within the brain.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.510
So let's consider these
two ends of the spectrum

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.460
of pleasure and pain
and what they contribute

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.763
to those experiences of pleasure and pain.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.630
The organ that we call the
skin, as I mentioned earlier,

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.910
is the largest organ in our body.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.190
And throughout that
organ, we have neurons,

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.300
little nerve cells.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.040
Now to be really technical about it,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.060
and the way I'd like you to understand it

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.440
is that the so-called cell
body meaning the location

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.080
of a cell in which the
DNA and other goodies

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.540
the kind of central factory of the cell,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.340
that actually sits right
outside your spinal cord.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.855
So all up and down your
spinal cord on either side

00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:24.480
are these little blobs of neurons,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.960
little collections of neurons.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.360
They have a name if you'd like to know

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.370
for you aficionado or
those who are curious,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.220
they're called DRGs dorsal root ganglia.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.180
A ganglion is just a
collection or clump of cells.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.670
And those DRGs are really
interesting because they send

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.440
one branch that we call an axon,

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.200
a little wire out to our
skin, also to our muscles

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.540
into our organs, but here
we're talking about the skin.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.430
They send a wire out to our
skin and that wire literally

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.290
reaches up into the skin.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.030
It's actually in our skin
and they have another wire

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.430
from that same cell body

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.610
that goes in the opposite direction,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.990
which is up to our brain
and creates connections

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.520
within our brain in the
so-called brainstem.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.510
What this means is that
the neuron in your body

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.990
that we call the DRG
that sends a wire an axon

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.590
to sense what's going on in your big toe

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.240
and then sends another axon
in the opposite direction

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.710
into the base of your brain,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.900
that is the largest cell in
your entire body of any kind.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.090
Fat cell, muscle cell,
nerve cell, et cetera.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.780
Is extremely long cells.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.580
It can be a meter or more depending

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.210
on how tall you happen to be.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.671
So we have these cells that have wires

00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:41.403
they go off in two different directions

00:15:41.403 --> 00:15:44.888
and the wire that's within
our skin will respond

00:15:44.888 --> 00:15:49.888
to any number of different
categories of stimuli.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.020
These wires are positioned within the skin

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.620
to respond to mechanical forces.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.120
So maybe light touch,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.030
some will only send electrical activity up

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.500
toward the brain in
response to light touch.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.650
Meaning if you press on
the skin really hard,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.810
they don't respond.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.310
You stroke the skin lightly
with your fingertips

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.650
or a feather and they
respond very robustly.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.110
Others respond to course
pressure, the hard pressure,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:21.350
but they won't respond to a
light feather, for instance.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.400
Others respond to temperature.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.948
So they will respond
to the presence of heat

00:16:25.948 --> 00:16:30.040
or the presence of cold or
changes in heat and cold.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.180
And still others respond
to other types of stimuli,

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.860
like certain chemicals on our skin.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.380
Many of you have probably
experienced the sensation

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.170
of eating a hot pepper.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.650
Well, I don't recommend doing this,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.210
but were you to take a
little slice of jalapeno

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.090
or other hot pepper, habanero
pepper or something like that

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.480
and rub it on your skin, you
would actually feel something

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.170
at that location.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.130
And that's because that
pepper doesn't just create

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.620
a sensation within your mouth,

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.030
it will create a similar
sensation on your skin.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.350
So these neurons are amazing.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.350
They're collecting information
of particular kinds

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.950
from the skin throughout the entire body

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.140
and sending that information
up toward the brain.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.000
And what's really incredible,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.070
I just want you to
ponder this for a second.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.950
What's really incredible
is that the language

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.860
that those neurons use
is exactly the same.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.350
The neuron that responds to light touch

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.810
sends electrical signals
up toward the brain,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.260
the neurons that respond
to cold or to heat

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.980
or to habanero pepper, they only respond

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.980
to the particular thing that
evokes the electrical response.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.930
I should say that they only respond

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.320
to the particular stimulus, the pepper,

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.840
the cold, the heat, et cetera,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.490
that will evoke an electrical signal,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.070
but the electrical signals
are a common language

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.380
that all neurons use.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.110
And yet, if something cold
is presented to your skin,

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.410
like an ice cube, even if
you don't see that ice cube,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.770
if your eyes are closed, or
someone comes up behind you

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.500
and puts an ice cube
against your bare skin back,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.960
you know that that sensation,
that thing is cold.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.553
You don't misperceive it as
heat or as a habanero pepper.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.370
So that's amazing.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.680
What that means is that
there must be another element

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.920
in the equation of what
creates pleasure or pain.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.720
And that element is your brain.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.500
Your brain takes these electrical signals

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.950
and interprets them.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.780
Partially based on experience,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.650
but also there are some
innate meaning some hard wired

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.610
aspects of pain and pleasure sensing

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.910
that require no experience whatsoever.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.440
A child doesn't have to fall down but once

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.200
to know on that first fall, that hurt.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.400
They don't have to touch a flame,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.960
but once and the very first
time they will withdraw

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.920
their hand from the flame.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.560
So no prior experiences required.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.200
Other things prior experience is required.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.480
For instance, if you're somebody that has

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.940
an intense, intense
aversion to spicy foods,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.440
that's probably because you've
tasted spicy foods before.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.070
Likewise, if you really like sweet foods,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.460
it's probably because
you've tasted them before.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.770
So you can start to make predictions

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.960
based on prior experience,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.290
but the pain and pleasure system

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.600
don't need prior experience.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.660
What they need is a
brain that can interpret

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.700
these electrical signals

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.110
that can take these electrical
signals and somehow create

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.160
what we call pleasure
and pain out of them.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.750
So what parts of the brain?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.310
Well, mainly it's the
so-called somatosensory cortex.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.740
The portion of our neocortex,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.743
which is on the outside of our brain,

00:19:29.743 --> 00:19:31.980
that kind of bumpy part, not kind of

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.900
if you have a normally formed
brain, it will be bumpy.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.010
If you have a smooth
brain that's not good.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.740
Some animals just have a smooth brain.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.715
Humans have a bumpy brain,

00:19:39.715 --> 00:19:41.347
which means it has a
very large surface area.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:44.210
And those bumps are 'cause
you squeezed it like a pizza

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.820
and clump and you bunched it all up

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.480
and put inside the skull.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.313
That's good.

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:49.990
That means you have a lot of neurons.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.310
And in your somatosensory cortex,

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.690
you have a map of your
entire body surface.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.650
That map is called a homunculus.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.900
And if we were to take your cortex

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.550
and lay it out on a table,

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.380
I've actually done this with the cortices

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.070
of various animals and humans included.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.090
What you would find is that
there's literally a map

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.199
of your entire body surface.

00:20:12.199 --> 00:20:15.010
But it wouldn't look exactly like you,

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.113
this map would be very distorted.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.360
Why would it be distorted?

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.690
Well, certain areas of your body

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.980
have a much denser
innervation as we call it,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.920
or put simply many more
of these sensory wires

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.300
from these DRGs within your skin.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.670
So this map of you that
exists in your brain,

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.310
and you do have one of these
on each side of your brain,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.670
so you have two of
these maps to homunculi,

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.390
that is you, it's your
representation of touch

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.230
including pleasure and pain.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.730
And in that map, your lips are enormous.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.740
And your back is very, very small.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.430
And the area around your eyes

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.450
and the area representing your
face is absolutely enormous.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.440
So you would look like some
sort of odd, weird clay doll

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.430
from some sort of bizarre
late night animation thing.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.400
And just imagine the
psychedelic experience of that

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.500
character of you and that's
what it would look like.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.560
But it's not randomly organized.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.240
To the contrary, it's highly organized

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.090
in a very particular way,

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.580
which is that the areas of your skin

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.990
that have the highest density
of the sensory receptors

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.680
are magnified in your brain.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.720
So it's sort of like having more pixels

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.860
in a certain part of a camera than others,

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.940
and in doing that
allowing higher resolution

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.500
in this case of touch, not a vision,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.390
but of touch sensation in
certain parts of your body.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.380
What are the areas that are magnified?

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.610
Well, the lips, the face,
the tips of the fingers,

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.130
the feet, and the genitals.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.460
And so this map of you
has very large lips, face,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.310
tips of fingers, bottoms
of feet, and genitals.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.890
And that's because the innervation,

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.210
the number of wires that go
into those regions of your body

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.330
far exceeds the number of
wires for sensation of touch

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.430
that go to other areas of your body.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.510
You can actually experience
this in real time right now

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.460
by doing a simple experiment that we call

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.440
two-point discrimination.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.030
Two-points discrimination is your ability

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.410
to know whether or not
two points of pressure

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.920
are far apart, near each other,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.270
or you actually could perceive incorrectly

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.370
as one point of pressure.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.660
You might want a second
person to do this experiment.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.640
Here's how you would do it.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.960
You will close your eyes,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.450
that person would take two fine points.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.810
Don't make them too sharp, please.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.800
So it could be two pencils
or pens or the backs of pens.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.210
Two pens I'm holding in my hands.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.300
If you're just listening to
this, I'm just holding two pens.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.140
My favorite pens, these
pilot, V5 or V7, which I love.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.200
If you were to close your eyes

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.610
and I were to take these two pens

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.760
and put their points close
together about a centimeter apart

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.680
and present them to the top of your hand,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.410
I'm going to just going
to do that now to myself.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.210
You, even though your eyes were closed,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.520
you would be able to perceive
that that was two points

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.740
of pressure presented simultaneously

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.300
to the top of your hand.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.920
However, if I were to do this
to the middle of your back,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.680
you would not experience them
as two points of pressure.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.100
You would experience them as
one single point of pressure.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.900
In other words, your two point
discrimination is better,

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.890
is higher on areas of your body

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.750
which have many, many
more sensory receptors.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.289
You are more sensitive at those locations.

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:39.070
Now this makes perfect
sense once you experience it

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.470
or you hear about it.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.810
However, most of us
don't really appreciate

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.430
how important and what a
profound influence this change

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.060
in density of receptors
across our body surface has.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.640
And we can go a step further
and describe another feature

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.290
of the way that you're built and the way

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.060
that you experience pleasure and pain,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.160
which is called the dermatome.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.890
The dermatome is literally the way

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.230
in which your body surface is carved up

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.200
into different territories.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.900
Much like a map of the
United States is carved up

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.940
into different territories

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.240
of states and counties, et cetera.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.040
The dermatome is the way in which neurons

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.530
connect to different parts of your body.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.530
Now, you've actually experienced
the dermatome before.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.150
The dermatome is when you have a neuron

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.570
that connects to a
particular area of the body

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.730
and that neuron doesn't just
send one little wire out

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.960
like one little line
and go up into the skin

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.950
to detect mechanical, or
thermal, or chemical stimuli.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.800
It actually sends many
branches out like a tree.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.100
But remember those
branches of the tree come

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.470
from one single neuron.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.800
Now, occasionally what will
happen is you will experience

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.740
something like cold, or
heat, or pain, or tingling

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.690
on a patch of your body.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.830
And occasionally that patch
of body will actually have

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.450
a very cleanly demarcated boundary,

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.060
a very stark boundary
with the areas around it.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.570
A good example of this would
be the herpes simplex 1 virus,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.369
which if one has this virus,

00:25:07.369 --> 00:25:10.690
and I should mention that
somewhere between 80 and 90%

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.160
of people have this virus,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.130
this is not a sexually transmitted virus.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.880
This is a virus is transmitted
very easily between people

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.700
through various forms of
contact non-sexual contact,

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.880
it's present in children,
it's present in adults

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.230
and most people get it, some
get symptoms and some don't

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.130
some get recurring symptoms, some don't.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.720
We can talk about that
at the end, if you like,

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.490
but this virus lives on what's called

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.190
the fifth cranial nerve also
called the trigeminal nerve.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.580
The trigeminal nerve sends
branches out to the lips,

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.090
to the eyes, and to certain
portions of the face.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.130
So for those of you listening,

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.850
I've just kind of put my
right hand across my face

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.270
and to sort of simulate
the three branches,

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.540
the trigeminal aspect of this nerve.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.200
So tri three.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.910
Now, when the herpes virus
flares up, as they say,

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.950
in response to stress or other factors,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.450
the virus inflames that nerve

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.990
and people experience tingling
and pain on the nerve.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.230
Sometimes they'll get a
cold sore or a blister

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.890
on their lip or near their mouth,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.590
sometimes they'll get
a collection of those.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.890
And that's because that
dermatome is actually inflamed.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.800
Now other people will experience
something like shingles.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.720
It's a fairly common viral infection.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.890
And what they'll notice
is they'll get a rash

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.900
that has a boundary.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.330
It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.230
sometimes blisters, and
it'll have a sharp boundary.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.900
That boundary exists because
the virus exists on the nerve.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.090
And so it actually is boundaried

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.450
with the neighboring area of the body

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.750
that's receiving input from another nerve

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.210
and that one doesn't have
the virus living on it.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:53.180
So anytime you see a rash or
a pattern on the body surface

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.710
on the skin that has a
pretty stark boundary,

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.350
chances are that's an event
that's impacting the dermatome.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.780
I've experienced this before

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.130
then not through herpes simplex,

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:07.650
but through the experience
of having a lot of blood

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.900
sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.730
across the front of my
face, it was really bizarre.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.440
I looked in the mirror and I
thought, what is going on here?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.450
I was having an allergic
reaction to something I'd eaten.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.890
And that allergic reaction
clearly was affecting one

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.850
of the nerves and therefore the dermatome

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.190
and what it showed up was,

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.930
it was almost like someone
had drawn lines on my face

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.130
that said, okay, this rash
or this reaction rather

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.500
can happen here, but not in
a region right next to it.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.400
Whenever you see that chances are

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.810
it's a reaction of the
nerves of the dermatome.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.110
So you'll start to see
these things more and more

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.392
when you start to look for them.

00:27:41.392 --> 00:27:43.380
You don't always have to
have a viral infection

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.213
to experience this.

00:27:44.213 --> 00:27:46.150
Sometimes you'll just experience tingling

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.020
or even a pleasant sensation,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.320
and it will be restricted
in kind of a strict boundary

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.500
on one location or your body
surface and not another.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.300
Not corresponding to an organ like,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.640
okay, this arm or just your
feet or something like that.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.730
But just a segment.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.060
It's almost like someone
outlined a particular area

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.210
of her body surface.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.810
That's the dermatome.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.064
So you've got sensors in the skin

00:28:10.064 --> 00:28:12.690
and you've got a brain
that's going to interpret

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.010
what's going on with those sensors.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.170
In fact, we can take an
example of a sudden rash

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.770
or inflammation at one
location, the dermatome,

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.120
and we can ask what would make it hurt?

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.960
What would make it worse?

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.830
What would make it go away?

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.210
And believe it or not, your
subjective interpretation

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.700
of what's happening has
a profound influence

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.070
on your experience of pleasure or pain.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.180
There are several things that
can impact these experiences,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.860
but the main categories are expectation.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.900
So sort of whether or not
you thought or could expect

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.640
that this thing was
going to happen, right?

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.540
If someone tells you
this is going to hurt,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.280
I'm going to give you
an injection right here,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.600
it might hurt for a second.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.520
That's very different and
your experience of that pain

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.470
will be very different than
if it happened suddenly

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.950
out of the blue.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.870
There's also anxiety, how anxious,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:07.290
or how high or low your level
of arousal, autonomic arousal,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.600
that's going to impact your
experience of pleasure or pain.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.870
How well you slept and where you are

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.563
in the so-called circadian
or 24-hour cycle.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.400
Our ability to tolerate
pain changes dramatically

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.200
across the 24-hour cycle.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.470
And as you can imagine is
during the daylight waking hours

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.770
that we are better able to tolerate,

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.040
we are more resilient to pain,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.980
and we are better able
to experience pleasure.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.970
At night our threshold
for pain is much lower.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.220
In other words, the amount of mechanical

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.980
or chemical or thermal
meaning temperature stimulated

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.830
that can evoke a pain response
and how we rate that response

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.130
is much lower at night.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.370
And in particular, in the hours
between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM,

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.120
if you're on a kind of
standard circadian schedule.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.850
And then the last one is our genes.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:07.210
Pain threshold and how
long a pain response lasts

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.490
is in part dictated by our genes.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.540
And later I'm going to discuss this myth

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.200
or whether or not it's really a myth

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.330
as to whether or not certain
people in particular red heads,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:22.603
people who have reg
pigmented hair and fair skin,

00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:24.970
whether or not their
pain thresholds differ.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.500
And to just give you a
little sneak peek into that,

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.281
indeed they do and it's
because of a genetic difference

00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:33.780
in a particular gene, in a
particular pattern of receptors

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.460
in the skin that are
related to the pigmentation

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.090
of hair and skin.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.430
So we have expectation,
anxiety, how well we've slept,

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.300
where we are in the so-called
24-hour circadian time

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.863
and our genes.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.660
So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.920
because those two factors
can powerfully modulate

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.200
our experience of both pleasure and pain

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.200
in ways that will allow us to
dial up pleasure if we like

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.340
and to dial down pain, if indeed
that's what we want to do.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.840
So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.659
because those two things
are somewhat tethered.

00:31:12.659 --> 00:31:15.470
There are now a number
of solid experiments,

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.570
both in animal models and in humans

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.310
that point to the fact that
if we know a painful stimulus

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.490
is coming, that we can better
prepare for it mentally

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:30.480
and therefore buffer or
reduce the pain response.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.150
However, the timing in which
that anticipation occurs

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.610
is vital for this to happen.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.030
And if that timing isn't quite right,

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.630
it actually can make the
experience of pain far worse.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.780
So here I'm summarizing a
large amount of literature,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.490
but essentially if subjects are warned

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.830
that a painful stimulus is coming,

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:56.830
their subjective experience of
that pain is vastly reduced.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.250
However, if they are
warned just two seconds

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.530
before that pain arrives,
it does not help.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.130
It actually makes it worse.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.320
And the reason is they
can't do anything mentally

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.283
to prepare for it in that
brief two second window.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.900
Similarly, if they are warned
about pain that's coming

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.670
two minutes before a
painful stimulus is coming

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.630
electric shock or a poke or
cold stimulus or heat stimulus

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.950
that's pretty extreme,
that also makes it worse

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.090
because their expectation
ramps up the autonomic arousal.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.620
The level of alertness
is all funneled toward

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.690
that negative experience that's coming.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:40.680
So how soon before a painful stimulus

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.160
should we know about it if the goal is

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.910
to reduce our level of pain?

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.720
And the answer is somewhere
between 20 seconds

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.070
and 40 seconds is about right.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.700
Now, I'm averaging across a
number of different studies,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.770
but if you have about
20 seconds or 40 seconds

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.130
advance warning that
something bad is coming,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.260
you can prepare yourself for that,

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.249
but the preparation itself and the arousal

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:07.070
that comes with it,
the kind of leaning in,

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.480
okay, I'm either going to relax myself

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.830
or I'm going to really
kind of dig my heels in

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.303
and kind of meet the pain head on.

00:33:14.303 --> 00:33:16.660
That seems to be the optimal window.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.390
This can come and useful
in a variety of contexts,

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:23.320
but I think it's important
because what it illustrates

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.430
is that it absolutely cannot
be just the pattern of signals

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.550
that are arriving from
the skin, from these DRGs,

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.520
these neurons that connect to skin

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.850
that dictates our experience
of pain or pleasure.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:40.440
There has to be a subjective
interpretation component,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.990
and indeed that's the case.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:46.300
So let's talk about the
range of pain experiences.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.130
And from that, we will understand better

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.383
what the range of pleasure experiences are

00:33:50.383 --> 00:33:53.300
that different people have
because we are all different

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.100
in terms of our pain threshold.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.220
First of all, what is pain threshold?

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.390
Pain threshold has two dimensions.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:04.390
The first dimension is the
amount of mechanical or chemical

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.840
or thermal stimulation
that it takes for you or me

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.350
or somebody else to say,
I can't take that anymore.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.620
I'm done.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.190
But there's another element as well

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.120
which is how long the pain persists.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.390
I'll just describe myself for example,

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.160
I don't consider myself somebody

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.530
who has a particularly
high pain threshold.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.240
I don't think it's
particularly low either,

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.660
but I wouldn't consider myself somebody

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.310
that has a particularly
high pain threshold.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.970
When I stubbed my toe against
the corner of the bed,

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:32.860
it absolutely hurts.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.130
But one thing that I've noticed is

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.390
that I have very sharp
inflections, very high inflections

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.460
in my perception of pain, and
then they go away quickly.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.940
I don't know if that's adaptive or not.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.170
It's probably not,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:48.430
but my experience of pain is
very intense, but very brief.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.110
Other people experience pain in a much

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.690
kind of slower rising,
but longer-lasting manner.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:57.760
And to just really point
out how varied we all are

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.700
in terms of our experience of pain,

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.920
let's look to an experiment.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.620
There been experiments done
at Stanford School of Medicine

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.770
and elsewhere, which
involved having subjects

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.910
put their hand into a
very cold vat of water

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.450
and measuring the amount of time

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.320
that they kept their hand in that water.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.990
And then they would tell the
experimenter very quietly,

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.990
how painful that particular stimulus was

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.540
on a scale of one to 10
so-called Likert scale

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.833
for your aficionados.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.730
That simple experiment
revealed that people experience

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.130
the same thermal in this
case, cold stimulus,

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.470
vastly different.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.280
Some people would rate it as
a 10 out of 10 extreme pain.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.040
Other people would rate it
as barely painful at all,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.890
like a one.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.380
Other people, a three other
people, a five, et cetera.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.300
Now what's interesting is
that the same thing is true

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.590
for experience of a hot, painful stimulus

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.474
120 degree hot plate, where you
have to put your hand on it,

00:35:56.474 --> 00:35:58.790
and then at some point
you remove your hand.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.739
Some people are able to keep their hand

00:35:59.739 --> 00:36:03.840
on there the whole time, but
people rate that experience

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.700
as very painful, a little bit painful

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.100
or moderately painful
depending on who they are.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.780
Now, that's interesting,

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.390
probably not that surprising, however,

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.130
but what is very interesting is that

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.720
when the same experiment
was done on medical doctors

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.680
or medical doctors in training,

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.550
they too of course experienced pain

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.250
through a range of subjective experiences.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.050
Some of them just like any
other person off the street

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.810
said a particular stimulus
of a particular temperature

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.817
was very painful, other said
it wasn't painful at all

00:36:35.817 --> 00:36:38.450
and some said it was moderately painful.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.630
And that turns out to be vitally important

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.130
for the treatment of pain

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.870
because pain is not an event in the skin.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.230
Pain is a subjective,
emotional experience.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.917
You may have heard that we
have a particular category

00:36:51.917 --> 00:36:54.440
of these DRGs that innervate the skin,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.562
which are called nociceptors.

00:36:56.562 --> 00:37:01.090
Nociceptor comes from the word
noci, nocere I believe it is,

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.690
which means to harm.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.160
However, nociceptors don't
carry information about pain,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.070
they carry information about
particular types of stimuli

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.490
impacting the skin.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.150
And then the brain assigns
a value of valence to it,

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.530
a label and says that's painful.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.910
And where people draw the
line between not painful

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.450
and painful varies.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.210
Now, because physicians are people

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.620
and because physicians treat pain,

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.240
what we know from a lot of data
now is that if someone comes

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.990
into the clinic and says they're
experiencing chronic pain

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.600
or whole body pain or
acute pain after an injury

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.330
or one location, it doesn't
really matter what the cause is

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.203
or even if there's a cause at all,

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.620
how the doctor reacts to that
report of the patient's pain

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.490
will dictate in many cases
the course of treatment.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.590
And of course doctors, their
goal is to treat the patient

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.740
to going to the patient's
needs, not their own.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.020
And that's what good doctors do.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.480
However, it's been found and
I think now there is work

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.320
being done to try and change this,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.570
but if a doctor has a very
high threshold for pain,

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.270
their interpretation of
somebody else's report of pain

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.300
is going to be different.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.680
They might not discount
the patient, right?

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.650
This doesn't necessarily
mean that they think, oh,

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.870
this person their pain is
irrelevant, probably not.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.580
In fact, from having a
high threshold for pain,

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.390
if someone comes in and
says, I'm in extreme pain,

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.690
that doctor probably thinks,

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.240
wow, this has to be
really, really extreme,

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.830
but they can be talking about
two different experiences.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.440
Similarly, if a physician has
a very low threshold for pain,

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.063
and someone comes in and says,

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:41.210
yeah, I'm experiencing
some pain in my back.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.460
I've got the sciatica thing, but yeah,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.850
it's a little bit uncomfortable.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.590
It's like a, I don't know
like a four out of 10.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.720
Well, that physician might
interpret that four out of 10

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.200
as a pretty extreme sense of pain

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.220
or pretty extreme experience of pain.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.990
And so you can start to see
how the subjective nature

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.760
of pain can start to have real impact

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.180
on the treatment of pain
because treatment of pain

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.760
is carried out by physicians.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.960
In fact, there is no
objective measure of pain.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.820
We can ask how long
somebody can keep their hand

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.840
on a hot plate or in a cold bath.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.213
You can do various experiments.

00:39:15.213 --> 00:39:17.490
They even have some extreme experiments

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.220
where they'll shave a portion of the leg

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.820
and they'll put on a very
painful chemical compound

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.510
and see how long people can tolerate that.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.460
These are very uncomfortable
experiments as you can imagine,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.350
but in general, we don't have a way

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:34.070
of measuring somebody else's
subjective experience of pain.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.810
There is no blood pressure measure.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:38.601
There's no heart rate beats
per minute measure of pain.

00:39:38.601 --> 00:39:41.760
So one of the great
efforts of neuroscience

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.910
and of medicine is to try and come up

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.963
with more objective measures of pain.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.260
Similarly, pleasure is something
that we all talk about.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.540
Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.040
or more of that please or less of that,

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.050
but we have no way of
gauging what other people

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.920
are experiencing except what
they report through language.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.030
And so this is really just to illustrate

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.690
that this whole thing around
pain isn't a black box.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.900
We do have an understanding
of the elements.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.740
There are elements in the skin,

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.870
there's elements of the brain,

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.570
there's expectation,
anxiety, sleep, and genes,

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.440
but that it is very complicated.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.290
And yet there are certain principles

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.770
that fall out of that complicated picture

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.490
that can allow us to better
understand and navigate

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.560
this axis that we call
the pleasure-pain axis.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.840
So rather than focus on just
the subjective nature of pain,

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.270
let's talk about the
absolute qualities of pain

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.100
and the absolute qualities of pleasure

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.680
so that we can learn how to
navigate those two experiences

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.033
in ways that serve us each better.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.790
First of all, I want to
talk about heat and cold.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.520
We do indeed have sensors in our skin

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.540
that respond to heat and cold.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:52.090
And for any of you that
have entered a cold shower

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:56.950
or a cold body of water of any
kind or ice bath, et cetera,

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:01.400
you will realize that getting
into cold is much harder

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.240
if you do it slowly.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.940
Now, despite that people
tend to do it very slowly.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.420
I have noticed an enormous
variation with which people

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.450
can embrace the experience of cold.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.430
I noticed it because I do
some work with athletes

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:17.650
and I do some work with military

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.510
and I do some work with
the general public.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.940
And one of the best tests of
how somebody can handle pain

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.210
is to ask them to just
get into an ice bath.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.010
It's not a very sophisticated experience,

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.320
but it really gets into the
core of the kind of circuitry

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.403
that we're talking about, both
in the skin and in the brain.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.860
Some people regardless of
sex, regardless of age,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.890
and regardless of physical ability

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.783
can just get into the cold.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:46.860
They're somehow able to do it.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.840
Now, I don't know what their
experience of the cold is.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.673
And neither do you.

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.245
You only know your experience,

00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:53.400
but they're able to do that.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.010
Some do it quickly, some do it slowly.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.580
Others find the experience
of cold to be so aversive

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.830
that they somehow cannot
get themselves in.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.490
They start quaking, they start complaining

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.860
and many of them just simply get out.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.693
They can't do it.

00:42:07.693 --> 00:42:09.880
Some don't even get in past their knees.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.080
This isn't necessarily
about pain threshold,

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.523
but it's related to that.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.060
I think it can be helpful
to everyone to know

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.440
that even though it feels
better at a mental level

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.460
to get into the cold
slowly and people ask, oh,

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.211
I just want to get in slowly,
I want to take my time.

00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:27.960
It is actually much worse

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.320
from a neuro-biological perspective.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.870
The neurons that sense cold respond

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.310
to what are called relative
drops in temperature.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:39.820
So it's not about the absolute
temperature of the water.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.530
It's about the relative
change in temperature.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.300
So as you move from a
particular temperature,

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.360
whether or not it's in the
air next to an ice bath

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.350
or cold shower, or from a
body of water that's warm

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.170
to a body of water that's colder,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.755
or sometimes in the ocean,
you'll notice it's warm.

00:42:54.755 --> 00:42:56.690
And then as you swim out further,

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.330
you'll get into a pocket of
water where it's much colder.

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.370
That's when the cold receptors
in your skin start firing

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.800
and sending signals up to your brain.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.210
Therefore, you can bypass
these signals going up

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.450
to the brain with each relative
change one degree change,

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.620
two degrees change, et cetera,

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.140
by simply getting in all at once.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.940
In fact it is true and maybe
you've been told this before,

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.510
and it is true that if
you get into cold water

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.930
up to your neck,

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.370
it's actually much more comfortable

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.410
than if you're halfway in and halfway out.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.810
And that's because of the
difference in the signals

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.950
that are being sent
from the cold receptors

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:32.910
on your upper torso,

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.000
which is out of the water
in your lower torso.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.310
Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:38.470
to mean that they should just jump

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.830
into an unknown body of water.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.950
There are all sorts of
factors like currents,

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.340
and if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.290
You can stop the heart.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.830
People can have heart attacks from getting

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:51.830
into extremely cold water,
like a melted mountain stream

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.690
that's been frozen all winter,

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:57.490
or has been very, very cold or
as a snow pack going into it.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.630
If very cold, you can
indeed have a heart attack.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.290
So please be smart about
how cold and what bodies

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.630
of cold water you happen
to put yourself into.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.150
But it is absolutely true
that provided it safe,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.220
getting into a cold water
is always going to be easier

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.400
to do quickly and is going to be easier

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.070
to do up to your neck.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.010
In fact, you actually want to
get your shoulders submerged.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.690
There are a number of
other things you can do

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.410
if you really want and it's safe to do.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.530
You can put your face under and activate

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.920
the so-called dive reflex,
which also makes the tolerance

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.000
of cold easier believe it or not.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.210
So it's very counterintuitive.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.540
It's like getting into water
faster and more completely

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.720
you will experience as less
uncomfortable, less cold.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.340
And indeed that's the case.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.630
And that's because these cold receptors

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.870
are measuring every relative
drop in temperature.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.380
So every single one is
graded as we say in biology,

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.783
it's not absolute.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.360
As an additional point, if
you're sitting in a body

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.400
of cold water and it's not circulating,

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.090
you'll notice that you start
to warm up a little bit.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.490
Or even if you feel like
you're freezing cold,

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.870
if you move and that water
around you moves, of course,

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.910
then you'll notice it's got even colder.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.500
And that's because
there's a thermal layer.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.270
You're actually heating up the water

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.270
that surrounds your body

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.880
like a halo around every
aspect of your body.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.780
A sort of silhouette of you of heat

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.100
where you're heating that water.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.820
When you move, you disrupt
that thermal layer.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.100
Now heat is the opposite.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.290
Heat and the heat receptors in your skin

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:26.860
respond to absolute
changes in temperature.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.400
And this is probably because our body

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.100
and our brain can tolerate
drops in temperature

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.788
much better than it can tolerate

00:45:33.788 --> 00:45:36.580
increases in temperature safely.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.250
So when you move from say a
standard outdoor environment,

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.110
I mean, here in the States

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.710
we measure in terms of Fahrenheit.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:46.150
So maybe it's a 75 or an 80
degree, or even 90 degree day,

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:48.780
and you get into a 100 degrees sauna,

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.700
or if you're in a cool
air conditioned building

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.340
and you go outside and
it's very warm outside,

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.450
you sort of feel like the heat
hits you all at once, boom.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.730
Hits you all at once, kind
of like a slap in the face,

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.650
but then it will just stay at that level.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:05.500
Your body will acclimate to
that particular temperature.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.370
However, if that temperature
is very, very high,

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.100
you'll notice that your
experience of that heat

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.640
and your experience of
kind of pain and discomfort

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.110
and your desire to get out of that heat

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.250
will tend to persist.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.570
You don't really adapt in the same way.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.230
And certain people who are really good

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.620
at handling very hot
sauna, get better at this.

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.140
You learned to calm your
breathing, et cetera,

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.210
lower your autonomic arousal.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.950
Obviously you don't want to
let your body temperature

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.670
go too high because
neurons cook, they die.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:35.660
If neurons die, they don't
come back and that's bad.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.360
Many people unfortunately harm
themselves with hyperthermia.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.570
Everyone has a different threshold
for this, but in general,

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.640
you don't want your body
temperature to go up too high.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.720
That's why a fever of like 103 starts

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.450
to become worrisome 104.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.940
You really get concerned if and it goes

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.490
up into that range or higher,

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.610
that's when you need to
really cool down the body

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.913
or get to hospital so
they can cool you down.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.410
Heat is measured in absolute
terms by the neurons.

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:05.620
So gradually moving into heat makes sense,

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.870
and finding that threshold,

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.980
which is safe and comfortable for you,

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.180
or if it's uncomfortable,

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.680
at least resides within
that realm of safety.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.000
So that's heat and cold,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.220
and those are sort of non-negotiables.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.630
You can try and lower
your level of arousal.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.797
In fact, many people who
get into a cold shower

00:47:21.797 --> 00:47:23.770
and ice bath I think the recommendation

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.620
that I always give is that

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.890
you have two possible approaches to that.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:29.590
You can either try and relax yourself,

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.590
kind of just stay calm within the cold,

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.780
or you can lean into it.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.820
You can actually take mental steps

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.760
to generate more adrenaline

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.950
to kind of meet the demands of that cold.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.960
And at some point we'll
do a whole episode on

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.780
how to use cold and heat
to certain advantages

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.590
we've done a little bit
of this in past episodes

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.050
using the cold to
supercharge human performance

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.270
and things of that sort.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.671
But in general, cold is
measured in relative terms.

00:47:57.671 --> 00:48:00.828
And therefore getting in all
at once is a good idea provided

00:48:00.828 --> 00:48:02.100
you can do it safely.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.760
And heat is measured in absolute levels

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.360
by your brain and body and therefore

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.100
you want to actually
move into it gradually.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.350
So it's the kind of the inverse
of what you might think.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.650
One of the most important
things to understand

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.430
about the experience of pain
and to really illustrate

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.312
just how subjective pain really is,

00:48:19.312 --> 00:48:23.490
is that our experience of
pain and the degree of damage

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.960
to our body are not always correlated.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.400
And in fact, sometimes can
be in opposite directions.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.820
A good example of this would be x-rays.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.440
We all occasionally get
x-rays at least in the US

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.930
we get x-rays when we go to
the dentist from time to time,

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.280
and the occasional x-ray might be safe

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.380
depending on who you are

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.440
provide you're not pregnant, et cetera.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.445
I've gone to the dentist.

00:48:43.445 --> 00:48:44.278
They put you in the chair,

00:48:44.278 --> 00:48:45.770
they cover you with the lead blanket,

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:49.840
and then they run behind the
screen to protect themselves.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.760
And they beam me with the
x-rays to get a picture

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.580
of your teeth and your jaws
and your skull, et cetera.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.320
Well, if you were to get too many x-rays,

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.400
you could severely damage
the tissues of your body,

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.803
but you don't experience any
pain during the x-ray itself.

00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:09.679
In contrast, you can think
that your body is damaged

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.790
and experienced extreme pain

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.750
and yet your body can have no damage.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.870
A classic example of this was published

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:20.880
in the British Journal of Medicine,

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.110
in which a construction worker fell from

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.480
I think it was a second
story, which he was working

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:32.030
and a nail went up and through his boot

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:35.340
and he looked down and
he saw the nail going

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:40.340
through his boot and he was
in absolute excruciating pain.

00:49:40.497 --> 00:49:44.160
They took him to the hospital
and because the nail was

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.380
so long and because of
where it had entered,

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.610
it exited the boot, they
had to cut away the boot

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.200
in order to get to the nail.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.280
And when they did that,

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.130
they revealed that the nail had passed

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.880
between two of his toes.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.880
It had actually failed to
impale his body in any way.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.930
And yet the view, the
perception of that nail

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.010
entering his boot at one
end and exiting the boot

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.420
at the other was sufficient
to create the experience

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.360
of a nail that had gone through his foot.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.640
And the moment he realized
that that nail had not gone

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.800
through his foot, the pain
completely evaporated.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.020
And this has been
demonstrated numerous times.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.610
People that work in emergency rooms

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.160
actually see variations on this.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.050
Not always that extreme,

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:32.410
but many times what we see
and how we perceive that wound

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.940
or that event has a profound influence

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.650
on how we experience pain.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.950
And I mentioned this,
not just because it's a

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.190
kind of sensational and fantastic example

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:43.630
of this extreme,
subjective nature of pain,

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.320
but also because it brings
us back to this element

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.560
which is, we don't know
how other people feel.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.776
Not just about pain, but about pleasure.

00:50:51.776 --> 00:50:55.330
We think we do, we have some general sense

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:56.750
of whether or not an event ought

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.830
to be painful or pleasurable,

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.990
but actually we barely
understand how we feel

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.690
let alone how other people feel,

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:07.300
and we can be badly
wrong about how we feel

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.050
meaning we can misinterpret
our own sense of pain

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:13.920
or our own sense of pleasure
depending on what we see

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.390
with our eyes and what
we hear with our ears.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:21.000
So we hear a scream like a shrill scream,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.860
and we think it must be pain.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.930
And if we look at something
that's happening to somebody

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:28.510
and it fits a prior category
or a prior representation

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:31.170
of what we would consider
painful stimulus,

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:34.250
well, then we think that
they're an extreme pain,

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.660
but actually they might
not be in pain at all.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.320
Now this highly subjective nature of pain

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.650
and the way in which we
use our visual system

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:45.080
to interpret other people's
pain and our own pain

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.410
has actually been leveraged
to treat a very extreme form

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.890
of chronic pain.

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.140
And it's an absolutely fascinating area

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.690
of biology and neuroscience.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:57.260
And it's one that we can
actually all leverage

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.060
toward reducing our own levels of pain

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.410
whenever we are injured.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:04.620
Or believe it or not,
even in chronic pain.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.730
To describe this area of science requires

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.870
a kind of extreme example,

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.420
but I want to be clear that
even if you don't suffer

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.570
from this extreme example,

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.333
there's relevance and a
tool to extract for you.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.910
The extreme example is
that of an amputated digit,

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.740
meaning one of your fingers or your toes,

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.030
or of an amputated limb.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:31.030
So people that have digits or
limbs that are gone missing

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.830
from an injury or surgical removal,

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.830
will often have the experience
that it's still there.

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:41.140
The so-called phantom limb phenomenon.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.750
Now, why would that be?

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:47.671
Well, when you remove a
particular finger or limb,

00:52:47.671 --> 00:52:50.240
obviously that finger and limb is gone

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.650
and the dorsal root ganglion neuron

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:54.980
that would normally send a wire out

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.180
to that particular region of the body,

00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.560
that wire is no longer
there because that portion

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.860
of the body is no longer there.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.540
And in some cases, those neurons die

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.870
almost always, but not always.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.650
However, the map your
so-called homunculus,

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:13.373
your representation of yourself
in the brain is still there.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.670
And this map, the so-called homunculus map

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.540
that you have in that
I have is very plastic.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.630
It can change.

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:24.890
And so as a consequence areas of the map

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:26.720
that adjacent to one another

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:31.340
can actually start to invade
other areas of the map.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.890
So for instance, there
are neuroimaging studies

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.660
that have documented that somebody

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.833
that has say a complete
removal of their left arm,

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.240
the representation of
their left arm still exists

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.900
in the cortex.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.990
And experimentally if one is to stimulate

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:52.210
that area of the cortex, that person,

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:53.660
and if that person were you,

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.930
would experience having that arm

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.100
that it were being stimulated,
even though it's not there.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.520
Now, someone who has an
amputated arm doesn't need

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.330
to have their brain stimulated

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.000
in order to have the experience

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.960
of that phantom limb being present.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.990
In fact, many people who have
limbs that were amputated

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.650
feel as if that limb is still present

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.540
even though obviously it's not.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.150
And no matter how many
times they look to the stump

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:21.860
and just see a stump,
somehow it doesn't reorganize

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.093
that homunculus so-called
central brain map.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.600
Now, that would be fine.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.920
You might even think that would be better,

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.940
better to think you have the arm there

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.110
than to feel as if it's missing,

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.380
and yet many people who
have amputated limbs

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.220
report phantom limb pain.

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.450
They don't feel that the arm

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.540
is just casually draped next to them.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.590
They feel as if it's bunched
up and it's an extreme pain.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:49.500
In fact, this kind of contorted stance

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.980
that I'm taking right here in my chair

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.270
is not unlike the way that
these patients described this.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:55.280
They feel as if it's kind of cramped up,

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.660
it's very uncomfortable for them.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.410
Now, and absolutely creative

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.330
and you could even say genius scientists

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.830
by the name of Ramachandra.

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:07.700
That's actually his last name,

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.970
his complete name is a
little bit more complicated.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:13.450
So you all almost always hear
Ramachandran referred to as

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:16.800
Ramachandran or V.S Ramachandran
because his full name

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.870
is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.360
So a lot of letters in
there, a lot of vowels,

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.990
but Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.350
He was actually a colleague of mine

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:29.910
when my lab was formerly

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.060
at the University of
California, San Diego.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.770
Has done a lot of work on
this phantom limb phenomenon.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.490
And Ramachandra actually started
off as a vision scientist.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.620
And he understood the
power of the visual system

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.810
in dictating our experience

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:44.520
of things like pain and pleasure.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.490
And so what he developed
was a very low technology

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:52.060
yet neuroscientifically
sophisticated treatment

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.850
for phantom limb.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.270
It consisted of a box, literally a box

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.460
that had mirrors inside of it.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:03.350
And the patient would put
the intact hand or limb

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:05.040
into one side,

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.340
and obviously they couldn't
put the amputated limb

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.370
into the other side, but
because of the configuration

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:12.100
of the mirrors, it
appeared as though they had

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.480
two symmetric limbs inside the box.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.440
And then he would have
them look at that limb

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.260
and move it around.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.640
And as they would do this,

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.110
they would report real time movement,

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.510
or I should say real time
perception of movement

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.140
in the phantom limb.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.750
Now this is absolutely
incredible but makes total sense

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.010
when you think about
the so-called top down

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.470
or contextual modulation
of our sensory experience,

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:39.990
remember it's anticipation, it's anxiety,

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:42.270
it's interpretation of what's happening

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:45.400
that drives our perception
of what's happening.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.700
And so, as he would have these patients

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.200
move their intact limb to
a more relaxed position,

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.180
the patients would feel

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.190
as if the phantom limb were relaxing.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:59.160
And this was used successfully
to treat phantom limb pain

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.040
in a number of different people.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.240
It didn't always work.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.270
And you can imagine sometimes

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:05.010
it might be a little
trickier like for a leg

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:09.470
although there have been leg
boxes that have been developed

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:11.510
and arranged for this purpose.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:13.830
And what was remarkable
is that they could finish

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.670
these experiments and have
the patient, the person

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:19.520
enter a state of relaxation,

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.260
reduced the pain in the phantom limb,

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.220
and it would stay there
even though, of course,

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:26.010
as they exited the mirror box,

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:28.410
they would go about their
life and use their intact limb

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.640
for its various purposes.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.680
I love this experiment
because it really speaks

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.510
to the subjective nature
of pain and pleasure.

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:37.530
It speaks to the power
of the visual system,

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.300
like what we see just like the nail

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.270
through the boot experiment.

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:44.370
What we see profoundly
impacts our experience

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.150
of pleasure and pain in this case pain.

00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:52.070
Now, there's another aspect
to the phantom limb experience

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:54.790
and of these maps, the
so-called homunculus maps

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.870
in the cortex that Ramachandran worked on,

00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:01.060
which has very interesting
and reveals the degree

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.880
to which these maps are
plastic or can change

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.450
in response to experience.

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:10.570
Turns out that because of the locations

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:14.910
of different body part
representations within these maps,

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.920
certain parts of our body that
normally we don't think of

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.920
as related can start to
create merged experiences.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.260
What do I mean by that?

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.440
Well, Ramchandran described a patient

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:32.440
who had a somewhat odd experience
of having lost their foot.

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.800
So they actually had their foot amputated

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.390
about midway up the Achilles.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:41.120
So lower portion of the calf and foot.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.270
I don't recall what the reason
was for having it removed.

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:46.010
And fortunately for this patient,

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:50.270
they did not experience pain
in that portion of their body,

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:53.280
but rather they confided in him

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.820
that whenever they would have sex,

00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:01.200
they would experience their
orgasm in their phantom foot

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.830
in addition to in their
genitals, of course.

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:07.380
And Ramachandra understood
the homunculus map.

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.730
And he understood that this
was because the representation

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:14.770
of the foot within the homunculus
actually lies adjacent to,

00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:17.190
and is somewhat interdigitated with

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:21.010
it actually kind of merges
with the representation

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:22.880
of the genitalia.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.490
Now that's a weird situation.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:30.940
And yet you now know that
the density of innovation

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.710
of the feet and the genitalia,

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:34.407
as well as the lips and
the face are actually

00:59:34.407 --> 00:59:37.890
the highest sensory innervation

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:39.660
that you have in your entire body.

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.550
And this speaks to, I think,

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:44.430
a more important general
principle for all people

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:46.840
of the experience of pleasure or pain,

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.210
which is that an aspect
of our pain or pleasure

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.720
can be highly localized.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.870
It can be because of a cut
to a particular location

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:59.870
on the body or it can
because of a fall injury

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:04.130
or a kind of bruise on
one side of our body.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.970
And yet our experience
of pleasure and pain

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:11.190
can also be an almost
a body-wide experience.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.830
And yet it's always most rich.

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:16.430
It's always most heightened
in these regions of our body

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.180
that have dense sensory innervation.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.280
So we experience pain
and pleasure according

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.800
to local phenomenon receptors in the skin,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.010
and this homunculus map

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.000
that has all these different territories,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.940
but because of the way that
those territories are related,

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.460
this kind of wild example of
somebody experiencing orgasm

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.650
in their phantom foot speaks
to the larger experience.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.570
The more typical rather
experience that I should say

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.160
that all people have,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.150
which is that pleasure can be body-wide

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:46.290
or we can experience it in our face

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:49.130
or the bottoms of our feet
and other areas of the body

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.120
that we experience pleasure
and similarly with pain.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.250
And that brings us to the
topic of whole body pain,

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:59.060
not just localized pain, as
well as whole body pleasure

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.460
not just localized pleasure.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.200
There are a number of
examples of whole body pain

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.390
that people suffer from.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:10.385
And one common one is called fibromyalgia.

01:01:10.385 --> 01:01:12.690
I want to just first share
with you a little bit

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.410
of medical insight.

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:17.040
A few months back, I did an Instagram live

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.970
with Dr. Sean Mackey
who's an MD medical doctor

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:23.710
and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.220
that was recorded and
placed on my Instagram.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.460
If you want to check it out,

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.180
we can provide a link to
that in the show notes.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:34.100
Dr. Mackey is the Chief
of the Division of Pain

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.930
at Stanford School of Medicine.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:37.070
So he's a scientist.

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:40.070
He studies pain and he
treats patients dealing

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:42.100
with various forms of
pain, whole body pain,

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.230
like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.170
And he shared with me
something very interesting,

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:52.162
which is that anytime you
hear or see the word syndrome,

01:01:52.162 --> 01:01:55.740
that means the medical
establishment does not understand

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:56.590
what's going on.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.970
A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:02.220
that point in a particular direction

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.050
or some general set of directions about

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:05.530
what could be going on,

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:10.530
but it doesn't reveal a true
underlying disease necessarily.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.890
It could be aggregative diseases

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:15.360
or it could be something else entirely.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.700
And I want to make sure that I emphasize

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.400
the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.590
I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.620
and we interpret that as
meaning all in one's head.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.410
But I think it's important to remember

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:29.600
that everything is neural,

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.410
whether that's pain in your body

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.670
'cause you have a gaping wound

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.620
and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.150
or whether or not it's pain
for which you cannot explain it

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:41.640
on the basis of any kind of injury.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.680
It's all neural.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.033
So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic

01:02:46.033 --> 01:02:47.360
it's kind of irrelevant.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.713
And I hope someday we
move past that language.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.123
Psychosomatic is interesting.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.220
There was a paper that
was published in 2015,

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.520
and then again in 2020 a different paper

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.810
focused on the so-called
psychogenic fevers

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:05.030
or psychosomatic effects.

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:06.420
I just briefly want to mention this

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.693
because it relates back to pain.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.790
These studies have shown
that there are areas

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.050
of the so-called thalamus,

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.770
which integrates and
filter sensory information

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.250
of different kinds.

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:20.287
And within the brainstem,
an area called the DMH

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:24.060
and I can also provide a link
to this study if you like,

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.110
that shows that there is
a true neurological basis.

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.110
There are brain areas and
circuits that are related to

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:34.430
what's called psychogenic
fever when we are stressed.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:37.620
And in particular, if we
think that we were injured

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.820
or that we were infected by something,

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.090
we can actually generate a true fever.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:45.240
It is not an imagined fever.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.320
It is our thinking generating

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.510
an increase in body temperature.

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:52.630
And so this has been called psychosomatic.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:56.790
It's been called psychogenic,
but it has a neural basis.

01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:01.460
So when we hear syndrome and
a patient comes into a clinic

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.690
and says that they suffer for instance,

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:06.150
from something which is
very controversial frankly

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:07.750
like chronic fatigue syndrome,

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.050
some physicians believe that it reflects

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:13.438
a real underlying medical
condition, others don't.

01:04:13.438 --> 01:04:18.220
However, syndrome means
we don't understand.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.290
And that doesn't mean
something doesn't exist.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:25.320
Fibromyalgia or whole
body pain for a long time

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.630
was written off or kind of explained away

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.290
by physicians and scientists
frankly, my community

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.370
as one of these syndromes.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.520
It couldn't be explained.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.760
However, now there is
what I would consider

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.880
and I think others would
and should consider

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.110
from understanding of at
least one of the bases

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:46.920
for this whole body pain.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.240
And that's activation of
a particular cell type

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.880
called glial.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.780
And there's a receptor on these glial

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.100
for those of you that want to
know called the toll 4 receptor

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:01.000
and activation of the
toll 4 receptor is related

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.970
to certain forms of whole
body pain and fibromyalgia.

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:08.470
Now, what treatments
exist for fibromyalgia.

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.290
And even if you don't
suffer from fibromyalgia,

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.200
and even if you don't know anyone who does

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.480
this is important information

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.290
because what I'm about to tell you relate

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:20.800
to how you and your body,
which is you of course

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.100
can deal with pain of any kind.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.560
And there are actually things
that one can do and take

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.560
that can encourage
nerve health in general.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.770
In other conditions like
diabetic neuropathy,

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:34.140
but in all individuals.

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:39.140
So there are clinical data
using a prescription drug.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:41.570
This is work that actually was done

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.940
by Dr. Mackey and colleagues.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.890
The drug is called naltrexone.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.520
Naltrexone is actually
used for the treatment

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.780
of various opioid addictions
and things of that sort,

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.080
but it turns out that a very low dose,

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.810
I believe it was a one 10th
the size of the typical dose

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:03.415
of naltrexone has been
shown to have some success

01:06:03.415 --> 01:06:06.650
in dealing with and treating
certain forms of fibromyalgia.

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:09.520
And it has that success
because of its ability

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.360
to bind to and block these
toll four receptors on glial.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.250
So this so-called syndrome
or this thing that previously

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.120
was called a syndrome, fibromyalgia

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.230
actually has a biological basis.

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.660
It was not just inpatients heads.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.630
And I really tip my hat to
the medical establishment

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:28.470
including Dr. Mackey and others

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:32.070
who explored the potential
underlying biologies

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.810
of things like fibromyalgia
and are starting

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:35.030
to arrive at treatments.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.070
Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor,

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:38.590
so I'm not prescribing anything.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:39.970
You should talk to your doctor of course,

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:43.170
if you have fibromyalgia
or other forms of chronic

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:46.100
or whole body pain to explore
whether or not these low dose

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.860
naltrexone treatments are right for you.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.640
But I think it's a beautiful
case study if you will,

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.340
not a case study of an individual patient,

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:58.340
but a case in study of linking
up the patient's self-report

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.790
of these experiences and using science

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.500
to try to establish clinical treatments.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.280
There's another treatment,

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.920
or I should say there's another approach

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.753
that one could take.

01:07:07.753 --> 01:07:10.220
And again, I'm not recommending
people do this necessarily.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.310
You have to determine what's
right and say for you,

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:13.510
I cannot do that.

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:15.790
There's no way your
situation's very far too much,

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:18.300
and it would be outside of my wheelhouse

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:22.850
to prescribe anything, but
there's a particular compound

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.190
which in the United States
is sold over the counter

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:26.730
and in Europe is prescription.

01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:28.970
It's one that I've talked
about on this podcast before

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:30.110
for other purposes.

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:33.437
And that compound is acetylcarnitine.

01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:36.947
Acetylcarnitine as I
mentioned is by prescription

01:07:36.947 --> 01:07:38.317
in most countries in Europe

01:07:38.317 --> 01:07:41.250
and the US you can buy
this over the counter.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.980
There is evidence that
acetylcarnitine can reduce

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.930
the symptoms of chronic whole body pain

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:49.650
and other certain forms of acute pain

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:53.160
at dosages of somewhere
between one to three

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.480
and sometimes four grams per day.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.040
Now acetylcarnitine can be taken orally.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.770
It's found in 500 milligram capsules,

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.290
as well as by injection.

01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:06.660
By injection in the States
in the United States that is

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.350
also requires a prescription

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.950
or requires a prescription I should say.

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:13.260
The over-the-counter forms
are generally capsules

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.540
or powders.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.610
Those apparently do not
require a prescription.

01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:20.500
There are several studies
exploring acetylcarnitine

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.000
in this context, as well
as for diabetic neuropathy.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.330
And what's interesting about
acetylcarnitine is it's one

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:30.070
of the few compounds that isn't just used

01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:31.650
for the treatment of pain,

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:34.220
but has also been shown
in certain contacts

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.800
to improve peripheral
nerve health generally.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.510
And for that reason, it's
an interesting compound.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:43.680
I've also talked about
acetylcarnitine on here previously,

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.030
because it has robust effects
on things like spur motility

01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:52.960
and health, including the
speeds at which sperms swim,

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.620
how straight they swim
turns out that swimming

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:58.570
for sperm is more efficient
if they swim straight,

01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:02.450
as opposed to like those
kids in on the swim team,

01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:04.120
they're like banging up
against the lane lines

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.230
and zigzagging all over the place.

01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:10.720
So it does turn out to be the
case that the quickest route

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.619
between any two places is a straight line

01:09:12.619 --> 01:09:14.470
and the good sperm know that,

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.707
and the less good sperm
don't seem to know that.

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:19.850
And acetylcarnitine seems to
facilitate straight swimming

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:21.640
trajectories as well as speed of swimming

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.170
and overall sperm health.

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:26.800
And there is evidence from
quality peer reviewed studies

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.960
showing that acetylcarnitine
supplementation can also be

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.840
beneficial for women's fertility
in ways that it affects

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.610
perhaps we don't really
know the mechanism,

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:39.800
health and status of the
egg or egg implantation.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.210
There are a large number of
studies on acetylcarnitine.

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:44.700
You can look those up
on Pub Med, if you like,

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.710
or on examine.com.

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:48.500
There are some studies that I don't think

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.410
are included there which are
particularly interesting.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:55.210
One that I just would like
to reference the last name

01:09:55.210 --> 01:10:00.210
of the first author is
Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I.

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:02.580
The title of the paper is

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.820
Effects of l -Carnitine Supplementation

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.060
on Serum Inflammatory Markers

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.780
and Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.130
in Females with Knee Osteoarthritis.

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.630
So this is a randomized double
blind placebo controlled

01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:17.362
pilot study that showed
really interesting effects

01:10:17.362 --> 01:10:21.450
of short term supplementation
of acetylcarnitine.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.941
Longer term, the effects
were less impressive.

01:10:23.941 --> 01:10:26.360
So it's pretty interesting
that this compound has

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.240
so many different effects.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.370
How could it have these effects?

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:30.410
Well, it appears that
it's having these effects

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:35.070
through its impact on the
so-called inflammatory cytokines.

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:37.708
Inflammatory cytokines for
those of you that don't know

01:10:37.708 --> 01:10:39.760
are secreted by the immune system

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.080
in response to different stressors,

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.710
physical stressors, mental stressors too

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:47.770
food that you eat that isn't good for you.

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.210
The so-called hidden sugars.

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:51.800
Yes, will increase inflammation

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.150
if they're ingested too often,

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.730
or in amounts that are
too high in quantity.

01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:57.940
Things like Interleukin 1 beta,

01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.730
things like C-reactive protein,

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:01.230
things like interleukin 6.

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:04.260
Interleukin 6 is kind of the
generic inflammatory marker

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.490
that all studies refer to.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:07.490
And yet there are other interleukins,

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:09.920
please note that there
are other interleukins

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.720
like interleukin 10 that
are anti-inflammatory.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.520
So immune system can secrete
inflammatory molecules

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.730
to deal with wounds and stress and things.

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:19.960
And in the short term that's good,

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.650
and in the longterm that's bad.

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:26.650
And it can secrete anti-inflammatory
cytokines like IL10.

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.490
And these matrix metalloproteinases,

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:30.700
it's kind of a mouthful,

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.030
but these matrix metalloproteinases
are very interesting.

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:37.400
Anytime you see A-S-E, ASE
that's generally an enzyme,

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.880
which means that these
compounds in this case,

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.930
these matrix metalloproteinases are used

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:46.994
to break down certain
elements around wounds

01:11:46.994 --> 01:11:49.820
and scoring which might
sound like a bad thing,

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.170
but in some cases is good
because it allows certain cells

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:55.130
like glial cells so-called microglia

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:56.560
to come in like low ambulances,

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.400
like low paramedics and clean up wounds.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.950
So scarring and inflammation

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.640
is kind of a double-edged sword.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.130
It can be good, but too much scarring.

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:06.870
If it contains a wound too much,

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:09.030
doesn't allow the
infiltration of cell types

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.750
to move in and take care of
that wound and heal it up.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:14.259
So it appears that L-carnitine
is impacting a number

01:12:14.259 --> 01:12:17.080
of different processes,
both to impact pain

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.210
and perhaps, and I want
to underscore perhaps,

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.260
but there are good studies happening now,

01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:25.660
perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.277
As long as we're talking about acute pain

01:12:27.277 --> 01:12:29.350
and chronic pain and supplementation

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:32.060
and non-prescription drugs,
at least in the United States

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.980
that people can take to deal
with pain of various kinds,

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.920
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.010
that I get asked most often about,

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:44.010
which are agmatine and
S-adenosyl-L-methionine,

01:12:44.207 --> 01:12:45.793
which is sometimes called SAMe.

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:50.300
Both of those have been
shown to have some impact

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.520
categorized on examine as notable impact

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.190
on various forms of pain,
due to osteoarthritis,

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:01.830
or due to injury of various
kinds of indifferent subject

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:05.350
population, men, women, people
of different ages, et cetera.

01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:07.700
SAMe in particular has been interesting

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.120
because it's been shown head to head

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.350
with drugs like Naproxen and
other drugs of that sort,

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:17.850
which are well established
and sold over the counter

01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:21.010
in the US to work at least as well

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:24.030
as some of those compounds
at certain doses.

01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.847
But it's also shown that SAMe

01:13:26.847 --> 01:13:29.260
and some of those things take more time

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.540
in order to have those effects.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.283
In fact, head to head
with things like Neproxin

01:13:34.283 --> 01:13:37.090
have been shown that they
can take up to a month

01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:39.300
in order to have the
pain relieving effect.

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.990
Now, whether or not that
makes them a better choice

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.640
or a worst choice really
depends on your circumstances.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.340
I'm certainly not recommending
that anybody take anything,

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.930
but I do think it's interesting
and important to point out

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.400
that things like
agmatine, things like SAMe

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.629
have been shown under
certain circumstances

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:57.020
to be beneficial for pain and
they are outside the realm

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.030
of prescription drugs.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:00.260
I think this is a growing area of

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.340
some people call them supplements,

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.510
some people call them nutraceuticals.

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.410
Look, at the end of the
day these are compounds

01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:06.960
that affect cellular processes.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.930
And the more that we understand

01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:09.658
how they affect those cellar processes

01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:13.110
as we now do for things
like acetylcarnitine,

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:15.460
I think the more trust
that we can put into them,

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.140
or the more to which we
might want to avoid them

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:20.750
because of some of the side effects

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:23.360
or contra-indications that
those compounds could have.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.408
If you're interested in
those other compounds,

01:14:25.408 --> 01:14:28.810
I do invite you as I always
do to check out examine.com,

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.098
but also to do your
research on those compounds

01:14:31.098 --> 01:14:33.060
by simply putting them into Google

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.390
or putting them into PubMed,
which would be even better.

01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:37.220
And if you are going to go into PubMed,

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.160
if you're going to
start playing scientist,

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.958
which I do encourage you to do,

01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:43.630
I would encourage you to
not just read abstracts,

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.860
but if you can, if the
studies are freely available,

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.080
I realized not all of
them are freely available

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.260
to try and read those studies

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.710
at least to the extent that you can.

01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:54.050
There's a particularly nice
study that you might look at

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:57.460
that was published in
2010 in Pain Medicine,

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.470
which is Keynan et al K-E-Y-N-A-N,

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:03.340
which looked at the safety and efficacy

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.510
of dietary agmatine sulfate

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:08.807
on lumbar disc associated radiculopathy

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:12.910
not laughing at the condition.

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:16.900
It's a painful condition that describes a,

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.910
it's a kind of a range
of symptoms that relate

01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:20.180
to pinching of nerves.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.013
The spinal columns,

01:15:21.013 --> 01:15:23.150
I was laughing at my pronunciation of it.

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.570
That particular study is quite good.

01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:29.610
And the conclusion of that
study that they drew was that

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:31.560
there were limited side effects

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.240
and that dietary agmatine sulfate is safe

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.670
and efficacious for treating
and alleviating pain

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:38.470
and improving quality of life

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.890
and lumbar-disc associated pain.

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:45.890
However, there were very
specific dosage regimens

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.250
that were described there
and duration of treatment.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:51.250
And so you should not take
anything that I say or that study

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.060
to mean that you can just
take this stuff willy-nilly

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:56.030
or at any concentration
of course, or dose.

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:59.310
You always want to pay attention
to what the science says.

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:02.040
That paper fortunately is
freely available online.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.270
And we will also provide
a link to that study.

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:06.140
For those of you that
are interested in SAMe

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:10.170
and its usage for the treatment
of various types of pain,

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:11.873
and perhaps other benefits,

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.017
a number of companies
have stopped making SAMe

01:16:16.017 --> 01:16:18.930
instead what they're now
focusing on is what they think

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:22.265
is a better or more
bioavailable alternative,

01:16:22.265 --> 01:16:27.070
which is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
or 5-MTHF.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:33.550
This molecule is necessary
for converting homocysteine

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:37.320
to methionine, which is
then converted to SAMe

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.600
so rather than taking SAMe directly,

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.580
the idea is to take
something that's upstream

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.570
of SAMe and make more SAMe
endogenously available.

01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:48.010
This is a different strategy.

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:49.880
I've talked about this strategy before

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.270
for increasing other things
like growth hormone, et cetera.

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:55.430
There's always this
question of whether or not

01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:58.070
in trying to increase the
amount of a particular molecule

01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:00.257
in the body, whether or not
taking that specific molecule

01:17:00.257 --> 01:17:03.630
was the best thing or
working further upstream

01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:07.260
as it's referred to
working on the precursor

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:09.070
or increasing the levels of the precursor

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:10.990
is the better way to go.

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:15.990
It appears that this
5-MTHF is the strategy

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:21.160
that people are now taking in
place of taking SAMe directly.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.390
So in other words, they're taking this

01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:25.430
in order to get elevated levels of SAMe.

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:26.840
Now, I'd like to turn our attention

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.570
to a completely non drug, non
supplement related approach

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:32.960
to dealing with pain.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.960
And it's one that has existed
for thousands of years.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.864
And that only recently has the
Western scientific community

01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:43.820
started to pay serious attention to,

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.850
but they have started to
pay serious attention to it.

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:51.680
And there is terrific mechanistic
science to now explain

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.600
how and why acupuncture can work very well

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.090
for the treatment of
certain forms of pain.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:01.590
Now, first off, I want to
tell you what was told to me

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:04.490
by our director or Chief
of the Pain Division

01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:07.010
at Stanford School of
Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,

01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:10.240
which was that some
people respond very well

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.246
to acupuncture and others do not.

01:18:13.246 --> 01:18:17.470
And the challenge is
identifying who'll respond well

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:19.760
and who won't respond well.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.280
Now, when I say won't respond well,

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.438
that doesn't necessarily
mean that they responded

01:18:23.438 --> 01:18:26.500
in a negative way, that
it was bad for them,

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.890
but it does appear that
a fraction of people

01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:33.020
experienced tremendous pain
relief from acupuncture

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.900
and others experience
none at all or very little

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.410
to the point where they have to seek out

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:38.673
other forms of treatment.

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:42.670
The science on this is still ongoing.

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:44.640
There was actually an excellent
paper published on this

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.050
in the Journal of the
American Medical Association,

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:50.620
one of the premier
medical clinical journals.

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.780
And it basically reinforced the idea

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.629
that you have responders
and non-responders.

01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:59.040
A number of laboratories
have started to explore

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.250
how acupuncture works.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.750
And one of the premier
laboratories for this

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:07.624
is Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School.

01:19:07.624 --> 01:19:11.480
Qiufu has spent many years
studying the pain system

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.950
and a system that's
related to the pain system,

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:17.603
which is the system that
controls our sensation of itch.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.230
Just as a brief aside about itch,

01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:25.470
itch and pain are often co
associated with one another.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:27.650
I was recently in Texas,
and I will tell you,

01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:30.000
they have some mean mosquitoes.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.590
They're small, but
whatever they're injecting

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:33.550
into your skin.

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:35.740
Well, here I am talking now
about my subjective experience

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.030
of pain, whatever they
injected into my skin

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:42.230
felt to me like the most
extreme mosquito bites

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.830
I've ever had, not while
they were biting me,

01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:47.390
not while they were
injecting the venom, but boy,

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:50.271
those Texas mosquitoes make me itch.

01:19:50.271 --> 01:19:51.400
How do they do it?

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.540
Well, their venom creates little packets

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.430
of so-called histamine that travel around

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:01.070
those packets are called mast cells,

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:03.400
little packets of histamine
that go to that location

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.640
and make me and presumably you

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.860
want to scratch those mosquito bites.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.080
I scratch mine you scratch yours,

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.050
but we both scratch our mosquito bites.

01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:13.140
And when we do that, the
histamines are released.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.510
That gets red and inflamed
and the itch even worse.

01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:19.230
The inflammation is actually
caused by the histamine.

01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:24.230
Well, that experience of
inflammation and pain and itch

01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:26.643
is what we call a pyrogenic experience.

01:20:26.643 --> 01:20:29.910
So we we have pain which is
nociception, essentially,

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:34.672
I know that the pain of aficionado

01:20:34.672 --> 01:20:36.830
always get a little upset
because they say, oh,

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:38.730
there's no such thing
as as a pain receptor,

01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:40.160
it's no susceptive receptors

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.790
and pain is subjective experience.

01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.510
Yes, I acknowledge all that.

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:46.470
But for fluency, let's
just think about pain

01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:49.100
as a certain experience and
itch as a separate experience,

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.360
but they often exist together
because those mosquito bites

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.940
were what I would call painful,
or at least not pleasant.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.770
They didn't just itch,
they were also painful nuts

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:01.780
because itch brings with it inflammation

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.800
and inflammation often
brings with it pain relief,

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.690
but it can also bring with
it the sensation of pain.

01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:10.660
So itch and pain are
two separate phenomenon.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.860
It was actually discovered
through a really interesting

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.490
phenomenon that relates to something

01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:18.290
that is actually consumed
in supplement form,

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.490
which is this tropical legume.

01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.690
It's actually a bean
called Mucuna pruriens.

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:28.690
That's M-U-C-U-N-A that's
one word P-R-U-I-E-N-S

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:34.360
Mucuna pruriens is a bean,
it's as legume that this bean

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:37.310
is 99% L-DOPA.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:40.060
It's dopamine or rather it's
the precursor to dopamine

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.470
and people buy this stuff
and take it over the counter

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:44.680
as ways to increase
their levels of dopamine.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.860
It does make you feel
really dopamine doubt,

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:50.800
meaning it makes you feel a
little high and really motivated

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.690
and really energetic
a lot like other drugs

01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:55.130
that will do that.

01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:57.810
I don't necessarily recommend
taking Mucuna pruriens.

01:21:57.810 --> 01:22:00.030
I personally don't like taking it.

01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.160
Doesn't make me feel good.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.890
I crash really hard when I take it.

01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:07.880
But on the outside of
this bean is a compound

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.520
that makes people itch.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.650
So they remove this when you
take it in supplement form.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:14.580
In fact, it's usually in capsule form,

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:18.080
but the outside of this
bean, it's like a hairy bean.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.056
And those little hairs contain a compound,

01:22:21.056 --> 01:22:24.840
which was actually used
to study and identify

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.110
these itchy receptors in the skin.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:30.060
So we don't have time to go
into all the details of itch,

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.420
but it's pretty interesting
that you have these compounds

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.030
out in nature that can make us itch.

01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:35.560
Inside them they have dopamine.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.540
I mean, this is really weird,

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.900
but plant compounds are really powerful.

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.640
So don't let anyone tell
you that because something's

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.052
from a plant or an earth
that it's not powerful.

01:22:44.052 --> 01:22:47.500
There are very powerful
plant and herb compounds.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.220
Mucuna prurien being one of
them with dopamine on the inside

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.310
and itchy stuff on the outside.

01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:54.610
Now, what does this all
have to do with acupuncture?

01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:58.750
Well, Qiufu Ma's lab
has not just identified

01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:01.950
the itch pathway, this pruritus
genes as they're called,

01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:04.940
which causes itch and
the pyrogenic phenomenon

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.230
of itch being separate from pain.

01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:12.230
His lab has also studied how
acupuncture causes relief of,

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.100
but also can exacerbate pain.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.080
Now, the form of acupuncture
that they explored

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.710
was one that's commonly in
use called electroacupuncture.

01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:23.100
So this isn't just putting little needles

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.000
into different parts of the body.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.730
These needles are able to
pass an electrical current,

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:29.970
not magically, but because they have

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:31.360
a little wire going back to a device

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.760
and you can pass electrical current.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.053
Here's what they found.

01:23:34.053 --> 01:23:37.450
This is a study published
in the journal neuron

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:40.500
Cell Press journal, excellent
journal, very high stringency.

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.530
So what Qiufu Ma's lab found
was that if electroacupuncture

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.343
is provided to the abdomen,
to the stomach area,

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.170
it creates activation of what are called

01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:53.410
the sympathetic ganglia.

01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:55.070
These have nothing to do with sympathy

01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:58.350
in the emotional sense has to
do with the stress response.

01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:59.630
Sympa just means together.

01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:02.693
So it activated a bunch of
neurons along the spinal cord.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.780
And the activation of
these neurons evolves

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:11.780
neural adrenaline and something
called NPY neuropeptide Y.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.630
The long and short of it is
that stimulating the abdomen

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:20.630
with electroacupuncture was
either anti-inflammatory

01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:22.650
or it could cause inflammation.

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:25.200
It could actually exacerbate
inflammation depending

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.810
on whether or not it was
of low or high intensity.

01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:31.020
Now that makes it a very
precarious technique.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.360
And this may speak to some of the reason

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.320
why some people report
relief from acupuncture

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.780
and others do not.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:41.550
However, they went a step further
and stimulated other areas

01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:43.472
of the body using electroacupuncture.

01:24:43.472 --> 01:24:46.100
And what they found is that
stimulation of the legs

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.930
of the hind limbs, as
it's called an animals,

01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:51.380
and the legs in humans caused a circuit,

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.450
a neural circuit to be activated that goes

01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:57.920
from the legs up to an area
of the base of the brain

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.310
called the DMV not the DMH,
which I mentioned earlier,

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:04.350
but the DMV like you go to the DMV,

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.820
which is a miserable experience
for most people, forgive me,

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.320
DMV employees, but let's be honest

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.160
most people don't enjoy
going to the DMV as patrons,

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.040
but we have to so we go.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.450
The DMV and low intensity stimulation,

01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:23.920
this electroacupuncture of the
hind limbs activated the DMV

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.830
and activated the adrenal glands,

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:30.100
which sit at top of your
kidneys and cause the release

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.810
of what are called catecholamines.

01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:35.340
And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:40.340
In other words, electroacupuncture
of the legs and feet can,

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.100
if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.140
and reduce symptoms of pain.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.430
And can we think accelerate wound healing

01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:51.900
because activations of these
catecholaminergic pathways

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.140
can accelerate wound healing as well.

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.350
So the takeaway from this is
that while there are thousands

01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:02.860
of years and millions of
subjects involved in explorations

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.813
of electroacupuncture and acupuncture,

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:09.030
Western medicine is
starting to come into this

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.080
and start to explore underlying mechanism.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.720
Now, for those of you
that love acupuncture

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.300
and are real proponents of it,

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.640
it's worked for you, you might say,

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.330
well, why does Western medicine
even need to come into this?

01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:22.370
Why should they even be exploring this?

01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:24.400
But we should all be
relieved that they are

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.880
because what's starting to happen now

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.540
is that as the mechanistic basis for this

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.563
is starting to come to light,

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:35.990
insurance coverage of
things like acupuncture

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:38.150
is starting to emerge as well.

01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:40.380
And this is in contrast to other therapies

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.000
for which there's a lot
of anecdotal evidence,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.180
but very little mechanistic understanding.

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.407
One example of that would
be laser photo biomodulation

01:26:48.407 --> 01:26:52.410
the use of lasers of
different types really

01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:54.680
to treat pain and to
accelerate wound healing.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.590
A lot of people claim that
this can really help them.

01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:00.129
However, most places,
at least in the States,

01:27:00.129 --> 01:27:01.800
won't cover this with insurance

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.184
or don't perform this in standard clinics.

01:27:04.184 --> 01:27:08.310
And the reason is the underlying
mechanism isn't known.

01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:10.900
I'm not going to get into the
argument about whether or not

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.660
mechanistic understanding
should or should not be required

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:17.800
in order to have insurance
coverage of things that work.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.110
That's not what this is about.

01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:21.350
And that actually will
be a boring discussion

01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:23.670
because I'm shouting at
a tunnel through you.

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:25.330
And I wouldn't be able
to hear you shout back

01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:27.220
no matter what your stance on that is,

01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:30.938
but just trust me when I
say that I am both relieved

01:27:30.938 --> 01:27:35.040
and delighted to hear that
excellent medical institutions

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.033
like Stanford are starting to
think about electroacupuncture

01:27:39.033 --> 01:27:39.866
and how it can work.

01:27:39.866 --> 01:27:42.210
That places like Harvard
Medical School are starting

01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:44.320
to explore this at a mechanistic level.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.840
And I do believe that
there's an open-mindedness

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.402
that starting to emerge for instance,

01:27:49.402 --> 01:27:52.000
the National Institutes of Health,

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.090
not only has an institute
for mental health

01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:55.760
and cancer research and an eye institute,

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.553
but now complementary
health, the so-called NCCIH.

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.970
National Institutes of
Complementary Health

01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:04.660
that is exploring things
like electroacupuncture,

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:08.080
meditation, various supplements
and things of those sort.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.190
I do think that we're entering
a new realm in which things

01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:13.800
like pain and pain management
will be met with more openness

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.970
by all physicians, at
least that's my hope.

01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:18.829
So please take that into
consideration right now.

01:28:18.829 --> 01:28:22.270
The mechanistic evidence
for laser photobiomodulation

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:23.190
is not strong.

01:28:23.190 --> 01:28:27.330
One of the major issues
or the barriers to that

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:30.235
is that most of the
studies that are out there

01:28:30.235 --> 01:28:33.030
were actually paid for by companies

01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:38.030
that build devices for
laser photobiomodulation.

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.800
And so we really need
independent studies funded

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.260
by federal institutions that have no bias

01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:46.900
or financial relationship
in order to gain trust

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.783
in whatever data happen to emerge.

01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.650
There is a technique that at one time

01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:53.070
was considered alternative,

01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:55.880
but now has a lot of mechanistic science

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:59.230
to explain how it works,
and it does indeed work

01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:03.543
for the treatment of chronic
and also for acute pain.

01:29:03.543 --> 01:29:08.543
And that treatment is hypnosis
in particular self-hypnosis.

01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:12.170
Now, my colleague at Stanford
in fact, my collaborator,

01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:14.950
Dr. David Spiegel, our
Associate Chair of Psychiatry

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:16.670
has devoted his professional life

01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:20.300
to developing hypnosis
tools that people can use

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.500
to help them sleep better, focus better,

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.730
stay motivated, et cetera.

01:29:24.730 --> 01:29:26.680
While most people hear
hypnosis and they think,

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.090
oh, this is stage hypnosis.

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:29.480
People walking around like chickens

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.690
are being forced to laugh

01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:33.100
or fall asleep on command, et cetera.

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.620
This is completely
different than all that.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.910
This is self hypnosis
and there are now dozens,

01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:41.690
if not more quality peer
reviewed studies published

01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:44.980
in excellent journals done by Dr. Spiegel

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.570
and others at other universities.

01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:50.640
It really all has to do
with how self-hypnosis

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.600
can modulate activity
of the prefrontal cortex

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.230
and related structures like the insula.

01:29:57.230 --> 01:30:02.230
The prefrontal cortex is involved
in our executive function

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.320
as it's called, our planning,
our decision making,

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.200
but also how we interpret context,

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.150
what the meaning of a given sensation is.

01:30:10.150 --> 01:30:11.727
And that's extremely powerful.

01:30:11.727 --> 01:30:15.000
I just want to remind
everybody that the currency

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.010
of the brain and body has not changed

01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:18.690
in hundreds of thousands of years.

01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:21.010
It's always been dopamine,
serotonin, glutamate,

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:23.350
GABA, testosterone, estrogen.

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:25.600
What's changed are the contingencies,

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.050
the events in the world
that drive whether or not

01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:31.110
we get an increase or decrease
in testosterone or estrogen,

01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:33.440
the events in the world
that dictate whether or not

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.050
we get an increase or
a decrease in dopamine.

01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:38.760
Believe me, the events
that drove those increases

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.090
and decreases were very
different even a 100 years ago

01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:42.470
than they are now.

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:45.910
And as we create new things and
societies change, et cetera,

01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:50.430
they will continue to exchange information

01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.010
in the same currency, which
is dopamine, serotonin,

01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:55.450
and all these other
neuromodulators and chemicals.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.629
Hypnosis takes advantage of this

01:30:57.629 --> 01:31:02.040
by allowing an individual,
you, if you like

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.610
to change the way that you
interpret particular events

01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:06.990
and to actually experience
what would be painful

01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:09.180
as less painful or not painful.

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.540
And that's just the example of pain.

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.900
Hypnosis is powerful
for other reasons too.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.680
It actually can help
rewire neural circuits

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.160
so that you don't experience as much pain

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.210
so that you can sleep
faster, focus faster.

01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:23.520
If this is all sounding very fantastical

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.113
well, it's supported by data.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.070
The data are that when
people do self-hypnosis

01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:33.260
even brief self-hypnosis
of 10 or 15 minutes,

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.670
a few times a week, maybe
even returned to that hypnosis

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:39.370
by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,

01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:43.380
they can achieve significant
and often very impressive

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.210
degrees of pain relief in chronic pain

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:47.760
whether or not that chronic pain arises

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.660
through things like fibromyalgia
or through other sources.

01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:52.150
If you want to check this out,

01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:54.190
there's a wonderful zero cost resource

01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:56.240
that's grounded in this work.

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.200
It's the app reveri.com.

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.198
So R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

01:32:03.198 --> 01:32:05.980
There you can download a zero cost app

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.340
for Apple phones or for Android phones.

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:12.680
And there are a variety of
different hypnosis scripts.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.280
These are actually self hypnosis scripts,

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.170
and you'll actually hear Dr.
David Spiegel talking to you.

01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:19.680
He can teach you about
hypnosis and how it works.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.468
There are links to scientific studies

01:32:21.468 --> 01:32:24.930
that web address that I
gave you before reveri.com.

01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:27.290
You can see the various studies
and the various write-ups

01:32:27.290 --> 01:32:29.560
related to those studies
and how this all works.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.926
And they're simple protocols.

01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:33.790
You just click on a tab and
you listen to the self-hypnosis

01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:36.180
and it will take you into hypnosis.

01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:39.370
And several of those hypnosis
grips have been shown

01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:44.240
clinically to relieve certain
patterns of chronic pain.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.630
So it's a powerful tool,
and I encourage you not

01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:50.010
to write off the non-drug
non supplement tools

01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:53.270
as less than powerful
because indeed many people

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:55.290
experience tremendous relief from them.

01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:57.850
And of course, they also can be combined

01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:00.170
with drug treatments
if that's right for you

01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:03.240
or with supplements and things
of that sort to treat pain,

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.720
if that's right for you.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.890
So again, electroacupuncture
now often supported

01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:11.220
by insurance, not always, but often.

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:13.890
Great mechanistic data starting to emerge.

01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:17.320
Hypnosis, terrific tool.

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.970
There's even the self-hypnosis
tool that one can access

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:21.980
through the zero cost app Reveri

01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:24.960
and lots of great clinical data

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.680
and scientific mechanistic data.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.160
There are neuro imaging studies showing

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.237
that different brain areas
are activated in hypnosis

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:32.370
the so-called default network,

01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:35.210
kind of where your brains is kind of idols

01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:38.020
and the different circuits
that are active in at rest

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.250
shift with hypnosis and shift long-term

01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:42.380
in ways that positively conserve you.

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.240
And then these things like
laser photobiomodulation

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.710
still more or less in that
experimental medical community.

01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:51.380
I should say, Western Medical
Community, not so certain,

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.570
but hopefully there will be data soon,

01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:55.960
and hopefully those data
will point to mechanisms

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.410
that allow the insurance companies

01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:03.350
and other sort of medical
bodies to support them

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:06.090
if indeed they have a mechanistic basis.

01:34:06.090 --> 01:34:09.430
I just want to briefly touch on
a common method of pain relief

01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:12.180
that speaks to a more general principle

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.440
of how things like electroacupuncture,

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.160
and also some of these
new emerging techniques

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.020
of kind of like active tissue release

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.870
and this principle that
you hear a lot about

01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:24.210
in sports medicine now that
when you have pain or injury

01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:26.680
at one site, that you
should provide pressure

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.030
above and below that site.

01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:31.810
You may have seen this in the
Olympics, which is ongoing now

01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:34.720
where people will put tape on their body

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.509
at certain locations oftentimes.

01:34:36.509 --> 01:34:39.960
The logic or what they're
saying is that this is designed

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:43.240
to create relief in a joint or in a limb

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.920
that's below the tape, not
necessarily under the tape,

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.220
but above or below.

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.060
So for instance, if there's
pain in one shoulder,

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.040
sometimes we'll put it
on the trapezius muscle

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.873
or things of that sort.

01:34:53.873 --> 01:34:56.030
It turns out that there
is a basis for this

01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:58.730
because of the way that
these different nerves run in

01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:02.680
from the skin and from the
muscles up into the spinal cord

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.330
and into the brainstem providing pressure

01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:07.960
on one nerve pathway can
often impact another pathway.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.810
And the simplest and most
common example of this is one

01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:13.020
that we all do
instinctually or intuitively

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:14.820
even animals do this.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.740
This is something that in the
textbooks is all is called

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:20.610
the Gate Theory of Pain
developed by Melzack and Wall

01:35:20.610 --> 01:35:22.370
kind of classic theory.

01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:26.000
Basically we have receptors in our skin,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.370
the so-called C fibers, that's just a name

01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:30.250
for these little wires that come

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:33.840
from a particular class
of DRGs that's very thin

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.840
that brings about certain kinds

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.500
of nasal scepter information.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.840
I want to say pain information,

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.230
but then the pain people believe
are not their pain people.

01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:44.500
Sometimes they're a pain
because what they tell me

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.900
is they're on pain
receptors okay, nociceptors

01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.360
That information comes in C fibers

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.940
and what happens when we injure something

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:57.370
well, provided that we won't
damage it worse by touching it,

01:35:57.370 --> 01:36:01.420
oftentimes what we will do is
we will rub the source of pain

01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:05.470
or the location in which
we were experiencing pain.

01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:10.470
And it turns out that's not
an unuseful thing to do.

01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:14.380
When we rub our skin or an area,

01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.550
or we provide pressure nearby it,

01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:18.380
we activate the so-called A fibers,

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:22.120
the bigger wires and
neurons that innovate,

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.550
meaning they jut into that area of skin.

01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:27.470
And those A fibers, the ones that respond

01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:31.210
to mechanical pressure
actually are able to inhibit

01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:33.310
those C fibers, the ones that are carrying

01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:35.170
that so-called pain information.

01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:38.920
So rubbing an area or providing
pressure above or below

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:42.990
an injury actually provides
real pain relief support

01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:46.770
for the location of
that injury or that pain

01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:49.070
because of the way that
these different patterns

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:51.600
or these different types
of neurons interact

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.500
with one another.

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:53.810
And when I say it inhibits it,

01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:55.493
I don't mean that it like shouts at it,

01:36:55.493 --> 01:36:58.340
what it does is it releases
it's literally kind of

01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.340
like vomits up a little
bit of a neurotransmitter

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.280
called GABA.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.960
And GABA is a
neurotransmitter that inhibits

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.210
it quiets the activity of other neurons.

01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:11.890
And so it's acting as kind
of an analgesic, if you will,

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:15.690
it's acting as its own
form of drug that you make

01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:19.090
with your body to quiet the
activity of these pain neurons.

01:37:19.090 --> 01:37:21.300
So rubbing a wound
provided it doesn't damage

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.340
the wound worse or providing
pressure above or below

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:28.290
typically it's above a particular injury

01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:30.760
can have a real effect in
relieving some of the pain

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.593
of that injury.

01:37:31.593 --> 01:37:34.060
And some people have speculated
this as through fascia,

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:37.000
or this is through other
bodily organs and tissues.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.360
And it might be we're going to
do a whole episode on fascia.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.150
It's extremely interesting tissue,

01:37:41.150 --> 01:37:43.140
but right now it seems
that the main source

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:47.460
of that pain relief is through
this A fiber inhibition

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:50.840
of these C fibers
so-called Melzack and Wall

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.020
Gate Theory of Pain if
you'd like to look it up

01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:55.170
and learn about that further.

01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:56.950
Now, let's talk about a phenomenon

01:37:56.950 --> 01:38:00.080
that has long intrigued
and perplexed people

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.610
for probably thousands of years.

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:05.190
And that's redheads.

01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:07.760
You may have heard before that
redheads have a higher pain

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.060
threshold than other individuals.

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.271
And indeed, that is true.

01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:16.090
There's now a study that
looked at this mechanistically.

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:20.600
There's a gene called the MC1R gene.

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.990
And this MC1R gene encodes

01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:25.470
for a number of different proteins.

01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:27.780
Some of those proteins
of course are related

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.360
to the production of melanin.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.680
This is why redheads often not always,

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.750
but often are very fair skinned.

01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:35.850
Sometimes have freckles, not always.

01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:37.510
And of course have red hair.

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:40.100
Some people are really intense ginger's

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.840
not psychologically or emotionally
intense perhaps that too,

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.140
but meaning their hair is very, very red.

01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:47.460
Others, it's a lighter red.

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:50.590
So of course there's
variation here, but this gene,

01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:55.590
this MC1R gene is associated
with a pathway that relates

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.880
to something that I've talked
about on this podcast before

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.880
during the episode on hunger
and feeding and this is POMC.

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:08.500
POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.240
and POMC is cut up.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.420
It's cleaved into different hormones,

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:16.720
including one that
enhances pain perception.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.360
This is melanocyte stimulating hormone.

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.150
And another one that
blocks pain beta endorphin.

01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:25.760
Now, if you listen to the
episodes on testosterone

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.300
and estrogen and the episodes
on hunger and feeding,

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.230
some of these molecules
will start to ring a bell.

01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:34.520
Things like melano
stimulating hormone relate

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:35.970
to pigmentation of the skin

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.240
relate to sexual arousal, et cetera,

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.333
but it turns out that in red heads,

01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:43.500
because of the fact that
they have this gene,

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:48.500
this MC1R gene, the POMC
Pro-opiomelanocortin,

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.310
that's cut into different hormones,

01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:52.950
melanocyte-stimulating hormones

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:56.040
and another one beta endorphin.

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.410
Beta endorphin should cue you to the fact

01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:01.020
that this is in the pain pathway.

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.660
The endorphins are endogenously made,

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.540
meaning made within our body opioids.

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:09.920
They actually make us feel numb

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.460
in response to certain kinds of pain.

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.820
Now, not completely numb,

01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:17.000
but they numb or reduce
our perception of pain

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.470
because of the ways in
which they are released

01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:20.870
from certain brain centers.

01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:23.340
We'll talk about those
brain centers in a moment.

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:27.500
So what's really interesting
is that this study showed

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.520
that the presence of these
hormones is in everybody.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:35.420
We all have melanocortin 4,
we all have beta endorphins.

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.600
We all have POMC et cetera,

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.730
but red heads make more of
these endogenous endorphins.

01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:42.830
And that's interesting.

01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:46.160
It allows them to buffer
against the pain response.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.590
I have a personal anecdote
to share with you about

01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:50.920
this red head and heightened levels

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.910
of pain tolerance phenomenon.

01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:54.590
Obviously I'm not a redhead.

01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:58.210
I don't dye my hair, but
my partner for many years

01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:00.560
was a red head and still is a red head.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.253
She had bright red hair and
had that since childhood.

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.249
Well, we had the fortunate experience

01:41:07.249 --> 01:41:10.930
of becoming friends
with Wim Hof and family.

01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:13.290
They actually came out to
visit us and did a series

01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:15.530
of seminars in the bay area.

01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:18.440
This was in 2016, as I recall.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.780
And my partner, she had
never done an ice bath.

01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:25.940
She had never done any kind
of real cold water exposure

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.720
experience before, but as
one particular gathering

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.580
as is often the case when women's around,

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.460
there was an ice bath and a
number of people were getting

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:33.293
into this thing.

01:41:33.293 --> 01:41:34.950
This was actually before a dinner event.

01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:38.050
And I think for most people
who have never done an ice bath

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:41.900
getting in for 30 seconds
or a minute is tolerable,

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.180
but it takes some effort.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.450
It takes some willpower
and take some overcoming

01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.830
that pain barrier 'cause
it is a little bit painful.

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:48.663
Not a lot.

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:52.770
Some people can stay in longer
three minutes, five minutes

01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:54.770
without much discomfort.

01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:57.710
What was incredible is
that without any desire

01:41:57.710 --> 01:41:59.470
to compete with anybody else,

01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:02.700
my partner redhead got into the ice bath

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.610
and just like sat there for 10 minutes.

01:42:04.610 --> 01:42:06.320
In fact, at one point she
just kind of turned to me

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.820
and said, "I don't really feel pain.

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.140
I'm not really in pain."

01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:13.250
And Wim loved this.

01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:14.190
Wim thought it was great.

01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:15.558
He thought it was the most
terrific thing in the world.

01:42:15.558 --> 01:42:17.240
And he got back in the ice bath

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.507
and they became fast friends,

01:42:18.507 --> 01:42:20.840
and I think they're
probably still fast friends.

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.330
So in any event, that's an end of one.

01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:25.570
What we call an anecdata example.

01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:28.250
Anecdata is not really a term
that we should use too much

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:31.410
'cause it's N of one
anecdotes are just that.

01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:32.770
They're just anecdotes.

01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:37.068
But it's been described many
times in various clinics

01:42:37.068 --> 01:42:41.360
by anesthesiologists, by
observation of coaches, et cetera,

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:45.170
that redheads men and
women who are redheads

01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:47.180
seem to have this higher pain threshold.

01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:51.100
And it does seem to be because
their body naturally produces

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.960
ways to counter the pain response.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.800
They produce their own endogenous opioids.

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.570
Now this of course should not
be taken to mean that redheads

01:43:00.570 --> 01:43:03.060
can tolerate more pain and
therefore should be subjected

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:06.240
to more pain, all it means
is that their threshold

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.500
for pain on average, not all of them,

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.080
but on average is shifted higher

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.000
than that of other individuals.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.810
And it remains to be
determined whether or not

01:43:15.810 --> 01:43:18.490
other light skin, light haired individuals

01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:21.000
also have a heightened
level of pain threshold.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.470
And I should mention because
I mentioned the ice bath

01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:26.210
that of course pain threshold is something

01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:28.960
that can be built up and
provide you do that safely

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:30.845
in ways that aren't damaging your tissues

01:43:30.845 --> 01:43:32.950
because of course, pain is a signal

01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:36.330
that is designed to help you
to keep from harming yourself,

01:43:36.330 --> 01:43:38.610
but provided that you can
do that in a way that's safe

01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:41.150
and doesn't damage your tissues,

01:43:41.150 --> 01:43:43.360
increasing your pain threshold
through the use of things

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.990
like ice baths is something
that really can be done.

01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:48.420
It has a lot to do with these contextual

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.410
or top-down modulations of the experience.

01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:55.080
You can tell yourself
that this is good for me,

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.410
or I'm doing this by
choice or whatever it is.

01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:58.480
You can distract yourself.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.960
There are a huge number of different ways

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.160
that one could do that.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.240
One of the more interesting ways

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:06.080
for which there are actually
really good scientific data

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.870
come from my colleagues,
Sean Mackey's Lab.

01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:12.900
And that actually looked at
how love and in particular,

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:17.480
the experience of obsessive
love could actually counter

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:21.440
the pain response, not just
in redheads, but in everybody.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.670
So that study I'll just briefly describe

01:44:24.670 --> 01:44:26.680
it involved having people
come into the laboratory

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.790
and experience any one or a number

01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:30.620
of different painful stimuli,

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.410
but they had selectively
recruited subjects

01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:35.270
that were in new relationships

01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:38.120
for which there was a
high degree of infatuation

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.710
so much so that the people
couldn't stop thinking about

01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:43.660
or communicating with that new partner

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:47.263
up to 80% of their waking
time, which is a lot.

01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:51.600
That constant obsessing about that partner

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.760
was correlated with.

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:56.230
It wasn't causal necessarily,
but was correlated with

01:44:56.230 --> 01:44:59.430
the ability to sustain
higher levels of pain

01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:03.810
than people who were in
more typical non obsessive

01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:07.450
forms of love, longstanding relationships,

01:45:07.450 --> 01:45:10.530
where there wasn't long
obsessive love rather.

01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:12.090
And of course in this study,

01:45:12.090 --> 01:45:14.000
there were a lot of good control groups.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.030
They included a distractor,

01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:18.820
they included people
obsessing about other things,

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:19.760
their pet, et cetera.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.427
They included other forms
of love and attachment,

01:45:23.427 --> 01:45:26.420
but it does seem that
certain patterns of thinking

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:30.060
can allow us to buffer ourselves
against the pain response.

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.560
And that should not be surprising.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.100
Certain forms of thinking are
associated with the release

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:38.520
of particular neuromodulators
in particular dopamine.

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.772
And dopamine, it may
seem is kind of the thing

01:45:41.772 --> 01:45:44.200
that underlies everything, but it's not.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.850
Dopamine is a molecule that's associated

01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:49.770
with novelty expectation,
motivation, and reward.

01:45:49.770 --> 01:45:52.240
We talked about this at the
beginning of the episode,

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.400
that it's really the molecule
of expectation and motivation

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.760
and hope and excitement
more than it's associated

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.140
with the receival of the reward.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.870
Well, dopamine is coursing
throughout the brain

01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:08.230
at heightened levels and
coursing throughout the body

01:46:08.230 --> 01:46:11.190
at heightened levels when we fall in love.

01:46:11.190 --> 01:46:13.630
This probably has some adaptive mechanism

01:46:13.630 --> 01:46:15.980
that ensure paired bonding between people

01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.490
or who knows, maybe it ensured not bonding

01:46:18.490 --> 01:46:19.323
to multiple people.

01:46:19.323 --> 01:46:22.939
Nobody really knows how dopamine functions

01:46:22.939 --> 01:46:24.840
in terms of pair bonding,

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:28.150
but it is known that
when people fall in love,

01:46:28.150 --> 01:46:31.660
new relationships create
very high levels of dopamine.

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.500
And that's probably the mechanistic basis

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.630
by which these people were able
to buffer the pain response

01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:41.360
by thinking about their partner
or this new relationship

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.630
that they're in almost
obsessively or obsessively.

01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:46.470
Now that raises a deeper question

01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:47.430
we should always be asking.

01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:48.730
Yeah, but how, how?

01:46:48.730 --> 01:46:52.900
Well, the dopamine system
can have powerful effects

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.640
on the inflammation system.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.100
And it doesn't do this
through mysterious ways.

01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.280
It does this by interacting
through the brainstem

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.300
and some of the neurons
that innervate the spleen

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.450
and other areas of the body,

01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:09.274
that deploy cells to go combat infection,

01:47:09.274 --> 01:47:11.350
inflammation, and pain.

01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:14.150
And the ways in which
dopamine can modulate pain,

01:47:14.150 --> 01:47:16.374
and in this case, this particular study

01:47:16.374 --> 01:47:18.480
transform our experience of pain.

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.814
Maybe even to something that's pleasureful

01:47:20.814 --> 01:47:22.670
is not mysterious.

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:25.990
It's really through the
activation of brainstem neurons

01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:28.820
that communicate with areas of our body,

01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:31.530
that deploy things like immune cells.

01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:34.214
So for instance, we have
neurons in our brain stem

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:38.420
that can be modulated by
the release of dopamine

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.250
and those neurons in the
brainstem control the release

01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:44.410
of immune cells from
tissues like the spleen

01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:45.940
or organs like the spleen.

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.840
And those immune cells can
then go combat infection.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.510
We've heard before that when we're happy,

01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:53.650
we're better able to combat
infection, deal with pain,

01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:54.833
deal with all sorts of things

01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:57.180
that essentially makes us more resilient.

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.800
And that's not because dopamine
is some magic molecule,

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.490
it's because dopamine
affects particular circuits

01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:05.600
and tells in a very neuro-biological way

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.820
in a biochemical way tells
those cells and circuits

01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.170
that conditions are good.

01:48:10.170 --> 01:48:12.070
Despite the fact that
there's pain in the body

01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.990
conditions are good.

01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:14.520
You're in love or conditions are good.

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.220
You want to be in this experience.

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:19.350
Or conditions are good
this is for a greater cause

01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:22.580
that you're fighting or suffering
for some larger purpose.

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.740
So all of that has existed
largely in the realm

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.990
of psychology and even
motivational literature

01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:28.180
in this kind of thing,

01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:30.110
but there's a real
mechanistic basis for it.

01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:32.770
Dopamine is a molecule that
can bind to receptor sites

01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:34.060
on these brain areas.

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:36.640
Those brain areas can then
modulate the organs and tissues

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.010
of the body that can allow
us to lean into challenge.

01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:41.620
And those challenges can be infection,

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.840
it can be physical pain, it
can be long bouts of effort

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.090
that are required of us.

01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:50.260
And I think many people
have described the feeling

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:53.390
of being newly in love as a
heightened level of energy,

01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:54.670
a capacity do anything.

01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:58.400
I mean, the whole concept
of a muse is one in which

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.120
some individual or some
thing either imagined or real

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.680
enters our life and we
can use that as fuel.

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.930
And that fuel is chemical fuel

01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:10.860
and that chemical fuel is dopamine.

01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.790
And it really does allow
for more resilience

01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:15.770
and can even transform
the experience of pain

01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:17.510
or what would otherwise be pain

01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:19.490
into an experience of pleasure.

01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:22.220
So, along those lines,
let's talk about pleasure.

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:24.910
With all the cells and
tissues and machinery related

01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:28.540
to pain, you might think
that our entire touch system

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.330
is designed to allow us to detect pain

01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:33.240
and to avoid tissue damage and well,

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:36.420
a good percentage of
it is devoted to that.

01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.450
A good percentage of it is also devoted

01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:40.910
to this thing that we call pleasure.

01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:43.300
And that should come as no surprise.

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:46.510
Pleasure isn't just
there for our pleasure.

01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:48.320
It serves adaptive role,

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.520
and that adaptive role relates to the fact

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.910
that every species has a primary goal

01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:54.850
which is to make more of itself

01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:56.933
otherwise it would go extinct.

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:01.620
That process of making more
of itself sexual reproduction

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:04.370
is closely associated with the sensation

01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:06.090
and the perception of pleasure.

01:50:06.090 --> 01:50:10.410
And it's no surprise that not
only is the highest density

01:50:10.410 --> 01:50:15.230
of sensory receptors in and
on and around the genitalia,

01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:19.130
but the process of
reproduction evokes sensations

01:50:19.130 --> 01:50:22.500
and molecules and perceptions
associated with pleasure.

01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:25.450
And the currency of pleasure exists

01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:27.210
in multiple chemical systems

01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:29.970
but the primary ones
are the dopamine system,

01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:31.820
which is the anticipation of pleasure

01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:37.720
and the work required
to achieve the ability

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.610
to experience that pleasure,
and the serotonin system

01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:44.570
which is more closely related
to the immediate experience

01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:45.600
of that pleasure.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.570
And from dopamine and serotonin
stem out other hormones

01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:52.230
and molecules, things like oxytocin,

01:50:52.230 --> 01:50:53.840
which are associated with pair bonding.

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.040
Oxytocin is more closely associated

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:58.590
with the serotonin system biochemically

01:50:58.590 --> 01:51:01.277
and at the circuit level
meaning the areas of the brain

01:51:01.277 --> 01:51:04.150
and body that manufacture
a lot of serotonin,

01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:06.310
usually not always, but
usually contain neurons

01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:08.620
that also manufacturer and make use

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.453
of the molecule oxytocin.

01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:15.460
Those chemicals together
create sensations of warmth,

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:18.570
of well being, of safety.

01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:21.499
The dopamine molecule is
more closely associated

01:51:21.499 --> 01:51:23.903
with hormones like testosterone

01:51:23.903 --> 01:51:26.990
and other molecules involved with pursuit

01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:30.540
and further effort in order
to get more of whatever

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:33.390
could potentially cause
more release of dopamine.

01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:35.850
So this is a very broad strokes,

01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:39.378
no pun intended description
of the pleasure system.

01:51:39.378 --> 01:51:41.730
There are of course,
other molecules as well.

01:51:41.730 --> 01:51:44.430
One in particular that's very interesting

01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:45.633
is something called PEA.

01:51:46.818 --> 01:51:49.920
PEA, it stands for Phenethylamine

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:53.050
sometimes also referred
to as Phenethylamine

01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:56.160
depending on who you
are and where you live,

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:59.040
how you pronounce it
doesn't really matter.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.396
PEA is a molecule, which
is incredibly potent

01:52:03.396 --> 01:52:07.010
at augmenting or increasing the activity

01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:09.100
of certain cells and neural circuits

01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:11.580
that relate to the pleasure system.

01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:16.150
PEA has purportedly been
thought to be released

01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:18.750
in response to ingestion of
things like certain forms

01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:19.830
of dark chocolate.

01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:21.810
Some people take it in supplement form.

01:52:21.810 --> 01:52:24.080
It's a bit of a stimulant,

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:27.580
but it also seems to heighten
the perception of pleasure

01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:30.067
in response to a particular
amount of dopamine

01:52:30.067 --> 01:52:31.470
and or serotonin.

01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:34.500
So for instance, in a kind
of a arbitrary experiment

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.220
and units type example,

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:39.360
if a given experience evokes a particular

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:41.430
amount of serotonin and dopamine

01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:44.170
and gives rise to a subjective
experience of pleasure

01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:46.240
of say level three out of 10,

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:50.410
the ingestion of PEA prior to
that experience can increase

01:52:50.410 --> 01:52:53.050
the rating of that experience
as more pleasureful.

01:52:53.050 --> 01:52:55.650
Maybe a four or a five, or even a six.

01:52:55.650 --> 01:52:59.510
And PEA is known to be present in

01:52:59.510 --> 01:53:02.040
or I should say it's releases stimulated

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.120
by a number of different
compounds, such as dark chocolate,

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:08.820
certain things like
aspartame and certain people

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.580
can actually increase the
amount of PEA released.

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.370
Some of these glutamate related
molecules like aspartame

01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:17.120
or things are in the glutamate pathway

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.740
can increase PEA release.

01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.860
And then some people
will actually take PEA

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:25.340
in supplement form for its
mild stimulant properties

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:29.010
as well as for increasing
the perception of,

01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:31.580
or the ability to experience pleasure.

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.930
It's not a sledgehammer.

01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:35.672
It's not like dopamine itself.

01:53:35.672 --> 01:53:39.310
People that take things
like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA

01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:41.850
or drugs of abuse, which I
certainly don't recommend

01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:44.760
things like cocaine or amphetamine

01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:47.950
experience tremendous
increases in dopamine,

01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:50.563
not so much increases in serotonin.

01:53:51.499 --> 01:53:55.210
Some people will take
serotonin in precursor form

01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:57.580
like 5HTP or serotonin itself,

01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:00.400
or they'll take the amino acid
precursor like tryptophan.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.420
I'm not saying these
things as recommendations

01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:04.500
for increasingly one sense of pleasure,

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:07.340
I'm describing them
because of what they do

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:10.010
generally falls into two categories.

01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:13.730
The first category is
to raise the foundation,

01:54:13.730 --> 01:54:17.400
what we call the tonic level
of dopamine and serotonin.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:22.400
So if levels of serotonin
and dopamine are too low,

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:27.500
it becomes almost impossible
to experience pleasure.

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.810
There's a so-called anhedonia.

01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:31.850
This is also described as depression.

01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:34.690
Although it needn't be
long-term depression.

01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:37.510
So certain drugs like antidepressants

01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:42.210
like Wellbutrin Bupropion
as it's commonly called

01:54:42.210 --> 01:54:44.310
or the so-called SSRI,

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:48.030
the serotonin selective
re-uptake inhibitors

01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:51.097
like Prozac, Zoloft and
similar will increase dopamine

01:54:51.097 --> 01:54:53.300
and serotonin respectively.

01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:57.490
They're not increasing the
peaks in those molecules.

01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:59.903
What we call the acute
release of those molecules,

01:54:59.903 --> 01:55:02.780
what they're doing is they're
raising the overall levels

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:03.613
of those molecules.

01:55:03.613 --> 01:55:05.610
They're raising the sort of foundation

01:55:05.610 --> 01:55:07.010
or the tide if you will,

01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:09.980
think about it as your mood
or your pleasure rather

01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.390
is like a boat, and if it's on the shore

01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:13.790
and it can't get out to sea,

01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:15.190
unless that tide is high enough,

01:55:15.190 --> 01:55:17.500
that's kind of the way to
think about these tonic levels

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.050
of dopamine and serotonin.

01:55:19.050 --> 01:55:20.860
Now, most of us fortunately,

01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:25.190
do not have problems with our
baseline or autonic levels

01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:26.991
of dopamine and serotonin release.

01:55:26.991 --> 01:55:31.070
Things like PEA in that case
will cause a slight increase

01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:36.070
in that tide and make the
ability of certain experiences

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.240
to increase dopamine
further more available.

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.130
What we call this in neurosciences
so-called gain control.

01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.140
I can kind of turn up the volume,

01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:48.000
bring us closer to the threshold

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.580
to activate certain circuits.

01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:51.170
And this is really what we mean

01:55:51.170 --> 01:55:54.390
when we say a neuromodulator, okay?

01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:57.870
This is why when you are
very happy about something,

01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:59.360
let's say you're out with your friends.

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.040
You're really excited.

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.330
Maybe depending on where
you live and what's going on

01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:04.730
in your area of the world right now,

01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:07.950
like I have a niece and she's
been locked up in quarantine

01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:10.270
for a long time recently
because it was deemed safe.

01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:11.620
She got to go to summer camp.

01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:13.622
I have never seen that kid so happy

01:56:13.622 --> 01:56:16.733
to spend with her friends.

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:20.600
She was so excited and
it was really amazing

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.680
to see how excited she was.

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:24.740
Her baseline levels of
dopamine were clearly up

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:28.230
so much so that when she saw her friends,

01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:30.600
she literally started squealing.

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:31.970
They were squealing, she was squealing.

01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:32.803
Everyone was squealing.

01:56:32.803 --> 01:56:33.790
I wasn't squealing.

01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:35.180
I would admit it if I was squealing.

01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.800
I wasn't squealing, but it
was such a delight to see

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.890
and I'm sure that made
my dopamine levels go up,

01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:43.127
which was, she was just so
excited such that anything

01:56:43.127 --> 01:56:45.060
and everything felt like
an exciting stimulus.

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.860
This is pleasure, right?

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.650
And I don't want to
write off the experience

01:56:48.650 --> 01:56:51.650
from an neuro-biological
reductionist standpoint,

01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:52.483
quite the opposite.

01:56:52.483 --> 01:56:55.620
It's really beautiful to
see again this principle

01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.880
that different experiences
and the experience of pleasure

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.060
from different things.

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.450
Seeing your friends for the first time,

01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:04.210
summer camp for a kid,

01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:08.070
whatever it might happen to
be use the same currency,

01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:11.430
dopamine use the same currency serotonin.

01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.050
And this is a principle that I hope

01:57:13.050 --> 01:57:14.400
in listening to this podcast

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.190
and even some of it's repetitive features

01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:17.853
from one episode to the next.

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.810
I'm hoping that those will
start to embed in your mind

01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:24.140
that the brain and body
use these common currencies

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.580
for different experiences.

01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:28.760
So yes, if your dopamine and
serotonin, or I should say

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:32.810
if your dopamine and or
serotonin levels are too low,

01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:34.860
it will be very hard to achieve pleasure

01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:37.410
to experience physical
pleasure or emotional pleasure

01:57:37.410 --> 01:57:38.700
of any kind.

01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:40.750
That's why treatments of the sort

01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:43.770
that I described a minute
ago might be right for you.

01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:45.530
Obviously we can't determine
if they're right for you.

01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:47.170
It's also why they have side effects.

01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:49.930
If you artificially
increase these molecules

01:57:49.930 --> 01:57:51.660
they're associated with pleasure,

01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.990
oftentimes you get a lack of motivation

01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:55.410
to go seek things like food.

01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:57.207
People don't get much
interest in food 'cause

01:57:57.207 --> 01:58:00.300
why should they if their
serotonin levels are already up.

01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:02.566
Again, there's a ton of
individual variation.

01:58:02.566 --> 01:58:05.140
I don't want to say that
these antidepressants

01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:06.380
are always bad.

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:08.340
Sometimes they've saved lives.

01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:09.670
They've saved millions of lives.

01:58:09.670 --> 01:58:10.960
Sometimes people have side effects

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.560
that make them not the right choice.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.860
So it has to be determined
for the individual.

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.690
Things like PEA or a more subtle effect.

01:58:18.690 --> 01:58:21.640
I should mention PEA
supplementation is something

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:24.600
that a number of people use
but it's very short-lived.

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.414
Because of the half-life of
this molecule was very brief,

01:58:27.414 --> 01:58:31.312
the effect only lasts
about 20 minutes or so.

01:58:31.312 --> 01:58:34.400
Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.860
lead to longer baseline
increases in dopamine.

01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:42.140
But remember, any time
you raise a baseline,

01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:46.240
you reduce the so-called signal to noise.

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.120
What it means is if you're riding around

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.210
at really high dopamine, at first,

01:58:50.210 --> 01:58:51.830
everything will start to seem exciting

01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:53.770
like my niece and seeing her
friends for the first time.

01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:54.906
Everything's exciting.

01:58:54.906 --> 01:58:57.510
But then what will happen
is when your dopamine levels

01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:59.660
return to more normal levels,

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:02.396
it will take a much
greater dopamine increase

01:59:02.396 --> 01:59:06.060
of much bigger event,
more novel, more exciting

01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:09.030
in order to achieve the sense that

01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:11.410
what you're experiencing is pleasureful.

01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:13.440
And this is because of the relationship

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:15.460
between pleasure and pain.

01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:17.670
Now, in a future episode
we are going to go deep

01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:20.360
into this relationship
between pleasure and pain,

01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:23.270
but just briefly as a precursor to that

01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:25.690
and because it's relevant
to the conversation

01:59:25.690 --> 01:59:26.840
that we've been having,

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.750
you might want to be
wary of any experience,

01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:34.760
any experience, no matter how it arrives,

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:38.520
chemical, physical, emotional,
or some combination,

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:41.150
you might want to be wary
of letting your dopamine go

01:59:41.150 --> 01:59:43.320
too high and certainly you want to be wary

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.240
of it going too low.

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.580
Because of the way that
these circuits adjust.

01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:50.450
Basically every time that the
pleasure system is kicked in

01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:54.220
in high gear, an absolutely
spectacular event,

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.603
you cannot be more ecstatic.

01:59:56.603 --> 02:00:01.603
There is a mirror symmetric
activation of the pain system.

02:00:02.130 --> 02:00:05.780
And this might seem like
an evil curse of biology,

02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:06.613
but it's not.

02:00:06.613 --> 02:00:09.465
This is actually a way to
protect this whole system

02:00:09.465 --> 02:00:11.820
of reward and motivation
that I talked about

02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:14.170
at the beginning of the episode.

02:00:14.170 --> 02:00:16.430
It might sound great to
just ingest substances

02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:17.470
or engage in behaviors

02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:19.120
where it's just dopamine,
dopamine, dopamine,

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.480
and just constantly be motivated,

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:24.010
but the system will eventually crash.

02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:25.990
And so what happens is when
you have a big increase

02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:28.840
in dopamine, you also
will get a big increase

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.980
in the circuits that underlie
our sense of disappointment

02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.990
and re adjusting the balance.

02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:38.040
And with repeated exposure
to high levels of dopamine,

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:40.770
not naturally occurring wonderful events,

02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:45.770
but really high chemically
induced peaks in dopamine,

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:49.260
high magnitude, chemically
induced peaks in dopamine.

02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:51.340
What happens is those peaks in dopamine

02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:55.210
start to go down and down and
down in response to the same,

02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:57.820
what ought to be incredible experience.

02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:01.420
We start to what's called
habituate or attenuate,

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:05.850
and yet the pain increases in size.

02:01:05.850 --> 02:01:09.540
And this has a preservative
function in keeping us safe,

02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:11.040
believe it or not.

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.380
But what I just described
is actually the basis

02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:16.150
of most if not all, forms of addiction

02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:17.400
something that we will deal with

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.410
in a future episode in depth.

02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:20.860
So what should you think about all?

02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:21.950
How should you think about pleasure

02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:23.400
and how should you think about pain?

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:25.270
What is too much pleasure?

02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:28.860
Well, that's going to differ
from person to person,

02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:33.420
but to the extent that one
can access pleasure repeatedly

02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:37.680
over time, ideally without
chemical augmentation,

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:40.050
certainly not excessive
chemical augmentation,

02:01:40.050 --> 02:01:42.700
that means that this pleasure
system is tuned up well

02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.500
and can continue to experience pleasure.

02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:47.580
However, if you find yourself engaging

02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:50.120
in the same behavior over and over again,

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.920
but achieving less and
less pleasure from it,

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.360
chances are you want to adjust down

02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.963
how often you engage in that behavior.

02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:04.430
And or adjust down your
expectation of reward

02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:06.623
every time you engage in that behavior.

02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:08.950
What do I mean by that?

02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:10.360
Well, at the beginning of the episode

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:14.230
I talked about how dopamine
will allow us to get

02:02:14.230 --> 02:02:15.820
into bouts of hard work.

02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.940
We will work very hard to pursue a reward,

02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.440
and that's really what dopamine does.

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:21.840
And then when the reward comes

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:24.070
that doesn't increase our dopamine.

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:26.243
In fact, our dopamine levels go down.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.610
One of the key things that we can all do

02:02:30.610 --> 02:02:34.310
to adjust our ability
to experience pleasure

02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:38.890
is to engage in that
intermittent reward schedule.

02:02:38.890 --> 02:02:41.620
You can either adjust
down the peak in dopamine,

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.480
meaning not let yourself
ever get too happy,

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.580
but that's no fun, right?

02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:47.820
Life is about occasionally achieving

02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:49.610
or experiencing ecstasy,

02:02:49.610 --> 02:02:52.860
but every once in a
while, remove the reward.

02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.320
And of course, I don't
mean ecstasy the drug

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.210
that's a separate matter.

02:02:55.210 --> 02:02:56.970
The MDMA trials are a separate matter.

02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:58.210
Very interesting, I want to be clear.

02:02:58.210 --> 02:03:01.290
I meant psychological and physical ecstasy

02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:03.230
of the natural sort.

02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:06.960
I've immense interest in what's
going on in the MDMA trials,

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.400
but just for clarity purposes,

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.470
that's a separate topic that we will cover

02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:14.390
in an episode very soon.

02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:17.290
So how do you adjust this dopamine system?

02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:20.060
Well, every once in a while at random,

02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:22.660
not in a predictable way,

02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:26.550
you remove the reward
and that will keep you

02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:30.070
and your dopamine system
tune up in the proper ways.

02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:32.640
The gain of the dopamine
system, as we say,

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.930
will be adjusted so that you can continue

02:03:34.930 --> 02:03:37.260
to experience dopamine and serotonin

02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:38.910
when you actually get the reward.

02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.900
This can be translated into a huge number

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:43.950
of different domains,

02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:46.380
but I want to give some
examples because I'm sure

02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:47.320
that many of you are asking,

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.490
wait, what does this actually mean?

02:03:48.490 --> 02:03:50.260
Okay, let's say you're a student,

02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:52.870
or this could be a student in academia,

02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:56.220
or this could be a student
of a physical practice.

02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:59.113
Every once in a while when
you do something really well,

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.580
maybe that's even just
showing up to the practice

02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:04.752
rather than pat yourself on the back,

02:04:04.752 --> 02:04:07.070
just tell yourself
yeah, that's the minimum

02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:08.150
that's expected of me.

02:04:08.150 --> 02:04:10.620
When everyone's excited about
something that you're doing,

02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:12.120
maybe you're excited about it,

02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.860
try and adjust down your
excitement a little bit.

02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:16.910
I know this might seem counterintuitive,

02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:20.180
but you're preserving the
ability to experience excitement

02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:21.980
in a variety of contexts.

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.530
Let's say you get a big monetary award.

02:04:25.530 --> 02:04:27.750
Well, that's great.

02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:28.680
I'm happy for you.

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:30.340
And that's wonderful.

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:32.839
However, you should be a little bit wary

02:04:32.839 --> 02:04:34.800
if you care about your dopamine system

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.930
and you care about your ability

02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:39.760
to get subsequent monetary
rewards, excuse me,

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.580
awards rewards doesn't
matter which through effort,

02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:44.580
if you want to be able
to maintain the ability

02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:47.130
to exert effort, well,
then you probably wouldn't

02:04:47.130 --> 02:04:49.500
want to run out and
immediately buy something

02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.200
with that monetary reward.

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:52.650
In other words, you
wouldn't want to layer on

02:04:52.650 --> 02:04:55.560
more dopamine release, okay?

02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:57.830
You might, but you might not.

02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:59.160
You might skip it.

02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.188
What you'll find then
is that your motivation

02:05:01.188 --> 02:05:03.110
is essentially infinite.

02:05:03.110 --> 02:05:05.510
This is what I described at
the beginning of the episode.

02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:08.710
And again, it's because
dopamine is this currency.

02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:10.987
It's like these days you
hear a lot about Bitcoin,

02:05:10.987 --> 02:05:14.540
and Ethereum, and
Dogecoin, and USs dollars,

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.740
and Euros and other stuff.

02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:20.780
But the currency that you use in your body

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:23.170
doesn't matter what
external currency those are.

02:05:23.170 --> 02:05:24.740
In fact, as you watch the value

02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:26.240
of different currencies go up

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:29.100
whether or not it's cryptocurrency
or standard currency,

02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.610
the value is actually
reflective of the dopamine

02:05:31.610 --> 02:05:33.850
that exists inside of people.

02:05:33.850 --> 02:05:36.450
So all the excitement
about a particular currency

02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:39.660
crypto or otherwise is
really just dopamine.

02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:42.930
That's the currency that we all use.

02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:44.710
And there's no negotiating that.

02:05:44.710 --> 02:05:46.790
That's just the way that we're built.

02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:48.830
Now, to give yet other examples.

02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:51.140
Let's say you're teaching other
people how to do something

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:53.360
and they do something exceptionally well.

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.770
If you reward them every single time.

02:05:55.770 --> 02:05:58.030
and in particular, if you
reward them with something

02:05:58.030 --> 02:06:00.950
that's even greater than the
experience of what they did.

02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:02.860
So let's say kids win a soccer game

02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:04.140
and they're ecstatic.

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.160
They're jumping all over the place.

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:07.780
They're super excited and you reward them

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:10.950
with an even bigger
experience, a celebration,

02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:14.550
you are actually inhibiting their ability

02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:17.680
to perform the same set of activities

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:21.080
that led them to the win if,
and I really want to underscore

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.960
if you reward them every time.

02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:26.290
Of course we should
reward kids and each other

02:06:26.290 --> 02:06:28.430
and ourselves for our accomplishments,

02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:30.820
but you don't want to do it every time.

02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:33.030
And sure there will be some disappointment

02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:37.890
from suddenly removing the
reward that you expected,

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.210
but that's exactly the point.

02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:41.860
That's what keeps these
circuits tuned up properly.

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.340
Now there's the other form of pleasure,

02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:47.080
which is the more immediate visceral

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.270
or sensory experience of pleasure.

02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:51.760
This is distinct from goals
and goal-directed behavior.

02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:53.350
I'm talking about the
immediate experience.

02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:55.830
This is more of the serotonergic system.

02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:57.600
There are other systems involved too,

02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:58.750
but this is also the system

02:06:58.750 --> 02:07:02.890
that draws out those endogenous opioids

02:07:02.890 --> 02:07:04.140
from a particular structure.

02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:06.510
We have a structure in the
back of our brain called PAG

02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:10.040
P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area.

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:13.340
Very interesting brain area
that is associated with pain,

02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:16.500
but also with pleasure because
under certain conditions,

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:20.006
it deploys endogenous opioids and gives us

02:07:20.006 --> 02:07:22.300
a kind of blissed out feeling.

02:07:22.300 --> 02:07:25.630
This is not like the opioids
of the opioid epidemic sort

02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:27.715
that people take and
unfortunately have led

02:07:27.715 --> 02:07:30.490
to tremendous amounts
of suffering and abuse.

02:07:30.490 --> 02:07:33.000
These are endogenously released opioids.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.430
These are the kinds of
opioids that come out

02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:38.090
from long distance bouts of
physical exercise and running.

02:07:38.090 --> 02:07:40.170
These are the opioids that are deployed

02:07:40.170 --> 02:07:42.300
in response to giving birth

02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:45.830
and overcoming the tremendous
pain of childbirth.

02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:50.090
So PAG is very contextual
and there are few types

02:07:50.090 --> 02:07:53.840
of stimuli or I should
say events in life...

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:55.310
I'm really showing my nerdy side.

02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:56.780
There are a few types of stimulate,

02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:00.790
I'm talking about experiences
that evoke endogenous opioid

02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:02.300
release from PAG.

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:05.050
One is sexual activity.

02:08:05.050 --> 02:08:08.430
Sexual activity can
increase pain threshold.

02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:12.850
And here I am not suggesting
or getting involved

02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:15.550
in anyone's particular proclivities
or personal experiences.

02:08:15.550 --> 02:08:18.060
You're welcome to editorialize
this however you like,

02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:21.230
however, what I'm talking
about are animal data

02:08:21.230 --> 02:08:23.230
and yes, human data as well,

02:08:23.230 --> 02:08:25.300
that show that pain
thresholds are increased

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:28.450
anytime PAG is activated
because of the release

02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:30.173
of these endogenous opioids.

02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:35.070
There's also the immediate experience

02:08:35.070 --> 02:08:37.260
of whether or not a
particular form of touch

02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.820
is pleasureful or not.

02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.780
And there there's some
very interesting biology

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:43.470
that relates to really
how those little wires

02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:45.543
from those DRGs innovate our skin.

02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:50.430
Work studies I should say
done by David Ginty's lab

02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:51.540
at Harvard Medical School,

02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:54.200
the Ginty lab has spent years working

02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:56.570
on the somata sensory
system, the touch system

02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:00.420
has identified a particular
category of neurons

02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:01.769
that innervate the skin
and then those neurons

02:09:01.769 --> 02:09:04.660
of course send that information
up to the brain too.

02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.460
And they actually respond
to direction of touch.

02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.270
Now, some of you might be more sensitive

02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:13.120
to this than others, but it turns out that

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:17.853
certain hairs like to be
deflected one way versus another.

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:22.040
Whether you like cats or not,
you can do this experiment.

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:25.160
You can pet a cat in the
direction that they're fur lies.

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:26.780
So it lies down in a particular direction.

02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:28.090
You'll notice that there's actually a gene

02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:29.720
that dictates that the hairs lie down

02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.830
in a particular direction.

02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:33.830
And if you pet them in a way that's

02:09:36.330 --> 02:09:38.130
co-operating with that direction.

02:09:38.130 --> 02:09:39.370
So not pushing the hairs up,

02:09:39.370 --> 02:09:42.580
but rather stroking the
hairs on the back of the cat.

02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:44.100
Well, you'll notice as
they often like that.

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:45.910
Not all cats some cats are pretty grouchy,

02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:48.280
but if you stroke their hair,

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.310
they will often per,
they'll often push into you.

02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:53.860
If you were to stroke their
hair in the opposite direction,

02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:56.220
pushing the hairs up against the direction

02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:59.227
that they want to lie down,
cats do not like that.

02:09:59.227 --> 02:10:01.170
And it turns out that people
don't like that either.

02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:03.080
Some people do like to
have their hair pushed

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.270
in a direction against the direction

02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:07.060
in which it wants to lay down.

02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:10.800
But there is more typically response

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.250
a feeling like it's
pleasureful for instance,

02:10:13.250 --> 02:10:14.860
when someone brushes or combs their hair

02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.430
in the direction that
it wants to lay down.

02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:19.210
And that's because the way
in which these neurons,

02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:22.160
they innovate these hairs
sends information up

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.840
to the brain bifurcates actually,

02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:25.780
it splits into brain centers

02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:28.550
that evoke a sense of pleasure
or a sense of not pleasure.

02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:30.170
It's not necessarily pain.

02:10:30.170 --> 02:10:34.060
So you might find that certain
people are very particular.

02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:36.240
They like to be touched in a
certain way, but not others.

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:37.880
You might be one of those people.

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.430
And areas of our skin
that have high density

02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:45.430
of receptors are very, very
sensitive in a real way,

02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:49.640
in a real sense of the
word to patterns of touch

02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:53.730
and whether or not a touch
is too firm or too light.

02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:58.600
And that will be modulated
by overall levels of arousal.

02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.820
And when I talk about arousal,

02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:02.510
what I'm talking about is how
alert or how sleep we are.

02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:05.320
It is impossible to experience pain

02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:07.660
when we are deep in sleep.

02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:09.650
I don't mean sleeping like
of the typical night's sort.

02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:10.850
I mean, of the anesthesia sort.

02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:13.400
That's the purpose of anesthesia
to bring the brain and body

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:16.810
into a deep plane of
rest, very deep in fact,

02:11:16.810 --> 02:11:21.210
and it's very hard if
not impossible to achieve

02:11:21.210 --> 02:11:24.750
or experience pleasure when
we are in a very low state

02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:26.370
of arousal as well.

02:11:26.370 --> 02:11:29.120
When we are in heightened
states of arousal,

02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.160
we can achieve pain,
we can experience pain

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:34.063
and we can experience pleasure.

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:37.573
And under those heightened
states of arousal,

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.020
we are more sensitive.

02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:43.120
Literally the passage
of electrical signals

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:45.230
from those locations on the body

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:48.670
that have heightened degrees
or higher degrees, I should say

02:11:48.670 --> 02:11:51.190
of receptors, use your imagination.

02:11:51.190 --> 02:11:53.590
They include the lips, the
face, the feet, and the genitals

02:11:53.590 --> 02:11:56.763
and nearby areas, literally nearby areas.

02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.660
Under conditions of higher
arousal two things happen,

02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:04.090
the ability to achieve
or experience pleasure

02:12:04.090 --> 02:12:05.970
at those locations goes up

02:12:05.970 --> 02:12:09.440
and our tolerance and our
threshold for pain also goes up.

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:12.760
So the principle here is that
as our levels of arousal,

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:15.540
that foundation of
arousal goes up or down,

02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:18.390
so too goes up and down our ability

02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:20.370
to achieve pleasure and pain.

02:12:20.370 --> 02:12:22.566
And so these two extremes of
being deep within anesthesia

02:12:22.566 --> 02:12:26.410
or another extreme as asleep

02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:28.760
or an heightened levels of arousal,

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:30.460
our ability to achieve pleasure and pain

02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.580
are going to scale according to those.

02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:35.260
And this is why, and I'm
certainly not suggesting this,

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:38.890
but this is why some
people will take stimulants

02:12:38.890 --> 02:12:41.070
or drugs of abuse that increase arousal

02:12:41.070 --> 02:12:44.260
in order to achieve
pleasure of other kinds.

02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:46.590
The problem is is that
those drugs in particular

02:12:46.590 --> 02:12:49.810
are things like cocaine and
methamphetamine and amphetamine

02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:51.960
become their own form of reinforcement

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:56.150
so much so that the
person doesn't seek out

02:12:56.150 --> 02:12:59.023
any other form of excitement or arousal.

02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:02.850
So today we weren't
talking about addiction.

02:13:02.850 --> 02:13:05.010
We weren't necessarily
talking about motivation,

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:07.270
but we touched on those
topics as sort of a precursor

02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:08.910
of what's to come.

02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:11.780
We talked about the pathways
in the skin and in the brain

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.230
and elsewhere in the body

02:13:13.230 --> 02:13:15.020
that control our sense
of pleasure and pain.

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:17.270
We described a number of
different tools ranging

02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:19.110
from hypnosis to different supplements,

02:13:19.110 --> 02:13:23.380
to electroacupuncture
and various other tools

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.990
that one could use to modulate your sense

02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:26.740
of pleasure or pain.

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:28.940
And of course, in thinking about pleasure,

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:30.137
we have to think about the dopamine system

02:13:30.137 --> 02:13:31.187
and the serotonin system

02:13:31.187 --> 02:13:33.560
and some of the related chemical systems.

02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:35.060
I realized that today's podcast

02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:37.570
had a lot of scientific details.

02:13:37.570 --> 02:13:39.020
We've timestamped everything for you

02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:42.350
so that you don't have to
digest it all at once of course

02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:44.040
I don't expect that everyone would be able

02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:46.395
to understand all these
details all at once.

02:13:46.395 --> 02:13:49.890
What's more important
really is to understand

02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:52.100
the general principles of how something

02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:53.690
like pleasure and pain work.

02:13:53.690 --> 02:13:56.390
How they interact, and
the very seldom systems

02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:58.780
within the brain and body
that allow them to occur

02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:02.470
and that modulator or change
their ability to occur.

02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:04.450
And of course your subjective experience

02:14:04.450 --> 02:14:05.720
of pleasure or pain.

02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.230
So I do hope that this was
on hole more pleasureful

02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:10.600
than painful for you.

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:13.200

02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:40.200
There are other ways to
support the podcast as well.

02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.953
We have a Patreon that's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:45.730
And there you can support the podcast

02:14:45.730 --> 02:14:47.580
at any level that you like.

02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:49.450
In addition, please check out our sponsors

02:14:49.450 --> 02:14:51.810
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:53.750
We only work with sponsors and brands

02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:55.970
that we absolutely love their products

02:14:55.970 --> 02:14:57.610
and that we wholeheartedly endorse,

02:14:57.610 --> 02:14:59.080
and that we use ourselves.

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:01.360
In addition, we've partnered with Thorne.

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:02.940
Thorne as a supplement company,

02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:04.050
and we've partnered with them

02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:06.290
because they have the
highest levels of stringency

02:15:06.290 --> 02:15:09.020
in terms of the quality of
the ingredients they use

02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:11.570
and the quantity of the
ingredients they use.

02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:13.775
By quantity I mean that unlike a lot

02:15:13.775 --> 02:15:15.940
of supplement companies out there,

02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:18.800
the amounts that are listed
on the bottle are absolutely

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:22.250
what you find in those capsules
and tablets in the bottle.

02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:27.250
If you go to Thorne that's
T-H-O-R-N-E/U/Huberman,

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:30.930
you can see the supplements that I take

02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:33.800
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:36.770
as well as any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:38.960
Just go into the Thorne
site through that portal,

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.410
thorne/u/huberman and
even if you navigate off

02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:45.130
from that location in the site,

02:15:45.130 --> 02:15:47.880
you'll get 20% off any of the
items that you might select

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.940
from other locations
within the Thorne site.

02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.500
If you're not already
following us on Instagram,

02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.690
it's Huberman Lab at Instagram,

02:15:54.690 --> 02:15:58.260
and there I do various
tutorials about neuroscience,

02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:01.650
offer neuroscience related
tools all backed by science.

02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:02.940
And last but not least,

02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:04.560
I thank you for your time and attention

02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.300
and thank you for your
interest in science.
