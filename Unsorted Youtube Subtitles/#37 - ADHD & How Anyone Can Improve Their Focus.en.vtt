00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:02.300
- Welcome to the Huberman lab podcast,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.441
for everyday life.

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:09.460
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.510
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.190
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.350
at Stanford school of medicine.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.460
Today, we are going to talk
all about attention deficit,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.710
hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.340
We are also going to talk
about normal levels of focus.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.930
What are normal levels of
focus and how all of us,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.280
whether or not we have ADHD
or not can improve our ability

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.610
to focus our ability to
rule out distraction.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.030
It turns out those are
two separate things,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.220
as well as remember information better.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.740
We are also going to talk about

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.770
how we can learn to relax while focusing,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.050
which turns out to be a critical
component of learning new

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.890
information and for coming
up with new creative ideas.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.130
So whether or not you have
ADHD or know someone who does,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.660
or if you're somebody who feels
that they do not have ADHD,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.980
but would simply like to
improve their ability to focus

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.750
or to be more creative.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.253
This episode is definitely
for you as well.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.960
We are going to talk
about drug based tools

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.870
that are out there.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.040
We are going to talk
about behavioral tools.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.250
We will talk about the role
of diet and supplementation,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.440
and we will talk about new emerging

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.810
brain machine interface devices,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.570
things like transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120
If you don't know what
that is, don't worry,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.630
I will explain it to you.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.710
These are non-invasive methods
for rewiring your brain

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.570
in order to make focusing
more natural for you

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.910
and to teach you how to
increase your depth of focus.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.380
Now, just a quick reminder

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.110
that any time we discuss
a psychiatric disorder,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.120
it's important that we remember

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.060
that all of us have the
temptation to self-diagnose

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.010
or to diagnose others.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.590
So, as I list off some of
the symptomology of ADHD,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.670
some of that symptomology
might resonate with you.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.870
You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.840
or you might decide that someone you know,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.230
definitely has ADHD.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.240
However, it is very important
that you don't self-diagnose

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.330
or diagnose somebody else

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.470
the clear and real diagnosis of ADHD

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.670
really should be carried out
by a psychiatrist, a physician,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.590
or a very well-trained
clinical psychologist.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.120
There are clear criteria
for what constitutes

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.120
full-blown ADHD.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.080
However, many of us have
constellations of symptoms

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.030
that make us somewhat
like somebody with ADHD

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.870
and if you're struggling
with focus nowadays,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.020
as a lot of people are because of stress,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.130
because of smartphone use,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.910
which turns out can induce adult ADHD.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.519
We'll talk about that.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.950
We'll then pay attention
to the symptomology.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.210
You may actually require
professional treatment

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.370
you might not,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.590
equally important is to remember

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.990
that some of the terms that we cover,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.810
like impulse control and
attention and concentration

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.510
are somewhat subjective and
they can change over time.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.000
Sometimes we have a better
level of attention than others.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.320
Maybe it depends on how we slept

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.040
or other events going on in our life

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.238
where something that
we're entirely unaware of.

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:11.970
The important thing to remember

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.040
is that we can all improve
our attentional capacity.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.570
We can all rewire the circuits
that make heightened levels

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.180
of focus, more accessible to us.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.060
We can do that through multiple
types of interventions,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.690
and we are going to cover all
those interventions today.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.110
Before we march into the material,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.150
I'd like to remind that
this podcast is separate

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.370
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.500
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.360
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.280
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.420
And keeping with that theme,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.300
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.234
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:49.480
Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.633
that are of the utmost quality.

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:54.280
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.860
and I can tell you that
there are many features

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.490
built into our visual system

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.420
that allows us to see things clearly,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.810
whether or not we are in shade

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.830
or bright sunlight, et cetera.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.650
A lot of sunglasses have the problem

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.760
that you have to constantly take them off

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.760
and put them back on again,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.750
because of changes in background
luminance, as we call it,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.710
Roka, sunglasses have solved this problem.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.140
It doesn't matter if you're
standing in tree shade

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.440
or a bright light, or what have you,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.750
you can always see things
with perfect clarity

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.630
and that shows that they really understand

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.580
the way that the visual system works

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.690
and their eyeglasses
are built accordingly.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.360
I wear readers at night,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.990
so I wear eye glasses to read at night,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.420
or when I drive at night and their readers

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.600
and eyeglasses are terrific as well.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.670
One thing I like so much
about their eyeglasses

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.197
and their sunglasses
is that despite being,

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.410
"Performance glasses" mean
you can wear them on running

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.360
or swimming or biking, they
don't fall off your face,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.280
even if you get sweaty,
they're very lightweight.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.950
You don't even notice that they're on

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.590
is that the aesthetic is really good.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.880
A lot of performance glasses,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.640
they look kind of ridiculous, frankly,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.530
they make people look like cyborgs,

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.760
but their aesthetics are terrific,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.910
they have a lot of different styles,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.120
you can select from.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.150
The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.370
from Stanford and everything
about their sunglasses

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.870
and eyeglasses were designed
with optical clarity

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.320
and performance in mind.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.130
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Belcampo.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.350
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.010
that raises organic grass fed

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.030
and finished certified humane meat.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.030
I tend to eat meat about once a day.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.730
So typically I'll fast
until about noon or one

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.100
and then my lunch consists
of a small piece of steak

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.980
or chicken and some salad

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.400
and then I tend to eat my
carbohydrates in the evening

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.690
before I go to sleep.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.230
Sometimes and especially
lately I'm eating my protein

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.500
earlier in the day

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.960
because I'm playing around
with some of the findings

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.850
related to protein
intake early in the day.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.360
But regardless, I'm eating
meat about once a day.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.000
For me, it's extremely important

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.080
that any meat that I consume

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.070
come from humanely raised animals

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.750
and that the meat be of
the very highest quality.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.780
So with Belcampo meets the
animals graze on open pastures

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.990
and seasonal grasses,
which results in meats,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.080
that's much higher in
nutrients and healthy fats,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.160
including omega-3s,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.470
which I've talked a lot
about on this podcast,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.060
the importance of
omega-3s for heart health,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.370
for brain health, for mood, et cetera.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.230
Personally, I love their rib eye steaks,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.260
their New York steaks,
their chicken is terrific

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.070
and I also liked the organic meatballs.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.270
All the elk meat is organic and grass fed,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.040
and grass-finished, if
you'd like to try Belcampo,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.040
first time customers can get 20% off

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.840
by going to belcampo.com/Huberman

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.270
and using the code Huberman at checkout.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.960
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix sleep.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.530
Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.530
that are absolutely second to none.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.670
I started sleeping on a
Helix mattress about eight,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.540
nine months ago, and I've
never slept better in my life.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.730
If you go to the Helix site,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.820
they have a short two minute quiz,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.700
and that quiz asks you questions like,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.760
do you sleep on your back?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.610
Do you sleep on your side?

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.480
Do you sleep on your stomach?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.470
Do you tend to run hot or cold
in the middle of the night?

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.320
Maybe you don't know

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.480
and they actually have an
option to select, I don't know

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.040
and Helix will match you to a mattress

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.850
that specific to your sleep needs.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.230
It turns out to be really important.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.880
Some people have the tendency to run hot

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.713
and sleep on their stomach.

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:11.030
Other people lie on their back

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.490
and they're waking up cold
in the middle of the night.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.520
So you really need a mattress

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.500
that's matched to your sleep needs.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.370
I did that and I matched to
the dusk mattress, D-U-S-K

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.270
and it turns out to be perfect
for me and my sleep needs

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.000
as well their pillows are really terrific.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.830
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.900
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.120
take their two minutes sleep quiz,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.150
and they'll match you
to a customized mattress

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.260
and you'll get up to $200
off any of their mattresses

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.710
and you'll get two free
pillows with your order.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.140
They have a 10 year warranty.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.420
You have to try it out
for 100 nights risk-free

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.500
it's more than three months

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.350
and if you don't like it,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.700
they'll pick it up for you
and they'll take it away

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.310
and you get all your money back.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.670

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.260
So let's talk about ADHD,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.960
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.280
Let's also talk about focus and attention

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.120
and everybody's ability
to focus and attend

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.570
not just people with ADHD.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.150
We are also going to talk about tools

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.820
that would allow anyone,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.950
whether or not they have ADHD or not

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.943
to enhance their level of
concentration and focus.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.030
Now, ADHD used to be called
ADD Attention Deficit Disorder.

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:27.910
We have record of ADD in
the medical literature

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.640
dating back to as early as 1904.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.670
Now there's nothing special about 1904.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.110
That's just the first
time that it showed up

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.760
in the standard medical literature.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.240
We have to believe that ADD,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.350
which we now call ADHD existed before 1904

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.170
and probably long before 1904, why?

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.260
Well, because it has a
strong genetic component.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.840
If you have a close
relative that has ADHD,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.280
there's a much higher probability
that you will have ADHD

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.010
and that probability goes
up depending on how closely

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.090
related to that person you happen to be.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.923
So for instance,

00:09:02.923 --> 00:09:06.810
if you're an identical twin
and your twin has ADHD,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.880
there's a very high concordance as we say,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.890
a very high probability
that you will have ADHD

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.250
up to 75% chance.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.150
If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.620
that number goes down a
bit in the 50 to 60% range

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.550
and so on.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.600
If you have a parent with ADHD,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.860
that number ranges anywhere
from 10 to 25% likelihood,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.740
that you will have ADHD
if you have two parents

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.260
and so on and so on, okay?

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.750
So there's a genetic component

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.440
that genetic component it turns out,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.330
relates directly to how
specific neural circuits

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.990
in the brain wire up,

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.240
the chemicals they use and the
way they use those chemicals,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.253
a topic that we are going
to discuss in depth today.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.150
Now, if you have a close
relative with ADHD,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.500
that does not mean that
you are faded to have ADHD

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.860
and if you happen to have ADHD,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.670
there are ways to overcome those symptoms

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.140
of lack of attention,
impulsivity and so on.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.470
Another important point about ADHD

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.470
is that it has nothing
to do with intelligence,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.140
whether or not we're
talking about intelligence

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.164
measured by a standard IQ test

00:10:10.164 --> 00:10:13.040
a rather controversial issue
as many of you probably know,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.390
there are lots of forms of intelligence

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.430
that a standard IQ test
just wouldn't pick up

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.230
emotional intelligence,
musical intelligence,

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.283
spatial intelligence, all
sorts of intelligences.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.890
None of them are related to ADHD.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.980
Being very high functioning
doesn't make you

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.610
more likely to have ADHD and being ADHD

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.330
doesn't necessarily mean
that you have a low IQ.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.880
So there are people with
ADHD who have low IQs

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.920
people with ADHD with high IQ,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.580
people with ADHD with high
emotional IQ or with low IQ

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.630
in the emotional scale,
it's all over the place.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.040
The important point is that
your ability to attend and focus

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
does not relate to how smart
you are or your IQ of any type,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.060
not just a standard IQ.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.860
The renaming of the ADD to ADHD took place

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.340
in the mid to late 1980s

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.070
when the psychiatric community

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.920
and the psychological community

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.910
started taking better
notice of the fact that

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.850
so-called hyperactive kids
also had attentional issues.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.160
This might seem obvious,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.850
but there's been extensive
and ongoing revision

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.610
of the criteria for designating
a psychiatric disorder

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.253
and this is still an
ongoing process even today.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.380
So in the mid eighties,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.090
we started hearing about ADHD

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.150
and then gradually that term
ADD has been dropped away.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.680
However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.550
has led to much better
diagnosis and detection of ADHD.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.900
So right now the current
estimates are that

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.810
about one in 10 children
and probably more have ADHD.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.810
The current estimates are
anywhere from 10%, one in 10

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.800
to as high as 12%.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.910
Now, fortunately about half of those

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.740
will resolve with proper treatment,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.960
but the other half typically don't.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.700
The other thing that we
are seeing a lot nowadays

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.340
is increased levels of ADHD in adults

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.450
and there's some question
as to whether or not

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.410
those adults had ADHD that went undetected

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.030
during their childhood or whether or not

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.070
ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.940
due to the way that we are
interacting with the world

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.562
in particular smart phone use,

00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:34.563
the combination of email,
text, real-world interactions,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.640
multiple apps and streams
of media and social media

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.100
all coming in at once
trying to manage life.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.580
All of the things that are going on

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.130
are creating a kind of cloud
of poles on our attention

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.420
and so there is this
question to whether or not

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.100
we are creating ADHD in
adults that never had ADHD

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.123
prior to being an adult.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.680
So let's talk about attention

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.891
and first let's just define
what we mean by attention

00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:05.667
out there in the scientific literature

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:08.180
and in discussions about ADHD,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.810
we will hear things
like attention and focus

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.570
and concentration and impulse control

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.361
for sake of today's discussion,

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.820
attention, focus, and concentration

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.100
are essentially the same thing, okay?

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.210
We could split hairs and
the scientific literature

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.960
does split hairs about these.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.730
But if we want to understand the biology

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.750
and we want to have

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.520
a straightforward conversation about ADHD,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.470
if I say attention or focus,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.670
I'm basically referring to the same thing,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.120
unless I specify otherwise, okay?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.120
So people with ADHD have
trouble holding their attention.

00:13:41.197 --> 00:13:43.710
What is attention?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.610
Well, attention is perception.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.550
It's how we are perceiving
the sensory world.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.650
So just a little bit of neurobiology 101,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.690
we are sensing things all the time.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.410
There's information coming
into our nervous system

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.243
all the time.

00:13:57.243 --> 00:13:59.720
For instance, right now
you're hearing sound waves.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.740
You are seeing things,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.760
you are sensing things against your skin,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.765
but you're only paying
attention to some of those

00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:08.690
and the ones that you're
paying attention to

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.830
are your perceptions.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.880
So if you hear my voice,
you are perceiving my voice.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.850
You are not paying attention
to your other senses

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.070
at the moment, okay?

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.860
You might even be outside in a breeze

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.890
and until I said that,

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.970
you might not be perceiving that breeze,

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.920
but your body was sensing it all along.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.360
So attention and focus are
more or less the same thing,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.310
but impulse control is something
separate because impulse

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.900
control requires pushing out
or putting the blinders on

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.380
to sensory events in our environment.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.160
It means lack of perception,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.073
impulse control is about
limiting our perception.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.630
People with ADHD have poor attention

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.478
and they have high levels of impulsivity

00:14:50.478 --> 00:14:52.550
they're easily distractable.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.740
But the way that shows
up is very surprising.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.310
You might think that people with ADHD

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.330
just simply can't attend anything.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.790
They really can't focus,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.480
even if they really want to,
but that's simply not the case.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.650
People with ADHD yes,
they are distractable.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.050
Yes, they are impulsive.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.890
Yes, they are easily annoyed

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.490
by things happening in the room.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.290
They sometimes have a high
level of emotionality as well.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.010
Not always, but often

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.320
however people with ADHD
can have a hyper focus

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.090
and incredible ability to focus

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.480
on things that they really enjoy

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.820
or and are intrigued by.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.600
Now, this is a very important point

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.360
because typically we think
of somebody with ADHD

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.100
as being really wild and hyperactive,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.986
or having no ability whatsoever
to sit still and attend

00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:46.800
and while that phenotype as we call it

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.563
that contour of behavior
and cognition can exist,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.370
many people, if not all people with ADHD,

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.710
if you give them something
they really love,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.530
like if the child loves video games

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.340
or if a child loves to draw,

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.480
or if an adult loves a
particular type of movie

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.000
or a person very much, they
will obtain laser-focus

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.680
without any effort.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.090
So that tells us that people with ADHD

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.280
have the capacity to attend,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.210
but they can't engage that attention

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.580
for things that they don't
really, really want to do

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.730
and as we all know much of life,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.610
whether or not you're a child or an adult

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.730
involves doing a lot of things
that we don't want to do,

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.035
much of our schooling
involves doing things

00:16:30.035 --> 00:16:32.440
that we would prefer not to do

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.550
and sort of forcing ourselves
to do it, to attend,

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.420
even though we are not super interested

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.310
in what we are attending to.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.143
There are a couple other things

00:16:40.143 --> 00:16:43.760
that people with ADHD display quite often.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.620
One is challenges with time perception.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.100
Now time perception is
a fascinating aspect

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.080
of how our brain works

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.050
and later we're going to
talk about time perception

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.250
and how you can actually get
better at time perception.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.960
It's very likely that right
now you are doing things

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.000
that get in the way of
optimal time perception

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.030
and I will tell you how
to adjust your ability

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.863
to measure time with your brain.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.090
People with ADHD often run late.

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:14.010
They often procrastinate,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.700
but what's interesting and surprising

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.950
is that if they are given a deadline,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.940
they actually can perceive time very well

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.440
and they often can focus very well

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.220
if the consequences of
not completing a task

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.520
or not attending are severe enough.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.584
It's a little bit like the
way that people with ADHD

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:34.310
can really focus if they like something.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.820
Well, if they're scared
enough about the consequences

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.490
of not attending, oftentimes not always,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.063
but oftentimes they can attend.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.950
If they're not really
concerned about a deadline

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.361
or a consequence,

00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:48.770
well, then they tend to lose track of time

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.250
and they tend to underestimate
how long things will take.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.180
Now many people do that,
not just people with ADHD,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.840
but people with ADHD have challenges,

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.560
understanding how to line up
the activities of their day

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.680
in order to meet particular deadlines

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.150
even if it's just a simple thing,

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.290
like finishing one set
of tasks before lunch,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.830
oftentimes they will remember
that lunch starts at noon,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.980
but somehow they aren't able
to fill the intervening time

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.170
in a way that's productive

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.510
and they can obsess about

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.770
the upcoming deadline for instance,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.080
we will talk about how to remedy this.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.990
In addition,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:30.360
their spatial organization
skills are often subpar,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.850
not always, but often you will
find that somebody with ADHD

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.170
uses what's called the pile system

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.260
in order to organize things,

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.250
they will take many belongings

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.440
and this could be in the
kitchen or in their bedroom

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.600
or in their office or in any space

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.190
and they will start piling things up

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.060
according to a categorization system

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.410
that makes sense to them and only them.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.660
It doesn't really have
any logical framework.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.340
Now, many people use the pile system

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.420
and if you use the pile system,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.940
that doesn't mean that you have ADHD

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.580
in fact, if you're unpacking a house

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.230
or you've moved recently,

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.750
or you've received a lot
of presence recently,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.480
the pile system makes perfect
sense to organize your space.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.230
But people with ADHD
tend to organize things

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.700
according to the pile system all the time

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.700
and that pile system
doesn't work for them.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.980
Okay, so that's the key distinction

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.440
that they use a filing system,
and it's not really files,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.250
they're piling things up in a
way that makes sense to them,

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.270
but then it doesn't work for
them in terms of what tasks

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.080
they actually need to perform.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.560
They can't find things

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.730
or if anyone moves one thing
then it's very disruptive

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.730
to their overall plan
because their overall plan

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.140
doesn't really work in the first place.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.890
So that's a common
phenotype as we call it.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:42.730
A phenotype by the way,

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:47.670
is just an expression of a
particular set of underlying

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.420
genetic or psychological components, okay?

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.560
So we say the phenotype.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.460
So a phenotype can brown
hair and green eyes,

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.320
like for me,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.460
a phenotype could also be

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.610
that somebody uses the
piling system, okay?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.780
The other thing that people
with ADHD have real trouble with

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.950
is so-called working memory.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.480
Now you might think that people with ADHD

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.900
would have really poor memories,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.420
but in fact, that's not the case.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.890
People with ADHD often
can have a terrific memory

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.180
for past events,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.160
they can remember upcoming
events quite well.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.170
Their memory is clearly working.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.270
However, one aspect of
memory in particular

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.770
that we call working
memory is often disrupted.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.920
Working memory is the ability to keep

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.950
specific information online,

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.220
to recycle it in your
brain over and over again,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.620
so that you can use it in
the immediate or short term.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.070
A good example of this
would be you meet somebody,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.440
they tell you their name,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.240
they give you their phone number verbally,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.910
and you have to walk back to your phone

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.070
and enter it into your phone.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.440
People without ADHD might have
to put some effort into it,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.770
it might feel like a bit of a struggle,

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.100
but typically they will be able
to recite that phone number

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.790
in their mind over and over,
and then put into their phone.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.940
People with ADHD,

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.550
tend to lose the ability
or lack the ability

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.830
to remember things that they
just need to keep online for

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.170
anywhere from 10 seconds
to a minute or two, okay?

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.010
So a string of numbers like 6,
4, 3, 7, 8, 1 for most people

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.560
would be pretty easy.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.840
6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.170
you could probably remember
that a minute from now

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.810
without writing it down.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:23.250
But if you add one more number
to that 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3,

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.070
it gets tougher, okay?

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.370
So there's a reason why
phone numbers typically have

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.030
seven digits in them, of
course, there's an area code,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.530
but remembering information
that strings out longer

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.490
than seven numbers or a sentence or two

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.100
that's challenging for most people,

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.210
people with ADHD have severe challenges,

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.100
even with much smaller
batches of information

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.460
over even much smaller batches of time.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.130
Deficits in working memory are also

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.910
something that we see in people who have

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.460
frontotemporal dementia,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.110
so damage to the frontal lobes

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.410
or age-related cognitive decline

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.630
and so it will come as
no surprise that later

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.890
when we discuss treatments, supplements,

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.190
and other tools for ADHD,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.530
that many of those treatments,

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.970
supplements and tools for
ADHD are similar to the ones

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.793
that work for age-related
cognitive decline.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.350
Okay, so we've more or less established

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.160
the kind of menu of items that
people with ADHD tend to have

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.210
some have all of them.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.220
Some have just a subset of them.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.120
Their severity can range
from very intense to mild,

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.100
but in general,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.230
it's challenges with attention and focus,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.410
challenges with impulse control,
they get annoyed easily.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.810
They have kind of an impulsivity,

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.678
they can't stay on task.

00:22:41.678 --> 00:22:43.703
Time perception can be off,

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.980
they use the piling system

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.770
or a system that doesn't
work well for them

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.190
in order to organize their
things in physical space

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.630
and they have a hard time
with anything that's mundane

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.900
that they're not really interested in.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.650
But again, I just want to
highlight that people with ADHD

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.420
are able to obtain
heightened levels of focus,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.520
even hyper-focus for things
that are exciting to them

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.690
and that they really want to engage in.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.380
So now you have the
contour of what ADHD is,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.760
and if you're somebody
who doesn't have ADHD,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.919
you should also be asking
yourself which aspects of ADHD

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:20.640
are similar to things
I've experienced before.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.120
Because what we know
about the healthy brain

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.136
is that there's also a
range of abilities to focus.

00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:29.927
Some people focus very well on any task.

00:23:29.927 --> 00:23:33.760
You give them a task, they can
just laser in on that task.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.690
Other people that have to kind
of fight an internal battle,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.900
they have to convince themselves

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.210
that it's important or interesting.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.900
They have to kind of incentivize
themselves internally.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.670
Other people doesn't matter,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.940
they could be bored to
tears with the information,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.017
but they can do it just because they are,

00:23:50.017 --> 00:23:51.610
"Very disciplined people."

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.040
We tend to admire those people

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.690
but as you'll see a little bit later,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.040
it's not clear that that's the best way

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.750
to run your attentional system.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.940
There might be something to this business

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.050
of having heightened levels of attention

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.220
for the things that you are

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.323
most interested or excited by.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.750
So let's drill into this
issue of why people with ADHD

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.600
actually can focus very intensely
on things that they enjoy

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.863
and are curious about.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.350
Now, enjoyment and curiosity
are psychological terms,

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.950
they're not even really
psychological terms.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.570
They're just the way that we
describe our human experience

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.810
of liking things, wanting
to know more about them.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.540
But from a neuro-biological perspective,

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.800
they have a very clear
identity and signature

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.818
and that's dopamine.

00:24:36.818 --> 00:24:38.960
Dopamine is released from neurons,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.180
it's what we call a neuromodulator

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.540
and as a neuromodulator
it changes the activity

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.850
of the circuits in the brain,

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.061
such that certain circuits
are more active than others

00:24:49.061 --> 00:24:50.910
and in particular,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.850
dopamine creates a
heightened state of focus.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.570
It tends to contract our visual world

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.020
and it tends to make us
pay attention to things

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.130
that are outside and beyond
the confines of our skin.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.430
That's what we call exteroception.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.730
Dopamine also tends to put
us in a state of motivation

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.230
and wanting things outside
the confines of our skin.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.000
So whether or not we're pursuing something

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.560
physical in our world,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.879
or whether or not we're
pursuing information

00:25:19.879 --> 00:25:21.750
in our outside world,

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.840
dopamine is largely
responsible for our ability

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.199
and our drive to do that.

00:25:27.199 --> 00:25:30.810
But dopamine as a
neuromodulator is also involved

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.150
in changing the way that
we perceive the world.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.210
So, as I mentioned earlier

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.200
you have all these senses coming in

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.160
and you can only perceive some of them

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.802
because you're only paying
attention to some of them.

00:25:41.802 --> 00:25:45.630
Dopamine when it's released in our brain

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.910
tends to turn on areas of our brain

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.090
that narrow our visual focus

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.810
and our auditory focus,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.360
so it creates a cone
of auditory attention,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.680
that's very narrow,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.870
creates a tunnel of visual
attention that's very narrow.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.710
Whereas when we have less dopamine,

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.830
we tend to view the entire world,

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.940
we tend to see the whole
scene that we are in,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.470
we tend to hear everything all at once.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.062
So as I describe this,

00:26:09.062 --> 00:26:12.940
hopefully you're already
starting to see and understand

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:17.340
how having dopamine
release can allow a person,

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.050
whether or not they have ADHD or not

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.850
to direct their attention
to particular things

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.500
in their environment, all right?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.760
So now what we're doing is
we're moving away from attention

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.410
as this kind of vague ambiguous term,

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.550
and we're giving it a
neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.560
and we are giving it a
neural circuit identity

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.820
and just to put a little
bit of flavor and detail

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.650
on which neurocircuits those are,

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.590
I want to discuss two general
types of neurocircuits

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.990
that dopamine tends to enhance.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.560
So let's talk neurocircuits

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.280
and for those of you that
love hearing neuroscience,

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.180
nomenclature, you're
going to eat this part up

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.350
and for those of you that
don't like a lot of names

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.240
of brain areas I invite you to tune out

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.940
or just try and grab
the top contour of this.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.830
I will describe it in
pretty general terms,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.290
but I will give some detail
because I know there are

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.699
some of you out there who
really want to dig deeper into

00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:12.410
what the exact structures
and connectivities are, okay?

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.200
So there are two main
types of circuits that

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.550
we need to think about
with respect to ADHD,

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.060
attention and dopamine.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.130
The first one is called
the default mode network.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.750
The default mode network is
the network of brain areas

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.550
in your brain and my brain
and in everybody's brain

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.880
that is active when
we're not doing anything

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.290
when we're just sitting
there idle at rest.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.560
Now it's very hard to
not think about anything,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.780
but when you're not engaged
in any type of specific task,

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.180
so you're not driving, you're
not playing a video game,

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.570
you're not trying to study,
you're not trying to listen,

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.210
you're just sitting
there letting your brain

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.740
kind of go wherever it wants to go.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:53.083
Your default mode network
underlies that state of mind.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.940
The other set of circuits that
we're going to think about

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.630
and talk about with respect
to ADHD are the task networks,

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.920
the networks of the brain
that make you goal oriented,

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.410
or that are at least trying
to make you goal oriented

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.330
and those are a completely
different set of brain areas.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.760
However, the default mode network

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.520
and these tasks networks are
communicating with one another

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.240
and they're doing that
in very interesting ways.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.820
So first I want to describe how these two

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.010
sets of brain areas,

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.110
the default mode network

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.590
and the task networks
normally interact, okay?

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.010
So little bit of naming here

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.300
again feel free to ignore it

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.360
if you don't want this level of detail,

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.040
but the default mode network includes

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.350
an area called the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.828
frontal cortex, no surprises in the front

00:28:43.828 --> 00:28:45.360
and you have a dorsal, the top

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.070
and side lateral part
dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.480
You got one on each side
of your brain, right?

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.700
And then you have a brain area called

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.830
the posterior cingulate cortex

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.200
and then you have an area called
the lateral parietal lobe.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.990
Again, you don't need to
remember these names for,

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.550
these are three brain areas that normally

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.210
are synchronized in their activity.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.500
So when one of these areas is
active in a typical person,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.640
the other areas would be active as well.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.850
So it's a little bit
like a symphony or a band

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.200
like a three-piece band
is like drums, guitar,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.160
and bass they're playing together, okay?

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.890
That's how it is in a typical person

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.820
and in a person with ADHD,

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.550
or even a person who has subclinical ADHD

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.030
or in any human being
who hasn't slept well,

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.990
what you find is the default mode network

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.000
is not synchronized.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.823
These brain areas are just
not playing well together.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:37.690
Now the task networks include
a different set of structures.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.700
It still involves the prefrontal cortex,

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.980
but it's a different part of
the prefrontal cortex, okay?

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.700
Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.280
and there are some other brain areas

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.820
that the medial prefrontal
cortex is communicating to

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.260
all the time, mainly to suppress impulses.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.340
It's shutting down the desire to stand up

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.610
or to scratch the side of
your cheek or your nose,

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.950
if you're trying not to do that,

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.900
anytime you're restricting your behavior,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.227
These task directed networks
are very active, okay?

00:30:06.227 --> 00:30:10.260
Now normally in a person without ADHD,

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.050
the task networks and
the default mode networks

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.980
are going in kind of Seesaw fashion,

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.810
they are actually what
we call anti-correlated.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.760
So it's not just that
they are not correlated,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.850
they're actually opposing one another

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.333
they are anti-correlated.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.880
In a person with ADHD,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.510
the default mode networks
and the tasks networks

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.860
are actually more coordinated.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.100
That might come a surprising,

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.940
I think that we all have this tendency

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.000
to kind of jump to conclusion
and assume that somebody

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.820
who doesn't have an easy time
paying attention or has ADHD,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.550
that their brain must
be completely incoherent

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.900
that it's not working well

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.000
and because everything's out of whack,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.620
but there's something interesting
about people with ADHD

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.360
whereby the task networks
and the default mode networks

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.410
are actually working together
in a way that's correlated

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.770
and that is what's abnormal.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.120
So this would be like the
guitar bass and the drums

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.610
playing together in a way where

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.010
the bass isn't keeping the
backbeat and the drums,

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.340
aren't keeping the backbeat
that they're playing together,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.990
they're all playing the
melodies and harmonies

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.130
in a way that just doesn't sound right.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.530
That's what's going on in the
brain of somebody with ADHD

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.340
and we can now confidently say

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.940
based on brain imaging studies,

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.870
that when somebody gets better,

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.600
when they're treated for ADHD
or when they age out of ADHD,

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.750
as sometimes it's the case
that the default mode networks

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.580
and the task networks tend to become

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.690
anti-correlated again, okay?

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.450
So that's the underlying neurobiology,

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.759
but you'll notice that I
didn't mention dopamine at all.

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:47.430
What dopamine is doing in this context

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.580
is dopamine is acting like a conductor.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.870
Dopamine is saying this
circuit should be active

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.030
then that circuit should be active.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.520
It should be default mode network

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.920
and then when the default
mode network is not active,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.350
then it should be the task network.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.550
So it's really acting as a
conductor saying, you go,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.320
now you go, now you go, now you go.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.720
And in ADHD,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.755
there's something about
the dopamine system

00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:10.760
that is not allowing it
to conduct these networks

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.360
and make sure that they stay what,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.580
the engineers or physicists
or mathematicians would say

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.740
out of phase to be anti-correlated, okay?

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.020
Out of phase and anti correlate,
essentially the same thing,

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.500
at least for purposes of this discussion.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.740
So that raises two questions,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.500
could it be that dopamine is
not at sufficiently high levels

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.260
or could it be that dopamine
is just doing it all wrong?

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.093
In other words,

00:32:34.093 --> 00:32:36.560
is there no conductor or is
the conductor playing with like

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.580
little tiny toothpicks

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.620
and so the instruments can't see

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.020
what they're supposed to do.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.650
They can't get the instruction

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.090
'cause it's just not
loud enough, so to speak,

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.100
or could it be that the
information is getting out,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.130
but the information that's
getting out is wrong,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.010
the conductor's there,

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.743
but the conductor is in
very good at conducting.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.690
Now we can gain insight
into how the system works

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.310
and fails and how to treat it

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.860
by looking at some of the current

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.300
and previous treatments for ADHD,

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.360
as well as some of the recreational drugs

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.870
that people with ADHD
tend to pursue and like

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.610
now I'm certainly not a
proponent of people with ADHD

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.040
taking drugs recreationally,

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.550
that's not what this is about,

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.300
but if you look at their
drug seeking behavior

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.530
and you couple that drug seeking behavior

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.550
to their desire to remedy
their attention deficit,

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.280
you start gaining some
really interesting insight

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.660
into how dopamine is
regulating these circuits

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.940
in normal circumstances
and in people with ADHD.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.450
So what exactly is going on
with the dopamine system,

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.260
in people with ADHD

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.030
and what's going on
with the dopamine system

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.980
in people that have
terrific levels of attention

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.530
for any task?

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:51.000
Well, in the year 2015, an
important paper came out.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.820
The first author is Spencer,

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.900
and it came out in a journal
called Biological Psychiatry,

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.960
and it formalized the so-called

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.910
low dopamine hypothesis of ADHD.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.110
The idea that dopamine
was somehow involved

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.390
or not at the appropriate
levels in people with ADHD

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.850
had been around for a pretty long time,

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.830
but a formal proposition of
the low dopamine hypothesis

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.710
led to some really important
experiments and understanding

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.713
of what goes wrong in ADHD.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:24.380
It turns out that if
dopamine levels are too low

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.150
in particular circuits in the brain,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.260
that it leads to unnecessary
firing of neurons in the brain

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.370
that are unrelated to the
task that one is trying to do

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.950
and that is unrelated to the information

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.930
that one is trying to focus on.

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:41.700
So if you think back
before you've got this

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:44.260
default mode network and
a task-related network,

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.960
and they need to be in
this kind of concert of

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.632
anti-correlation and an ADHD
they're firing together.

00:34:50.632 --> 00:34:54.123
Well, the problem seems to
be that when dopamine is low,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.690
certain neurons are firing
when they shouldn't be,

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.150
this is like a band, right?

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.550
We'll go back to our band,
that's a guitar bass in it,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.350
and the person playing the drums

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.660
and it's as if one of those or
several of those instruments

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.500
are playing notes when they
shouldn't be playing, right?

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.030
The pauses and music are just as important

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.513
as the actual playing of notes.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.050
When dopamine is too low neurons fire,

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.920
more than they should in these networks

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.023
that govern attention.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.300
This is the so-called
low dopamine hypothesis

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.530
and if you start looking anecdotally

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:33.670
at what people with ADHD
have done for decades,

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.670
not just recently since
the low dopamine hypothesis

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.320
has been proposed,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.739
but what they were doing in
the 1950s and then the 1940s

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:42.572
and the 1960s.

00:35:42.572 --> 00:35:47.572
What you find is that they
tend to use recreational drugs,

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:53.090
or they tend to indulge
in non drug stimulants.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.180
So things like drinking,
six cups of coffee

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.250
or quadruple espressos,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.140
or when it was more prominent

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.020
smoking a half a pack of cigarettes

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.106
and drinking four cups of coffee a day

00:36:05.106 --> 00:36:08.010
or if the person had access to it

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.100
using cocaine as a recreational drug

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.620
or amphetamine as a recreational drug.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.387
All of those substances
that I just described

00:36:15.387 --> 00:36:17.760
in particular cocaine and amphetamine,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.500
but also coffee and cigarettes

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.620
increase levels of
multiple neurotransmitters,

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.250
but all have the quality
of increasing levels

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.110
of dopamine in the
brain and in particular,

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.850
in the regions of the brain
that regulate attention

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:35.800
and these task related and
default mode networks okay?

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.910
Now young children,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:39.518
fortunately don't have access
to those kinds of stimulants

00:36:39.518 --> 00:36:41.170
most of the time

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.570
and those stimulants
all have high potential

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.460
for abuse in adults.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.330
So we will talk about
the potential for abuse

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.390
in a few minutes.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.610
But if you look at children,

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.550
even very young children with ADHD,

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.650
they show things like
preference for sugary foods,

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.810
which also act as dopamine
inducing stimulants.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.900
Now, of course, once they
get access to soda pop

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.770
and coffee and tea,

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.150
they start to indulge in
those more than other people.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.983
For a long time,

00:37:10.983 --> 00:37:12.450
it was thought that children with ADHD

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.680
consumed too many sugary
foods or drank too much soda

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.340
or adults with ADHD

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.810
would take recreational
drugs like methamphetamine

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.080
or cocaine or would drink coffee to excess

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.880
or smoke cigarettes to excess

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.390
because they had poor levels of attention

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:31.210
and because they couldn't
make good decisions,

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.380
they were too impulsive and so forth

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.660
and while that certainly
could be the case,

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.950
knowing what we now know about dopamine,

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.940
and the fact that having
enough dopamine is required

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.630
in order to coordinate
these neural circuits

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:47.048
that allow for focus and
quality decision-making

00:37:47.048 --> 00:37:51.170
an equally valid idea
is that these children

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.880
and these adults are actually
trying to self-medicate

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.170
by pursuing these compounds, right?

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.110
Things like cocaine lead to
huge increases in dopamine.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.830
Well, what happens was
when somebody with ADHD

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.290
takes that drug,

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.190
it turns out they actually obtain

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.120
heightened levels of focus,

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.710
their ability to focus on things

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.000
other than things they absolutely care

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.690
intensely about goes up,

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.530
likewise, children who consume anything

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.727
that increases their levels of dopamine,

00:38:18.727 --> 00:38:23.727
if those children have ADHD,
they tend to be calmer,

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.810
they tend to be able to focus more.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.480
Now, this is very different than children

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.910
who do not have ADHD.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:30.940
When they consume too much sugar,

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.220
they tend to become super hyperactive.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.930
When they consume any kind of stimulant,

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.463
they tend to go wild and
run around like crazy.

00:38:37.463 --> 00:38:38.690
Actually, I have an anecdote about this

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:40.380
just to illustrate it.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.350
I have a friend,

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.010
he has two children that
are now in their teens

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.720
and twenties, but when they were little,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.260
one time, I brought them some
chocolate just as a gift,

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.680
when I showed up at their
house and within 30 minutes,

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.730
the kids were running around like crazy

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:56.130
I mean they were pretty high energy kids,

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.770
but they were going bonkers

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.010
and that's actually when the
mother, my friend at the time,

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.030
unfortunately, still now
looked at the chocolate,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.140
realized that it was chocolate
with espresso beans in it.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.530
It was like dark chocolate
with espresso beans

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.170
so I was really at fault there,

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.880
you don't want to give kids dark chocolate

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.713
with espresso beans,

00:39:11.713 --> 00:39:13.837
but what you're really
seeing that hyperactivity

00:39:13.837 --> 00:39:15.790
that is dopamine, okay?

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.720
It's the sugar combined with
the caffeine in this case,

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.370
combined with a few other
compounds that exist in chocolate,

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.470
that really increase
our levels of alertness

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.630
and our tendency to want
to move around a lot, okay?

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.240
So dopamine and low levels of dopamine

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.980
apparently are what's
wrong in people with ADHD,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.700
that dopamine hypothesis

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.810
is what led to the idea
that treating people,

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:44.490
children and adults included
with dopaminergic compounds

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.420
would somehow increase
their ability to focus

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.410
and if you look at the major
drugs that were developed

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.010
and now marketed by
pharmaceutical companies

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.793
for the treatment of ADHD,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.850
those drugs have names like Ritalin.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.700
Nowadays, it's typically
things like Adderall, Modafinil

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.170
and some of the other derivatives,

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.240
they all serve to increase
levels of dopamine

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.340
in particular dopamine in the networks

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.670
that control task directed behavior,

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.730
and that coordinate the
default mode network

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.840
and these task-related networks.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.900
So many of you have
probably heard of Ritalin.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.810
Ritalin is a prescription
stimulant that is

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:28.270
prescribed for ADHD as
well as for narcolepsy.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.010
Narcolepsy is a condition

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.050
in which people tend to fall asleep

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.570
during the day time, quite a lot,

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.040
excessive daytime sleepiness,

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.250
not due to lack of sleep at night,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.860
but also tend to fall asleep
when they get excited,

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.900
if they're really emotionally
excited or about to eat

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.830
or any other kind of activity that

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.460
would normally get somebody
really aroused and alert

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.390
people with narcolepsy
tend to fall asleep,

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.930
or they tend to become
what's called cataplectic.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.500
They tend to just sort of
go limp in the muscles.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.170
So it's this invasion of
sleep into the daytime.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.020
It's dysregulated by emotion.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.890
You can imagine why a stimulant,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.210
something that would wake
you up, make you very alert,

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.230
focused and motivated

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.430
would be a good treatment for narcolepsy.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:12.430
Adderall also is used to treat
ADHD and to treat narcolepsy

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.260
things like Modafinil

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.180
also used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.810
So you're sensing a theme here.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.020
So what are the differences
and similarities

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.255
between these drugs

00:41:23.255 --> 00:41:25.070
and what can that tell us about ADHD?

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.410
Well, Ritalin was one of
the first-generation drugs

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:34.190
that was prescribed for ADHD
in order to deal head on

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.180
with this dopamine hypothesis.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.340
This idea that in ADHD,
dopamine levels are too low.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.480
Nowadays, Adderall is the
more typically prescribed drug

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.780
for ADHD that has to do

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.830
with some of the so-called
pharmacokinetics,

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.790
the rate at which those
drugs enter the system

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.820
and how long they last in the system.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.653
So for instance,

00:41:53.653 --> 00:41:56.130
Ritalin was a drug that was packaged

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.330
into various time-release formulas.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:02.390
Whereas initially Adderall was
only released in a form that

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.630
had a very short life,

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:07.340
So meaning that it wasn't
in the bloodstream very long

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.980
and didn't affect the brain for very long

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.040
and so the dosages could be
controlled in a more typical way

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.930
without going into a lot
of tangential detail.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.020
As you all know, at
different times of day,

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.890
you tend to be more or less alert.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.660
So a long sustained release drug

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.950
while that might sound like
a really terrific thing.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:26.580
If that drug is having an effect

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.850
of making you more alert

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.190
and it's released across
very many hours of your day,

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.800
there might be periods of your day

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.400
when you feel too alert,

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.233
periods of your day,

00:42:35.233 --> 00:42:37.010
when you feel just right
and periods of your day,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.270
when you wished that you were more alert.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:42.070
These are some of the
pharmacokinetics, kinetics,

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.064
meaning movement of
the different compounds

00:42:44.064 --> 00:42:46.750
within the bloodstream
and brain that could,

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.630
you could imagine in a very real way,

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.790
would impact whether or not
someone would feel really good

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.500
on one of these drugs or whether or not

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.163
they would feel too anxious
or too sleepy and so on.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.970
Let's take a step back
for a second and just ask,

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.390
what are these drugs?

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.000
We know they increase dopamine,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.220
but what are they really?

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.680
Well, Ritalin also called methylphenidate

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.330
is very similar to amphetamine speed,

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.090
or what's typically call speed

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.390
in the street drug nomenclature.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:20.960
Adderall, which goes by
various other names, okay?

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.960
So Adderall, Adderall XR, my
dialysis, things like that.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.980
Adderall is basically a combination of

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.300
amphetamine and dextroamphetamine.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.270
Now some of you probably realize this,

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.040
that Adderall is amphetamine,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.270
but I'm guessing that there a
good number of you out there,

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:42.840
perhaps even parents and
kids that don't realize that

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.750
these drugs like cocaine and
amphetamine methamphetamine,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:50.750
which are incredibly dangerous
and incredibly habit forming

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.630
and have high potential for abuse.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.220
Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.580
are exactly what are used to treat ADHD

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.960
and they're not exactly like
cocaine or methamphetamine,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.130
but they are structurally
and chemically very similar

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.910
and their net effect in the brain and body

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:08.910
is essentially the same,

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.700
which is to increase dopamine primarily,

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.160
but also to increase
levels of a neuromodulator

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.420
called epinephrin or norepinephrine

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.290
also called noradrenaline and adrenaline

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:21.000
those names are the
same and to some extent

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.712
to increase levels of serotonin
in the brain and blood,

00:44:23.712 --> 00:44:25.810
but not so much serotonin,

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.420
that's just kind of a small
smidgen of effect, okay?

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.860
So dopamine way up norepinephrine
and adrenaline way up.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.850
So that's motivation
drive, focus and energy

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:40.050
and to some extent, a
little bit of serotonin,

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:44.391
which is really more about
feeling calm and relaxed

00:44:44.391 --> 00:44:46.680
and you can imagine why that would be

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.633
a good balancing effect for
dopamine and norepinephrine.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.010
So what I'm essentially
saying is that the drugs

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.960
that are used to treat
ADHD are stimulants,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.463
and they look very much alike.

00:44:58.463 --> 00:45:00.930
In fact, nearly identical to

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:02.410
some of the so-called street drugs,

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.860
stimulants that we all
here are so terrible.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.789
However, I do want to emphasize

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:10.180
that at the appropriate dosages

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.680
and working with a quality psychiatrist

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.200
or neurologist or family physician

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.860
does have to be a board certified MD

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.470
that prescribes these things,

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.840
many people with ADHD
achieve excellent relief

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.310
with these drugs, not all of
them, but many of them do,

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:30.210
especially if these treatments
are started early in life.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.010
So now knowing what these drugs are,

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:36.470
I want to raise the question
of why prescribe these drugs?

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.550
I mean, everyone has to make
a decision for themselves

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.790
or for their child as to whether or not

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.743
they're going to take these things or not.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:46.400
I also want to acknowledge
that many people out there,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.840
many, many people out there
are taking these drugs,

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.270
even though they have not
been clinically diagnosed

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.020
with ADHD when I say these drugs,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.270
I'm specifically referring
to Ritalin and Adderall

00:45:56.270 --> 00:46:00.120
and Modafinil, but more
typically it's Adderall, okay?

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.000
People using cocaine and amphetamine

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.290
for recreational purposes,

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.370
that's a completely different beast

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.510
and it is indeed a beast

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.823
and it's something that
I strongly discourage.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:15.130
However, I'm aware that up
to 25% of college students,

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.410
and perhaps as many as
35% of all individuals

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.410
between the ages of 17
and 30 are taking Adderall

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.160
on a regular or semi-regular basis

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.850
in order to work, in order to study

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.720
and in order to function and
focus in their daily life.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.060
Even though they have not
been diagnosed with ADHD,

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.340
there's a whole black market for this.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.110
They're getting it from
people with prescriptions.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.870
I'm not here to pass judgment.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.750
I just want to emphasize
how these drugs work.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.047
Some of the things that
they do to enhance cognition

00:46:48.047 --> 00:46:50.010
and focus that actually
serve the brain well

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.310
in certain individuals and how
they can be very detrimental

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:55.830
in other individuals.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:57.180
I sort of blew right past it.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:01.750
But the fact that in upwards
of 25% of young people

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.810
are taking things like Adderall,

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.950
despite not having a
clinical diagnosis of ADHD.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.823
Well, that's a ridiculously high number.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:12.600
A few years ago,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.980
it was estimated that
Adderall use and Ritalin use

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.690
without diagnosis of ADHD
was second in incident

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.590
only to cannabis,

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.410
but actually now the
consumption of Adderall

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.100
without prescription is higher than

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.810
the consumption of
cannabis in that age group.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:35.140
So what that means is that
there's a lot of stimulant use

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.270
in that age group

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.090
and there are a lot of adults also

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.180
using and abusing stimulants
in order to gain focus.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.830
Then we can have a whole
discussion about whether or not

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:45.700
life is becoming more demanding,

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.190
whether or not the need
for focus is excessive

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:50.040
and that's why people are doing that.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.630
But frankly, it's an
interesting discussion,

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.140
but it's not one that would
deliver us to any answers.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.167
Rather, I'd like to focus
on the ways that people now

00:47:57.167 --> 00:47:59.610
and people have always
been self-medicating

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.050
to increase, focus, right?

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.130
Caffeine, which I can indulge

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:08.530
some, I don't think to
access has long been used

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.410
as a stimulant to increase dopamine,

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:11.390
increase norepinephrine,

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:15.230
increased focus and energy
and in addition to that,

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:16.800
it works through the so-called cyclic amp,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.200
phosphodiesterase pathway,
remember anytime you see,

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.300
you hear an ASE, that's an enzyme.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.610
Phosphodiesterase is involved in the

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.460
conversion of things like cyclic amp into

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.820
energy for cells and so forth.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.210
Basically coffee gives you
energy it makes you feel good

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.120
and it increases focus
because of the circuits

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.663
that it engages in the brain.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.640
People have been taking caffeine

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.570
and continue to take it caffeine for ages.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.390
People also used to smoke cigarettes,

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.600
nicotine in order to gain focus.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.282
Nowadays, that's less common
because of the concerns,

00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:54.260
quite valid concerns about
lung cancer from smoking,

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.170
but there's a lot of vaping out there.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.930
There are a lot of people
now consuming nicotine,

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.510
which is the active
substance in cigarettes

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:06.930
and in most nicotine vapes
that stimulates the brain

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.290
to be more focused and more alert.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.470
So the idea of taking
stimulants of consuming things

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:15.670
or smoking things in order
to increase alertness

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.200
is not a new idea.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.003
It's just that in ADHD,

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.630
it's surprising that these
things would work, right?

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:23.770
I mean, if the problem is

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.600
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.320
what we're really talking about here,

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.890
or children that are prescribed a drug

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.000
that ought to be a stimulant,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.570
it ought to make them hyper hyperactive

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:36.960
and rather than doing that,

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.450
it actually somehow
serves to calm them a bit,

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.670
or at least allow them to focus.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.870
Here's the reason, children have a brain

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:49.770
that's a very plastic
meaning it can remodel itself

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.620
and change in response to
experience very, very quickly

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.490
compared to adults.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.960
Taking stimulants as a child,

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.110
if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:04.560
allows that forebrain task
related network to come online,

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.460
to be active at the appropriate times

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.710
and because those children are young,

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.720
it allows those children
to learn what focus is

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.880
and to sort of follow or
enter that tunnel of focus.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.350
Now, by taking a drug, it's
creating focus artificially,

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.260
it's not creating focus because
they're super interested

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.240
in something it's chemically
inducing, a state of focus,

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.220
and let's face it a lot
of childhood and school

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.550
and becoming a functional adult

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.700
is about learning how to focus

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.090
even though you don't
want to do something.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:35.170
In fact, when I was in college,

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:37.220
I had this little trick
that may or may not work

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.330
for some of you,

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:40.920
which is if I couldn't
focus on the material

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.350
I was trying to learn,

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.500
I would delude myself into thinking

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.460
that it was the most
interesting thing in the world.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.490
I would just kind of lie
to myself and tell myself,

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.893
okay, this, I won't mention the subjects,

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.000
I absolutely love this.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.270
I would just, I would tell
myself that I loved it

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:58.980
and I noticed that just that selective

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.100
or deliberate engagement of
that desire to know circuit,

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:06.140
whatever that is in my brain,
no doubt involves dopamine,

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.370
allowed me to focus and
remember the information

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.640
and somewhat surprisingly
or perhaps not surprisingly,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.470
I would often fall in
love with the information.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.990
I find that that was my favorite class.

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.100
So it was what I wanted to learn the most.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.860
So that's one way you
can do it artificially,

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.000
but kids with ADHD, they
can't do that, right?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.110
They're told to sit still

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.310
and they end up getting up 11 times.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:28.460
They are told that they
can't speak out in class

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.660
or that they have to remain
in their seats for 10 minutes

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.800
and they just, despite their best effort,

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.090
they simply cannot do it,

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.190
they're highly distractable.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:39.380
So what are we to make
of this whole picture

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.710
that we need more dopamine,
but these kids with ADHD,

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.230
they're getting their
dopamine by way of a drug,

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.970
which is for all the
world amphetamines, right?

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:50.180
It's speed, that's really what it is.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.520
What are the long-term consequences,

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.810
where the short-term consequences
and what should we make of

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.210
people taking these drugs
without a clinical need?

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.100
What are the consequences there?

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.360
Well, in order to get to
some of those answers,

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.290
I went to one of my colleagues,

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.720
this is a colleague
that I've actually known

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.300
for a very long time, I was
their teaching assistant

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.150
when they were an undergraduate,

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.980
they went on to get an
MD, a medical degree,

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:17.980
as well as a PhD and become
a pediatric neurologist

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.040
that specializes in the
treatment of epilepsy

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.720
and ADHD in kids of all
ages, from age three to 21,

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.553
that's the age range,

00:52:26.553 --> 00:52:30.210
pretty broad age range and has
extensive knowledge in this

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:34.530
and what makes them particularly
interesting for sake of

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:38.210
this discussion is that they
have a child, a young boy,

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.800
who's now showing signs of ADHD

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.970
and they are on the
threshold of trying to decide

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.260
whether or not they
will prescribe Adderall

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.403
or something similar.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.340
So we had a discussion about this

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:56.220
and prior to learning that
their child may have ADHD.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.810
I asked the following questions.

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:58.900
First of all, I asked,

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.250
what do you think about
giving young kids amphetamine?

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:07.250
And their answer was, on the
face of it, it seems crazy,

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:12.080
but provided that the
lowest possible dose is used

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.810
and that that dosage is
modulating as they grow older

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.548
and develop those powers of attention,

00:53:18.548 --> 00:53:22.730
their observation was that
they've seen more kids benefit

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.540
than not benefit from that.

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.730
Now I'm certainly not saying
what people should do.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.160
You obviously have to go to a doctor

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.380
because as I always say, I'm not a doctor,

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.340
I don't prescribe anything,

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.010
I'm a professor so I profess things

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.950
and here I'm professing that
you talk to your doctor,

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:39.150
if you're considering
giving Ritalin or Adderall

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.470
or any type of stimulant
to your child, of course,

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.040
what could be more important
than the health of your child.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.090
But it was a very
interesting answer because

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.610
typically we hear yes,
medicator don't medicate.

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.268
Rarely do we hear that the
medication should be adjusted

00:53:51.268 --> 00:53:54.650
across the lifespan and in
any particular kind of way.

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:56.380
Now the fact that this person,

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.966
this now friend of mine
and colleague of mine

00:53:58.966 --> 00:54:02.487
has so much expertise in
the way that the brain works

00:54:02.487 --> 00:54:06.690
and is considering putting
their child on such medication.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.910
I said, why wouldn't you wait

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:11.500
until your kid reaches puberty?

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.690
I mean, we know that in boys and in girls,

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.110
there are increases in testosterone

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.510
and estrogen during puberty,

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:21.440
that dramatically change the
way that the body appears.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.050
But also that dramatically change

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:26.700
the way that the brain functions
in particular we know this,

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.580
that puberty triggers the
activation of so-called

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.020
frontotemporal task related
executive functioning.

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.270
That's just fancy science
speak for being able to focus,

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:38.610
being able to direct your attention,

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.500
being able to control your
impulses, look at a small child,

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.300
or look at a puppy and then
look at an older child,

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.490
or look at a dog, very different levels,

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:47.920
patterns of spontaneous behavior.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.840
Young children move around a lot they're,

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.673
I don't want to say shifty,

00:54:50.673 --> 00:54:52.570
cause that makes it sound like
they're up to something bad,

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:53.510
which they might be,

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.520
but they don't have to
be up to something bad,

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.550
they fidget a lot.

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:57.383
So to puppies,

00:54:57.383 --> 00:55:00.500
everything's a stimulus as
animals and humans get older,

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.270
they learn how to control
their behavior and sit, still,

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:07.570
listen and focus even
if they don't want to.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:12.380
So giving a drug that allows
a child to access that

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:16.300
stillness early on it's
thought will allow them

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.640
to maintain that ability as time goes on.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.570
But I decided to push
a little bit further,

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:25.090
I said, well, why would you do it now

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.460
as opposed to during
puberty or after puberty?

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.580
And their answer was very specific

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:33.530
and I think very important,
what they said was look,

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:37.210
neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.350
and tapers off after about age 25,

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:45.350
but neuroplasticity from
age three until age 12 or 13

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:49.040
is exceedingly high and they're right,

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:49.900
when you sit back

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.090
and you look at the
literature on neuroplasticity,

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:54.670
you'd say childhood plasticity
and young adult plasticity

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:57.010
is much greater than adult plasticity,

00:55:57.010 --> 00:56:00.330
but that early childhood
plasticity is far and away

00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:03.460
the period in which you
can reshape the brain

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.420
at an accelerated rate.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:08.860
So this lines up really well
with the clinical literature.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:09.693
Not surprisingly,

00:56:09.693 --> 00:56:13.510
there are clinician that
early treatment is key.

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.560
If you have the opportunity to
work with a quality physician

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.430
and treat these things early,

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.130
these drugs can allow
these frontal circuits,

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:24.900
these task-related circuits
to achieve their appropriate

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.840
levels of functioning and for
kids to learn how to focus

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.430
in a variety of different contexts.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:33.360
Now, is that the only thing
that they should be doing?

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.350
Of course not.

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:36.660
So the next question I asked was

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.060
what should we make of all
this diet related stuff, right?

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:44.300
I've heard before that the
so-called elimination diet

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:48.860
or ingesting no sugars
or no dairy or no gluten,

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.010
that all of these things
have been purported

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:56.010
to improve symptoms of ADHD and
people and parents with ADHD

00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:00.230
go to fanatic lanes to try
and find the exact foods

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:03.540
that are causing problems
and the exact foods

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.660
that the kids can eat in order to try

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.310
and get their brain wired up right,

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:11.160
and correctly, and to avoid lifelong ADHD

00:57:12.313 --> 00:57:14.110
and their answer was really interesting.

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:16.080
But before I tell you their answer,

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.500
I want to tell you the
studies and the data

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.760
related to this question
of whether or not food

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.990
and the constellation
of foods that one avoids

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:28.240
and will eat has anything to
do with our levels of attention

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.073
and in particular,

00:57:29.073 --> 00:57:31.700
whether or not that can be
used as a leverage point

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.470
to treat ADHD.

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:36.320
So you can imagine the
challenges of exploring the role

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.150
of diet and nutrition in any study,

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:41.670
but especially in a study on ADHD, why?

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.827
Well, because as I mentioned
before, children with ADHD,

00:57:44.827 --> 00:57:46.800
and it turns out adults with ADHD

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.690
tend to pursue sugary
foods or any types of food

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:51.560
that increase their levels of dopamine.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.090
They are naturally drawn to those foods,

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:55.300
whether or not they realize it or not,

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.160
presumably as a way to try and treat

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.000
their lack of focus and impulsivity.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.500
So in this study that I'm
about to share with you,

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.910
there was no drug treatment,
it was just a study,

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.290
manipulating diet and
involved 100 children,

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:12.430
50 in the so-called
elimination diet group,

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.650
the special diet where
certain foods were eliminated

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.690
and 50 in the so-called control group.

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:21.420
However, being a well-designed
randomized controlled trial,

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.780
this study also included a crossover,

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.520
meaning where the kids would
serve as their own control

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.050
or control group at a
certain portion of the study.

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:30.883
So there'll be in one group

00:58:30.883 --> 00:58:32.170
where they eliminated certain foods

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:33.890
and then after a period
of time in the study,

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:35.260
they would swap to the other group.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.200
This is a powerful way to design a study

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.470
for reasons that you can imagine,

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.760
because you start to
eliminate changes and effects

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.204
due to individual differences.

00:58:43.204 --> 00:58:46.830
In any case, 100 children
total 50 in each group

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:48.280
at any one period in time

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.766
and the effects that they
observed were extremely dramatic.

00:58:51.766 --> 00:58:55.030
In the world of statistics and
analysis of scientific data,

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.210
we talk about P-values,
probability values.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:58.740
What's the likelihood that something

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.100
could happen according to chance

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.750
and typically the cutoff would be

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.360
something like P less than 0.05,

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.730
that's less than 0.05 chance essentially,

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:11.810
of the effect being due to chance.

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:13.090
However, in this study,

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:17.520
every single one of the
effects is P less than 0.0001,

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.920
very, very infant decimally small

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.350
probability that the effect
observed could be due to chance.

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:24.280
So what were these effects?

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.990
These effects were
enhanced ability to focus,

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:28.296
less impulsivity,

00:59:28.296 --> 00:59:32.790
even less tendency to move
when trying to sit still.

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:34.270
So everything from mental focus

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.440
to the ability to control
their bodies improved

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.720
when they were in the
elimination diet group,

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.690
what was eliminated?

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:44.140
Well, the elimination diet
in this particular study

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.560
was a so-called oligoantigenic diet.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:51.140
It was a diet in which each
kid took a test to determine

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.940
which foods they had antibodies for,

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.840
meaning that they were mildly allergic to.

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.320
Now in this study, it was very important

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.650
that the kids not be
extremely allergic to any food

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:01.950
because as I mentioned before,

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:05.370
they actually served as a
control at one point in the study

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.970
where they were eating all sorts of foods,

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.890
including foods that
had mild allergies to.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:13.890
So basically what the study
said was that eliminating foods

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.350
to which children have allergies

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.770
can dramatically improve
their symptoms of ADHD.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.050
And this study,

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.920
not surprisingly because it was published

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.460
in such a high quality
journal Lancet, et cetera,

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.850
large number of subjects
set the world on fire.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:32.100
People were extremely
excited about these results

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.466
because here in the absence
of any drug treatment,

01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:36.320
there was a significant improvement

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.900
in ADHD symptoms observed
and then came the criticisms.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.440
So many papers were published
after this specifically

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.050
dealing with re-analysis of these data

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:51.210
and I want to be fair in saying that

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:53.410
the data in the paper look good,

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:55.110
but there are criticisms

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.710
of the overall structural
design of the study.

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.500
I don't want to go into
all the details exactly

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.460
'cause it gets really nuanced
about some of the statistics

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.750
and the way that one
examines these types of data,

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:07.600
but there was skepticism

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.440
and in science, skepticism is healthy,

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.160
especially when making decisions about

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.450
whether or not to treat or feed children

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.150
one food or another, or give
them one drug or another.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.590
Now I want to return to
the story of my friend,

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:23.240
who is a pediatric
neurologist and treats ADHD

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.440
and has a child who is on the precipice of

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.450
perhaps starting to take drugs
for the treatment of ADHD.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:33.780
I asked the simple question,
do you see an effect of diet?

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.700
Meaning when parents control
the diet of their children,

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.310
does it make a positive or
negative or no difference in

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:44.135
terms of the way that
the kids respond to ADHD,

01:01:44.135 --> 01:01:47.330
drugs like Ritalin and
Adderall or whether or not

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.990
it can help them avoid treating
with those drugs entirely?

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:53.060
And her response was very
straightforward, she said,

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.940
elimination of simple sugars

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.990
has a dramatic and positive effect.

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:59.370
She's observed that over
and over and over again

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:03.360
in many dozens, if not
hundreds of patients, okay?

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.850
Now that's not a peer reviewed study,

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.150
that's a statement that I'm
conveying to you anecdotally,

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.163
but it's a highly, highly informed one.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.780
I said, what about
these elimination diets?

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.550
She said, and I found other
sources to support this,

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:18.540
that these oligoantigenic
diets are controversial.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.130
There are many people who really believe

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.760
in identifying all the things
that you're allergic to

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.390
and making sure that you

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:27.570
and especially your
kids avoid those foods.

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.630
However, there's another camp
that's starting to emerge

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.670
in the peer reviewed
scientific literature,

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.590
showing that when kids are
not exposed to certain foods

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.849
in particular nuts and
things of that sort,

01:02:39.849 --> 01:02:42.700
they develop allergies to those foods

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.290
and then when exposed to them later,

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:45.400
they cause real problems.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.960
So there's a whole galaxy of
discussion and controversy

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.130
and outright fighting about allergies

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:53.230
and kids and whether or
not the oligoantigenic diet

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:54.130
is the appropriate one.

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:58.430
However, out of the four
neurologists and psychiatrists

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.660
that I spoke to about ADHD
in preparation for this,

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.670
every single one said children with ADHD,

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:05.750
as much as possible,

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:08.970
should be encouraged to avoid high sugar

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:11.380
and simple sugar foods of most kinds

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.720
and if they can find particular foods

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.410
that exacerbate their symptoms,

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.410
obviously eliminating
those foods is beneficial

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.610
and the foods that
exacerbate their symptoms

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.527
change over time.

01:03:25.527 --> 01:03:28.750
So I don't like giving
a complicated answer,

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:31.340
but I also don't like
giving an incomplete answer.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.740
What this tells me is that children,

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.930
especially young children who have ADHD

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:41.500
should probably not eat much sugar

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.250
in particular simple sugars.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:44.710
In addition to that,

01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:47.760
exploring whether or not
they have existing allergies

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.210
to foods, they already
consume might be a good idea.

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:53.870
At least that's what this paper,

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:56.580
the Pelsser et. al Lancet
paper seems to speak to

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.920
and I should mention that that
paper was published in 2011.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.620
Since then there have been many
dozens of studies exploring

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.510
the same thing, as well as
meta analysis of all those data

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.360
and it does appear that diet can have

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.250
a highly significant role in eliminating

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.360
or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.750
so much so that some of the children

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.760
are able to not take medication at all,

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.000
or eventually wean
themselves off medication

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.720
as young adults and as adults.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.520
One interesting question
is whether or not adults

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.480
should modify their diet in order to

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.720
increase their levels of focus,

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.550
if they're already having
normal levels of focus,

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:37.980
but we'd like more or would like to reduce

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:42.550
existing adult ADHD,
that's an interesting,

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.770
and even more controversial topic,

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:47.260
it brings us right into the
realm of what are called

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.640
omega-3 fatty acids.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.730
I've talked many times
on this podcast about

01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:54.530
the known benefits of omega-3
fatty acids in particular,

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:58.710
getting a one gram 1000 milligrams or more

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.550
even as much as 2000
milligrams each day of

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:06.070
the so-called EPA component
of omega-3 fatty acids

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.630
known to have antidepressant effects,

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:09.660
mood elevating effects,

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.120
known to have important effects

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.600
protecting the cardiovascular system.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.860
I think it's now clear that
the immune system also benefits

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.860
that omega-3 fatty acids that
include a gram or more of EPA

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.910
that are very beneficial typically

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.110
that's done through fish oil,

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:29.120
liquid fish oil is going to
be the most cost efficient,

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.470
but they're capsule forms

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:33.100
for those of you that don't like fish oil,

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.330
you can ingest this through other means

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.960
you can get it from certain
algaes or krill, et cetera.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.700
You have to make it compatible
with your particular diet,

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.533
whether or not you're vegan

01:05:41.533 --> 01:05:43.320
or vegetarian or omnivore, et cetera.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.600
Omega-3s have shown,

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.490
been shown to have all these
positive health benefits.

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:52.270
Do they have positive effects
on focus and attention?

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.050
And the answer is you can find studies

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:59.350
that support that statement and
the effects are significant,

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:01.283
but the effects are modest.

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:06.350
You can also find studies
that show no effect,

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:11.107
however much like with
omega-3s and antidepressants,

01:06:11.107 --> 01:06:16.107
whereby ingestion of omega-3
fatty acids of a gram or

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.170
more of EPA per day allows
people with major depression

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:21.960
to get away with taking lower doses

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.790
of antidepressant medication.

01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:28.650
It does seem that ingestion of
omega-3 fatty acids in adults

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.920
that include EPA is of
1000 milligrams or more

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.050
can allow adults with ADHD

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:38.600
or mild attention deficit issues

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.600
to function well on
lower doses of medication

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.390
and in rare cases to
eliminate medication entirely.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.400
So what this says is once again,

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.630
that the omega-3 fatty
acids are beneficial,

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:54.810
will they cure or eliminate ADHD?

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:57.070
I think it's safe to say, no,

01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:58.420
they are playing a supportive

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.730
or what we call a modulatory role.

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.250
Just like good sleep,

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.360
plays a supportive and modulatory role

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.310
for essentially everything,
your immune system,

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.500
your ability to think your
ability to regulate your emotion,

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.830
it's modulating that process.

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:13.010
This component of modulation

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.880
is extremely important to highlight

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.079
and I think I want to spend
a moment on it because

01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:20.560
this is especially important
in the context of ADHD

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.920
and all the information that's out there.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.190
There are biological
processes that are mediated

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:28.940
by particular compounds like dopamine.

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.510
So for instance, the
ability to feel motivated,

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:35.890
to attend to focus is mediated
by the circuits in the brain

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:38.440
that release dopamine.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.730
However, attention is also
modulating by how rested you are.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.800
If you want to eliminate your
ability to think well at all,

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.690
just stay up for two nights
and don't sleep at all right?

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.740
If you do that,

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.350
you will have modulating
the circuits in your brain

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:55.320
that respond to various things

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.020
and you will be highly distractible.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.170
You'll be highly emotional.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:59.630
You will feel like garbage,

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:02.260
but that doesn't mean that sleep mediates,

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.440
focus and attention.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.090
It modulates it indirectly.

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:08.480
Likewise, I think these
omega-3 fatty acids

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:12.370
in particular the EPA is which
are so beneficial for mood

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:14.730
and apparently also for attention,

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:18.490
they directly mediate attention and mood,

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:20.640
what they do is they
modulate those circuits,

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.160
they make dopamine more available.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.240
They make whatever dopamine is available,

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.520
more likely to bind to
the various receptors

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.680
that are present on neurons and so forth

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.630
and I think this is very
important because likewise diet

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:35.300
in any discussion about nutrition

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.490
has to include this
framework of is the diet,

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:39.600
the elimination diet,

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.580
or whether or not it's some
other diet or esoteric diet,

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.160
ketogenic diet, is it modulating
or mediating a process?

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.810
And most likely in the context of ADHD,

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:51.000
it's modulating that process.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.370
So if the ADHD is mild or
if it's caught early enough,

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:57.720
or if it's in conjunction
with pharmacology

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.310
with a prescription treatment,

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.910
well, then it might help
guide the child or adult

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:03.990
to a better place of being able to focus.

01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:07.170
But it's not going to be the
switch that flips everything.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:10.810
Now that does not mean that
consuming the wrong foods,

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:13.160
sugary foods or foods that
you happen to be allergic to

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.100
is a good idea it will
still be detrimental.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.010
So I hope that conceptual framework helps

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.100
because if you go online,

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.420
if you're somebody with ADHD

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:24.500
or not your going to be
bombarded with the ADHD diet,

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.810
the oligoantigenic diet,
the elimination this,

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.260
this supplement that EPA

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.565
and I think it's very important
to understand whether or not

01:09:31.565 --> 01:09:34.590
you're talking about
something mediating a process

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.310
or modulating a process.

01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:38.880
Now drugs like Ritalin,
drugs like Adderall,

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.260
they are tapping into the circuitries

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:45.260
and the neurochemistries that
mediate attention and focus.

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:48.430
They are not the only
alternatives or the only choices

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:50.380
rather for treatment of these circuits

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.240
and enhancement of the circuits for focus.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.010
I'm going to talk about other alternatives

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:56.020
and some behavioral alternatives

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.460
that are not very well known,

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.960
but are very, very
effective in a few minutes.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.500
But I really want to make
this clear distinction

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.640
between modulation and mediation,

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.170
because it's vital for anyone
that's trying to modulate

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:11.630
or mediate anything
within their own brain.

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:14.400
If any of you are interested
in this oligoantigenic diet,

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.267
as it relates to ADHD,

01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:19.720
and you want to explore
a more recent study

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.780
besides that classic 2011 Lancet study,

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:23.870
that's rather controversial.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:25.970
There's a paper that was
published in frontiers

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:29.090
in psychiatry just last year, 2020.

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.470
The title of the paper is,

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:33.450
"Oligoantigenic diet
improves children's ADHD

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.760
rating scale scores reliably
in added video rating."

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.590
The added video rating is
just that they're using

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:43.300
an additional measure
of focus and attention.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.220
Again, that's Frontiers
in psychiatry, 2020,

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.290
I'll put a link to it in the caption,

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:51.110
and that's a more recent
study for you to peruse.

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:53.140
So we've talked about the
neural circuits of focus

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.240
and the chemistry of focus,

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.440
but we haven't talked yet
about what would make us better

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.010
at focusing and what
focusing better really is.

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:05.140
So let's take a step back and think about

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.860
how we focus and how
to get better at focus

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.050
and I'm going to share with
you a tool for which there are

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.330
terrific research data

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:15.720
that will allow you in a single session

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.103
to enhance your ability to
focus in theory forever.

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.570
What am I about to read you
is from an excellent book

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:25.730
that I recommend,

01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:27.410
if any of you are
interested in neuroscience

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.530
and things like meditation
and default mode networks

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:32.482
and things of that sort,

01:11:32.482 --> 01:11:34.332
the book is called, "Altered Traits."

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:37.950
Science reveals how
meditation changes your mind,

01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:40.410
brain and body and no,
I'm not going to try

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:41.800
and convince you to meditate.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.570
I'm going to share with you
a small passage in the book

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:47.410
that relates some research
data related to focus

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:48.710
that are very important.

01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:50.640
If you want to meditate,
that's your choice.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.480
That's a separate matter.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.340
This is a book by Daniel
Goleman and Richard Davidson

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.990
and I should just mention that

01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:57.700
Goleman is a well-known author

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.860
has written books on emotional
intelligence and so forth.

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.120
Richard Davidson is also a PhD.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.550
He's a professor of
psychology and psychiatry,

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:09.550
and he's at a University
of Wisconsin Madison,

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:12.310
he's done terrific work on brain states

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:14.513
and modulation of brain
states and so forth.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.530
What we're about to talk about is

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:21.950
when attention works and
when attention falters

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:24.090
and what we are specifically
going to talk about

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.810
are what are called attentional blinks,

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.070
not actual eye blinks.

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:29.820
We're going to talk about
that in a few minutes,

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.120
but we're going to talk
about attentional blinks.

01:12:33.069 --> 01:12:35.890
I'm paraphrasing here because

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.230
Goleman and Davidson wrote
about this so beautifully.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:41.370
I'd rather paraphrase from
them than try and just

01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:42.840
make up a new way to say it

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.000
that is less interesting or less good,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.617
but I want to credit them.

01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:48.870
Attentional blinks are
really easy to understand,

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:50.820
if you think about a where's Waldo task,

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.020
you know this task where's Waldo where,

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.960
there are a bunch of people and objects

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.190
and things in a picture

01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:57.670
and somewhere in there is Waldo

01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.730
with the striped hat and the
glasses and go skinny dude,

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:02.390
and you have to find Waldo

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:03.860
and so it's a visual search

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:06.240
and it's visual search for an object

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.340
that has distinct features,

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.970
but is embedded in this
ocean of other things that

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.750
could easily be confused as Waldo.

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:13.583
So you tend to look, look,

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:14.890
look, look, look, look, look, look, look,

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.600
and then you find Waldo.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.260
Kids can do this they enjoy doing this.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.730
Adults may or may not enjoy it,

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.160
but they can do it too.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.220
They find Waldo, when you find Waldo

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.170
or when you search for a target

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:29.350
in some other visual
search task at that moment,

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:31.970
your nervous system
celebrates a little bit

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:34.760
and it celebrates through
the release of neurochemicals

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.300
that make you feel good,
you found it and you pause.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.810
Now, the pause is interesting
because when you pause,

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:45.160
what we know from many experiments is that

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.810
in that moment of pause
and mild celebration,

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:53.810
however, mild you are not
able to see another Waldo

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.170
sitting right next to it.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.410
So what this means is in
attending to something

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:03.990
in searching and in
identifying a visual target

01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.220
your attention blinked
it shut off for a second

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.970
and there's a more formal
and more laboratory type

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.293
way that we look at this.

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.640
The more typical way to
do this is to give someone

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.530
a string of letters or a string of numbers

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:23.700
and beforehand you tell them
be on the lookout for the

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.350
letters R and Z, okay?

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:30.110
You're just going to watch
this string of numbers go by

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:31.880
and there will be a letter R in there,

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.800
and there will be a letter Z in there

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.810
and try and spot them both

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.740
and what you find is when you present

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.270
that string of numbers,
and then they see the R,

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:45.917
they see the R they
register it consciously

01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:48.930
and they tend to miss the Z,

01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:51.440
just like in the Waldo type example.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.610
Now, of course the numbers
are going by pretty quickly,

01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:55.133
but they can spot the R.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.620
They could also spot the Z,

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.730
if you told them
beforehand, just spot the Z

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.780
and the numbers are moving
through at the same rate

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.613
in both conditions.

01:15:03.613 --> 01:15:05.950
So what that means is that in every case,

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:10.260
you are capable of seeing the R or the Z

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.990
it's when you try and see
both that seeing the first one

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:16.450
prevents you from seeing the second one,

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:19.210
it's what we call an attentional blink.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:21.010
We do this all the time

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:25.460
and people with ADHD
tend to have many more

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.560
attentional blinks than people that don't

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.810
and this is true for
children and for adults.

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:32.090
This is an important point.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:34.090
So important that I want
to emphasize it twice

01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.570
in case you attentionally blinked.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.090
If you see something
that you're looking for,

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:40.890
or you're very interested in something,

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:43.510
you are definitely
missing other information

01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:47.960
in part because you're
over focusing on something

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.320
and this leads to a very
interesting hypothesis

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.440
about what might go wrong in ADHD,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.550
where we've always thought
that they cannot focus

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:58.360
and yet we know they can focus on things

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.450
they care very much about,

01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:03.060
well, maybe just maybe

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.180
they are experiencing
more attentional blinks

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.040
than people who do not have ADHD

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.470
and indeed, there are data
now to support the possibility

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:14.240
that that's actually what's happening

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.930
and that should be exciting
to anyone that has ADHD.

01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:18.990
It should also be exciting
to anyone that cares about

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:22.130
increasing their focus and
their ability to attend.

01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:23.780
What this is saying is
that these circuits,

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.410
that underlie focus in
our ability to attend

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:28.583
and our ability to eliminate distraction,

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:32.110
they aren't just failing to focus.

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:35.470
That's just a semantic way
of describing the outcome.

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.640
They are over focusing on certain things

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.610
and thereby missing other things.

01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:42.650
And so our distractability
or the distractability

01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:46.280
of somebody with ADHD could exist because

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.430
they are over focusing on certain elements

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:51.220
and there are there for missing

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.940
other elements that they
should be attending to.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.540
So what they really need is this property

01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.070
that we call open monitoring.

01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:00.720
Now open monitoring is something

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.840
that's described in the
book that I just referred to

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.420
and that typically is
associated with people

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.580
who have done a lot of meditation,

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.250
so called Vipassana meditation,

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.350
or have spent a lot of
time learning how to

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:15.310
do what's called open gaze visual analysis

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:16.330
and open gaze thinking.

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:17.780
But there's a simpler version of this

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.760
that allows us to bypass all that.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.623
First of all,

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:26.770
your visual system has
two modes of processing.

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:28.920
It can be highly focused,
a soda straw view.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.390
So looking for the R in
this string of numbers

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:33.050
in the example that I just gave,

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:35.006
or if you're very excited about something

01:17:35.006 --> 01:17:36.460
you're in that soda
straw view of the world,

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.010
and you're missing other things, okay,

01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:40.350
that's high levels of attention.

01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:43.390
However, there's also a
property of your visual system

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:45.070
that allows you to dilate your gaze,

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:47.340
to be in so-called panoramic vision.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.410
Panoramic vision is something
you can do right now,

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.940
no matter where you are,
and I can do it right now,

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.250
you won't know that I'm doing it,

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:56.420
but even though I'm still
looking directly at you,

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.060
I'm consciously dilating my
gaze so that I can see the

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.180
ceiling, the floor and
the walls all around me.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.710
That panoramic vision
is actually mediated by

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:06.900
a separate stream or
set of neural circuits

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.490
going from the eye into the brain

01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:10.970
and it's a stream or set of circuits

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.220
that isn't just wide angle view.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.280
It also is better at
processing things in time.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.200
Its frame rate is higher.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.120
So you've seen slow motion video,

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.780
and you've seen standard video,

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:26.650
slow motion video gives
you that slow motion look,

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:28.070
because it's a higher frame rate.

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.893
You're thin slicing time, okay?

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.440
You can use panoramic
vision to access the state

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.720
that we call open monitoring.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.380
When people do that,

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.500
they are able to attend to and recognize

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.130
multiple targets within
this string of numbers.

01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:48.230
They can see the R and they can see the Z

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:50.180
and they can see additional things.

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.690
So this is something
that can be trained up

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:54.040
and people can practice whether or not

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.170
they have ADHD or not.

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:57.590
What involves is learning

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.030
how to dilate your gaze consciously,

01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:01.470
that's actually quite
easy for most people,

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.440
whether or not you wear corrective lenses

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.440
or contacts or not

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.290
you can consciously go into open gaze

01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:09.288
and then you can contract
your field of view as well.

01:19:09.288 --> 01:19:11.380
There have also been studies done

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.980
where people were taught to
think in a particular way

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.820
for a very short period of time,

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.520
and that forever changed
their ability to limit

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.330
or reduce the number of
these attentional blinks.

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:26.050
There are now published
accounts in the literature

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:29.850
of a simple practice done
for about 15 minutes,

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:33.020
where subjects were asked to
just sit quietly eyes closed

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.100
and do what is sort of akin to meditation,

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.380
but to not direct their mind

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.380
into any particular state or place,

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.600
but simply to think about their breathing

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.700
and to focus on their
so-called interoception,

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.280
focus on how their body feels,

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.200
their mind drifted to bring it back, okay?

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.240
So it's basically meditation
for about 15 minutes.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.660
That might not seem like a
significant or unusual practice

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.950
or that it would have any impact at all.

01:19:55.950 --> 01:20:00.950
But remarkably, just doing
that once for 17 minutes,

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:05.190
significantly reduced the
number of attentional blinks

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:06.610
that people would carry out.

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:08.560
In other words, their focus got better

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.072
in a near permanent way without
any additional training.

01:20:12.072 --> 01:20:15.440
There's something about that
practice of reducing the amount

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.200
of visual information coming in

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.610
and learning to pay attention
to one's internal state,

01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:23.130
what we call interoception
that allow them an awareness,

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:26.090
such that when they needed
to look for visual targets,

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:29.050
when they need to focus on
multiple things in sequence,

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:30.560
they didn't experience

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.560
the same number of attentional blinks

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.150
and I should mention not
incidentally as people age

01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:38.250
and their working memory gets worse

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.900
and their ability to focus gets worse,

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:42.470
the number of attentional blinks

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.220
that they carry out goes up,

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.510
and there are now studies
exploring whether or not

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:50.420
the simple meditation like
practice of 15 to 20 minutes

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.340
or so of sitting and just quietly resting

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.730
and paying attention to one's breathing

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:57.320
and internal state can
also offset some of that

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.410
age-related what is
called cognitive decline.

01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:03.850
So what these data tell me is that

01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:05.925
regardless of whether
or not you're a child

01:21:05.925 --> 01:21:07.150
or you're an adult,

01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:09.930
whether or not you have ADHD or not,

01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:11.180
whether or not you're experiencing

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:12.730
age-related cognitive decline,

01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:14.260
or you would simply like to avoid

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.893
age-related cognitive decline,

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:20.670
a simple practice of taking 17 minutes

01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:23.780
sitting and paying attention
to your internal state,

01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:27.020
just interocepting,
registering your breathing,

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.180
registering the contact of your skin

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.260
with whatever surface you're on,

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:35.600
can forever rewire your brain
to be able to attend better

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.420
and possibly even offset

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.143
some of that age related
attentional drift.

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.930
Now, I don't expect anyone to
start meditating regularly.

01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:47.530
I don't expect anyone to do
anything they don't want to do,

01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:49.700
but I think most of us could handle

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.540
one meditation's session
of 17 minutes or so

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.290
and so if ever there was a
tool that stood to rewire

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:59.060
our attentional circuitry
in a powerful way.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.750
This seems to be it

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:05.570
and in addition, the ability
to engage in panoramic vision,

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:06.640
to dilate our gaze,

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.030
the so-called open monitoring
that allows the brain

01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.863
to function in a way

01:22:10.863 --> 01:22:13.240
that it can detect more
information faster,

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.700
that's a powerful tool as well

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.200
and the beauty of that tool is
that it works the first time

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.050
and it works every time.

01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:23.387
Now, how exactly it works
is a little bit unclear.

01:22:23.387 --> 01:22:25.930
Is it for instance,

01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:29.120
orchestrating this synchrony or asynchrony

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.610
between the default mode network

01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:32.750
and the task related
networks we don't know.

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:35.370
Those studies have not
yet been carried out.

01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:37.650
Nonetheless, the effects are significant,

01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:40.930
they are long lasting
and they appear to exist

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:43.820
after just one session of this quiet

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.760
17 minute interoception,

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.990
which to me makes it seem like

01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:49.830
a very worthwhile thing
to do for everybody.

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:51.970
So we just talked about
attentional blinks,

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:54.360
which are essentially blinks of thinking

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.520
it's your mind shutting off for a moment

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.690
and missing information.

01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:00.800
Now let's talk about actual blinks,

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.090
the sort that you do with your eyelids.

01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.550
Now, this might come
across as somewhat obvious,

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:10.050
but you can do fast, what
are called spontaneous blinks

01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:12.840
and they're always coordinated
between the two eyes

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.100
or you can do long blinks

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.590
like when you go to sleep at night,

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:19.520
you do one very long blink,
and I'm not being facetious.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.510
When you go to sleep at night,

01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:23.437
you are shutting your eyelids

01:23:23.437 --> 01:23:27.530
and you are limiting the
amount of information coming in

01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:30.490
and your perception of
time starts to drift

01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:31.690
as you go into sleep.

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:35.860
Your perception of time
changes from very fast,

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.180
at one moment to very slow
meaning the frame rate

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:44.810
at which you are analyzing
information dreaming, et cetera,

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:46.750
is variable when you were in sleep,

01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:48.200
sometimes it's very fast.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.860
Meaning you experienced
things in slow motion.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.140
Sometimes it's very fast.

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:55.990
In waking to your experience of time

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:58.600
can sometimes be very fast
sometimes be very slow.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.803
Typically the more alert you
are, the higher the frame rate,

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:05.150
your thin slicing your experience.

01:24:05.150 --> 01:24:06.410
You've probably had this happen.

01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:07.480
If you're ever very stressed

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.900
and you're waiting for
something or somebody,

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.850
it seems like it takes forever because

01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:14.070
your frame rate is higher

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:16.460
you're analyzing time more finely.

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:21.090
Conversely, if you are very
relaxed or even sleepy,

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.210
you wake up and you have to think of

01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:23.043
all the things you have to do.

01:24:23.043 --> 01:24:25.720
It will seem like the world
is going by very, very fast

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.040
and that you are moving very slow.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.360
Time is going at the same rate,

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.620
but your perception of
time is what's changed.

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.050
Believe it or not.

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:39.270
Your perception of time is
also changed on a rapid basis.

01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:43.223
Moment to moment basis
by how often you blink.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.820
This is a well-established literature

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:51.050
in the world of neuroscience
that unlike the literature

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:53.750
and claims about blinking and sociopathy,

01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:55.690
which have no basis,

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:59.050
the science of blinking as
it relates to time perception

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.270
has some very good data to support it.

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:03.980
I want to just emphasize
one study in particular,

01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.447
which is quite appropriately titled,

01:25:06.447 --> 01:25:09.100
"Time dilates after spontaneous blinking."

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.520
This is a paper that was
published in current biology.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.108
The first author is
Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.

01:25:15.108 --> 01:25:16.623
It's a wonderful paper.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:22.540
They examine the relationship
between fluctuations in timing

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.210
and blinking and to
make a long story short

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:29.960
what they found is that
right after blinks,

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.570
we reset our perception of time, okay?

01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:36.130
So blinks in that sense
are a little bit like

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.150
the curtain coming down on a scene

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:40.120
between scenes in a play

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.210
or takes in a movie, and
they clap the clap thing,

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.820
they started take in our,
what do they say, action

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.660
and then at the end they do the
thing and they click it down

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:52.550
and they say, it's a take that's one take

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:55.063
when you blink it's a take, okay?

01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:58.260
Now what's interesting

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.150
and will immediately make
sense to you as to why

01:26:01.150 --> 01:26:05.680
this is important is
that the rate of blinking

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.350
is controlled by dopamine.

01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:10.250
So what this means is that dopamine

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.530
is controlling attention.

01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:14.280
Blinks relate to attention and focus,

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.810
and therefore the dopamine
and blinking system is one way

01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:21.870
that you constantly modulate and update

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:23.830
your perception of time

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:27.070
and fortunately, it's also
one that you can control.

01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:29.980
So the basic takeaway of
this study was that blinking

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.210
controls time perception,

01:26:31.210 --> 01:26:33.840
but also that levels of dopamine

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.320
can alter your sense of
time and stay with me here,

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.930
and that blinking and dopamine
are inextricably linked.

01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:46.060
They are working together
to control your attention.

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.480
When dopamine levels go up,

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.780
people tend to overestimate
how long something lasted, why?

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.280
Because they are
processing time more finely

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.193
it's slow motion mode.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.070
When dopamine levels are lower,

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:04.450
they tend to underestimate time intervals.

01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:07.230
Let's remember back to the
very beginning of the episode,

01:27:07.230 --> 01:27:09.383
what's going on in people with ADHD,

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.620
they are not good at managing their time,

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:15.130
they tend to run late,
or they are disorganized.

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:17.780
They are not just disorganized in space,

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:20.348
meaning in that physical
space, around them,

01:27:20.348 --> 01:27:23.590
they're disorganized in time.

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:26.770
Their dopamine is low,
we know that as well

01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:29.630
and so they are
underestimating time intervals

01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:32.140
and so it makes perfect sense
that they would be late.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.500
It makes perfect sense that
they would lose track of time

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.660
or the ability to focus.

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.710
This is really exciting
because what it means is that

01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:42.340
children with ADHD, adults, with ADHD

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.160
or people with normal levels of focus

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.930
that want to improve
their ability to focus

01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:50.230
can do so through a training that involves

01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:53.150
learning how often to blink and when,

01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:56.860
and how to keep their visual
focus on a given target

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.930
and it turns out this study
has actually been done.

01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:02.260
There's a study again,
I'll link to the study,

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.140
entitled "Improvement of attention

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.040
in elementary school students

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.740
through fixation focused
training activity."

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.220
I won't go through all the details,

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:13.460
but what they found was a short period of

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.800
focusing on a visual target,

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.040
allowed the school
children to greatly enhance

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.650
their ability to focus on
other types of information

01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:26.110
and a significant component
of the effect was due

01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:28.390
to the way that they were
controlling the shutters

01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:31.730
on their eyes, their eyelids,
and controlling their blinks.

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:34.240
So what they did in this
study is they had these kids

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.760
focus their visual attention

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.040
on some object that was relatively close,

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.670
like their hand for a minute or so,

01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:42.890
which actually takes some
effort if you try and do that,

01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:44.758
they were allowed to blink.

01:28:44.758 --> 01:28:47.700
However, it's known from other work

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.179
that if people can consciously
override the desire to blink,

01:28:51.179 --> 01:28:54.010
at least to the point where
they feel like they have to,

01:28:54.010 --> 01:28:55.490
or else their eyes were dry out,

01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:58.570
that actually can increase
attention even further

01:28:58.570 --> 01:29:00.980
and they had conditions where
they would look at a point

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:04.314
further across the room and
even further across the room.

01:29:04.314 --> 01:29:07.390
It only took a few minutes
each day to do this

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.730
30 seconds in one
condition, or maybe a minute

01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:11.210
and then at another station

01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:12.247
of looking a little bit further out

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:14.170
and a little bit further out, however,

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:16.430
there was an important
feature of this study

01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:18.600
that is definitely worth mentioning,

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.550
which is before they did this

01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:23.870
visual focus, task or training,

01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:27.410
they did a series of physical
movements with the kids

01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:30.530
so that the kids could sort
of eliminate or move out

01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:32.620
some of their desire to move

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:36.390
and would thereby enhance
their ability to sit still.

01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:38.780
Now it's long been known
that kids need a recess,

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:41.420
they need time to run around
and play and roll around,

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:42.480
do whatever it is that they do

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.850
in order to be able to sit still at all.

01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:46.470
Adults probably need this too, frankly,

01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:49.750
but kids need it more because
the circuits in the brain

01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:53.870
that control reflexive
movements and as we say,

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:57.100
kind of rhythmic undulating
behavior and things like that,

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.740
that's an active suppression

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.810
and kids have less of
that circuitry built up

01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:03.970
until they hit about age 15 or 16.

01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:06.180
So they had the kids move around a bit

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:08.540
and then do this focus training.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.610
That brings me to another treatment

01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:14.420
that's actively used nowadays
in schools for kids with ADHD,

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.450
but also is starting
to be used by many kids

01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:22.500
and by parents in order to
keep their kids focusing

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:27.500
and not going crazy in the car
or not acting out in general

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.140
and that's the prevalence of
these so-called fidgeter toys

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:32.880
or things that kids can do actively

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.610
and repetitively in order to move out

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:37.970
some of their underlying
reverberatory activity

01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:39.320
in their nervous system.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:43.010
So what you will find is
that some kids with ADHD

01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:45.680
are now given a rubber band on their desk,

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.480
literally a rubber band
that's attached to their desk

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.200
and they're able to pull on it,

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.630
even snap it against the desk,

01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:51.690
if I had done that when I was a kid,

01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:53.420
I think my teachers were
throw me out of class,

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.910
but I think it's great
that they're allowing them

01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:57.530
to do this now as a way of moving

01:30:57.530 --> 01:31:00.680
some of their physical energy out

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.160
or engage their physical energy, rather,

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.800
as opposed to trying to sit

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.930
statue still all the time and attend

01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:10.130
and it turns out that does
enhance these children's ability

01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:12.820
to focus mentally when they
have some physical activity

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:16.980
to attend to and it turns out
it also can work for adults.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.160
I'll share with you I related anecdote

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.342
because it illustrates
the underlying mechanism.

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:25.370
I've had the great privilege
of being able to do a number of

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:28.520
surgeries, brain surgeries
during my career.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.213
So one thing you find when
you do brain surgeries,

01:31:30.213 --> 01:31:32.122
is that the brain's pretty small

01:31:32.122 --> 01:31:33.988
regardless of the species
that you're working on

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.360
and you're in there
and you're trying to do

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:38.140
something very specific
and the more you try

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:40.460
and hold your hands really steady,

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.500
the more they want to shake, all right?

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.650
So it's not natural for any of our limbs

01:31:44.650 --> 01:31:46.800
to sit perfectly still,

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.180
depending on how much coffee you had,

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.720
how well rested you are

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.100
and your sort of baseline
level of autonomic arousal.

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.290
Some of you may find that
you can hold out your hand,

01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:58.400
absolutely rock solid, others
will shake a little bit more.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:31:59.870
It doesn't mean you're if you're shaking,

01:31:59.870 --> 01:32:02.503
doesn't mean you're calm if you're still.

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.730
What it relates to

01:32:04.730 --> 01:32:06.640
is the amount of what we
call premotor activity,

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.370
the number of commands to move

01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:09.720
that are being sent through the system

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.010
and that's what I mean
by reverberatory activity

01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:16.010
and it does seem that kids
with ADHD and adults with ADHD

01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:18.470
have a lot of reverberatory activity

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:19.327
in their nervous system

01:32:19.327 --> 01:32:21.150
and so that's that constant desire to move

01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:22.840
it's hard for them to sit still

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.920
and therefore it's hard
for them to attend,

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.270
to harness their attention.

01:32:27.599 --> 01:32:29.110
When you do a surgery

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:32.045
and you find that your hands are shaking,

01:32:32.045 --> 01:32:33.880
what you learn from your mentors,

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.130
which I did and what works extremely well,

01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:37.800
whether or not you're
doing a surgery or not,

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.550
is that you simply tap your foot

01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:40.960
or you bounce your knee a little bit,

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.240
which you might think would
make your hand shake even more,

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.960
but provided that it's subtle.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.220
What it does is it actually
shuttle some of the activity

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.980
from those premotor circuits
to elsewhere in the body

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:55.130
and then you're able to sit
much more still with your hand,

01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:57.720
you're able to perform the
surgery with much more precision.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:00.460
You are able to write with
much better handwriting

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.600
and for those of you who
engage in public speaking,

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.840
if you ever too nervous,

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.020
that's why pacing while
you public speak helps

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:07.853
if you're nervous,

01:33:07.853 --> 01:33:10.150
that's why bouncing your
knee behind the podium

01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:10.983
works as well.

01:33:10.983 --> 01:33:13.340
That's why nodding your head
and gesticulating can help.

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.557
It's not a matter of,

01:33:15.557 --> 01:33:17.100
"Moving energy out of the body."

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.400
That doesn't actually happen,

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.970
what it is you're engaging
those premotor circuits

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:22.360
that are sending through commands.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.400
It's like trying to stuff,

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.050
a bunch of stuff through a funnel,

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:26.670
and it creates this tension,

01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:31.010
so you're giving it an outlet
for the neural circuitry

01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:32.370
to be able to move something

01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:34.640
so that you can keep other
components of your body

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.510
and your mental attention engaged

01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:41.000
and locked onto something
what we call focus.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.260
One thing related to this
whole business of blinking

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.520
and focus and training yourself to focus

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.520
and not blinking, et cetera,
is that most all of the drugs,

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.710
Ritalin, Adderall, and recreational drugs

01:33:53.710 --> 01:33:55.150
that increase dopamine,

01:33:55.150 --> 01:33:58.343
even coffee and tea and
other forms of caffeine,

01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:01.760
they tend to make us blink less

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.560
and when we get tired,
we tend to blink more.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.270
Now this is sort of a duh, right?

01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:10.590
But being wide-eyed
with excitement or fear

01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:15.370
or with your eyes, barely
being able to keep them open,

01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:17.590
now it should make perfect
sense that these shutters

01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:18.500
on the front of your eyes,

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.340
they aren't just there for winking

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:22.980
and they aren't just there
for cosmetic purposes.

01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:26.320
They are there to regulate
the amount of information

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.710
going into your nervous system

01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:31.140
and they're there to regulate how long

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:34.000
you are bringing information
into your nervous system

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.750
and in what bins, how widely or finely

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:40.960
you are binning time is
set by how often you blink

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.440
and how widely or specifically

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.780
you are grabbing attention
from the visual world is set

01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:48.920
by whether or not you're
viewing things very specifically

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.810
like a cross area through a
soda straw view like this,

01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:54.050
or whether or not you
were in this panoramic

01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:57.200
sort of whole environment mode,

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.540
this kind of fisheye lens
or wide angle lens mode

01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.253
and in fairness to the
pharmacology and the circuitry,

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.780
while dopamine and heightened
levels of alertness

01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.780
and excitement tend to make
us blink less and attend more.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.580
There's actually a study that's looked at

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.890
the other neurochemical systems

01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:19.410
and drugs and how those relate to blinking

01:35:19.410 --> 01:35:22.190
and so this will all be obvious
by the title of the paper

01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.100
I'm about to share with you.

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.217
This is a paper entitled,

01:35:25.217 --> 01:35:27.960
"Decreased spontaneous eyeblink rates

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.970
in chronic cannabis users,

01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:34.150
evidence for stride or cannabinoid,
dopamine interactions."

01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:36.130
Okay, I'm not going to go
into all the details here,

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:40.050
but one thing that is
somewhat surprising is that

01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:44.683
many people with ADHD
use or abuse cannabis,

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.110
you might think, well,
why would they do that?

01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:50.550
Because I thought that
a increase in dopamine

01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:51.560
is actually what's going to lead

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.730
to heightened levels of attention

01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:55.210
and that's what these
people in children crave.

01:35:55.210 --> 01:35:57.790
Well, it turns out that cannabis also

01:35:57.790 --> 01:36:00.770
increases dopamine
transmission in the brain,

01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:02.870
but because of the other chemicals,

01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:04.510
it increases namely serotonin

01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:07.530
and some components of the
cannabinoid and opioid system,

01:36:07.530 --> 01:36:12.530
it creates that kind of
alert, but mellow feel

01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:15.530
and again, here I'm not
a proponent of this,

01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:18.020
I personally am not a
THC or cannabis user.

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:19.190
It's just not my thing

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.810
and obviously it's illegal some places

01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:24.040
and so you have to
determine that for yourself

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.380
it does have medical purposes
in some places it is legal,

01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:32.240
but THC increases dopamine
and increases neurochemicals

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.140
that can also create a state of calm.

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.970
So it's that sort of middle ground

01:36:35.970 --> 01:36:38.500
and this paper has a
beautiful demonstration

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.530
whereby not just while
people are using cannabis,

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.930
but depending on how
long they've been using

01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:46.880
cannabis across their lifespan,

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.160
the rates of eye blinking change.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.900
So if you look at the number of years

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.860
that people have been using
cannabis on a regular basis,

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:58.660
either daily or up to excuse
me, weekly, or up to daily,

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.680
what you find is that for people

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.760
that have not been using cannabis at all,

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.530
or have only been using
it for about two years,

01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:08.260
their rates of eye blinks are much higher

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.640
than people who've been using
it chronically for 10 years.

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.800
In other words, people

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.420
who may be using cannabis for 10 years,

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.440
don't blink very often at all.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.530
Now cannabis has well known
effects in depleting memory,

01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:22.670
but it does seem to engage the focus

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.630
and blinking system in a
way that increases focus.

01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:27.310
So basically what I'm saying is

01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:29.250
marijuana seems to
increase people's focus,

01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:32.100
but then they can't remember
what they were focusing on.

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:35.450
Something I'd like to discuss
just briefly is the so-called

01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:39.520
interoceptive awareness that's
present in people with ADHD,

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.970
both children and adults.

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:43.690
Interoceptive awareness is one sense

01:37:43.690 --> 01:37:46.460
of one's own internal state heartbeat,

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:50.590
breathing contact of skin with
a given surface, et cetera.

01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:52.820
For a long time, there
was this hypothesis,

01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.970
this idea that people with ADHD,

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:57.610
were just not in touch with how they felt

01:37:57.610 --> 01:37:59.410
that somehow they weren't registering

01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:01.440
all the stuff that was
going on inside them

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.990
changes in heart rate and so forth

01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:04.900
and so they were behaving in a way

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.883
that was dysregulated
or appear dysregulated,

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:11.400
and that if they could
just learn to attend

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.240
to their internal state better,

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.320
that somehow they would
function better in the world.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.340
Now, before we described a process,

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:23.110
literally a 17 minute
interoceptive exercise

01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:25.860
that does seem to lead to improvements

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:29.940
in one's ability to focus
for a longer period of time.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:34.200
However, it's very unlikely
that that was due to

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.370
increasing interoceptive awareness per se.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:41.420
It probably wasn't because
people gain a much heightened

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:44.250
or improved ability to understand

01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:46.160
what's going on internally.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.950
In fact, you can imagine
how that might actually

01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:49.960
prevent one's ability to
pay attention to things

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.490
in the outside world.

01:38:51.490 --> 01:38:53.670
So while there is benefit
to just sitting there

01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:55.380
and being in stillness, as they say,

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.910
or focusing on one's
breathing and internal state

01:38:57.910 --> 01:39:00.380
for sake of then accessing information

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:01.930
in the external world,

01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:06.520
a really nice study called
interoceptive awareness

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.620
and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:11.140
explored whether or not
interoceptive awareness

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.832
was different in people with
ADHD or did not have ADHD

01:39:15.832 --> 01:39:20.200
and the findings were essentially
that there's no difference

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.460
that people with ADHD,
children, and adults,

01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:25.350
they are aware of what's
going on inside them

01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.550
just as much as anyone else's

01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:29.870
and the typical measure
of interoceptive awareness

01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:33.140
is one's ability to count
their own heartbeats.

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:36.060
This is actually challenging
for some individuals

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.890
and very easy for other individuals,

01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:39.660
regardless of their attentional capacity.

01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:41.870
Some people just can
really feel their heartbeat

01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:45.020
without taking their
pulse other people cannot

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.410
and these studies are pretty
straightforward to do.

01:39:47.410 --> 01:39:50.820
You ask people to sit there
and to count their heartbeats,

01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:52.700
and then you are
monitoring their heartbeats

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.140
and you get to gauge
how accurate they are.

01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.980
So it's important to understand
that people with ADHD

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.560
are in touch with how they feel.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.700
It's really a question of whether or not

01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:06.760
they can take the demands
that are placed upon them

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.430
and enter a cognitive
state of mental state

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:11.220
that allows them to access the information

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.053
they need to access

01:40:12.053 --> 01:40:13.300
in other words, whether
or not they can focus,

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.860
but it is absolutely wrong to think that

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:18.600
the child that's getting
up 11 times during a short

01:40:19.498 --> 01:40:21.660
six minute interaction at the table,

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.460
or whether or not a child who

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.270
somehow has to venture off every moment

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:27.640
or a coworker of yours

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.430
who's an adult who's constantly fidgeting

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.500
or moving things around that
somehow they are unaware

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.410
that they are oblivious,

01:40:32.410 --> 01:40:34.260
they're not oblivious to how they feel.

01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.520
Chances are they're very
challenged in the situations

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.353
that they're in

01:40:37.353 --> 01:40:38.860
and they're doing
everything they can to try

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.410
and regulate their attention.

01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:42.428
So I think it's an
important study to highlight

01:40:42.428 --> 01:40:44.760
because it really
underscores the fact that

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.170
something else is going on

01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:48.320
and that something else
has everything to do

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.600
with this ability to coordinate

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.220
these tasks directed networks,

01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.930
and to coordinate that in the proper way

01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:55.700
with that default mode network

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:58.120
and that is a process as you now know,

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.510
that's regulated exquisitely
by certain neurochemicals

01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:04.740
and in particular the
neurochemicals, dopamine,

01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:07.130
norepinephrine and serotonin,

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.040
and a fourth one I'd like
to throw into the mix,

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.380
which is acetylcholine,

01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:13.000
which is very vital for cognitive focus.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.410
So now I want to switch
back to talking about

01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:17.570
some of the drugs that are typically used

01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:19.800
to access those systems,
prescription drugs

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.070
and I want to talk about
some of the new and emerging

01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:23.930
non-prescription approaches

01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:25.990
to increasing the levels of dopamine,

01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:28.130
acetylcholine and serotonin in the brain

01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:30.240
using various supplement type compounds,

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.750
because several of them are showing

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.770
really remarkable efficacy

01:41:34.770 --> 01:41:36.740
in excellent peer reviewed studies.

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:39.770
So before moving to some of
the newer atypical compounds

01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:41.569
and things sold over the counter,

01:41:41.569 --> 01:41:46.300
I'd like to just briefly
return to the classic drugs

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.363
that are used to treat ADHD.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.590
These are the ones I mentioned earlier,

01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:54.640
methylphenidate also called Ritalin,

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.640
Modafinil or armodafinil is
another one and Adderall,

01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.190
again, all of these work by

01:42:02.190 --> 01:42:04.663
increasing levels of
dopamine and norepinephrine.

01:42:05.530 --> 01:42:08.534
Typically they're taken
orally in pill form,

01:42:08.534 --> 01:42:11.650
or sometimes in capsule form

01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:14.300
the dosages that are appropriate vary,

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:17.340
according to severity of the condition

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.890
for a given person and
the age of the person.

01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:24.240
This is a complicated
landscape for each individual.

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.760
They have to figure out the pharmacology

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.990
that's best for them.

01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:30.340
Some individuals are even layering long

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:35.160
or time to release Ritalin
with Adderall in smaller doses,

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.810
it can get quite complex or it
can be quite straightforward

01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:40.220
if you are really
interested in these drugs

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.260
and how they work

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:46.260
and you'd like to get a glance
at a table of all the results

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.860
from all the studies of
which there are now hundreds,

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:54.060
there's an excellent review
about these drugs and their use

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:57.270
and their comparison to
similarly structured drugs

01:42:57.270 --> 01:43:01.530
in particular MDMA and
cocaine and amphetamine,

01:43:01.530 --> 01:43:03.030
meaning Street Amphetamine

01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:05.170
to really illustrate the similarities

01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:08.560
of action and some of
the problems associated

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.270
with long-term use.

01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:11.870
I don't expect you to
read this article in full

01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:14.360
I'm here so that you don't
have to go read these articles,

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.100
but in case you want a ton of information,

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:20.740
the paper is Esposito et al
Frontiers and bio-sciences,

01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.810
it's an excellent, excellent

01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:24.680
review of the entire literature.

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.740
It is quite long.

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:29.860
I can put a link to that
study in our caption,

01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:33.110
and it essentially
describes all the studies

01:43:33.110 --> 01:43:35.970
that have been done, peer
reviewed and published,

01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:39.140
and it refers to these
drugs in an interesting way.

01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:42.040
It doesn't just refer these
drugs as for treatment of ADHD.

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.070
It actually refers to them
using language that ordinarily

01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:48.160
I'm not very fond of,
but I'll agree to here,

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.363
which is so-called smart
drugs or nootropics.

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:56.880
It also covers caffeine, which
again as I mentioned earlier,

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.370
increases dopamine norepinephrine

01:43:59.370 --> 01:44:01.890
and to some extent serotonin,

01:44:01.890 --> 01:44:05.100
but what I like about this
review so much is that

01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.040
in putting, these drugs of abuse,

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.610
methamphetamine, and cocaine,
right alongside these drugs,

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:12.370
like Ritalin and Adderall
and also caffeine,

01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:15.130
we start to realize that
the distinction between

01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:15.963
drugs of abuse

01:44:15.963 --> 01:44:18.020
and the distinction
between drugs of treatment

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:21.750
is actually a very fine and
sometimes even a blurry line

01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:25.440
and in thinking about whether
or not one wants to use

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.700
these prescription, I want
to emphasize prescription,

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:28.533
not drugs of abuse,

01:44:28.533 --> 01:44:29.510
but prescription drugs

01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:32.223
for treatment of one's
own attentional capacity.

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:35.290
I think it is important to understand

01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:37.140
the extent to which they all carry

01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:38.620
more or less the same side effects.

01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:41.750
The one exception being
caffeine caffeine side effects

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:44.700
can be anxiety if you ingest
too much of it, insomnia,

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.340
if you drink it too late in the day,

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:49.440
but typically it will not
cause the major side effects

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.920
of the other drugs,

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.463
such as high propensity
for addiction and abuse.

01:44:55.595 --> 01:44:58.550
Amphetamines of any
kind as well as cocaine

01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:00.680
can cause sexual side effects

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.604
because they're vasoconstrictors.

01:45:02.604 --> 01:45:06.530
So, men have trouble achieving erection,

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:11.530
there can often be the intense
desire or libido for sex,

01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:14.370
but an inability to actually perform.

01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:16.990
So that's an issue with
any kind of stimulant.

01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:19.290
So these drugs are not
without their consequences.

01:45:19.290 --> 01:45:24.030
In addition, and here I'd lump
caffeine back into the mix.

01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:27.770
In addition, they almost all
carry cardiac effects, right?

01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:28.880
They increase heart rate,

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.830
but they also have effects on
constriction of blood vessels

01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:34.950
and arteries and veins
and so forth in ways

01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:37.570
that can create cardiovascular problems.

01:45:37.570 --> 01:45:40.540
Now, caffeine is a bit
of a complicated one.

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:42.650
I talked about this on a podcast long ago,

01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:44.940
but I'll just remind you that it turns out

01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:47.180
that if you are caffeine
adapted, in other words,

01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:49.300
if you are used to drinking caffeine

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.280
then the ingestion of caffeine,

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.330
most often will cause vasodilation
who actually allow more

01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:55.570
blood flow through.

01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:57.730
However, if you are not caffeine adapted,

01:45:57.730 --> 01:45:59.619
it will cause vasoconstriction

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:02.160
due to an increased stress response.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.220
So if you're familiar with caffeine,

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:06.250
caffeine can actually
have a little bit more

01:46:06.250 --> 01:46:08.090
of a relaxation response

01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.923
although if you drink enough of it,

01:46:08.923 --> 01:46:11.000
it will make you amped up.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.050
These other drugs, almost
always lead to vasoconstriction,

01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:18.220
increased heart rate dilation
of the pupils, less blinking,

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:19.890
heightened levels of attention,

01:46:19.890 --> 01:46:22.050
which looks very much like stress

01:46:22.050 --> 01:46:23.990
and at its extremes looks very much

01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:25.230
like the effects of street drugs,

01:46:25.230 --> 01:46:27.290
like cocaine and amphetamine.

01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:28.390
Because of the large amounts of

01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:30.620
dopamine that released in the brain.

01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:33.350
People tend to crave
that state over and over

01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:36.260
and yet with each subsequent use

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.010
are able to get less and less

01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:39.410
of that euphoric feeling

01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:41.330
or that really, really focused feeling.

01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:43.560
So one thing that's being
explored quite extensively now

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.760
in the treatment of
ADHD are drug schedules.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:51.720
Whether or not people should
take Adderall every day

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:52.800
or every other day,

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.830
whether or not they should take it

01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:55.160
only every once in a while,

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.760
whether or not young children
can take it just a few times

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.440
and engage in behavioral
training of the sort

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.990
that I talked about before,
where they're doing,

01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:05.990
maybe it's a 17 minute
meditation type exercise,

01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:08.130
but more likely it would be the movement

01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:10.430
followed by the visual focusing,

01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:13.040
cause that's only done for
20 or 30 or 60 seconds.

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:13.873
Why would you do that?

01:47:13.873 --> 01:47:16.490
Well in a chemically enhanced state,

01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:17.850
your brain is more plastic.

01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:21.713
The circuits are able to
modify and learn better.

01:47:22.574 --> 01:47:25.840
That's the optimal time to engage in focus

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.370
in a very deliberate way.

01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:29.330
So just taking a drug and expecting

01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:31.190
focus to just work at any point

01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:35.090
and being able to turn
focus on and off at will,

01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:38.010
that's an unrealistic expectation, right?

01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:43.010
More likely the best use of
things like Adderall, Modafinil,

01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:47.330
armodafinil and Ritalin is going to be

01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:51.500
to combine those treatments
with behavioral exercises

01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.360
that actively engage the very circuits

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.370
that you're trying to train up and enhance

01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:58.010
and then perhaps I want
to highlight perhaps

01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:59.400
tapering off those drugs

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.570
so that then one can use those circuits

01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:04.470
without any need for
chemical intervention.

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:07.150
So despite any controversy
that might be out there,

01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:09.070
I think it's fair to say that

01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:11.310
the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids

01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.220
can positively modulate

01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:16.650
the systems for attention and focus.

01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:20.530
So then the question becomes how much EPA,

01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:23.290
how much DHA does that differ for,

01:48:23.290 --> 01:48:25.810
what's helpful for depression, et cetera

01:48:25.810 --> 01:48:27.900
and actually it does differ

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.320
in reviewing the studies for this

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.960
it appears that a threshold
level of 300 milligrams of DHA

01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:37.200
turns out to be an
important inflection point.

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.098
So typically fish oils or
other sources of omega-3s

01:48:41.098 --> 01:48:43.950
will have DHA and EPA

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.860
and typically it's the EPA

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.170
that's harder to get at sufficient levels,

01:48:48.170 --> 01:48:50.150
meaning you have to take
quite a lot of fish oil

01:48:50.150 --> 01:48:52.380
in order to get above that 1000 milligram

01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:55.730
or 2000 milligram
threshold to improve mood

01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:56.680
and other functions.

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.280
But for sake of attention,

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.400
there are 10 studies that
have explored this in detail

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:05.440
and while the EPA component is important,

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.930
the most convincing studies
point to the fact that getting

01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:12.493
above 300 milligrams per day
of DHA is really where you

01:49:12.493 --> 01:49:14.290
start to see the attentional effects.

01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:16.500
Now, fortunately, if you're
getting sufficient EPA

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.403
for sake of mood and other
biological functions,

01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:22.610
almost without question,

01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:25.240
you're getting 300
milligrams or more of DHA.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.840
So that usually checks that box just fine.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.080
What's interesting is that
there's another compound

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:35.080
phosphatidylserine that has
been explored for its capacity

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.680
to improve the symptoms of ADHD.

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.740
Again, I don't think
this is any direct way,

01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:41.880
but rather in a modulatory way,

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:44.760
but it appears that phosphatidylserine

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.690
taken for two months for
200 milligrams per day,

01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:52.980
was able to reduce the
symptoms of ADHD in children.

01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:55.430
It has not been looked
at in adults yet as,

01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:57.270
at least as far as I know,

01:49:57.270 --> 01:50:00.610
but that this effect was greatly enhanced

01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:03.570
by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.

01:50:03.570 --> 01:50:05.710
So now we're starting to
see synergistic effects

01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:08.010
of omega-3 fatty acids
and phosphatidylserine

01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:11.210
again that was 200 milligrams per day.

01:50:11.210 --> 01:50:12.280
This is something that sold

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.250
over the counter in capsule
form, at least in the U.S.

01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:16.490
there were two studies,

01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:18.310
both were double-blind studies.

01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:21.870
I carried out for anywhere
from one to six months on both

01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:23.780
boys and girls and it
really was boys and girls,

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:24.790
not men and women.

01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:28.860
This was kids age one
to six or seven to 12,

01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:32.160
and it was a fairly
large number of subjects.

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.570
So 147 subjects in one
case in 36 in the other,

01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:39.280
the takeaway is that getting
sufficient levels of EPA

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:42.810
and particularly there's 300
milligram threshold of DHA,

01:50:42.810 --> 01:50:46.760
plus, if you are interested
in it and it's right for you,

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.970
200 milligrams of phosphatidylserine

01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:50.440
can be an important augment

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.510
for improving the symptoms of ADHD.

01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:55.400
You'll also find literature out there

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:59.290
and many claims about
so-called Ginkgo Biloba,

01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:01.810
which has been shown to have minor effects

01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:04.080
in improving the symptoms of ADHD,

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.883
not nearly as effective
as Ritalin and Adderall.

01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:12.490
Ginkgo Biloba is not
appropriate for many people.

01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:15.490
I am one such person, I don't have ADHD,

01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:19.330
but when I'd taken Gingko,
even at very low doses,

01:51:19.330 --> 01:51:21.690
I get absolutely splitting headaches.

01:51:21.690 --> 01:51:23.440
Some people do not
experience those headaches,

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.793
but it's known to have very
potent vasoconstrictive

01:51:25.793 --> 01:51:29.880
and vasodilating properties
that vary depending on

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:32.000
when you took the compound.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.770
So for those of you that
are exploring Ginkgo Biloba,

01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:38.060
and you will see a lot of
claims about Ginkgo Biloba

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:41.784
for attention in ADHD
definitely take the vasodilation

01:51:41.784 --> 01:51:46.030
vasoconstriction headache
issue into consideration.

01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:48.460
So I'd like to talk
about the drug Modafinil

01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:50.950
and the closely related drug armodafinil

01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:53.150
that's AR Modafinil.

01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:55.530
Because Modafinil and armodafinil

01:51:55.530 --> 01:51:57.370
are gaining popularity out there,

01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:00.300
both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy,

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:03.810
but also for communities of people

01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:05.950
that are trying to stay
awake long periods of time.

01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:10.030
So it's actively used in the
military by first responders,

01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:13.140
it's gaining popularity
on college campuses

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.480
and people are using it more
and more as an alternative

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.480
to Adderall and Ritalin and
excessive amounts of coffee.

01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:23.673
It does increase focus
and to a dramatic extent,

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:28.240
Modafinil typically was very expensive,

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:30.120
I don't know if it's still this expensive,

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.590
but when one has a prescription for it,

01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:35.620
it could still cost as
much as eight or $900

01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:37.894
even $1000 a month.

01:52:37.894 --> 01:52:41.980
Armodafinil is a far
less expensive version,

01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.940
that's chemically slightly
different than Modafinil.

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:45.880
Regardless of price

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:48.635
people are taking
Modafinil and armodafinil.

01:52:48.635 --> 01:52:52.550
Want to emphasize that
unlike Ritalin and Adderall,

01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:56.330
Modafinil and armodafinil
are weak dopamine

01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:57.780
re-uptake inhibitors,

01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.150
and that's how they lead
to increases in dopamine.

01:53:00.150 --> 01:53:02.610
So, whereas Ritalin and
Adderall, amphetamine,

01:53:02.610 --> 01:53:05.340
and cocaine lead to big
increases in dopamine

01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:07.910
also through re-uptake
mechanisms and so forth

01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:12.830
Modafinil is a weaker
dopamine re-uptake stimulator

01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:15.150
and so what that means is that it leaves

01:53:15.150 --> 01:53:17.750
more dopamine around to
be active at the synopsis,

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:19.910
the gaps between neurons,

01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:22.090
however, it also activates other systems.

01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:24.280
It acts on the orexin system,

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:26.430
which is actually a peptide
that we talked about

01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:28.450
in the episode on hunger,

01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:31.130
because it regulates hunger and appetite,

01:53:31.130 --> 01:53:34.340
and it regulates sleepiness
and feelings of sleepiness.

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.140
In fact, the, excuse me, orexin

01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:37.740
also called hypocretin system,

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:39.360
the orexin hypocretin system

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.060
is what's disrupted in narcolepsy.

01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.430
That was the important
discovery of my colleagues,

01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:46.630
Emmanuel Mignot and Seiji Nishino

01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:48.370
at Stanford some years ago,

01:53:48.370 --> 01:53:50.990
they identified the
biological basis of narcolepsy

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:54.840
and it's a disruption in the
so orexin hypocretin system

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.350
and Modafinil is one of the

01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:58.140
primary treatments for narcolepsy.

01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:01.640
It also has these other
effects on the dopamine system

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.930
and on the norepinephrine system,

01:54:03.930 --> 01:54:08.500
even though it doesn't lead
to quite as intense levels

01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.380
of dopamine and arousal and focus,

01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:14.027
it does have the property of
raising levels of attention

01:54:14.027 --> 01:54:16.190
and focus, and that's
why people are using it.

01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:19.697
So it's a somewhat
milder form of Adderall.

01:54:19.697 --> 01:54:22.796
Armodafinil for some people
works as well as Modafinil

01:54:22.796 --> 01:54:23.880
and as I mentioned before,

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:26.260
it's much lower cost for
other people it doesn't.

01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.920
I have an experience,

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:30.320
meaning I do have an experience

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.230
that I'll share with you with armodafinil.

01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:33.270
A few years ago,

01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:36.460
I was suffering from
jet lag, really terribly

01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:38.320
and I was traveling overseas.

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.830
I went to a meeting to give a talk,

01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:45.519
I took half of the prescribed
dose of armodafinil.

01:54:45.519 --> 01:54:47.720
It was prescribed to me.

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.250
I took that half dose
and I gave my lecture

01:54:51.250 --> 01:54:53.170
and then I stayed around
to answer questions

01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:56.090
and then four hours later,

01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:58.010
a friend of mine came up to me and said,

01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:01.100
you've been talking for
four and a half hours,

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.640
and they're only a few people still here.

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.670
Luckily there were still a
few people be a lot weirder,

01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:07.700
if the room was completely empty,

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.460
'cause it wasn't being recorded.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.990
So I have firsthand knowledge

01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:14.020
of the sorts of cognitive
effects that it can create.

01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.490
I personally would not
want to be in that state

01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:18.160
for sake of studying or learning

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.310
or for doing this podcast, for instance

01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:23.240
and I can honestly say that today,

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.580
all I've adjusted is some coffee

01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:27.532
and some Yerba latte tea and some water.

01:55:27.532 --> 01:55:30.940
I'm not on any of the compounds
that I've described during

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.820
the course of today's episode.

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.100
You might ask why I took
half the recommended dose

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:40.560
of armodafinil and the reason
is that I'm somebody who's

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:44.046
fairly hypersensitive to
medication of any kind,

01:55:44.046 --> 01:55:46.840
what you find if you
look in the literature,

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.620
is that about 5% of people

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:50.860
are hyper hyper sensitive to medication.

01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:53.930
They require far lower
doses of any medication

01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:56.590
than other people in order to
experience the same effects.

01:55:56.590 --> 01:55:57.680
I'm somebody that I think has,

01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:02.150
or modest a hyper if that
sort of oxymoronic statement,

01:56:02.150 --> 01:56:05.390
but a modest hypersensitivity
to medication.

01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:07.210
So I've almost always been able to get by,

01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:09.850
on taking less of whatever
was prescribed for me

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:11.920
and feel just fine

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.970
or in this case to feel
like it was still too much,

01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:17.180
it turned out that the right
dose of armodafinil for me

01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:19.130
was zero milligrams.

01:56:19.130 --> 01:56:20.000
Now you may notice that

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.800
I haven't talked much about acetylcholine.

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.960
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.010
that at the neuron to muscle connections,

01:56:27.010 --> 01:56:28.880
the so called neuromuscular junctions

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.880
is involved in generating
muscular contractions

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.823
of all kinds for all movements.

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:37.190
Acetylcholine is also released
from two sites in the brain.

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:38.980
So a little bit of
nomenclature here again,

01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:41.080
feel free to ignore the nomenclature,

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.720
but there is a collection of
neurons in your brain stem

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.100
that send projections forward,

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.600
kind of like a sprinkler system

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.060
that's very diffuse to
release acetylcholine

01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:53.680
and those neurons reside
in an area or a structure

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.260
that's called the
pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN

01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.380
and then there's a separate
collection of neurons

01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.068
in the basal forebrain called

01:57:02.068 --> 01:57:05.750
unimaginatively nucleus
basalis the nucleus at the base

01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:09.300
and they also hose the
brain with acetylcholine,

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.850
but in a much more specific way.

01:57:11.850 --> 01:57:13.497
So one is sort of like a sprinkler system

01:57:13.497 --> 01:57:15.430
and the other one is more like a fire hose

01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:16.510
to a particular location

01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:19.003
and those two sources of acetylcholine,

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.810
collaborate to activate
particular locations in the brain,

01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:26.540
and really bring about a
tremendous degree of focus

01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:29.740
to whatever is happening at
those particular synapses.

01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.020
So it could be a focus
on visual information

01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.230
or auditory information,

01:57:33.230 --> 01:57:35.677
if you're listening closely
to what I'm saying right now,

01:57:35.677 --> 01:57:37.320
and you just heard closely

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:39.420
step out from the rest of my sentence,

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:41.310
no doubt there was acetylcholine

01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:43.220
released at the sites in your brain

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:46.590
where the neurons that
represent your recognition

01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:49.290
of the word closely occurred, okay?

01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:51.370
So now you have an example
and you have an understanding

01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:52.530
and hopefully a picture in your mind

01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:54.261
of how all this is working,

01:57:54.261 --> 01:57:58.270
not surprisingly then drugs
that increase cholinergic

01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:59.845
or acetycholine transmission

01:57:59.845 --> 01:58:03.003
will increase focus and cognition.

01:58:03.003 --> 01:58:06.420
One such compound is so-called alpha GPC,

01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:09.970
which is a form of choline
and increases acetycholine

01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:14.660
transmission dosages as high
as 1200 milligrams per day,

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:16.530
which has a very high dosage spread out,

01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:19.610
typically it's 300 or
400 milligrams spread out

01:58:19.610 --> 01:58:23.170
throughout the day have
been shown to offset

01:58:23.170 --> 01:58:26.260
some of the effects of
age-related cognitive decline,

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:27.490
improved cognitive functioning

01:58:27.490 --> 01:58:29.600
people that don't have
age-related cognitive decline

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.980
that's a very high dose.

01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:34.750
Typically when people are
using alpha-GPC to study

01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:36.930
or to enhance learning of any kind,

01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:40.000
they will take somewhere
between 300 and 600 milligrams

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.690
that's more typical.

01:58:41.690 --> 01:58:43.670
Again, you have to check with your doctor,

01:58:43.670 --> 01:58:45.420
you have to decide if the safety margins

01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.120
are appropriate for you

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.570
obviously you'll want to check that out,

01:58:49.570 --> 01:58:52.450
but alpha-GPC is effective in creating

01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:54.920
more focused by way of
this cholinergic system,

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.790
It stimulates acetylcholine release

01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:58.940
from both of those locations,

01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:01.910
the PPN in the back of the
brain and nucleus basalis

01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:03.453
in the front of the brain.

01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:07.019
There are two other over
the counter compounds

01:59:07.019 --> 01:59:11.560
that are in active use out
there for treatment of ADHD

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:15.541
and in use for simply
trying to improve focus

01:59:15.541 --> 01:59:17.660
and the first one is L-Tyrosine

01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:20.290
it's an amino acid that
acts as a precursor

01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:22.370
to the neuromodulator dopamine

01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:23.317
and now knowing everything you know about

01:59:23.317 --> 01:59:25.820
dopamine, attention and
the circuits involved,

01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:27.900
it should come as no surprise as to why

01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:31.310
people are exploring the use
of L-tyrosine for that purpose.

01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:34.373
L-tyrosine does lead to
increases in dopamine.

01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:40.060
They are fairly long lived
and L-tyrosine can improve

01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:42.870
one's ability to focus, however,

01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:46.110
the dosaging can be
very tricky to dial in.

01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:48.750
Sometimes it makes
people feel too euphoric

01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:51.510
or too jittery or too
alert that they are then

01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:52.957
unable to focus well.

01:59:52.957 --> 01:59:56.320
So the dosage ranges are huge,

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.630
you see evidence for 100 milligrams

01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:00.900
all the way up to 1200 milligrams.

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:01.733
It's something that really

02:00:01.733 --> 02:00:02.750
should be approached with caution,

02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:04.780
especially for people that have any kind

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:07.560
of underlying psychiatric
or mood disorder,

02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:10.460
because dysregulation of
the dopamine system is

02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:15.420
central to many of the mood
disorders such as depression,

02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:19.080
but also especially
mania bipolar disorder,

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.030
schizophrenia, things of that sort.

02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:22.680
So it's something that
really should be approached

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:25.970
with caution, nonetheless,
in exploring what's out there

02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:27.800
and even some studies online

02:00:28.918 --> 02:00:32.550
that were done in either animal
studies or human studies,

02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:35.910
it's clear that L-tyrosine
is being explored for that

02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:39.410
purpose as is PEA and Phenethylamine,

02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:43.910
which is a essentially PEA,
but some related compounds.

02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:46.720
So there's a whole class of dopaminergic

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.800
or dopamine stimulating supplements

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.740
that people are using to try

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:52.060
and get their dopamine
levels up and again,

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:56.510
it's kind of a fine line
between too little enough

02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:57.420
and too much.

02:00:57.420 --> 02:00:59.610
If you want to get the literature on

02:00:59.610 --> 02:01:02.550
those two compounds
there, I will refer you to

02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:07.110
this great website at
examine.com just as it sounds

02:01:07.110 --> 02:01:09.800
and you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA,

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:11.050
and you can get the details on that.

02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:14.680
But I highly recommend also
going to their section on ADHD

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.800
to see how those particular
comment OENs relate specifically

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:20.950
to ADHD and cognitive focus.

02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:22.580
And last but not least

02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:24.290
in terms of these different compounds,

02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:26.893
I do want to mention the Racetams.

02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:30.400
These are somewhat esoteric

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.640
and probably most of you
haven't heard about them,

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.370
but some of you probably
know a lot about them

02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:36.780
and they are becoming more popular.

02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:40.650
They go by names like New
pepped and things of that sort.

02:01:40.650 --> 02:01:43.800
The Racetams. are illegal
in certain countries.

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:45.700
They are gray market in other countries,

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:48.930
and they are sold over the
counter in this country,

02:01:48.930 --> 02:01:53.930
in the U.S. so they have
different margins for safety

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.550
you definitely need to
consult your doctor,

02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:58.660
especially if you have ADHD,

02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:02.230
but new pepped has been shown when taken,

02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:06.010
at 10 milligrams, twice
daily can be more effective

02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:07.830
than some of the other Racetams.

02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:11.010
What is Noopept? Noopept taps
into the cholinergic system,

02:02:11.010 --> 02:02:14.760
the acetylcholine system in
ways, very similar to alpha-GPC,

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.350
but seems to have a slightly
higher affinity for some of the

02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:22.000
receptors involved and can
lead to those heightened states

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.100
of cognitive capacity

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:26.069
and there are these
studies one in particular,

02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:28.040
comparative studies of new pepped,

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.410
Racetams in the treatment of patients

02:02:29.410 --> 02:02:31.315
with mild cognitive disorders

02:02:31.315 --> 02:02:34.340
and brain diseases of
vascular and traumatic origin.

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:35.190
That's a mouthful.

02:02:35.190 --> 02:02:37.550
What this study basically points to

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:40.820
is the fact that people who
are experiencing some degree

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.150
of inability to focus
due to prior concussion

02:02:44.150 --> 02:02:47.840
or some vascular event, a
stroke or a schemey of any kind,

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.100
because neurons need blood,

02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:50.950
when the blood supply
is cut off to neurons,

02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:52.800
or when there's a bleed in the brain.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.810
Subsequent to that, often

02:02:54.810 --> 02:02:56.760
there are challenges in maintaining focus.

02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:59.120
This is very common for
people who have done sports,

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:00.650
where there's a lot of
running into each other

02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:04.360
with your head like rugby
football, hockey, and so forth,

02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.150
but also people who have
experienced head blows

02:03:06.150 --> 02:03:08.460
or often overlooked is the fact that

02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:11.410
most traumatic head injury
is not actually from sports,

02:03:11.410 --> 02:03:14.130
even football it's from
things like construction work

02:03:14.130 --> 02:03:16.640
from high-impact work of that kind.

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:18.560
So there does seem to be some efficacy

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:21.763
of new Pepped and Racetams.
and things like it.

02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:25.530
It's an emerging area and
as I mentioned in the U.S.

02:03:25.530 --> 02:03:27.370
these things are sold over the counter.

02:03:27.370 --> 02:03:29.660
Again, you have to figure
out if it's right for you,

02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:32.900
but they are beginning
to show some promise,

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:35.670
and I'm intrigued by
them because of the way

02:03:35.670 --> 02:03:37.700
that they tap into the cholinergic system,

02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.397
which is both directly involved in focus,

02:03:40.397 --> 02:03:42.430
and the ability to focus,

02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:45.790
but is also important for things related

02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:47.670
to age-related cognitive decline.

02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:51.320
So a decline in cholinergic
transmission or acetylcholine

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:54.320
as we call it in the
brain is one of the things

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:55.297
associated with cognitive decline

02:03:55.297 --> 02:03:58.400
and it does seem that increasing
cholinergic transmission

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.420
can offset some of that cognitive decline

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:03.280
and perhaps even more so in conditions

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:06.310
such as vascular damage or
concussion to the brain.

02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:09.480
If you're interested in
atypical treatments for ADHD

02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:13.320
compounds or improve
focus and related themes,

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.960
and you like reading about this stuff,

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:16.520
there's an excellent review article

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.220
that I can refer you to it's

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:22.600
by Ahn et al, AHN it was published in 2016

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.500
so it's a little bit behind the times,

02:04:25.647 --> 02:04:27.710
although it's surprisingly
comprehensive given that,

02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:32.550
which lines up all the various
drugs that I've discussed,

02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:34.590
Racetams., and Adderall and Ritalin,

02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:38.120
and various forms of dopaminergic agents

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.640
and cholinergic agents
spells out whether or not

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:43.360
they are sold over the
counter by prescription,

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.230
and really lines them
up in all their effects,

02:04:45.230 --> 02:04:48.160
their drawbacks, et cetera.

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.400
I'll refer you to that study.

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:52.414
It's available in its full
length form online for free

02:04:52.414 --> 02:04:56.640
it's Hen et al the journal
is neuro plasticity,

02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:58.950
neural plasticity, 2016

02:04:58.950 --> 02:05:01.430
should be very easy to find
if you put those keywords in,

02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:02.680
and while it is a review,

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:04.410
it is a very comprehensive review

02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:06.120
and if you're really into this stuff,

02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:08.650
and you also want to
learn a thing or two about

02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:11.480
how these things interact
with neurofeedback, et cetera,

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.470
there's some information in there as well.

02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:15.570
I know I've already covered
a lot of information,

02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:18.520
but there is one more
category of technology

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:22.560
for the treatment of ADHD
and for enhancement of focus

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.030
in anyone that I would like to emphasize

02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:28.920
and that's transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.980
Transcranial magnetic
stimulation also called TMS

02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:34.620
is achieving increasing
popularity nowadays

02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:38.410
for the treatment of all
sorts of neurologic conditions

02:05:38.410 --> 02:05:40.200
and psychiatric conditions.

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.850
It is a non-invasive tool,

02:05:41.850 --> 02:05:45.520
it involves taking a coil
it's a device with a coil

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:48.970
that's placed over particular
locations in the brain,

02:05:48.970 --> 02:05:53.220
and then sends magnetic
stimulation into the brain

02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:54.570
and it can actually pass through the skull

02:05:54.570 --> 02:05:56.550
without having to drill through the skull

02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:59.190
and nowadays can be used to both

02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:00.870
lower the amount of activity

02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:02.550
or increase the amount of activity

02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:04.740
in specific brain areas.

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:09.740
It's spatial, precision is not remarkable.

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:11.200
That doesn't mean it's not of use,

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:16.200
but it is not a super
fine green tool, okay?

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.460
It's not a canon, but
it's also not a needle.

02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:21.200
It is somewhere in between.

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.850
It can direct the activity
of particular brain regions

02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:26.450
at particular depths and as I mentioned,

02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:28.450
it can increase or decrease that activity.

02:06:28.450 --> 02:06:29.490
So for instance,

02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:31.160
I've had a TMS coil placed on my head,

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:33.930
not for therapeutic purposes, even it was,

02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:36.640
I wouldn't tell you, but rather just for,

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.990
well, I'm a neuroscientist

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:40.240
and I worked in a lab with
one for entertainment,

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.790
exploratory purposes, please
don't do this at home.

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.750
It was placed over my motor cortex,

02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:49.260
which generates voluntary action

02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:52.230
and it was a coil that at that time

02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:54.110
could only inhibit neurons

02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:56.670
and so what I was doing
as I was moving objects

02:06:56.670 --> 02:06:58.470
around on a table, just like I am now,

02:06:58.470 --> 02:07:00.330
it was actually a pencil, not a pen

02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:01.980
and I was tapping the pencil

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:05.400
and then the TMS coil was turned
on and for the life of me,

02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:08.570
I could not move that pencil, okay?

02:07:08.570 --> 02:07:11.510
Because it was inhibiting
my upper motor neurons

02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:12.970
in the portion of my cortex

02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:15.590
that controls voluntary activity.

02:07:15.590 --> 02:07:16.960
As soon as the coil was turned off,

02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.940
I could return to
tapping the pencil again,

02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:23.180
nowadays it's possible
to stimulate motor cortex

02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:26.180
or any area of the brain
with some degree of precision

02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:29.550
that could create the impulse to move

02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:31.690
without actually making
the decision to move.

02:07:31.690 --> 02:07:34.810
So you can literally engage
certain neural circuits

02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:36.860
and therefore behaviors
and certain thought

02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:38.000
and emotional patterns

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.436
by way of transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

02:07:40.436 --> 02:07:43.850
This has far reaching
and vast implications,

02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:46.030
as you can probably imagine

02:07:47.010 --> 02:07:50.750
in discussing ADHD with a
colleague that uses TMS,

02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:55.400
what they are doing is they
are taking the TMS coil

02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:59.270
to children and adults that have ADHD,

02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:01.950
and they're using it to
stimulate the portions

02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:04.750
of the prefrontal cortex
that we talked about earlier

02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:08.620
that engage task directed focused states.

02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:09.960
So rather than using a drug

02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.247
that generally increases dopamine,

02:08:11.247 --> 02:08:13.120
and some of the other chemicals involved

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:17.310
there you using directed TMS
stimulation of the circuits

02:08:17.310 --> 02:08:20.490
and fortunately, I was
quite relieved to hear this,

02:08:20.490 --> 02:08:24.060
they are combining that with
a focused learning task.

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:25.940
So they're literally
teaching the brain to learn

02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:28.810
in a noninvasive way, no drug at all

02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:31.590
and right now there are
experiments clinical trials

02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:34.110
going on, comparing TMS of this sort

02:08:34.110 --> 02:08:37.570
to the drug treatments of the
sort that we described earlier

02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:38.690
that engaged these circuits

02:08:38.690 --> 02:08:40.160
through pharmacologic mechanisms.

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:42.719
So very exciting times for TMS,

02:08:42.719 --> 02:08:47.719
very exciting times for
pharmacology related to ADHD

02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:49.750
and for enhancing focus in general

02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:51.580
and when I say very exciting times,

02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:53.460
I mean, no drug is perfect,

02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:57.250
but the constellation of
drugs that's out there

02:08:57.250 --> 02:08:58.920
is getting much larger,

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:01.320
but because they tap
into different aspects

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:02.153
of their circuitry,

02:09:02.153 --> 02:09:04.060
I do think that we are well on our way

02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:06.870
to identifying the ideal
combinations of drug treatments,

02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:08.010
technological treatments,

02:09:08.010 --> 02:09:11.360
and behavioral paradigms
for increasing focus in both

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.130
children and adults with ADHD.

02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:16.650
And as a final final point,

02:09:16.650 --> 02:09:18.980
I also want to mention
something about technologies

02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:22.140
that are making it harder
for all of us to focus,

02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:23.240
regardless of whether or not

02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:25.360
we have pre-existing ADHD or not.

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.823
You can probably guess
where this is going.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:31.180
Everybody nowadays seems
to have a smartphone.

02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:33.250
I'm sure there are a few
individuals out there

02:09:33.250 --> 02:09:35.540
that don't have a smartphone.

02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:37.160
Nonetheless, most people have them.

02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.090
Most kids want one, as
soon as they can get them

02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:45.090
and they are small, they
grab our attention entirely.

02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:48.560
But within that small box of attention,

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.860
there are millions of attentional windows

02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:53.160
scrolling by, right?

02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:55.170
So just because it's one
device that we look at

02:09:55.170 --> 02:09:56.800
does not mean that we are focused,

02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.630
we are focused on our phone,

02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:00.000
but because of the way,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.400
in which context switches
up so fast within the phone,

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:06.430
it's thought that the
brain is struggling now

02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:09.540
to leave that rapid
turnover of context, right?

02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:12.190
Many, many shows, many,
many Instagram pages,

02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:14.230
many, many Twitter feeds
many, many websites.

02:10:14.230 --> 02:10:16.500
Basically the whole world,

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.500
at least in virtual format is available

02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:20.160
within that small box.

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:21.590
Unlike any other technology

02:10:21.590 --> 02:10:23.120
humans have ever dealt with before,

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:25.370
even though there are trillions

02:10:25.370 --> 02:10:27.150
infinite number of bits of information

02:10:27.150 --> 02:10:29.280
in the actual physical world,

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.530
your attentional window,

02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:32.740
that aperture of constriction

02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.910
and dilating that visual window

02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:36.620
is the way in which you cope with all that

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.140
overwhelming information typically.

02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:40.640
Well within the phone,

02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:44.010
your visual aperture
is set to a given width

02:10:44.010 --> 02:10:45.040
it's about this big,

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:46.740
typically the phone seem
to be getting bigger,

02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:48.970
but nonetheless, it's about that big

02:10:48.970 --> 02:10:51.130
and within there,

02:10:51.130 --> 02:10:54.600
your attentional window is
grabbing it near infinite

02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.300
number of bits of
information, colors, movies.

02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:59.120
If a picture is worth 1000 words,

02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.450
a movie is worth a billion pictures,

02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:03.540
the brain loves visual motion

02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:06.083
and so the question is,

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.380
does that sort of interaction
on a regular basis

02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:12.010
lead to deficits in the types of attention

02:11:12.010 --> 02:11:13.610
that we need in order to perform well

02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:15.690
in work, in school,
relationships, et cetera

02:11:15.690 --> 02:11:19.200
and the short answer is
yes, it does appear so

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.170
we are inducing a sort of ADHD

02:11:22.170 --> 02:11:25.120
and while the studies on this
are ongoing because prominent

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.930
use of smartphones really
took off right around 2010

02:11:27.930 --> 02:11:32.930
and we're only in 2021
longstanding studies take time,

02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.910
which is essentially to say the
same thing as long standing.

02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:39.100
There are some studies
and one in particular

02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:39.933
that I'd like to highlight

02:11:39.933 --> 02:11:42.900
one was actually carried
out pretty early in 2014.

02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:46.080
This is a study that
explored smartphone use

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:47.970
at the time they called
it mobile phone use,

02:11:47.970 --> 02:11:50.670
but smartphone use and inattention,

02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:54.820
difficulties in attending
in 7,102 adolescents

02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:58.020
that's a huge study,

02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.410
a population based cross-sectional study

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:06.300
and you will be probably
surprised and somewhat dismayed

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.070
to hear that in order
to avoid this decrease

02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:11.583
in attentional capacity,

02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:16.440
adolescents needed to use their smartphone

02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:19.290
for less than 60 minutes per day,

02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:23.010
in order to stay focused and
centered on their other tasks.

02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:24.530
Otherwise they started to really run

02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:26.410
into significant issues.

02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:28.610
So 60 minutes is not much,

02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:30.997
I've a feeling that most young people

02:12:30.997 --> 02:12:33.690
are using their phone more
than 60 minutes per day,

02:12:33.690 --> 02:12:35.170
I know I am.

02:12:35.170 --> 02:12:36.020
I think for adults,

02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:40.660
the number's probably higher
meaning if you're an adult,

02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:43.770
I'm going to just extrapolate
from what I read in this study.

02:12:43.770 --> 02:12:47.110
It seems that probably two
hours a day on the phone

02:12:47.110 --> 02:12:49.760
would be the upper limit beyond which

02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.440
you would probably experience

02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:54.063
pretty severe attentional deficits.

02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:57.910
I'm a big fan of Cal Newport
who wrote the book "Deep work."

02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:59.267
He's also written an excellent book,

02:12:59.267 --> 02:13:00.390
"A world without Email."

02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:02.460
I've never met him, but I'm
a huge admirer of his work

02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:05.160
and I will paraphrase
something that he said

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:07.420
far more eloquently than I ever could,

02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:12.200
which is that the brain does
not do well with constant

02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:15.610
context switching, meaning it can do it,

02:13:15.610 --> 02:13:18.620
but it diminishes our
capacity to do meaningful work

02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:20.270
of any other kind.

02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:24.150
And so Cal, as I understand is very

02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:25.550
he's our computer science professor

02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:26.800
at Georgetown, by the way,

02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:29.890
is very structured and very disciplined

02:13:29.890 --> 02:13:32.313
in his avoidance of cell phone use.

02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:34.850
I think we're all striving to do that.

02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:36.100
I'm not here to tell you what to do,

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:39.520
but I think whether or
not you have ADHD or not,

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:42.930
if you're an adolescent
limiting your smartphone use

02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:45.360
to 60 minutes per day or less

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.920
and if you are an adult to
two hours per day or less

02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:54.140
is going to be among the
very best ways to maintain,

02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:56.640
just to maintain your ability to focus

02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.360
at whatever level you can
now and as I always say,

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.040
most of the things that we get recognized

02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.900
for in life success in
life, in every endeavor,

02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:08.905
whether or not it's school
relationships, sport,

02:14:08.905 --> 02:14:12.810
creative works of any kind
are always proportional

02:14:12.810 --> 02:14:16.070
to the amount of focus that
we can bring that activity.

02:14:16.070 --> 02:14:18.300
It is important to rest of
course, to get proper sleep.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:20.400
But I stand behind that statement

02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.390
and I leave you with that
study about attention

02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:26.670
and cell phones and how cell
phones are indeed eroding

02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:28.610
our attentional capacities.

02:14:28.610 --> 02:14:31.680
So I realized I covered a
lot of information about ADHD

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.690
and the biology of focus and
how to get better at focusing.

02:14:35.690 --> 02:14:37.590
We talked about the behavioral

02:14:37.590 --> 02:14:40.250
and psychological phenotypes of ADHD.

02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:43.640
We talked about the
underlying neural circuitry.

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:45.900
We also talked about the neurochemistry

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:47.890
and we talked about the
various prescription

02:14:47.890 --> 02:14:51.140
drug treatments that are
aimed at that neurochemistry

02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:53.600
and aimed at increasing focus in children

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:55.520
and adults with ADHD.

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.290
We also talked about over
the counter compounds,

02:14:58.290 --> 02:15:01.690
the role of particular types
of diets and elimination diets

02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:04.430
and we talked about interactions
between these various

02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:08.110
features in dictating outcomes for ADHD

02:15:08.110 --> 02:15:10.100
and enhancing focus in general,

02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:13.420
we also talked a little bit
about emerging neurotechnologies

02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:15.900
and how certain technologies
like the smartphone

02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:18.590
are no doubt hindering
our ability to focus

02:15:18.590 --> 02:15:23.540
and put us at greater risk of
developing ADHD at all ages.

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:27.020
I do acknowledge the irony
and somewhat the contradiction

02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:30.640
of doing a two hour plus episode on ADHD

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.880
If indeed, people who are watching this

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:34.470
have challenges with attention,

02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:36.460
I want to emphasize that this podcast,

02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:38.510
like all of our podcast episodes

02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:41.210
are timestamped for a specific reason.

02:15:41.210 --> 02:15:42.420
They are designed to be digested

02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:45.580
in whatever batch one chooses, right?

02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:47.520
You don't have to watch or
listen to the entire thing

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:48.830
all at once however,

02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:51.350
if you've gotten to this
point in the podcast,

02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:52.300
I want to thank you.

02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:55.410
I do hope that you've learned
a lot about this condition.

02:15:55.410 --> 02:15:57.030
I hope you've also learned a lot

02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:58.990
about your own capacity to focus

02:15:58.990 --> 02:16:00.850
and things that you can
do to enhance your focus.

02:16:00.850 --> 02:16:02.520
We even talked about
a tool that takes just

02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:06.031
one 17 minute session to
enhance your ability to focus

02:16:06.031 --> 02:16:08.934
thereafter, presumably forever.

02:16:08.934 --> 02:16:11.650

02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:53.579
for research on neurobiology
in my laboratory.

02:16:53.579 --> 02:16:55.300
In addition, we have a Patreon

02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:58.510
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:00.470
There you can support the podcast

02:17:00.470 --> 02:17:01.880
at any level that you like.

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:03.790
During today's episode
we talked a lot about

02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:05.950
supplement based compounds.

02:17:05.950 --> 02:17:07.220
If you're interested in supplements

02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.460
and you want to see the
supplements that I personally take,

02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:14.430
you can go to Thorn that's
T-H-O-R-N-E slash the letter U

02:17:14.430 --> 02:17:17.880
slash Huberman and you can
see everything that I take

02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.590
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

02:17:20.590 --> 02:17:23.850
or if you navigate into the
Thorn site through that portal,

02:17:23.850 --> 02:17:27.360
you can get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorn makes,

02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:28.750
supplements aren't for everybody,

02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:30.700
you by no means have to take supplements.

02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:32.060
But if you are going to take supplements,

02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:33.290
it's important that you take supplements

02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:35.200
from a source that's reputable

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:38.180
and which the ingredients
are very high quality

02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:40.460
and in which the amount of the ingredients

02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:41.760
that listed on the bottle

02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:43.380
actually matches what's in the bottle.

02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:44.970
That's why we partnered with Thorn

02:17:44.970 --> 02:17:46.900
because they have the
highest levels of stringency

02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:50.000
in terms of quality and
specificity of the ingredients.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:50.833
And finally,

02:17:50.833 --> 02:17:53.280
I want to thank you for your
time and your attention,

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:56.104
and as always thank you for
your interest in science.

02:17:56.104 --> 02:17:58.687
