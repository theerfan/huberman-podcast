00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.910
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.760
where we discuss science

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.816
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:05.816 --> 00:00:08.399
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.460
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.300
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.350
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.580
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.040
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.060
it is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.150
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
about science and science-related tools

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.960
to the general public.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.200
Before we begin today,
just want to acknowledge

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.890
that if you're watching this on YouTube,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.880
yes, I have a bandage on
the left side of my face,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.250
I was trying to cook
something for Costello and I

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.350
and I got burned, burned myself,
it was a cooking accident.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.727
I'm fine, no need to dwell
on it, we can move on,

00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:43.020
but I just wanted to let you know

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.070
everybody's going to be okay,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.500
he got a great meal, I got
a burn and a great meal.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.740
Today's episode is brought
to us by Four Sigmatic.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.640
Four Sigmatic is a wellness company

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.720
that makes mushroom coffee.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.830
For those of you that haven't heard

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.140
of mushroom coffee before,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.340
I just want to make clear,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.880
these are not psychedelic mushrooms,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.890
and no, the coffee does not
taste like mushrooms at all.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.200
It tastes amazing and
it tastes like coffee.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.750
I started using Four Sigmatic
coffee a few years ago

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.270
and then we actually stocked it in my lab,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.770
we still stock it in my lab

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.960
because it tastes really good

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.570
and it also happens to have
two types of mushrooms in it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.170
that I particularly like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.390
because of their supplement
and medicinal qualities,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.000
and those two are lion's mane mushroom,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.370
which has been shown in
several research studies

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.000
to have a mild anxiolytic,
meaning anti-anxiety effect,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.540
and mood-elevating effect,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.560
those are from research
studies done independently,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.680
as well, it has Chaga mushroom,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.160
Chaga mushroom has been shown
to increase growth factors

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.120
that impact the nervous system,
like nerve growth factor,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.540
so that's the reason I drink it,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.170
and that's the reason
we stock it in the lab,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.260
and that's the reason
why I drink it at home.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.960

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.293
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Blinkist.

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:18.180
Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of nonfiction books

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.190
condensed down to just 15
minutes of key takeaways

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.010
that you can read or listen to.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.410
For me, I really like
listening to books on Blinkist,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.360
even books that I've already read.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.550
Typically, the way I consume information

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.370
is, unless it's fiction, I'll
listen to a nonfiction book

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.770
or I'll read the actual,
physical hard copy

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.110
of a nonfiction book,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170
and then at the end, I
like to take some notes

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.290
about things that really stuck with me

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.500
or key takeaways that I'd like to teach

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.140
or share with other people.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.890
With Blinkist, it allows me
to go back to those books

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.710
and get all the essential items,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.980
some of which I might have missed

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.540
in the course of listening to or reading

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.870
the full-length version,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.480
and if I haven't read a book before,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.920
it also gives me a sense of whether or not

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.770
I'd like to read the book.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.880
Blinkist has some terrific
science category books,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.677
for example, my colleague and
friend David Eagleman's book,

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:07.490
"Livewired," which came out recently,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.170
is all about neuroplasticity,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.720
it's a fantastic book, I
read the full-length book,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.400
and I've listened to it on Blinkist,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.290
and it's a terrific
synopsis of "Livewired,"

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.123
that's in there.

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.030
David Sinclair's book, "Lifespan,"

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.790
many of you probably
know that David Sinclair,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.170
professor of genetics at
Harvard Medical School,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.920
is a real pioneer in the
aging and longevity field,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.450
his book "Lifespan" is terrific,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.330
I've read the full-length
book, I've listened to it,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.917
and I've listened to it on Blinkist,

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:35.300
and so it really captures a
lot of the essential elements

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.740
that you would want to get from that book.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.090
Blinkist is also just a great way

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.040
to get through many books on the bookshelf

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.590
that you've been meaning to get
to but you haven't had time.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.580
With Blinkist, you can
get unlimited access

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.180
to read or listen to a
massive library of books,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.950
not just science books,

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.910
and they're all condensed in
this way of just 15 minutes

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.150
will allow you to get
all the key information,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.840
so right now, for a limited time,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.170

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.420
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Theragun.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.200
Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.550
that releases deep muscle tension.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.050
I was introduced to Theragun

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.400
on a dive expedition for my
laboratory a few years ago.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.960
On that expedition, we
were working very hard,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.120
we were diving all day,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.600
we were carrying pelican
cases with equipment,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.090
we were carrying tanks,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.180
very sore, very tired
by the end of the day,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.910
as was everybody else.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.420
Someone brought along a Theragun,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.350
and pretty soon, that thing
was getting passed around

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.670
and became the most
coveted device on board

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.410
because it really works to relieve

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.770
the soreness and deep muscle tension

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.910
that accumulates with
physical work, exercise,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.140
even just sitting too
long throughout the day,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.100
so when I got back, I got a Theragun,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.980
I still use the Theragun daily,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.920
it's terrific because it's very quiet

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.010
so you can use it while watching a movie

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.410
or even while having a conversation

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.520
without it feeling intrusive,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.130
it really gets down into the
meat of the muscle if you want,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.090
or you can use it more
superficially if you like.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.640
If you want to try Theragun,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.060
you can go to theragun.com/huberman,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.710
they have several models available,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.750
the first one starts at $190,
which if you think about it,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.690
is comparable to the price
of a professional massage

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.680
except that unlike a professional massage,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.160
you can use the Theragun
for as long as you want

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.010
throughout the day and for
as many days as you like,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.470
that's theragun.com/huberman,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.480
and I should mention that there's

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.810
also a 30-day money-back guarantee,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.850
so if you don't like the
product, you send it back,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.200
you get your money back.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.100
This month on the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.950
we're talking all about hormones,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.320
these incredible chemicals
that can impact our mood,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.220
our behavior, our feelings
of optimism or pessimism.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.720
The amazing thing about hormones

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.520
is that hormones impact all those things,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.680
but all those things,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.850
how we feel and what
we do and what we think

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.677
also can impact our hormones,

00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:12.330
and so it's a really
fascinating area of biology

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.120
that impacts every single
one of us every day

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.270
both in wakefulness and in sleep

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.070
and throughout the lifespan.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.910
Today, we're going to be talking
about hormone optimization,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.740
and we're mainly going to be focusing

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.030
on estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.530
Last episode of the
"Huberman Lab Podcast,"

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.630
we talked about sexual development,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.840
that is, how the chromosomes,
the gonads, and hormones

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.040
impact what we call sexual development,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.930
leading all the way up to puberty.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.420
Today, we're mainly going
to talk about processes

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.440
that happen from puberty onward,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.422
although we might talk

00:06:45.422 --> 00:06:47.050
a little bit about development as well,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.930
so today, we're going to talk
a lot about basic biology,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.600
but we're going to weave
in a lot of practical tools

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.500
along the way for how to optimize

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.750
these incredibly powerful
things that we call hormones.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.270
Before we dive into our discussion

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.740
about hormone optimization,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.570
I want to raise what I think
is a very important point

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.660
that at least I hadn't
heard of until recently,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.620
which is the concept of salutogenesis.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.810
Many of us are familiar with
the concept of pathogenesis,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.970
the idea that there are
all these scary diseases

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.070
like dementia and heart
disease and stroke,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.850
and all these things that await us

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.520
if we don't take good care of ourselves

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.340
and that might await us even if we do,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.341
that's the pathogenic model,

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:28.140
salutogenesis is something I learned about

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.270
from one of my Stanford
Medicine colleagues,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.660
which is a different orientation

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.790
toward health and well-being

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.540
where you're taking on
particular behaviors,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.420
you're taking on a particular stance

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.820
towards nutrition and exercise,
supplementation, et cetera,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.340
in order to promote well-being
above where you would be

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.323
if you were not doing those behaviors.

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:48.510
Now, if you think about
it, these two things,

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.860
salutogenesis and the pathogenic model,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.220
are really two sides of the same coin,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.720
but I'll just give an example

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.610
of how this might affect
you in a real way.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.240
If you like exercise because
it feels good, great,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.780
but many people exercise, or
eat well, for that matter,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.250
in order to avoid heart
disease or to avoid dementia,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.440
to avoid negative changes
in body composition,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.000
and while that's powerful

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.980
and certainly is the case that exercise

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.140
will help you move away
from all those things,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.950
the salutogenesis model differs

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.790
in that it involves a
mindset and an orientation

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.340
towards doing those things
in order to feels good,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.280
in order to enhance your level of energy,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.400
in order to improve endocrine function

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.950
and metabolic function,

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.830
so it's really part of
the pathogenic model,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.460
and yet, salutogenesis is
really more of a mindset

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.770
toward why you would do
these particular behaviors,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.410
and really, the most powerful mindset

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.520
is going to be one where you are thinking

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.860
about the pathogenic model,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.680
doing things so that you
don't end up sick, et cetera,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.370
and to move away from sickness,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.270
as well as the salutogenic
model where you're doing things

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.760
in order to move towards
health and well-being.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.730
We think of health and wellness nowadays,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.700
or the wellness community
or wellness practices,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.340
and in many ways,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.940
that is the essence of
the salutogenic model,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.380
but I found it very interesting

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.860
to know that within the
field of allopathic medicine,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.930
these two models exist

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.880
but we don't hear about
the salutogenic model

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.050
quite as often,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.350
so it's just something to keep in mind,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.203
especially because of some
of the mindset effects

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:16.810
that were discussed in previous episodes,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.530
I'm not going to go into these
in detail again right now,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.280
but if you might recall from
the episode on food and mood,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.170
we talked about some of
these incredible studies

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.220
that were done by Alia Crum's
group at Stanford and others

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.650
showing that if you tell people

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.840
that the behavior that
they're about to do,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.200
in this case, it was people
cleaning up hotel rooms

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.380
because that was their job,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.450
if you tell them that it's good for them,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.450
then you see much greater
positive health effects

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.640
than if they aren't
aware of that information

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.710
that it's good for them,

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.880
so we should really be thinking

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.140
about not just moving away from
disease and negative things,

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.730
but also why certain
things are good for us

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.580
because it's well-established now

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.700
from really good scientific studies

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.480
that keeping in mind the
positive effects of things

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.920
can really have an outsized
effect on well-being,

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.020
right down to the level of our physiology.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.710
So let's talk about hormone optimization,

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.590
today we're going to talk
about hormone optimization

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.360
in reference to estrogen and testosterone

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.950
and their derivatives,

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.720
now, estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.180
are what we call sex steroids,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.620
now, the sex steroids
immediately call to mind sex,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.770
for obvious reasons,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.770
and steroids, meaning anabolic steroids,

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.810
but I just want to emphasize
that estrogen and testosterone

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.540
are present in everybody,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.117
it's their ratios that
determine their effects,

00:10:36.117 --> 00:10:37.580
and so today we're going to talk

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.380
about how you can optimize their ratios

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.890
depending on your particular life goals

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.750
because the ratio of
estrogen and testosterone

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.100
in every individual has profound influence

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.300
on feelings of well-being,
feelings of optimism,

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.570
feelings of anxiety or lack
of anxiety, on reproduction,

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.050
on sexual behavior
independent of reproduction,

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.260
they are profoundly powerful molecules,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.890
and we all make these molecules,
to some degree or another,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.890
but there are also
important behavioral tools,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.990
supplementation tools,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.440
as well as prescription drugs

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.610
that can impact the ratios
of testosterone and estrogen

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.220
in really powerful ways,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.350
so we're going to cover all of that.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.070
I want to emphasize that when you hear

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.610
sex steroids or steroid hormones,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.250
most people think about anabolic steroids,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.580
and of course, anabolic steroids

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.900
are derivatives of testosterone
or testosterone itself,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.240
and they are heavily used and
abused in the sports community

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.330
as well as outside the sports community,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.300
but there, of course, are many steroids

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.730
that are not anabolic steroids

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.260
that are also abused in sports.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.530
Today, we're not talking
about drugs in sports,

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.900
but I think that it
carries such a heavy weight

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.380
when people hear the word steroids,

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.060
they think about anabolic steroids,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.290
so while today's discussion

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.330
will certainly be relevant
to physical performance,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.170
in fact, we're going to talk

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.580
about how specific types of exercise,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.810
particular patterns of cold exposure,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.880
as well as particular
patterns, believe it or not,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.960
of breathing can impact
sex steroid hormones,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.130
both estrogen and testosterone,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.660
the discussion isn't really geared

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.590
towards performance enhancement in sport,

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.620
although we will do an entire episode,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.900
perhaps even an entire month

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.460
related to performance enhancement
in physical enterprises.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.390
So one of the first things to understand

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.560
if you want to optimize your hormones

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.340
is where they come from.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.100
There are a lot of
different glands in the body

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.100
that produce hormones,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.980
there's the pineal gland,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.660
some hormones are made
in the hypothalamus,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.650
hormones are made by the gonads,
the ovaries or the testes,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.440
you've got the thyroid gland,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.610
there are a bunch of different glands

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.150
that make these different hormones,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.150
but when we're talking about
the sex steroid hormones,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.520
estrogen and testosterone,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.710
the major sources are ovaries for estrogen

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.350
and the testes for testosterone,

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.120
although the adrenals can
also make testosterone.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.410
Now, there are also some enzymes,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.800
enzymes are things that can
change chemical composition,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.820
and the enzymes that we're
going to talk about today

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.920
are the aromatases mainly,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.490
the aromatases convert
testosterone into estrogen,

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.350
so in a male, for instance,
that has very high testosterone,

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.440
some of that is going to be

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.690
converted into estrogen by aromatase,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.790
and aromatase is made by body fat,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.150
it's also made in the testes themselves,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.250
a lot of people don't realize this,

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.280
but the testes actually have the capacity

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.550
to manufacture estrogen and
aromatase, albeit at low levels,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.260
but this turns out to be important

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.960
for optimizing hormone levels
in males at later points,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.350
and we'll discuss that.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.300
It's important to note
that there's a huge range

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.150
in terms of the levels of hormones,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.530
testosterone and estrogen,
between individuals,

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.080
and it actually occurs within individuals

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.140
across the lifespan,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.820
I'm not going to throw
out specific numbers

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.610
of X picograms per
deciliter, et cetera today

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.580
because that's going to vary a lot,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.960
it's going to depend on
whether or not you're measuring

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.250
in picograms or nanograms
and that sort of thing,

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.880
if you want to examine your hormones,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.070
you should do that in conjunction
with a medical doctor,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.680
ideally, an endocrinologist can help you

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.190
sort out that information,

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.080
but the important thing to know

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.700
is that prepubescent females
make very little estrogen,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.720
and when we talk about estrogen,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.360
we mainly talk about estradiol,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.560
which is the most active form of estrogen

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.350
in both males and females.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.900
So prepubescent females,
very low levels of estrogen,

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.800
during puberty, levels of estrogen,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.770
AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket,

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.420
and then across the lifespan,
estrogen is going to vary

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.360
depending on the stage
of the menstrual cycle,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.210
but as one heads into menopause,

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.130
which typically takes place nowadays

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.840
somewhere between age 45 and 60,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.340
levels of estrogen are going to drop

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.143
and then post-menopause levels
of estrogen are very low.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.880
As well, testosterone will
fluctuate across the lifespan,

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.370
testosterone is going to be
relatively low prepuberty in males,

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.920
during puberty, it's going to skyrocket,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.920
and then the current numbers

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.430
are that it drops off at
about a rate of 1% per year,

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.010
although we're going
to talk about some data

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.160
that show that there's
actually tremendous variation

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.450
in testosterone levels,

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.640
there's actually a lot of examples

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.040
of men in their 90s, their 90s,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.570
who still have testosterone levels

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.410
that mimic pubertal levels,

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.830
which is remarkable and
speaks to the huge variation

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.570
in testosterone levels across individuals.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.960
So let's talk about other
sources of these hormones,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.800
and then it will make clear

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.430
what avenues you might want to take

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.580
in order to optimize these hormones.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.720
The other glands and tissues in the body

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.660
that make these hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.900
as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.170
so the adrenals right
on top of the kidneys,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.230
and the release of these steroid
hormones from the adrenals,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.337
in particular testosterone

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:45.300
and some of its related derivatives,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.910
are mainly activated by competition,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.940
so let's talk about competition

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.520
because it turns out that competition

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.000
is a powerful influence on
the sex steroid hormones,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.360
and the sex steroid hormones

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.200
powerfully influence competition.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.780
So most people don't realize this,

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.590
but most males of a
given mammalian species

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.880
never get to reproduce,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.910
in fact, they never even
get to have sex at all,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.600
and we don't often think about that,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.930
but testosterone plays a powerful role

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.380
in determining which
members of a given species

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.690
will get to reproduce,

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.840
which ones of that species

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.310
will actually get access to females,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.640
and so here I'm not talking
about humans specifically,

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.200
but it's well known in
species like elephant seals,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.010
in species like antlered
animals and rams, for instance,

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.820
that the higher levels of testosterone

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.310
correlate with access to females.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.160
Now, one interpretation of
this is that the females

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.290
are detecting which males
have high testosterone

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.370
and selecting them,

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.570
they're more receptive to them,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.890
we're going to talk about
receptivity for mating in a moment,

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.750
but it's actually more so that the males

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.610
that have higher
testosterone forage further

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.090
and will fight harder for the females,

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.450
and this is really interesting

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.400
because there's very good evidence now

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.970
that testosterone can reduce anxiety,

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.870
promote novelty-seeking,

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:17.290
and promote competitive interactions,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.690
and so before you leap too
far with this in your mind

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.633
and think about all these human
behaviors, just stay with me

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:23.590
because there's a little
bit of biology here

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.950
that makes it all make sense

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.143
and it turns out to be pretty simple.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.150
We have a brain region
called the amygdala,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.580
in Latin, that just means almond,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.130
but the amygdala is most
famous for its role in fear,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.690
we hear a lot about fear and the amygdala,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.660
but that the amygdala

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.740
is really involved in threat detection,

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.450
it sets our thresholds for anxiety

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.020
and what we consider scary or too much,

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.590
testosterone secreted from the gonads

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.740
and elsewhere in the body
binds to the amygdala

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.700
and changes the threshold for stress,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.170
so I've said before on previous
versions of this podcast

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.540
and on other podcasts

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.230
that testosterone has
this incredible effect

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.940
of making effort feel good,

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.920
but what I was really
referring to is the fact

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.560
that testosterone lowers
stress and anxiety,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.330
in particular, in males
in a given species.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.380
Now, this is important

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.340
because we often think of
testosterone as creating,

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.930
whatever, masculinization

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.510
or it's, you know, virilization,

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.230
or all these terms are thrown around,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.300
but what's it really doing

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.430
when it comes to mate
choice and competition?

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.790
What it's doing is it's reducing
the threshold for anxiety,

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.370
and in doing so, it selects individuals

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.900
of a given species to push further,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.080
being willing to suffer more,

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.370
although it also reduces pain,

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.870
so maybe they also suffer less,

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.810
in pursuit of reproduction and females.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.640
Now, it's well known in humans
that both males and females

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.970
who have elevated levels of testosterone

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.120
will engage in more novelty-seeking,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.450
and I do want to point out

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.470
that even individuals without
testes have testosterone,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.440
and peaks in testosterone
have similar effects

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.226
regardless of whether or not
someone has ovaries or testes,

00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:10.850
testosterone increases
generally lead to more foraging,

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.820
more novelty-seeking, increases in libido,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.270
and increases in desire to mate,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.950
so it is the case that
increases in testosterone

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.460
promote competitive and
foraging-type behaviors

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.200
in humans and in nonhuman mammals,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.280
but it's also true that competition itself

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.970
can increase androgens,
such as testosterone,

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.470
I want to repeat that, competitive
environments themselves

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.670
can increase testosterone.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.600
Now, some people have
come to the conclusion

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.950
that if you win, your
testosterone goes up,

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.920
and if you lose, your
testosterone goes down,

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.490
and to some extent, that's true,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.590
but that's not a direct
effect on the gonads,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.360
that's actually mediated by
the neuromodulator dopamine,

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.370
we talked about dopamine

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.730
in the episode on motivation and drive,

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.310
and dopamine and testosterone

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.180
have a remarkable interplay in the body,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.300
dopamine is actually released in the brain

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.480
in ways that has the pituitary,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.760
this gland that sits over
the roof of your mouth,

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.900
release certain hormones

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.230
that then go on to promote the
release of more testosterone,

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.020
and indeed, winning
promotes more dopamine,

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.750
and later, more testosterone,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.650
however, in the short term,

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.220
just competing increases testosterone

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.060
independent of whether
or not you win or lose,

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.400
so the short version of this

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.190
is that competition
increases testosterone,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.550
and this may be an ancient
mechanism whereby the androgens,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.250
such as testosterone, are feeding back

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.430
to encourage more
competitive-type behaviors

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.810
because every species,

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.260
whether or not you're
talking about reproduction

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.090
or other resource allocation,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.670
is involved in competition,

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.570
not every individual of a species

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.670
gets access to the same number of mates

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.520
or the same quality of mates,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.030
and this is true in both directions,

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.220
for males and females and
everything in between.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.310
So I just want to emphasize once more

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.130
in case I went through it too quickly

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.390
that increases in testosterone in females

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.610
are also going to lead to
increase in reproductive behavior

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.720
or seeking out reproductive
behavior, they increase libido,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.900
in fact, there's a particular
phase of the menstrual cycle

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.640
where testosterone peaks
just before ovulation

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.640
that, on average, leads
female humans to seek out sex

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.920
more than they would
otherwise during their cycle,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.490
and this is all by self-report,

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.360
but this is also while measuring

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.210
things like testosterone-estrogen
ratios, and so forth,

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.490
so it's really interesting
that a single molecule,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.190
regardless of chromosomal
or gonadal background,

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:41.190
is increasing seeking of
mates across individuals,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.900
increasing desire to compete
or willingness to compete,

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.240
and lowering the threshold
for stress and anxiety.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.490
It's important to point out

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.650
that while increases in testosterone

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.660
promote seeking of mates and reproduction

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.800
in both males and females,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.140
in females, it's actually
increases in estrogen

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.870
that promote receptivity to mating,

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.570
so testosterone is
driving the seeking of sex

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.170
and estrogen is promoting

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.850
the actual act of sex from females,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.900
so-called receptivity,
consensual receptivity.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.800
In males, it's interesting to
point out that testosterone

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.140
is promoting seeking of sex,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.830
but it's also estrogen in males
that's important for libido,

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.480
if estrogen levels are brought too low,

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.610
then men will completely
lose their libido,

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.000
this is often not discussed or overlooked

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.640
in the discussion about
testosterone therapy

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.340
and performance-enhancing drugs,

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.020
people think that
hyperandrogenized individuals,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.510
meaning people that have
very high levels of androgen

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.410
will have very high levels
of libido, and they will,

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.930
provided estrogen is available

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.870
in sufficient ratios to
match that testosterone,

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.220
so it's not simply the case

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.240
that high levels of testosterone

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.220
produce a lot of sex and mating behavior

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.500
and low levels of estrogen
are good across the board,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.340
you actually need both in
both males and females,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.880
it's just that in females,
the testosterone levels

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.630
are always going to be lower
than the estrogen levels,

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.400
and in males, the estrogen levels

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.770
are always going to be lower
than testosterone levels,

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.340
so testosterone promotes
sex-seeking behavior,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.040
and the real question then is,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.800
does sex itself promote testosterone?

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.600
And the answer is somewhat complicated,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.750
but the short version is yes,

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.250
and as you recall, sex
has multiple stages,

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.210
so there's the physical act of sex,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.610
there's the seeking of sex,

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.780
and then there's orgasm and ejaculation.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.800
Now, it's important to
distinguish between these

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.610
because whether or not sex
itself increases testosterone

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.860
depends on whether or
not the male ejaculates,

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.850
and this is very important to understand

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.580
because on a previous episode,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.810
I mentioned how dopamine
increases with sexual activity,

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.560
remember, dopamine and testosterone

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.900
tend to increase linearly
with one another,

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.690
but then after ejaculation,
there's a release of prolactin,

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.770
and prolactin actually sets
the refractory period in males

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.290
during which he can't have sex again,

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.190
and the duration of the refractory period

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.320
will vary tremendously depending
on how much and how long

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.300
that prolactin release occurs.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.400
I also described in a previous episode

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.010
how some people take vitamin B6,

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.927
I'm not suggesting anyone do this,

00:24:17.927 --> 00:24:21.550
but take vitamin B6 in order
to reduce prolactin levels

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.680
and thereby reduce the duration
of the refractory period,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.050
but getting at this question

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.740
about testosterone and sexual behavior,

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.860
it's important to distinguish

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.770
between these different
phases of reproduction

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.680
or reproductive behaviors,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.680
so there are studies showing
that sexual behavior itself

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.100
can increase testosterone,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.970
there was a study published in 2011

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.110
from Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A,

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.310
this is the stuff of
textbooks, this is on PubMed,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.910
these are quality studies,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.020
showing that men who observe sex,

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.950
so I guess this would be
observing pornography,

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.740
will have slight increases in testosterone

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.120
during the observation,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.910
these people actually were
willing to have blood draws taken

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.780
while watching pornography,

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.750
they had increases in testosterone
that were very modest,

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.670
of about 10%,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.550
whereas when people participated in sex,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.720
so they actually did this study
where people had blood draws

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.370
and they had real sex with their partners,

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.280
and they had 70%
increases in testosterone,

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.430
so there are increases in testosterone

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.350
that are quite significant

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.060
during the physical act of sex

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.520
and far less so during observing sex.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.300
Now, the question that I often get,

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.210
in fact, it's one of the
questions I get most often

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.420
in the comments on YouTube,

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.710
I don't know why that is,

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:43.710
is whether or not ejaculation
adjusts testosterone levels,

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.180
and it turns out, there are
two studies that I could find

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.040
that were quality studies
on PubMed that address this,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.240
that sex and ejaculation itself

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.830
does not reduce testosterone levels

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.380
although it will increase prolactin levels

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.440
for the reasons I described a moment ago,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.440
however, abstinence or
sex without ejaculation

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.220
for a week or more

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.480
will increase testosterone
levels up to 400%,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.930
so the answer is actually complicated,

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.490
it's not straightforward,

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.640
what it means is that sex
itself increases testosterone,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.440
however, abstinence also
increases testosterone

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.600
even further,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.710
so it's a nuanced answer,

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.590
and I hope this is
satisfactory, no pun intended,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.600
to those of you that have been asking me,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.070
what is the relationship
between sex and ejaculation

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.770
and testosterone and dopamine?

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.410
It is nuanced, and you have
to understand that nuance

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.810
if you want to understand

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.900
how certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.190
and how hormones impact those behaviors.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.120
As I mentioned before, in females,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.030
testosterone also primes the
motivation to seek out sex,

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.930
and sex itself also
increases testosterone,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.080
but it also increases prolactin,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.690
so in both men and women,

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.650
sex increases prolactin post-sex,

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.380
it's just the way that the system works,

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.610
it's that testosterone
and dopamine increase

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.200
in the seeking-out and
the behavior of sex,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.950
and then after sex,
prolactin levels go up,

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.130
there's kind of a quiescence,

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.250
the whole nervous system
is promoted towards calm,

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.480
and this may actually have
something to do with pair-bonding

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.820
and the encouragement of individuals

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.910
to spend more time together

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.810
to exchange different smells and hormones,

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:27.920
and maybe even pheromones,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.920
and we're going to talk
about pheromones in a moment.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.930
A few years ago, there
was a lot of excitement

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.840
about the hormone DHEA,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.021
which is mainly made by the adrenals,

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:40.300
DHEA has been promoted
as kind of a catch-all

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.640
for increasing testosterone and estrogen

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.620
in males and females,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.300
and indeed, DHEA will increase

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.170
both testosterone and estrogen,

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.740
this is something to be mindful of

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.420
if you're thinking about taking DHEA

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.666
or you're taking DHEA already.

00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:57.840
DHEA will increase both
testosterone and estrogen,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.820
and the extent to which it
increases one or the other

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.760
will depend on whether or
not you're starting off

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.690
with more estrogen than testosterone

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.570
or whether or not you're starting off

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.100
with more testosterone than estrogen

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.400
and whether or not you
have a lot of aromatase,

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.420
so for individuals that
have a lot of aromatase

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.760
being made by the testes or by body fat,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.610
if you take DHEA, there's a good chance

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.500
that a fair portion of that

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.070
is going to be shuttled
towards estrogen production

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.440
and not towards testosterone production,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.860
whereas in individuals that have

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.690
low levels of testosterone to begin with,

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.960
high levels of estrogen,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.270
there's a good chance that the DHEA

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.370
is going to promote mainly
estrogen production,

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.910
at least that's what I could find

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.110
from the research studies that I examined.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.580
So the way to think about DHEA,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.570
it's a kind of global promoter
of the sex steroid hormones,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.670
and its specific effects
are going to depend

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.100
a little bit on where you started

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.240
and whether or not you
have ovaries or testes.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.500
So just as there are behaviors

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.620
that can increase testosterone,

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.890
there are behaviors that
can decrease testosterone,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.630
and one of the most
well-characterized ones in humans

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.360
is becoming a parent.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.360
So expecting fathers have
an almost 50% decrease

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.053
in testosterone levels, both
free and bound testosterone,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.220
as well, their cortisol
levels, a stress hormone,

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.670
drop by almost three-fold,
which is incredible,

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.360
and their estradiol levels double,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.230
so their estrogen levels double,

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.210
so expecting fathers
many people have known

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.910
put on additional body weight,

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.960
everyone always thought that
it's because they're eating

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.410
in parallel with their pregnant wife,

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.770
but it turns out that these
effects of reduced testosterone,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.130
increased estradiol, and reduced cortisol

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.910
can all be explained by
an increase in prolactin,

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.050
so not just in humans, but
in other species as well,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.780
when the male and female of that species

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.680
are expecting young,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.420
they lay down more body fat,

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.170
the assumption is that this is to prepare

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.250
for long nights of no sleep,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.510
which occurs in many
species, not just in humans,

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.860
so it's really interesting
that this hormone, prolactin,

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.680
can start suppressing whole
categories of hormones,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.830
sex steroid hormones,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.080
and can start increasing whole
categories of other ones,

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.630
so we hear about the dad bod,

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.220
there are a lot of
explanations for the dad bod

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.630
that extend well beyond
this podcast episode,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.220
but it is a well-known phenomenon

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.890
that testosterone is going to drop,

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.030
prolactin's going to increase,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.940
estradiol's going to
increase in males and females

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.970
that are expecting children.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.550
Now, how long that lasts
is very interesting,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.860
it actually has to do
with how much contact

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.210
and how much contact with smells

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.030
of the baby, of the offspring,

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.430
the father happens to have,

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.910
so how available or unavailable he is

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.920
will actually impact
his level of hormones,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.730
now, I'm definitely not promoting the idea

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:47.040
that fathers or mothers take
time away from their offspring

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.940
in order to keep their
testosterone levels high

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.250
or to restore them,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.700
that's not what I'm saying at all,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.070
it's just interesting to point out

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.730
that these evolutionary
mechanisms push us toward

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.400
or bias us toward particular
categories of behaviors

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.980
by influencing our hormones,

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.070
which then feed back

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.190
and promote more of
that particular behavior

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.940
because as I mentioned before,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.710
peaks in testosterone in males and females

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.330
cause individuals to seek
sex, not promote parenting,

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.720
whereas reductions in testosterone,

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.080
increases in prolactin,
and decreases in cortisol

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.810
move individuals of both sexes
toward parenting behavior

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.820
and less toward reproductive behavior.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.470
The other behavior that
markedly reduces testosterone

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.000
in both males and females

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.160
and markedly reduces the desire

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.270
for seeking sex and sex itself is illness,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.697
and many of you might say,

00:31:36.697 --> 00:31:38.557
"Well, duh, when people feel sick,

00:31:38.557 --> 00:31:40.097
"they don't feel like seeking out mates,

00:31:40.097 --> 00:31:41.670
"they don't feel like having sex,"

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.180
but have you ever wondered
why that actually is?

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.610
Well, it turns out that
it can be explained

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.800
by the release of what are
called inflammatory cytokines,

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.340
so cytokines are related
to the immune system,

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.280
they travel in the lymph and in the blood,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.990
and they attack invader cells
like bacteria and viruses,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.970
and under conditions of illness,

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.720
we make a lot of different cytokines,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.710
some of them are anti-inflammatory,

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.800
but some of them are pro-inflammatory,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.430
and the best-known example

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.950
of a pro-inflammatory cytokine is IL-6,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.270
and it's known that IL-6, when
injected into individuals,

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.770
will decrease the desire for sex

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.090
and eventually will reduce

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.630
levels of testosterone and estrogen

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.660
independent of feeling lousy,

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.770
so the reason why people don't
want sex when they're sick

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.080
is because levels of IL-6 are increased.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.110
Now, this is important

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.360
because as we start to think
about the different ways

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.540
to modulate the sex steroid hormones,

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.283
so-called optimize the hormones,

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.860
keeping levels of IL-6 low

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.130
is going to be important for
them to exert their effects,

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.510
now, IL-6 doesn't just
travel to the gonads

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.360
and shut down the gonads,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.190
it actually has ways to interact
with some of the receptors

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:52.390
that the steroid hormones,

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.500
estrogen and testosterone, bind to,

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.890
and impact those receptors

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.650
so that the sex steroid hormones
can't have their effect.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.690
In short and put simply,

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.930
inflammatory cytokines like IL-6

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.790
are bad for sex steroid hormones,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.240
and so we're going to talk
about how to modulate IL-6

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.030
in the direction that you would want

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:13.340
and how to increase another
cytokine called IL-10,

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.090
which is anti-inflammatory

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.660
in ways that can help
promote, or at least support,

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.220
the sex steroid hormones.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.400
So as we move forward,

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.230
we're going to now start to consider

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.460
what sorts of behavioral practices,

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.080
as well as other things,

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.180
can modulate the sex steroid hormones

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.383
in the directions that
you want them to go,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.780
but before we do that,

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.480
and in order to set the stage for that,

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.230
you should be asking yourself,

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:41.130
how is it, or why is it,
at a mechanistic level,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.090
that behaviors can
modulate hormones at all?

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.140
If you think about it,
it's kind of strange

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.510
that just the mere act of
being a parent or parenting

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.030
can change testosterone
levels so dramatically

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.120
or estradiol levels so
dramatically, what is it?

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.880
Is it the sweat of the baby?

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.390
Is it their saliva?

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.750
Is it the sight of the baby?

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.730
Is it holding the baby,
or is it all those things?

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.100
It turns out that many of those effects

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.820
are because of smell,

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.070
or in some cases, even
possibly pheromones.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.280
Now, I talked about hormones,

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.520
hormones, again, are a
chemical, travels in the body,

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.080
impacts tissues and cells
elsewhere in the body,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.210
a pheromone is a chemical that's released

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.750
by one member of a species

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.110
that goes and impacts members elsewhere,

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.960
but of the same species,
or even of other species.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.820
Now, pheromone effects are
absolutely well-established

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.390
in lots of animal species,

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:34.800
but they are very controversial in humans.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.880
Today, I'm going to talk

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.430
about some of the
well-established ones in animals,

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:40.420
I've mentioned one or two of these before

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.800
on previous podcasts,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.450
but I haven't mentioned several of them,

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:47.460
and I'm going to talk about the evidence

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.780
for pheromones in humans
that are well-established.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.770
So the main ones in
animals that are discussed

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.870
are called the Lee-Boot
effect, the Whitten effect,

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.480
the Bruce effect, and
the Vandenbergh effect,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.680
named after the people
that discovered them.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.940
The Lee-Boot effect is when

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:07.390
you house females of a given
species together with no males,

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.360
they start displaying longer,
what are called estrus cycles,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.730
in many species, they don't
have menstrual cycles,

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:13.870
which are 28 days,

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.730
they have estrus cycles
which tend to be four days

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.123
or some variant thereof.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.190
It's an interesting phenomenon
because what it means

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.530
is that the presence of the male itself

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.170
is changing the ovulation cycle.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.520
Now, many people out there,

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.250
I imagine mostly the people
that are ovulating out there

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.447
will say, "Of course, I
notice I ovulate differently,

00:35:35.447 --> 00:35:38.357
"or my cycle changes when I'm
in the presence of my partner

00:35:38.357 --> 00:35:39.420
"or I'm not,"

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.610
but the pheromone effect

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.840
that mirrors this
Lee-Boot effect in humans

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.460
has still not really been identified,

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.360
nobody knows what the exact chemical is,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.270
but nonetheless, this is a
strong effect in some animals.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.340
The other one is the Bruce effect,

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.830
and this is a very dramatic effect

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:58.830
whereby a pregnant animal will
abort or reabsorb her fetus

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.360
if the dad of those animals,

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.840
the father that sired the litter,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.410
because these are
animals, they're litters,

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:11.410
is removed and a novel male
is placed in her vicinity

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.840
for about 48 hours,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.550
and what's interesting is
the way that this happens

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.830
is a pheromone that comes from male urine

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.870
activates the gonadotropin-releasing
hormone system

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.550
and causes a reintroduction
of the estrus cycle

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.960
and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.270
Now, a lot of people have
taken the Bruce effect

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.500
kind of to its extreme

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.770
and asked whether or not in humans,

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.730
miscarriages are caused by
detecting the pheromones

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.000
or odors of novel males,
meaning the non-dad male,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.630
and that's still an open question,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.360
nobody knows if that's true or not,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.660
so I want to emphasize that.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.120
The other one is the Vandenbergh effect,

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.160
and this is one I alluded to

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.780
in a previous episode of the podcast,

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.460
which is that puberty in
females can be accelerated

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.300
by placing a novel sexually competent male

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.460
in with a young female who
has not undergone puberty.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.660
There's also a version of this,
which I haven't described,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.520
which is delay of puberty

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.270
where you take juvenile female animals

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.100
that have not undergone puberty

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.830
and you put them with more mature females

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.830
of the same species,

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.710
and that introduction of more
females will cause a delay,

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.270
a significant delay in
the onset of puberty.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.900
So these are all pheromone effects,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.380
and we know they're pheromone effects

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.500
because they're not conscious,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.090
they also don't require actual contact

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.730
with the other members of a given species,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.460
these are all effects that can be mediated

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.240
by the urine from a given species

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.260
or by the sweat of a given species,

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.360
and speaking of sweat,
the one pheromone effect

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.620
that I'm very aware of from
the published literature

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.970
is a paper that was published in 1998

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.770
by Stern and McClintock

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.930
which was getting at this question

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:55.700
of synchronization of menstrual cycles.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.390
Now, the whole idea of
synchronization of menstrual cycles

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.350
is pretty controversial,

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:02.507
for a long time, people said,

00:38:02.507 --> 00:38:06.050
"Oh, this is absolutely a
well-characterized phenomenon,"

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.130
people in dormitories,

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.010
their menstrual cycles would synchronize,

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.900
people living in environments together,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.470
their menstrual cycles would synchronize,

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.070
and then some studies came out

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.550
that kind of undercut those data

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.360
and said no, this actually doesn't happen,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.840
and it was kind of controversial,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.430
but there is a very clear effect

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.770
that was described by
Stern and McClintock,

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.470
what they did actually
was they took females,

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.520
they charted their cycles,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.520
and then they had other females
wear pads in their armpits

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.850
and they collected sweat
from those females,

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.640
and then they took the
sweat from those pads

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.210
in those female's armpits,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.540
and they introduced them to women

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.640
who had never had contact with
the people who had sweated,

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.230
they only had contact with their sweat,

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.987
in fact, they swabbed it
underneath their nose,

00:38:53.987 --> 00:38:57.650
and if that sounds gross,
they dilute it in alcohol,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.630
so much so that they can't actually detect

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.180
the odor of the sweat,

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.790
that's actually very important
because it's not the smell,

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.590
it's the pheromone chemical itself,

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.670
and it turns out the
pheromone chemical itself

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:12.450
can modulate the menstrual cycle,

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.830
although it doesn't
necessarily synchronize it

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.280
with the sweater,

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.820
what it does is it changes

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.390
the duration and the pattern of ovulation

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.750
relative to the so-called
follicular phase,

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.920
long and short of this

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.410
is that the sweat and
pheromones of females

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:34.110
can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.830
of other adult females,

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.220
it's just a question of whether
or not they synchronize,

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.670
and if you're kind of
rolling your eyes now

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.033
and saying, "Well, of course they do,

00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:42.300
"and this is really detailed,"

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.140
this is how the science is done,

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.720
and the reason why people are so skeptical

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.650
about the presence of
pheromone effects in humans

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:54.620
is that there's no
well-identified pheromone organ,

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.910
you know, we have an area of our nose

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.200
that's responsible for smelling,
that's well-established,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.560
it's been observed in
MRIs many, many times,

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.920
in cadavers many, many times,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.750
in pretty much all individuals,

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.010
but the vomeronasal organ,

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.740
which is the pheromone-detecting organ,

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.640
hasn't really been found in humans,

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.250
there's something called Jacobson's organ,

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.660
which is thought to be
the organ in the nose,

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.060
it's actually on the top
of the roof of the mouth

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.660
and in the kind of back of the nose,

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.580
this is for you wine tasters,

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.660
I never can pronounce this,

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.620
what are they called,
sommelier, whatevers,

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.430
the people that are excellent at drinking

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.500
and detecting the essences of wine

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.830
that you have to go
through all these tests

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.840
in order to get certified as one of them,

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.743
somebody tell me,

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.200
they are using probably
a similar mechanism

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.840
of mixing taste and smell,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.940
and Jacobson's organ, if it exists,

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.990
the vomeronasal equivalent in humans,

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.320
is thought to be a combination
of smell and taste.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.760
Now, it gets even weirder and cooler

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.430
when you think about a given
study that was done in humans

00:40:55.430 --> 00:41:00.430
where if you take hundreds
of t-shirts from boyfriends,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.810
keep them separate,

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.210
you take those t-shirts,

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.940
you wash them many times separately,

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.680
and then you offer them
to the girlfriends,

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.950
the long-time partners of those guys,

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:15.840
and what you'll find
is that the girlfriend

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.610
can pick out her boyfriend's t-shirt

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.260
among hundreds of other t-shirts,

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.770
not because it smells different,

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.370
but because something
about it seems different,

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.500
it might smell different to her

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.530
in some way that's kind of
imperceptible even to her,

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.450
and the level of accuracy
in detecting that t-shirt,

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.560
her partner's t-shirt,

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.150
is way above statistical
significant thresholds,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.050
so much so that you almost have to say

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.780
there's something about these effects

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.800
that are real pheromone effects,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.020
although people still argue

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.610
that there are no pheromone
effects in humans,

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.130
that it's all through olfaction,

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.613
I think these are interesting
and important to understand

00:41:50.613 --> 00:41:52.310
because it means that a lot of things

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:53.540
coming through our nose,

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.830
whether or not it's pheromones or smells,

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.540
are impacting hormones and
our ability to attach memories

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.320
and kind of recognition
of mates and other people,

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.440
including our children,
not just our mates,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.450
and of course, perfume manufacturers

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.600
have really picked up on
the idea of pheromones

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.950
and have entire laboratories set up

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.670
to build chemical compounds into perfumes

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.400
that are designed to attract other mates,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.870
this is a well-established and
well-documented phenomenon.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.210
And the last point I'll
make about pheromones

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.260
is that this combination
of taste and smell

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.290
is such a real thing in the animal world

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.080
that there's something
called the flehmen response,

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.520
during the mating seasons
for different animals,

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.110
you can actually even see this in horses,

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.020
but for animals that are seasonal maters,

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.810
they'll do something
called the flehmen response

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.690
where they actually open
their lips and their mouth

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.870
and they expose their gums

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.890
so that they can capture pheromones

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.490
that are floating in the
wind in the environment,

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.170
they actually are looking for mates

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.260
using their mouth and
kind of sniffing around.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.093
If you own a dog

00:42:53.093 --> 00:42:55.150
and you watch the way that
the dog will sniff around

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.850
selecting where they want to
urinate, males and females,

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.040
they're bringing
molecules into their nose,

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.710
I know it sounds kind of
gross, sniffing urine,

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.160
but there are a lot of
pheromones in urine of animals,

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.740
a lot of pheromones that
are traveling in the wind,

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.700
again, whether or not this
is happening in humans,

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.970
I don't know, but then you
think about the perfume thing,

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.760
and here people are putting
these scents on themselves

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.340
that contain putative
pheromones, human pheromones,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.040
and walking around
hoping that their scents

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.190
are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:26.930
from other individuals of
the same human species,

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:30.090
so we are among the
animals in this behavior,

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.500
independent of whether or not you believe

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.900
pheromone effects exist.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.510
So let's get back to behaviors

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.703
that can help optimize hormone levels.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:40.810
One of the main behaviors
that's been shown

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:45.730
to be associated with
poor levels of estrogen

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.020
relative to age-match controls
for people with ovaries

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.750
or lower levels of testosterone

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.960
compared to age-match controls

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.063
for people with testes, is apnea,

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.020
apnea has everything to
do with under-breathing

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.320
and the buildup of too much
carbon dioxide in the body,

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.930
there are other effects of apnea as well,

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:13.590
but if there's a consistent
literature in this whole story

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.980
about aging and reductions in hormones

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:20.560
and general health and reductions
in hormones, it's apnea.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.860
I went deep into the literature
on advanced menopause,

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.460
or when menopausal
symptoms are exacerbated,

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.860
and I went into the
literature on andropause,

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.810
or early-onset andropause,

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.500
or levels of testosterone

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.850
that are far lower than they
should be for a given age,

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:41.090
and in every case, you
could find multiple papers

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:45.830
that show that apnea, or
poor efficiency of breathing

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.920
and buildup of too much
carbon dioxide in the body

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.753
was a problem,

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:51.920
mostly sleep apnea,

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.880
although apnea in general
was shown to be an issue

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.840
negatively impacting hormones.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:00.620
Now, the directionality of this
effect isn't entirely clear,

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.420
it could be that reductions
in estrogen cause apnea,

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.810
and actually, there's some reason

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.070
to believe that might be the case,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.080
I found at least one paper

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.130
showing that there are estrogen receptors

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.790
on some of the neurons that
actually innervate the lungs

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.350
and allow for the perception

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.470
of how full or empty the lungs are,

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.370
in other words, reductions in
estrogen may adjust breathing

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.880
by changing our sensitivity
to our own lungs,

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.440
now, that was true for males and females,

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.930
remember, estrogen is
both males and females,

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:36.570
but as well, I found papers in
which testosterone reductions

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.150
were associated with apnea,

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:41.240
and testosterone receptors are also found

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.900
on a lot of cells in
the so-called viscera,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.340
including the lungs,

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.200
so again, the directionality
of the effect isn't clear,

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.540
but what's really interesting

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.610
is that there are very clear ways

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.350
in which patterns of breathing,

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.620
especially patterns of breathing in sleep,

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.380
can modulate hormones

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.590
in ways that are immediately actionable

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.820
and can serve to optimize
both estrogen and testosterone

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.610
regardless of whether or not
you have ovaries or testes.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.090
So what is apnea?

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.830
Apnea is under-breathing,

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.360
or mainly, cessation of
breathing during sleep,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.610
so people are holding their breath,

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.532
and then they'll suddenly wake up,

00:46:16.532 --> 00:46:18.730
and actually I've talked
about the physiological sigh

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.920
on previous episodes of this podcast,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.230
of this pattern of double
inhales followed by exhales

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.060
that one can do consciously
to reduce stress and anxiety

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.830
and offload carbon dioxide,

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:29.970
that pattern of breathing

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.380
is actually what kicks in spontaneously

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.210
anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:36.910
although in many people who have apnea,

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.640
they don't engage the physiological sigh.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.850
People who are dramatically overweight

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.560
also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep,

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.790
there's actually a lot of buildup

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.410
of carbon dioxide in the body,

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.580
and that can lead to excessive
sleepiness during the day,

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.240
inability to access the
deeper phases of sleep,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.090
and it's well-established
that going into deep sleep

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:00.350
and getting the proper patterns

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.740
of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.200
are important for hormone optimization.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.760
I talked about how to modulate
sleep and optimize sleep

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.700
in the first month of the
"Huberman Lab Podcast,"

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.440
so please check out those
episodes if you have sleep issues

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.920
or you want to work on your sleep,

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.080
also check out Matt Walker's
terrific book, "Why We Sleep,"

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.170
and that will help you
find various protocols

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.250
to help you optimize your sleep,

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:25.350
but the issue of breathing itself

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.370
can be adjusted in the
daytime waking hours

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.170
in ways that can powerfully
impact both sleep,

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:33.380
reduce incidents of sleep apnea,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.640
and apparently from some
emerging literature,

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.550
can also help to optimize various hormones

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.520
even just by breathing in
particular ways while awake.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.803
So here's how this works,

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.250
there's now a lot of literature

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.970
showing that breathing through the nose,

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:48.960
not through the mouth,

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.010
is powerful for improving lots of things,

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.590
first of all, it improves
cosmetic features

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:55.530
of the jaw and face,

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:59.110
this was first well-established
by my colleagues at Stanford

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.490
in a book called "Jaws: The
Story of a Hidden Epidemic,"

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.740
this is by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich,

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.730
who are both faculty at Stanford,

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:10.220
has a forward by Robert Sapolsky,
the great Robert Sapolsky,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.720
and it also has a heavy
endorsement upfront

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.550
by Jared Diamond, the author
of "Guns, Germs, and Steel,"

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:17.530
the Pulitzer winner,

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.500
so a lot of heavy hitters
on this book, "Jaws."

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.270
It's not a book that a lot of people

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.260
know about, unfortunately,

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:26.040
but it really describes the
benefits of nasal breathing

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.670
and the terrible things
that happen when people,

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.490
in particular children, but adults also,

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.290
are heavy mouth-breathers,

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.070
so mouth-breathers have changes

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.010
in the cosmetics of their face and jaw

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.600
that are really bad in
terms of attractiveness,

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.950
and this was done in twin studies,

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.280
you can look in the book
and see some of this,

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.220
it's really dramatic how
being a mouth-breather

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.570
tends to make the chin drop
back behind the upper mandible,

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.870
there's a lengthening in the
face, a drooping of the eyes,

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.500
it can be quite dramatic or modest

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.440
depending on how much mouth-breathing.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.240
Now, sometimes we have to
breathe with our mouths,

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.460
but there's also a lot of data and studies

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.330
described in this book, "Jaws,"

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:06.330
that describe how nose-breathing
in wakefulness and in sleep

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.830
promotes all sorts of positive things

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.530
related to not just cosmetics,

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.610
but also the improvement of gas exchange

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:17.160
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body,

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.300
and as well, it can modify levels

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.620
of different neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:25.690
in ways that positively
can impact hormones,

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.810
so believe it or not,
being a nasal-breather

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:30.550
and avoiding being a mouth-breather

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.440
can actually positively impact hormones,

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.510
and in particular, the hormones
testosterone and estrogen,

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.720
although the way that it does that

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.320
is by making you a better sleeper,

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.970
which allows you to
produce more testosterone

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.343
and the appropriate amounts
of testosterone and estrogen,

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.240
but it does that in part
through indirect mechanisms

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.210
because deep sleep supports the gonads,

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:55.910
the ovaries and the testicles

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.640
and their turnover of cells
and the production of cells,

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.400
remember, in the ovary, particular cells

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.800
and the egg follicles
themselves make estrogen,

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.620
and in the testicle,

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.270
that the sertoli cells
and the Leydig cells

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.410
are important for the formation of sperm

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.400
and for testosterone, respectively.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.660
So what does this all mean?

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.110
This means we have to
be breathing properly,

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.330
it almost sounds kind of
like, kind of new-agey,

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.600
like, oh, you have to breathe properly

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.530
to get your hormones right,

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.550
but no, you have to breathe properly

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.140
to get your breathing and sleep right

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.160
so that your sleep can
actually be deep enough

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.310
and you're not entering apnea states,

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:35.210
and then that will support gonad function,

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:36.840
and I wouldn't be putting this out

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.480
as one of the main
behavioral tools upfront

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.510
if it weren't for the fact

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.820
that the effects of
apnea on these hormones

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.860
are dramatic and terrible,

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.200
and the positive effects
of getting breathing right

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.120
on these hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.920
are dramatic and wonderful,

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.880
so let's talk about a few
of those studies briefly

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.160
so I can underscore the
value of proper breathing

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.030
in order to optimize hormones.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:01.230
So I was able to find at
least four quality studies

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:06.030
showing that when apnea is
reduced in sleep, or eliminated,

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.900
there are significant increases
in testosterone in males

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.930
and in proper estrogen to
testosterone ratios in females,

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.030
and the way that it works
is very interesting,

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:21.290
apparently, it works by
reductions in cortisol,

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.930
now, cortisol is a stress hormone

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.030
that is released early
in the day as we wake up

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.940
and serves healthy roles in
protecting us against infection,

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.910
reducing inflammation, et cetera,

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.870
but you don't want
cortisol to be too high,

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:34.130
and you certainly don't
want it elevated too long

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.140
throughout the day and night,

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.070
and so we all know,

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.180
because now we've been told a
lot in the last decade or so,

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.020
that getting proper sleep is important

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.260
for all these aspects of health,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.790
getting proper sleep can really offset

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.930
all the reductions in
testosterone and estrogen

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.750
and reductions in fertility that occur

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.060
if we don't get enough sleep,

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.530
but seldom is it discussed how sleep

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.730
actually adjusts things like
testosterone and estrogen,

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:01.030
and it does it by modifying cortisol,

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.130
so the molecule cholesterol

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:06.960
can be converted into
testosterone or estrogen,

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.040
but there's a competition

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.530
whereby the cholesterol
will turn into cortisol

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.970
and not testosterone,

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.730
or it'll turn into
cortisol and not estrogen

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:19.690
if stress levels are too high,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.240
so the simple version of this

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.680
is getting your breathing
right during the waking hours,

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.880
meaning primarily, unless
you're working out really hard

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.930
or there's some other reason why,

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.940
you're maybe eating or speaking,

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.120
that you need to be
breathing through your mouth,

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.640
you should be a nose-breather,

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.110
there's really good evidence for that now,

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.020
and in sleep, you also
want to be a nose-breather

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.660
because that's going to
increase the amount of oxygen

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.493
that you're bringing into your system

00:52:42.493 --> 00:52:45.490
and the amount of carbon
dioxide that you're offloading,

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:47.330
there are other positive
effects of it as well,

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.450
but you're basically reducing apnea,

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.130
breath-holding in sleep leads
to buildup of carbon dioxide

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.060
and leads to increases in cortisol,

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:58.030
which then decrease testosterone
and decrease estrogen

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:01.370
in negative ways across all sexes, okay?

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:04.030
So the simple version of this
is get your breathing right,

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.850
so how do you do that, how do
you get your breathing right?

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.840
Well, for some people that
have severe sleep apnea,

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.620
they are going to need the CPAP machine,

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.300
this is a machine that you
actually put on your face

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.620
and it helps you breathe
properly in sleep.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.780
Many people, however, are
starting to do this thing

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.870
of taping their mouths shut,

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.050
now, this sounds a little bit extreme,

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:21.600
and you certainly don't want to do this

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.670
in any way that's dangerous.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:25.387
James Nestor talked
about this in his book,

00:53:25.387 --> 00:53:27.510
"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.550
that simply taping shut the mouth,

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.310
with some tape that will allow you

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.000
to open your mouth if you really need to,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.090
during sleep can allow
people to shift over

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:40.580
from being mouth-breathers
and snorers to nose-breathers.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.460
In the daytime, the best way
to get good at nasal-breathing

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.200
is to dilate the nasal passages,

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.550
'cause a lot of people have a hard time

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.330
breathing through their nose,

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.600
and one way to do this

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.177
is to just breathe through your nose more,

00:53:52.177 --> 00:53:54.700
and one way to do that
is when you exercise,

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.860
in particular, cardiovascular exercise,

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.600
most of the time, provided
you're not in maximum effort,

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.300
you should be nasal-breathing.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.870
Now, for a lot of people,

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.460
nasal-breathing during
exercise is hard at first,

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.470
but as you do it,

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:10.360
because the sinuses have a
capacity to dilate over time,

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.930
you'll get better at it,

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:15.940
the sinuses, if you haven't
ever held a skull for,

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.660
because of my job as a neuroscientist,

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.670
I've held a lot of skulls,

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.190
taken a lot of brains
out of a lot of skulls,

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:23.210
I teach neuroanatomy,
and I've done that for,

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.650
goodness, god knows how many species

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:27.210
I've done that for, including human,

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.170
but what the sinuses
are is they're actually,

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:32.480
what you've got are you
got these little portals

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.680
in the bone that run, you
know, up here and down here,

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.830
behind the nose and into the jaw,

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.810
if you ever had a cold and
your sinuses are stuffed up,

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:42.310
you feel like you have
congestion here and here

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.600
and around your ears and in
your cheeks and in your face,

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.160
and that's because the sinuses

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.890
are actually portals where
the bones are fused together

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.800
and interdigitated like this,

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.000
but they're lined, of
course, with mucus membranes,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.100
and as you start to nasal-breathe more,

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.240
the nasal passages will
start to dilate more,

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.270
don't worry, you're not
going to get giant nostrils,

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:02.700
but what's going to end up happening

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.820
is you're going to have an easier time

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.210
breathing through your
nose just from waking,

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:08.280
so my advice would be

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.560
breathe through your nose while exercising

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.840
unless you're in maximum effort,

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.930
pretty soon, what you'll find

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.600
is you actually can create more output

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.550
than you would if you were
breathing through your mouth,

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.090
and of course, there
are exceptions to this,

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:23.500
if you're swimming, follow
that breath protocol,

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.910
for fighters and martial artists,

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:26.260
there's reason to do

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.330
the kind of exhale
breathing through the mouth,

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:29.450
that shh kind of thing,

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:31.510
you know, there are reasons
to do that sort of thing

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:32.450
for particular sports,

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:33.350
but for most people who are

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:36.100
kind of recreational
athletes or exercisers,

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.470
learn to be a nasal-breather,

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.270
it has positive cosmetic effects,

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:42.460
it reduces apnea, it
offloads more carbon dioxide,

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.590
it increases lung capacity,
it dilates the sinuses,

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:48.490
and it prevents apnea in sleep,

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.670
so unless you have severe
apnea and you need the CPAP,

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.010
becoming a nasal-breather

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.470
can have all sorts of positive effects

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:57.330
by reducing cortisol, reducing apnea,

00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:01.240
and indirectly, raising
testosterone and estrogen

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.760
in the proper ratios,

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.130
so this might seem kind of
foundational and indirect,

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.310
but when you go into the
scientific literature,

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:10.140
it comes through as one of
the most powerful things

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.370
that you can do that is zero cost,

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.600
takes a little effort but it's zero cost,

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.550
and it has all of these positive
effects across the board,

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:20.670
you know, both cosmetic

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.820
and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera,

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:25.730
so that's the first piece
of behavioral advice.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.480
The second piece of behavioral advice

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.570
relates to the viewing of light,

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:33.210
and many of you have heard
me talk about this before,

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:35.080
and I'm not going to belabor the point

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.380
that viewing bright light
within the first hour of waking,

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.700
whether or not it's from artificial light

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.000
or ideally, from sunlight,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.100
has these powerful effects
on sleep and wakefulness,

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.620
but we have to return to this

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:49.040
if you want to understand
how light can impact hormones

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.240
because hormones, light, and dopamine

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.070
have a very close-knit relationship,

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:57.440
so much so that your
light-viewing behavior

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.570
can actually have a direct effect

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:01.760
on hormone levels and fertility,

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.400
it can have a direct effect
on hormone levels and libido,

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.020
it can have a direct
effect on hormone levels

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.840
and your ability to heal quickly,

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.350
and I'm not talking about shining light

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:12.460
on particular injuries,

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.560
that may or may not have positive effects,

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:18.860
we can argue about that on a
subsequent episode, it may,

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.350
but what I'm talking about is
viewing light with your eyes,

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:22.610
so let's talk about that now

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:26.460
because the scientific
literature on this are robust

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.450
and they extend back several decades,

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.950
and yet, I think most people
don't really understand

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.450
how powerful this relationship is

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:35.220
between light, dopamine, hormones,

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.710
and all the great things that
the sex steroid hormones do

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:41.020
when they're available in your
body in the proper ratios.

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.970
In order to understand
the powerful effects

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.770
that light can have on
the sex steroid hormones,

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:49.060
we need to understand
seasonal breeding animals,

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.200
now, humans are not seasonal breeders,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.840
but if you understand the biology

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.400
of how light impacts various
neurotransmitters and hormones,

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.320
you'll set yourself up
for a deep understanding

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.060
of what you should do with
your light-viewing behavior.

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.670
So several species of animals,

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:08.010
many species of animals, in
fact, like rabbits and fox,

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:11.380
and various mustelids,
like ferrets and ermines,

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:15.000
change their pellage
color across the seasons,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.820
this might be kind of a duh,

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:20.700
but fox in winter are
often white or light gray,

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:25.170
and those same animals will
be brown or darker-colored

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:27.380
in the summertime and spring months.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.750
Now, those same animals
breed in the spring,

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:31.430
and they shut down breeding,

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.940
they actually shut down ovulation,

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.350
they often shut down
testosterone production

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:37.940
in the winter months,

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.240
so right now I'm just
correlating color of fur

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.180
with tendency to breed,

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.180
tendency to breed, as we
know, is going to be related

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.960
to the levels of sex steroid hormones,

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.443
estrogen and testosterone.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:53.320
Now, why would these two things be linked?

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.940
Well, it turns out that dopamine
is the link between them,

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.293
so dopamine has a precursor,
that precursor is tyrosine,

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.620
which is amino acid, comes from food,

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.990
and when dopamine levels are
high, as I mentioned before,

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.300
there's a tendency for more
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.340
luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone,

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.270
all the hormones that come

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.620
from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.400
and stimulate estrogen
and testosterone release

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.003
from the ovary and testes,

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.273
dopamine basically increases all of that.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:28.700
The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine,

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.510
but the precursor to a lot

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:33.340
of the melanin-producing elements of cells

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.390
that give pigmentation,
including for the hair,

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:41.320
is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme,

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.480
so yes, the same amino acid-based pathway,

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:50.460
and many of the same enzymes
that are devoted to dopamine

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.860
and dopamine increasing
the sex steroid hormones

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.453
are devoted to giving
pigmentation to the hair and skin,

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.970
and this is why in the summer
months, when days are longer,

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.310
animals are breeding more,

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.610
and this is also why in the winter months

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:11.670
when days are shorter,
animals are breeding less,

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:15.750
this is also why in humans,
many people, not all,

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.830
feel an elevation in mood in
the spring and summer months

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:21.220
because of the amount of
sunlight they're getting

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.420
is increased relative
to the winter months.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.397
Now, some of you may be saying,

01:00:25.397 --> 01:00:27.430
"I love the fall, I love the winter,"

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:29.890
sensitivity to light in
these dopamine systems

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:32.210
has a strong genetic component,

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.480
so you go to some areas of the world,

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.110
I have relatives who are Scandinavian,

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.340
and in some areas of Scandinavia,

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.630
people know that there's

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.050
a kind of seasonal affective disorder,

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.680
there's kind of a seasonal depression

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.510
and people get sadder and
more quiescent in the winter,

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.650
there's actually less going out,

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.820
and therefore, there's
less sexual behavior,

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.600
there's less partying
and things of that sort,

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.907
but other people will say,

01:00:53.907 --> 01:00:56.007
"No, during the winter
months, I feel great

01:00:56.007 --> 01:00:58.010
"and I love the holidays
around winter," et cetera,

01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.610
so there's a lot of variation,

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.440
but in general, the
pathway is the following,

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.440
increased viewing of sunlight,
and it has to be to the eyes,

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.950
it's not to the skin,

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.810
increased viewing of sunlight

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.210
increases dopamine levels in the brain,

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:13.880
increased dopamine levels
in animals and humans

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.360
increases the amount of these melanocytes

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.820
and the activity of these
melanin-producing cells,

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.740
which give pigmentation
to the skin and hair,

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.800
and indirectly, increase the amount

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.750
of testosterone and estrogen,

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.830
and thereby, reproductive behavior,

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:34.640
feelings of well-being,
social interactions,

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.400
reductions in anxiety, et cetera,

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.470
all of which should make sense

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:39.570
based on what we've talked about already

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.170
in terms of the biology

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.930
and the impact of these steroid hormones

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:46.470
on various aspects of the mind and body.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:49.030
So how does this translate to a protocol?

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.060
This translates to the protocol of,

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.410
if you want to optimize
testosterone and estrogen,

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:57.060
you need to get your
light-viewing behavior correct,

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.000
it's not just about optimizing your sleep,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.040
which is also important,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.790
it's about getting sufficient
amount of light in your eyes

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:06.170
so you have sufficient levels of dopamine,

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.150
so the simple protocols for
that I've reviewed before,

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:11.280
but it means getting
anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.030
of bright light exposure in
your eyes early in the day,

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.740
it is not sufficient to
do this with sunglasses

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.530
unless you have to do
that for safety reasons,

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:21.200
it's fine to wear prescription
lenses and contacts,

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.130
if you can't get sunlight
for whatever reason,

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.950
you want to use bright artificial light,

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.940
but that is absolutely critical

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.330
for timing the cortisol release properly,

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.910
limiting cortisol release to
the early part of the day,

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:34.680
getting increases in dopamine
that are going to promote

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.900
the production of
testosterone and estrogen

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.150
to healthy levels,

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.840
the other aspect of light-viewing behavior

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.370
that's extremely important

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.530
is to avoid bright light
exposure to your eyes

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:46.640
in the middle of the night,

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.500
if you're viewing bright light
in the middle of the night,

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.470
you are suppressing dopamine release,

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.210
if you're suppressing dopamine release,

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:55.050
you are suppressing testosterone levels

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.140
so much so that I would wager

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.870
that a major effect of sleep deprivation

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:04.090
on reducing testosterone and estrogen

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.750
is not necessarily because
of the lack of sleep per se,

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.180
it's because usually when people

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.490
are not getting enough sleep,

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:11.590
they're getting too
much light in their eyes

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:13.650
in the middle of the night as well,

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:16.700
a study on this has
not been completed yet,

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.450
but there are two studies
published in "Cell" and "Neuron,"

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:21.570
both Cell Press journals,
excellent journals,

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.810
showing that viewing
bright light with the eyes

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:26.410
in the middle of the circadian night

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:28.740
has a detrimental effect on dopamine,

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.520
and therefore has a detrimental effect

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.790
on things like testosterone and estrogen,

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:36.190
so you can't even begin
to talk about supplements

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:38.080
and other ways to optimize testosterone,

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.997
diet and its effects on
testosterone and estrogen

01:03:39.997 --> 01:03:43.060
and fertility and reproductive
behavior, et cetera,

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.930
until you get your breathing right,

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.440
until you get things like your
light-viewing behavior right,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.980
so bright light early in the day

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.100
and throughout the day is great,

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.200
view as much bright light,
ideally sunlight, as you can,

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.640
as much as you safely can,

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.770
you obviously don't want
to burn your retinas

01:03:58.770 --> 01:03:59.630
or damage your retinas,

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:00.900
so never look at any light

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.670
that's so bright it's painful to look at,

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:04.300
but getting a lot of light in your eyes

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.620
is not just about adjusting
your sleep-wake rhythms,

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.560
it's also about optimizing
your sex steroid hormones,

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.400
and avoiding bright light
in the middle of the night

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.220
is not just about not
disrupting your sleep,

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.470
it's also about optimizing
the sex steroid hormones,

01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:19.070
and now that you understand

01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:20.640
a bit of how the sex steroid hormones work

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.970
and how powerful they
are for reducing anxiety

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:24.750
and all these other effects,

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:26.700
this should be straightforward to do,

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.090
or hopefully it's inspired you

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.860
to get your light-viewing behavior

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.590
and your breathing behavior correct.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.920
In fact, in thinking about tools,

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.370
for many people that are suffering

01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:38.460
from low levels of estrogen
if they want higher levels

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.370
or low levels of testosterone
if they want higher levels,

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:44.550
just getting the breathing
and light-viewing behavior,

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:48.400
which will indirectly
support sleep behavior,

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.540
can be a huge and positive effect

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:53.760
on levels of sex steroid hormones.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.650
I can already anticipate
that in hearing this,

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:59.040
you might wonder whether
or not viewing light

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.510
is going to, for instance,
increase your testosterone a lot

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.750
when in fact you want
your estrogen increased,

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.730
or it's going to increase
your estrogen a lot

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:09.460
when you want your testosterone increased,

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.550
everything I'm describing
here is for people,

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:15.230
regardless of chromosomal
or gonadal background,

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:18.620
so I'm trying to basically
offer all this information

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.850
in one swoop,

01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:24.010
but basically, if you're somebody
who naturally has ovaries

01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.620
and has higher levels of
estrogen than testosterone,

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.940
then viewing bright
light early in the day,

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.970
because of dopamine's effects,

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:34.010
is going to promote more estrogen

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.010
and subtle increases in testosterone,

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:37.650
whereas if you're somebody who starts off

01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.230
with more testosterone and lower estrogen,

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:42.490
so somebody presumably who has testes

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.380
or maybe you're supplementing
with testosterone

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.420
through other sources for whatever reason,

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.320
bright-light viewing

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.360
is going to increase testosterone
and estrogen in parallel,

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.750
but you're still going to maintain

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:54.630
the ratio of testosterone to estrogen,

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:56.100
in short, you don't have to worry

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.870
that you're going to
increase the wrong hormone,

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:00.090
this is all about optimizing
the ratios of hormones

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.850
that you already have.

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:03.400
Okay, so we've talked about breathing,

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.960
we've talked about light,

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.320
let's talk about a third element

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.870
that there seems to be some
excitement about lately

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:11.980
for other reasons

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.970
but that can actually have

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:17.180
some pretty profound
influences on hormone levels,

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.200
and that's heat and cold,

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.850
so as always, rather
than just offer a tool,

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.090
I'm going to tell you
the underlying science

01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:26.360
as it relates to naturally
occurring phenomena

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.700
because, in understanding that

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.190
and understanding the mechanism,

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:31.510
you're going to be in
a far better position

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:33.730
to understand the tools and mechanisms

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.780
and how you might want to
adjust them for your own life.

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.160
So now you understand the relationship

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:43.150
between light, day length,
dopamine, and hormone levels,

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:45.540
and everyone should realize

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.030
that temperature and
day length are linked,

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:49.100
and I'm sure as I say that,

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.180
you're probably thinking, "Oh, of course."

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.870
In summer, when there's more sunlight,

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.530
days are longer, nights are shorter,

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:57.350
in general, it tends to be warmer out,

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:59.810
and in winter, when nights
are longer, days are shorter,

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:01.800
it tends to be colder out,

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.800
and in the winter months,

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.510
testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:09.113
in many animals and in humans,

01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:11.920
and in the summer months,

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.390
because of the role of dopamine

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:16.010
in promoting the sex steroid hormones,

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:18.840
when days are longer and it's warmer,

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.850
humans tend to make more
estrogen and testosterone

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:24.260
relative to the other months of the year.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.400
Now, these effects can be
somewhat weak and modulated

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.850
as opposed to in
seasonally breeding animals

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:32.150
where they're really dramatic, okay?

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:36.330
But the point is that temperature

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:38.330
and day length and sunlight,

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:40.230
those are all intimately related

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.820
because of the systems
that we evolved in, right?

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.320
So before we had artificial light

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.770
and artificial heating
and artificial cooling,

01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.530
our biology evolved under systems

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:52.130
where temperature, day
length, and the hormones

01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:54.140
were correlated with one another,

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.900
so nowadays, there's a lot
of interest in using cold

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.990
as a way to stimulate testosterone,

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:03.310
this is mainly because
in the sports community,

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:05.530
in particular, in the
bodybuilding community,

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:07.260
they are always seeking ways

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.670
to maximize testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone,

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:12.040
keep estrogen to its minimum required

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.100
to still have a libido and
still have skin elasticity

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.500
but also walk around with Saran-wrap skin,

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.550
then all this kind of extreme
stuff that happens there

01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:23.680
has led to a recent movement
where, believe it or not,

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.820
I heard this and I couldn't
believe it, I went and checked,

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.880
but although I didn't buy them,

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.883
that on Amazon, you can actually find,

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:34.230
they're literally underwear
that have ice packs,

01:08:34.230 --> 01:08:35.840
so I think they are ice pack underwear,

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.310
so that people are making themselves cold

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:39.670
at the level of the gonads

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:42.660
in order to try and increase
testosterone and libido,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:43.990
sounds pretty crazy,

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:46.100
but believe it or not,

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.790
that and things like ice
baths and cold showers

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:53.200
can have positive effects
on the sex steroid hormones,

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.260
both testosterone, mainly in males,

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.920
and estrogen, mainly in females,

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.147
and you might say, "Wait, I thought cold

01:09:01.147 --> 01:09:04.947
"makes the reproductive
axis kind of shut down a bit

01:09:04.947 --> 01:09:07.300
"or reduces testosterone and estrogen,"

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.780
but it turns out it's
not actually the cold

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.750
that's having these effects in people,

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.210
things like the ice bath, cold
showers, cold-water swims,

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:17.950
these ice underwear or whatever they are,

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:20.933
can't believe that these actually
exist, but they do exist,

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:25.270
what happens is there's
a rebound in vasodilation

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:29.240
after cooling, so cooling
causes vasoconstriction,

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.280
and then after the cooling,
there's a rebound vasodilation

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.750
and there's more infusion
of blood into the gonads.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.480
There's also an effect that's neural,

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.390
so let me explain how this works

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:43.500
because there are only
a few studies on this,

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.220
none of which looking
at the frozen underwear,

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.860
but that have looked at cold exposure

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.060
and levels of androgens and estrogens,

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.630
and it's kind of interesting,

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:53.890
so you have to remember that the gonad,

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:57.590
the ovaries and the testes
are heavily vascularized.

01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:59.540
Remember, even at the level of the brain,

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.810
GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:03.990
comes from neurons
that, believe it or not,

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:06.150
start off in your nose
early in development,

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:07.660
migrate into the hypothalamus.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.300
I'm not making that up, they
started off in your nose

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.970
and migrated to the hypothalamus.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:14.700
Those neurons extend
processes, we call them axons,

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.700
into the pituitary and release
GnRH into the pituitary.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.420
There's a lot of vascularization
within the pituitary,

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.460
so now those hormones, or GnRH,

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.880
can stimulate
follicle-stimulating hormone,

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.830
luteinizing hormone,

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:31.733
which then are released and
travel into the bloodstream.

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:36.530
Then those hormones reach
the ovary or testes,

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:39.410
and they have to get into
the ovary and testes,

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:43.160
and the way they do that is
through the vascular system,

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.960
and people forget, but the vascular system

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.840
and how constricted or dilated vessels are

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.580
is controlled by neurons, all right?

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.640
We discussed this during
the discussion about stress

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.310
in the stress episode,

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:00.420
but it's well-known to neuroscientists

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:04.340
that the best way to shut
down neurons is to cool them,

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.470
so there are a lot of examples of this

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:07.550
in the scientific literature,

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:08.646
but most people aren't aware of it

01:11:08.646 --> 01:11:09.770
because you're not digging around

01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:11.340
in the method section of these papers,

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:14.230
but when we want to shut down neurons,

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:16.390
we can do things like inject
drugs that will do that,

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:18.560
like lidocaine, you know,
the stuff that makes you numb

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.393
at the dentist,

01:11:19.393 --> 01:11:20.860
or you can use different inhibitors,

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.010
but one of the best ways
to do it experimentally

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:24.370
is to just cool neurons,

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:26.650
when you make neurons cold,

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.300
because there's a temperature dependence

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.640
of when neurons can be
active and when they can't,

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.360
the neurons shut down,

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.330
so the most plausible explanation
for why cold exposure,

01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:40.160
either through 1 to 10-minute
ice bath or cold shower

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.870
or the ice underpants thing,

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:45.150
would increase testosterone
or increase estrogen

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:47.210
is that you're cooling the neurons

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:50.470
that control vasoconstriction
and vasodilation

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:55.270
and shutting down the entry of blood,

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.680
or at least reducing it,

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.940
and hormones into the gonad,

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.230
and then when the gonad
and the surrounding area

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.480
heats up again,

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.350
you're getting a rebound
hyper-vasodilation

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:09.810
that delivers excessive
levels of, not excessive,

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:13.410
but increased levels of
GnRH and other hormones

01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:16.330
and carriers and carrier
proteins and so forth

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:18.340
that would then stimulate the gonad

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.130
to release more testosterone

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.900
or would stimulate the gonad
to release more estrogen,

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.710
that's the most plausible
explanation I can come up with,

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:26.920
there aren't a lot of studies

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.850
looking at direct effects
of temperature on the gonad,

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:32.430
and it's going to be a
difficult study to carry out

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:35.970
in any case because unless it
were done in vitro in a dish,

01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:38.080
it's very hard to eliminate
all the other things

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.290
like vasoconstriction and vasodilation,

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.940
put simply, we don't know
whether or not cold and heat

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:47.690
directly affect the production
of testosterone and estrogen,

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:51.340
we only know that cold and
heat can modulate those,

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.100
probably through indirect mechanisms

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.040
like controlling the amount of blood flow

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.930
by way of shutting down
or activating the neurons.

01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:59.370
Now, there's a lot of lore

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.613
around heating up the gonads too much,

01:13:01.613 --> 01:13:04.110
there's actually a whole set

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:08.307
of pseudoscience webpages
out there saying,

01:13:08.307 --> 01:13:09.867
"Well, if you want a girl,

01:13:09.867 --> 01:13:12.627
"you should conceive the child
at this room temperature,

01:13:12.627 --> 01:13:13.460
"and if you want a boy,

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.690
"you should conceive the child
at this room temperature."

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:16.950
I don't think there's really

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:20.490
any firm scientific evidence
for that, for either one,

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:23.030
but there's some interesting literature

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:26.310
about temperature dependence
of production of hormones,

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:27.860
and I think that it probably relates

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.690
to these mechanisms of vasodilation

01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:32.330
and neural control over vasodilation,

01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:34.350
and of course, excessively high heat

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:36.740
is not good for the testes,

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.030
for sperm production, or for sperm health,

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:41.180
sperm have all sorts
of proteins in the cap,

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.120
things like pentraxins and other things

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.580
that cause them to swim faster

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.290
when they're expressed properly
and in the right locations,

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:50.250
and heat actually alters the
location and the function

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.990
of a lot of those proteins,
they're very heat sensitive,

01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:54.360
and so that's why excessive heat

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.820
is truly not good for fertility,

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.350
which may be independent of heat's roles

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:02.810
in promoting estrogen or testosterone.

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:04.690
Okay, so now we've talked about breathing,

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.240
light, and temperature,

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.610
we talked about parenthood,
we talked about competition,

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:11.930
and we talked about
some pheromone effects,

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:15.160
now let's talk about
particular forms of exercise

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.540
and how they modulate
the steroid hormones,

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:22.130
and then we're going to talk
about various supplements,

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.040
both in reference to testosterone

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.070
and in reference to estrogen.

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:29.680
So now let's talk about how
exercise in its various forms,

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.180
weight training, endurance work,

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.350
weight training to failure, or
less intense weight training

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:36.880
can impact testosterone levels,

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.570
but I want to remind you that
we're talking about testosterone

01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:41.540
both in males and females,

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.520
and based on what you know
from earlier in the episode,

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.990
testosterone can have
numerous positive effects

01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:50.230
in both males and females
provided they're in optimal range.

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:52.980
So if you look on the web,

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.000
people will say, "Oh, you know,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.147
"testosterone is increased
by weight training,

01:14:57.147 --> 01:14:59.030
"you want to do these big,
heavy compound movements,"

01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:01.320
squats and deadlifts and
chins and things of that sort,

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.750
but what about the scientific studies?

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:03.863
Like, what's the actual basis for this?

01:15:03.863 --> 01:15:05.610
Because if you just take a step back

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:07.690
and look at this from the
perspective of a scientist,

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:09.670
you'd say, okay, what is a squat?

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:12.270
A squat is loading up a
bunch of weights on a bar

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.310
and then, you know,
sitting down, essentially,

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:16.110
and standing up over and over again.

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.880
What's a deadlift?

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.540
It's lifting heavy
weights from the ground.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.030
Why would that increase
testosterone, right?

01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:24.580
This is what's often not
discussed in the weight training

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.270
or even the exercise science community,

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:30.050
what would actually stimulate
the release of testosterone

01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:31.900
from the adrenals and/or testes,

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.530
and which one is it,
adrenals or testes or both?

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.010
And that's often not discussed,

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:37.500
but as a neuroscientist,

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.810
these are the kinds of
things we think about

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:43.200
because we think always that
genes don't create behavior,

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.350
immune systems don't know
when to be activated,

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:48.270
lungs don't know when to inhale or exhale,

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.570
hearts don't know when to beat

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.510
except for the information
that it gets from neurons,

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.950
the nervous system controls all of that,

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:59.770
and so really the answer has
to be in the neural system

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.250
that's related to these particular types

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.260
of weight-bearing exercises.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.050
So when you go into this literature,

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:09.740
it's kind of hard to find real mechanism,

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.770
you see a lot of effects,

01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:13.410
you'll hear things like,
androgen receptor content,

01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:15.600
meaning testosterone and its derivatives,

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.420
receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise,

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.710
and you'll find some examples

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:23.330
that, for instance, you know,
they do muscle biopsies,

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:26.140
they can actually see receptor increases,

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.100
looking at either high-volume

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.657
or low-volume really intense exercise,

01:16:30.657 --> 01:16:33.570
and you can find a lot of that
but not a lot of mechanism

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:36.080
about how the nervous
system would do this,

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.280
and the reason you'd want
to know how it can do it

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.910
is that you could potentially
build better protocols

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:45.440
or figure out exactly
what about these movements

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.900
is triggering increases

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.120
in androgen receptors and testosterone.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.960
So what's interesting is
when you start digging

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.350
into the more mechanistic studies,

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:58.390
what you find is that
heavy weight training,

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:01.690
so this is weight training where the sets

01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:05.887
are done with anywhere from
kind of one to eight rep range,

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:07.320
and this translates differently

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.050
depending on ratio of muscle
fiber type and so forth,

01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:11.530
but where basically people are

01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:15.390
working at anywhere from like,
70% to 95% of their maximum,

01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:16.440
or sometimes even going

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.430
right down to their
one-repetition maximum,

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:21.210
really kind of max effort,

01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:25.490
what you find is that
using the nervous system

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:27.780
in a way in which they're
moving heavy loads,

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:30.070
so that I would translate to recruitment

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:31.730
of high-threshold motor units,

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.360
for you muscle physiologists,

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.610
and there's a rule in muscle physiology

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:39.390
about the neuron recruitment
for moving muscles

01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:40.660
where you basically use

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:42.940
the minimum number of
motor units of neurons

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.200
to activate muscle as you possibly can,

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.740
as loads increase, you have to recruit

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.510
more and more neurons,

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:50.560
you always hear about
recruiting muscle fibers,

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.290
but really, it's recruiting more neurons

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:55.070
to recruit more muscle fibers,

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.290
and what you find is that
heavy weight training,

01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:00.500
but not weight training to failure

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.790
where completion of a
repetition is impossible,

01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:06.560
leads to the greatest
increases in testosterone.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.440
Now, I'm sure there are a bunch

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.000
of exercise jockeys out there

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.910
that are going to come at
me with a bunch of things

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:13.180
where, oh, yeah, but high volume and this,

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:16.640
and training to failure and that, sure,

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.410
if you're willing to kind
of put things side by side,

01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:22.530
adjust for exogenous
testosterone treatment

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:23.770
and all the rest,

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:25.090
which was done in these studies,

01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:27.140
what you find in general

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:30.410
is that weight training with heavy loads,

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.140
so anywhere from one-rep maximum

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:35.910
to somewhere in the six
to eight repetition range,

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:37.750
in males or females,

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.860
increases testosterone significantly,

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.897
and it does it for about a
day, sometimes up to 48 hours,

01:18:43.897 --> 01:18:45.630
and the studies that I found

01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:48.830
which seem to hold the
most rigor or weight

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:49.960
based on where they're published

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.870
as opposed to being published

01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:51.880
in the journal of "Never Heard of It,"

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.610
they're published in good-quality

01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:55.223
exercise physiology journals,

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.910
for instance, the paper by Ratamess,

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:04.070
R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:06.460
which was published in 2005,

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.450
which talks about modulations
in androgen receptor content

01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:10.970
after heavy resistance exercise,

01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:13.610
looks at going to failure
and not to failure,

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:18.610
the work of Izquierdo et
al. published in 2006,

01:19:18.817 --> 01:19:20.257
"Differential Effects of Strength Training

01:19:20.257 --> 01:19:21.827
"Leading to Failure Versus Not Failure

01:19:21.827 --> 01:19:24.440
"on Hormonal Responses,
Strength, and Power Gains,"

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.010
you know, there are a lot of studies here

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:29.550
and I will certainly put the
links to these in the caption,

01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:31.840
many of these actually
include Duncan French,

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.200
who runs the UFC training center

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.710
who I've had the privilege of meeting

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.210
and discussing some of this with before,

01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:39.930
as well as other authors, of course,

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:41.170
but they all point to the fact

01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:44.560
that there's something about
the engagement of the neurons

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.550
that recruit high-threshold
motor units in muscle

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:51.360
when moving heavy loads,
but not to failure,

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.320
that has to provide some
sort of feedback signal,

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.770
either to the gonad to
produce more testosterone,

01:19:56.770 --> 01:20:01.650
or is increasing the activity
of receptors in the body.

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:03.260
Now, why do I say that?

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:05.410
Well, this is the puzzle, right?

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:06.930
How is it that a particular movement,

01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:09.340
just like how is it that
interacting with your child,

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.780
is increasing or decreasing testosterone?

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.270
This is the kind of fundamental question

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:14.760
at the mechanistic level,

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.140
and we answered the
question for child-rearing,

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:19.710
it has probably something to
do with smell and pheromones,

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:21.810
although I'm sure there
are other cues as well,

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:26.060
but there's clearly a influence

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:29.450
of hard work at the neural level

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:33.160
and then at the muscular level
for increasing testosterone,

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:37.430
and there's also clearly an
effect of working too hard

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:40.320
and presumably increasing
cortisol too much,

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.830
although I'm speculating there,

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:44.390
in terms of reducing testosterone,

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:46.930
and so the reason we're
getting nitty-gritty about this

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:48.880
is because ultimately, we'd
really like to understand,

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.270
what are the optimal protocols?

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:51.460
You know, out there in the literature,

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:54.510
you hear, move heavy objects
to increase testosterone,

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:55.580
some of that will be converted

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.550
to the more powerful androgen, DHT,

01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:59.710
by 5-alpha reductase et cetera,

01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:02.010
but we really don't understand yet

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:04.770
how these particular behaviors
increase testosterone

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.080
and whether or not it's doing that

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.660
by modulating the receptors

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.780
or it's modulating
testosterone release directly,

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.620
presumably, testosterone release directly

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.473
and sensitivity of the receptors,

01:21:13.473 --> 01:21:15.730
that what most of the
muscle physiology studies

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:17.520
that I was able to find point to,

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.840
but this basically boils down

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.550
to a particular set of protocols

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:22.670
where if you want to
increase testosterone,

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.240
for whatever reason,

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.790
that weight training with
heavy loads but not to failure

01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:30.390
seems to be the best-supported,

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:33.420
at least scientifically
supported, solution to that,

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.350
now, it may not raise
your testosterone levels

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:36.430
as high as you want,

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:39.690
but it's definitely taking
things in the correct direction.

01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:42.060
Now, many of you might
be endurance athletes

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.560
or also enjoy exercise

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.900
besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.410
and there are several studies

01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:52.500
exploring whether or
not endurance activity

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.860
can increase or decrease androgen levels

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.300
and whether or not you combine

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.150
endurance activity and weight training,

01:21:59.150 --> 01:22:00.720
whether or not that has any effect

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.800
if you do the endurance
activity first or second,

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.070
and the takeaway from all of this

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:09.930
was that endurance activity,
if performed first,

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:12.690
leads to decreases in testosterone

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:14.560
during the weight training session

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.220
as compared to the same weight
training session done first

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.570
followed by endurance activity,

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.470
in other words, if you want to
optimize testosterone levels,

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.930
it seems to be the case
that weight training first

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:27.420
and doing cardio-type
endurance activity afterward

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.380
is the right order of business.

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.010
Now, when these are done on separate days,

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:32.310
it doesn't seem to have an effect,

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.160
they showed no statistical interaction,

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.050
but it seems that if
you're going to do these

01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:39.250
in the same workout episode

01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:41.470
that it's move heavy loads first,

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:43.910
then do cardiovascular exercise,

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:45.230
so there's a little bit of data

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:47.860
looking specifically at
how endurance exercise

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:50.620
impacts testosterone and its derivatives,

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.200
and it's very clear that
high-intensity interval training,

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.410
sprinting et cetera,

01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:57.190
which somewhat mimics the neural activity

01:22:57.190 --> 01:23:00.120
that occurs while moving
heavy weight loads,

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.927
is going to increase testosterone

01:23:01.927 --> 01:23:04.830
and there's ample evidence
for that in the literature,

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:09.620
and that endurance exercise
that extends beyond 75 minutes

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.030
is going to start to lead to
reductions in testosterone,

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:14.270
presumably by increases in cortisol,

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:17.820
but of course, the
intensity of the exercise

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.270
is going to be important too,

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:21.900
you know, I don't think
anyone really believes

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.190
that hiking for three hours

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:25.280
is going to reduce your testosterone,

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.420
whereas I think if one were to go out

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.380
and run hard for three hours

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.700
that you can imagine there'd
be reductions in testosterone

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.580
by way of increases in cortisol,

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.620
and so while this area
certainly needs more research,

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:40.170
it's pretty clear that
limiting the endurance exercise

01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:43.140
to 75 minutes or less,
not making it too intense,

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:46.710
is one way to keep cortisol
from going through the roof,

01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:48.280
but I've talked on previous episodes,

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.070
and there are a lot of others
who have talked out there

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:51.420
about how to clamp cortisol,

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:53.580
how to keep cortisol more reduced,

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.500
this is also one of the
reasons why, you can imagine,

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.960
that various individuals,

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.900
either for competition or
just for their own purposes,

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:04.030
rely on testosterone therapy,
exogenous testosterone,

01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:07.550
not just for weight training,
but for endurance exercise,

01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:09.790
so this is one of the reasons
why every once in a while,

01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:11.310
professional cyclists will get popped

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:12.870
for performance-enhancing drugs,

01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:14.060
meaning they'll get caught,

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.670
and it's not just that they're
increasing red blood cells

01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:18.540
through EPO and things of that sort,

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.530
oftentimes they're also
taking testosterone

01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.580
not because they want to be large

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:25.020
or have massively hypertrophied muscles,

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:28.110
but because they're
injecting testosterone,

01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:28.990
they don't have to worry

01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:31.477
about cortisol-induced
reductions in testosterone,

01:24:31.477 --> 01:24:32.810
and they can just clamp,

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:34.390
or keep their testosterone levels high,

01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:35.810
not something I'm recommending,

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:38.070
but I'm just justifying the rationale

01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:41.230
for why an endurance athlete
would want to do that at all.

01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:45.100
So now let's switch over
to talking about estrogen,

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.140
so there are many people

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.800
who are trying to optimize
their estrogen levels,

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.820
and one of the places
where this shows up a lot

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.630
and I get a lot of questions
about is menopause,

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:55.490
so menopause, as I mentioned earlier,

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:59.910
is this fairly massive reduction
in the amount of estrogen

01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:01.930
that is circulating in one's blood

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:03.400
mainly because the ovary

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.060
is now depleted of some
estrogen production of its own,

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.760
the eggs are not being produced,

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.030
they've been depleted, et cetera.

01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:15.660
So menopause is characterized
by a variety of symptoms,

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:17.830
and it's multifaceted,

01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.090
probably deserves an
entire episode on its own,

01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:23.340
but things like hot flashes,
things like mood swings,

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:26.630
things like headaches, in
particular migraine headaches,

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.320
there can be a lot of brain fog,

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.530
it can be very, very
disruptive for people.

01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:32.310
Now, you sometimes hear about andropause,

01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:35.150
which is thought to be the
kind of analog to menopause,

01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:37.440
but menopause has certain characteristics

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.440
that make it a very robust
phenomenon for most women,

01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:44.670
whereas for men,

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:47.580
andropause is going to sometimes
happen, sometimes won't,

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.620
in fact, without going into the details

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.910
of the graphs and the data,

01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:53.610
it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,

01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:57.780
that some men maintain levels
of circulating androgens

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.613
that are quite high,

01:25:58.613 --> 01:26:00.737
even as similar as they were in puberty

01:26:00.737 --> 01:26:02.640
and their teen years and 20s,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.670
well into their 60s, 70s, and 80s

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.487
if they're optimizing
a lot of other things,

01:26:06.487 --> 01:26:09.220
and probably genetics
plays a role as well,

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:10.970
whereas some males won't,

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:13.660
but within the female population,

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.370
or population of individuals
that have ovaries,

01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:18.880
there's a very stereotyped
and characteristic

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.700
reduction in estrogen levels

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.930
as the number of eggs becomes depleted,

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:26.490
and that's what we think of as menopause.

01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:28.450
So what are the various things

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:30.050
that one can do for menopause?

01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:32.660
Well, one of the most common ones

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:36.060
is that physicians will
prescribe supplemental estrogen,

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.810
so this is hormone therapy

01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:40.040
where somebody takes
either their oral estrogen

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.100
or they'll use a patch or a pellet,

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.500
some way to secrete
estradiol into the system,

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.360
and that has varying success
depending on the individual,

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.040
some people respond very well to it,

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.310
other people really
have challenges with it,

01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:55.400
and there are a lot of side
effects associated with it

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.660
for some people, not others,

01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:00.250
in addition, there's a concern always

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:01.900
about supplementing estrogen

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:06.200
when there's a breast cancer
background in the family

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.250
or there's concern about
breast cancer for any reason

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:11.150
because a lot of those cancers
are estrogen-dependent,

01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:15.210
and that's why drugs like
tamoxifen and anastrozole

01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:18.090
and drugs that block either aromatase

01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:21.320
or block, excuse me,
estrogen receptors directly

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.060
were initially developed,

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.610
you see them a lot on the internet,

01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:27.410
again, for all the sports folks

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:30.290
who are trying to increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen,

01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:32.440
but remember, those drugs
were initially developed

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.410
as ways to prevent estrogen
binding to the estrogen receptor

01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:39.180
as cancer treatments,

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.610
so I want to be very clear

01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:41.740
and I've said this many times,

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.830
we always put it in the caption
of each episode, of course,

01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:47.250
that I'm not a physician, I'm not an M.D.,

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:48.170
I don't prescribe anything,

01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:49.610
I'm a professor and I profess things,

01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.190
I'm here to translate
the scientific literature

01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:52.380
and point to what might be

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.760
some useful avenues for exploration,

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.330
but this is just for information purposes,

01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:58.340
you should definitely talk to your doctor

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.150
about anything that I'm talking about now

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.430
or in any episode, for that matter.

01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:06.240
So if you look at the
literature on menopause

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.160
outside of just standard estrogen therapy,

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.940
there are some very
interesting compounds out there

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:13.773
that have been used

01:28:13.773 --> 01:28:17.460
and that are supported by
quality peer-reviewed studies,

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.450
and again, I'll refer you once again

01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:21.760
to this amazing website, examine.com,

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.340
where you can put in
essentially any condition

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.173
or any supplement,

01:28:25.173 --> 01:28:27.430
and it will point you to
the human effect matrix,

01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:29.440
not animal studies,

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.220
but human studies that
have explored these things.

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.380
Now, there are a huge variety of them here

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.870
so I won't go into all of them,

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:38.870
but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:42.240
that have been shown to be powerful

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.360
in the context of menopause,

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.340
as well as other conditions

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:49.000
where estrogen is lower
than one would like,

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.390
include a description in
some of the literature,

01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:52.410
I'll get into this in a moment,

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.970
of something like black cohosh,

01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:56.600
I think that's the correct pronunciation,

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.000
it's literally the word
black and then C-O-H-O-S-H,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.680
and it's very interesting,

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.870
there are 13 peer-reviewed studies

01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:08.420
that have reached prominence

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.090
in the kind of commercial landscape

01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:12.570
where this substance, black cohosh,

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.170
has been promoted as a
way to increase estrogen,

01:29:15.170 --> 01:29:18.360
turns out that the effects are consistent

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.530
but are fairly minor,

01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:22.290
fairly minor increases in estrogen,

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:25.110
so it does seem to be a real effect,

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:28.020
it is significant over the placebo effect,

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.970
but there's also a
significant placebo effect

01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:32.740
in some of these studies as well,

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.740
so what's interesting when
you look at these studies

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.090
is that many of them were carried out

01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:40.430
over a period of six-plus months,

01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:42.350
they're double-blind studies, et cetera,

01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:46.860
and almost all of them lead to
modest increases in estrogen

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:51.860
and modest decreases in
menopause-related symptoms.

01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:56.260
Now, a few additional
details about these studies,

01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:00.620
they were generally carried
out on women age 45 to 64,

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.370
in some cases, they look
specifically at women

01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:05.200
that were clinically obese or overweight,

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.070
although not always,

01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:09.320
the subject size pools are pretty big,

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.120
you know, anywhere from 50 to 87,

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.110
these are decent size,
132 subjects, et cetera,

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:17.997
so these look to be like quality studies,

01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:20.360
and they basically point to
the fact that black cohosh

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.080
can have a modest effect in
improving menopause symptoms.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.270
The other one is Panax ginseng,

01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:31.680
so P-N-A-A-X ginseng,

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.380
has been shown to decrease some symptoms

01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.120
associated with menopause,
mostly related to libido,

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.270
although the other
effects were unreliable.

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.760
Other things, like maca,

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.810
which is known to increase
dopamine actually,

01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:45.440
had minor effects,

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.200
things like, the names here

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.580
are a little hard to
pronounce, so forgive me,

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:53.010
things like Valeriana officinalis

01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:55.860
has shown that there
can be some improvement

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.470
in the hot flash symptoms

01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:59.400
and some of the insomnia
associated with that,

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.230
so that might be worth exploring,

01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:02.750
again, discuss with your doctor,

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:06.253
but these were both 100-subject plus,

01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:09.460
age 45 to 64 individuals,

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.560
double-blind placebo-controlled studies

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.680
that showed significant
but modest effects.

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.930
There was one substance

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:21.880
in the gallery of the
compounds that was looked at

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.530
that turns out to be
particularly interesting,

01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:27.600
and this one is also particularly
difficult to pronounce,

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.040
and it's Pueraria mirifica,

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.810
so I'm going to spell this out for you,

01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:38.810
it's P-U-E-R-A-R-I-A, Pueraria,

01:31:40.164 --> 01:31:45.164
mirifica, M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A,

01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:49.140
and there are four
studies on this compound

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:53.290
that show, in every case,
it to be very potent,

01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:56.130
in fact, comparable to estrogen therapy,

01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:57.950
estrogen replacement therapy,

01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:59.840
in reducing the symptoms of menopause,

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.290
so this was pretty striking

01:32:01.290 --> 01:32:02.660
because when you go through these studies

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:03.493
and you look again

01:32:03.493 --> 01:32:06.970
that they seem to be
pretty well controlled,

01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:08.770
as far as I could tell,

01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:11.633
and they explored a
pretty wide subject pool,

01:32:12.591 --> 01:32:16.180
and it seems that every
single one of these studies,

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:21.180
when looking side by side
at Pueraria mirifica,

01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.880
which is also called,

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.563
now this is really hard to
pronounce, Kwao Krua Kao,

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:30.423
I guess that's the name that
they use in various countries,

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:33.950
that it was comparable to
estrogen replacement therapy,

01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:36.940
so I mentioned this because
a lot of people contacted me

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.137
and said, "What about the
insomnia in menopause?

01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.150
"What about the headaches in menopause?"

01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:42.620
Now, I'm not suggesting you run out

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.380
and immediately start taking
any of these compounds,

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.690
please talk to your doctor,

01:32:45.690 --> 01:32:48.480
you know, any hormone-related compound

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.690
is a serious consideration

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:53.190
because of the relationship
to breast cancers,

01:32:53.190 --> 01:32:55.460
but just in general, these compounds are,

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:57.810
estrogen and testosterone,
are exceedingly powerful

01:32:57.810 --> 01:33:01.287
in terms of controlling our
mental and physical states,

01:33:01.287 --> 01:33:03.550
and so you want to
approach them with caution,

01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:06.420
but I thought that that one
in particular was interesting

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:10.670
and for which there are quite
a few PubMed-documented,

01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:13.360
peer-reviewed studies in quality journals.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.370
Okay, so now let's talk

01:33:14.370 --> 01:33:16.380
about the role of specific compounds,

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.470
some of which, many of which can be taken

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:22.560
in supplementation form or
extracted from diet and nutrition

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.640
in order to optimize sex steroid hormones,

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.680
and again, I just want to emphasize

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.710
that I'm not suggesting
anyone take anything

01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:31.040
or stop taking anything,

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.100
this is purely for informational purposes,

01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.480
but some of the data on these

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.263
is quite striking and impressive.

01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:40.820
It's very clear

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:45.300
that certain collections
of nutrients are useful

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.680
for promoting testosterone
and estrogen production

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.610
in their proper ratios,

01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:52.930
and those things are what I would call

01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:54.840
the sort of usual suspects,

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.650
vitamin D, which is important

01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:58.830
for so many biological functions,

01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:00.530
including endocrine functions,

01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:04.030
zinc, magnesium, et cetera,

01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:06.360
and if you want to look
into this more deeply

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.193
and you want to understand

01:34:07.193 --> 01:34:08.950
exactly what the negative effects are

01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:10.960
of not having sufficient
zinc and magnesium,

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.350
and what those levels might actually be,

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:16.600
there's a paper that's
available, you can go on PubMed,

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.270
I can't pronounce this
last name, I'm sorry,

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:24.270
it looks to me like Wrzosek,
but it's W-R-Z-O-S-E-K,

01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:29.500
I hope I didn't butcher that
too badly, Wrzosek et al. 2020

01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:33.080
in "Endocrinology and Metabolism Review,"

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.990
so this is a recent paper in
a good, peer-reviewed journal

01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:37.300
that talks mainly about

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.500
how the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.080
and the sex steroid hormones

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.440
are negatively impacted by
deficiencies in magnesium,

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.110
deficiencies in vitamin D,
and deficiencies in zinc,

01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:53.310
however, that doesn't point to the levels

01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:56.610
that one should take in order to optimize,

01:34:56.610 --> 01:34:58.820
so it doesn't say take X amount of zinc

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:01.210
or X amount of magnesium
or X amount of vitamin D,

01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:02.940
for that information,

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:07.240
because it's so context-dependent
and individual-dependent,

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.500
I highly recommend you go to examine.com,

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.700
you can put in zinc or
magnesium or vitamin D,

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:14.100
and they will give you ranges of dosages

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.920
that are supported by specific studies,

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.800
again, that information
is completely free to you,

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.140
and it's very useful in figuring that out.

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.920
I personally have supplemented

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.930
with zinc, magnesium,
and vitamin D for years,

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:28.390
but many other people do that as well,

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:29.710
and the question is always, how much?

01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:32.270
And that's why I'm a proponent
of getting blood work done

01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:33.103
because that's how you know

01:35:33.103 --> 01:35:34.960
whether or not your androgen levels,

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:37.380
as well as things like
vitamin D levels, et cetera,

01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.280
are sufficiently high,

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.810
so the takeaway from these studies

01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:43.300
looking at what deficiencies cause

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.840
in terms of deficits in
testosterone and estrogen

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.740
really point in the direction of,

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.620
make sure you're getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:54.020
unless you want these steroid
hormone levels to be reduced

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.300
for whatever reason.

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.720
One of the things that's been
shown time and time again

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.940
to have very negative effects
on sex steroid hormones,

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:04.370
testosterone mainly men,
estrogen mainly in women,

01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:06.570
is opioids.

01:36:06.570 --> 01:36:08.180
There's this whole issue, of course,

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:11.960
of the opioid epidemic, it's
deserving of an entire episode,

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.930
we are going to talk about
that with experts in addiction

01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:19.220
and people that treat pain and so forth,

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:22.960
but the opioids dramatically reduce

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.500
levels of testosterone and estrogen,

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.530
and they do that mainly by
disrupting the receptors

01:36:29.530 --> 01:36:31.820
on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons,

01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.350
these neurons within the hypothalamus

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:35.020
that communicate to the pituitary,

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:38.290
and in fact, people that take
large amounts of opioids,

01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:41.470
or even take low levels of
opioids for long periods of time,

01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:44.050
will develop all sorts
of endocrine syndromes,

01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:45.900
that's been shown over and over again,

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.740
gynecomastia, or male
breast development in males,

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:51.150
disruptions to the ovary in females,

01:36:51.150 --> 01:36:53.700
it's really a quite terrible situation,

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:58.190
so excessive opioids are very problematic

01:36:58.190 --> 01:36:59.580
for sex steroid hormones,

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.060
I don't think anyone will have any trouble

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.170
finding any literature on that,

01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:04.130
you can just go into PubMed,

01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:09.110
you can put opioids, testosterone,
or opioids, estrogen,

01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:11.870
but the major effect is actually
way up in the hypothalamus

01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:14.060
to shut down the production of GnRH,

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.780
the very hormone that stimulates

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:17.900
testosterone and estrogen release.

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:21.297
Now, there's an entire
industry devoted to supplements

01:37:21.297 --> 01:37:22.930
and various things that people can take

01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:24.260
to increase testosterone,

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:27.620
some of which have scientific
data to support them,

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.180
some of which do not,

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.550
and some of which have anecdotal support

01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:33.330
and some of which do not.

01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:35.060
This ranges so broadly,

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:38.800
I mean, things like the
material off deer antlers,

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.360
which is high in, supposedly, IGF1,

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.790
which is in the growth hormone pathway,

01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:48.680
all the way to actual
consumption of bull testes,

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.200
you can go on Amazon right now,

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.033
I certainly don't
suggest that you do this,

01:37:51.033 --> 01:37:55.700
and you can actually buy
ground up testes from cows,

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.460
and you can consume those,

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.310
now, a lot of that's going
to be broken down in the gut,

01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:02.950
I'm certainly not suggesting you do that,

01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:06.120
but just the point out this
is a huge and vast literature,

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.090
and it actually dates
back hundreds of years

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:12.310
even though testosterone
wasn't discovered that long ago

01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:14.600
as a specific hormone molecule

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.070
and characterized and then resynthesized,

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:20.150
it has a huge industry

01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:22.440
because of the powerful
effects that it has,

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.800
likewise with estrogen,

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.580
the development of the birth control pill

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.200
was only made possible by
understanding the structure

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.020
of estrogen and estradiol,

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.710
and we're going to talk
all about birth control

01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:35.060
and how it works and its influence
on various other pathways

01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:36.520
in a future episode,

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.840
but there are these supplement compounds

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.830
that are supported by
the scientific literature

01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:45.440
in terms of their ability
to adjust androgens,

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.370
things like testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone.

01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:49.250
One of the ones that has

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:53.040
really good evidence for it is creatine,

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.940
it's very clear that
something about creatine,

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:58.560
although the mechanism
isn't exactly clear,

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.340
either increases 5-alpha reductase

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.480
or makes the testosterone
molecule more susceptible

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.260
to certain enzymatic reactions

01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.347
that leads to increases in DHT,

01:39:09.347 --> 01:39:11.800
DHT, dihydrotestosterone,

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.120
as I mentioned in the previous episode,

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.970
has this dramatic role in creating

01:39:15.970 --> 01:39:19.120
a kind of masculinization
of the brain prenatally,

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.670
it also defines the
primary sex characteristic

01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:24.600
of the growth of the penis, et cetera,

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:29.200
and beyond infancy and early
childhood and later in life,

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.870
it has powerful effects
in creating balding,

01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:33.070
in beard growth, et cetera,

01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:36.940
and it has a much higher affinity
for the androgen receptor

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.230
than does testosterone,

01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:42.060
so creatine can increase DHT,

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.050
which means that if you take creatine

01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.540
and you're very DHT-susceptible,

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.710
then you might experience some hair loss,

01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:52.300
this has been heavily debated,
does creatine cause baldness?

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.160
It's going to depend,

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.580
it's going to depend on how
much 5-alpha reductase you have

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.050
and how prone to hair loss you are,

01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:00.890
some people can take
creatine without any problem

01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:01.723
in terms of hair loss,

01:40:01.723 --> 01:40:04.500
some people cannot, they
start losing their hair

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.990
to levels that, at least for
them, aren't comfortable.

01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:10.560
There are a few other things
that can increase testosterone

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.570
and it has to do with the way

01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:16.070
that testosterone exists in
its free and its bound form,

01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:20.880
so testosterone, the molecule
is kind of total testosterone,

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.870
that's usually what's measured,

01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:24.290
this is the kind of levels that
are typically thrown around

01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:27.630
of anywhere from 300 to 900
being the kind of natural range,

01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:29.410
and then supraphysiological,

01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:32.040
getting up into 1,200, 1,600 range,

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.180
but testosterone isn't

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.440
just roaming around free in the blood,

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.980
at least most of it isn't,

01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:39.180
most of it is bound

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:44.180
to either sex hormone binding
globulin, SHBG, or to albumin,

01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:46.140
they're needed as transporters

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.160
to get testosterone into cells

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:51.250
so that testosterone can have
its effects on gene expression

01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:54.660
as well as other pathways
within the cells,

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.310
so people talk about that the
level of free testosterone

01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:59.570
is really what's important

01:40:59.570 --> 01:41:01.940
and that you want to
optimize free testosterone,

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.860
that's a little bit of a tricky statement,

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:07.570
that's kind of like, it's true,

01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:10.600
and yet, it's not really reflective

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.830
of a thorough understanding

01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:14.440
of how these binding globulins work,

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.700
remember, these binding globulins

01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.590
aren't there to soak up
all your testosterone

01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:19.660
just to make it hard for
you to free up testosterone

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:23.110
and you know, make gains in
the gym or whatever it is,

01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:24.190
or have increases in libido,

01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:26.830
they're there to actually
transport testosterone

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:30.040
to specific tissues, to shuttle
them to specific tissues

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.040
and to set the rate of bound
and unbound testosterone

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.530
so that's it's not all unbound at once,

01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:38.460
and you know, it's always interesting

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:39.320
to look in the literature

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.280
and see how everyone wants

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.620
to free up their testosterone
so that it can work,

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:46.060
but sex hormone binding globulin

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.900
can bind up too much testosterone

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.410
to the point where it's having
negative effects on libido

01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:53.360
or on muscle growth and fat
loss and things of that sort,

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.190
this is true in males and females,

01:41:55.190 --> 01:41:58.560
or it can be doing exactly
what it's supposed to do,

01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.690
which is shuttling testosterone

01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:01.840
to the proper tissues and organs

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.320
where it has all these
effects, including the brain.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.070
So there are supplements,

01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:09.950
in particular, tongkat ali,

01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:11.540
which is, it has this other name,

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:13.470
it's something called tongkat ali,

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:14.390
sometimes it's called,

01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:16.590
and forgive me that
it's hard to pronounce,

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:21.510
but Eurycoma longifolia Jack,

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:23.960
they always seem to have these names

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:27.160
that kind of allude to
androgenic features,

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.320
like I don't know why, longifolia Jack,

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.430
I don't know, I think it's kind of obvious

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:34.230
why that sounds sort of androgenic.

01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:37.640
This has been shown in several studies,

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.210
and you can find these on examine.com,

01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:41.293
or you can go to PubMed if you
like, I've looked at these,

01:42:41.293 --> 01:42:43.810
that it does seem to
have some pro-fertility,

01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:48.810
pro-free testosterone, and
subtle aphrodisiac effects,

01:42:49.230 --> 01:42:52.590
it does also seem to be
a slight anti-estrogen,

01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:55.340
so the reports of this are,

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:58.480
people take this anywhere from
400 to 800 milligrams a day,

01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.920
again, I'm not suggesting you do that,

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.290
but that's kind of what's out there,

01:43:01.290 --> 01:43:03.880
and there is some decent
scientific literature

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.710
to support the fact that it liberates

01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:07.840
some of the bound testosterone

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.580
and allows more free
testosterone to be available,

01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:12.930
some of the reported
quote-unquote side effects

01:43:12.930 --> 01:43:15.930
are things like excessive
alertness and insomnia

01:43:15.930 --> 01:43:17.690
if it's taken too late
in the day and so forth,

01:43:17.690 --> 01:43:21.070
but I encourage you to explore
that further if that's,

01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:22.614
if increasing free testosterone

01:43:22.614 --> 01:43:25.340
is something that you're
interested in doing.

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:29.610
Examine.com includes a lot of other things

01:43:29.610 --> 01:43:31.960
that can increase testosterone,

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.350
one of the things that's been

01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:36.950
purported to free up
testosterone in the blood

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:39.860
are things like nettles, stinging nettles,

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.530
although I should point
out that the literature

01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:42.530
points to stinging nettle

01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:45.160
also having some fairly potent effects

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.200
on the prostate and on the liver,

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:49.070
and so it might be a tricky molecule

01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:52.320
and maybe not an attractive
one for people to take.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.490
So we talked about creatine,
we talked about tongkat ali,

01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:57.410
it's clear that boron,
which is really interesting,

01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.550
believe it or not, I
think boron comes from,

01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:02.610
I think these were like,
meteors that landed on Earth

01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:04.063
and now they extract boron,

01:44:04.988 --> 01:44:07.450
it's one of these crazy stories
that, when you look at it,

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:08.710
you go like, "How could that possibly be?"

01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:11.070
but there's actually, that's how it works,

01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:14.810
that boron, there's
some scientific support

01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:16.520
for it freeing up more testosterone,

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:17.760
and again, freeing up testosterone

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.330
may be exactly what you want,

01:44:19.330 --> 01:44:20.610
I just don't think that we should

01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:23.900
demonize these carrier
proteins like albumin and SHBG,

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.830
in fact, albumin is very important

01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:28.330
for testosterone to be able
to make it into the brain

01:44:28.330 --> 01:44:31.460
to have some of the pro-androgenic effects

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:33.630
on the cognitive effects of testosterone

01:44:33.630 --> 01:44:35.110
because in both males and females,

01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:39.383
testosterone can shift these
behaviors, like mate-seeking,

01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:43.330
reductions in anxiety, and so forth,

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:44.800
that we talked about before,

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.997
only by making it into the brain,

01:44:45.997 --> 01:44:48.510
and there is this thing called
the blood-brain barrier,

01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:49.720
which is fascinating

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.890
and deserving of an entire episode also,

01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:54.880
and getting molecules across
the blood-brain barrier,

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.137
even if they're sex steroid
hormones, which are lipophilic

01:44:57.137 --> 01:45:00.840
and can pass through cell
membranes, requires carriers,

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:05.640
and those carriers often are
bound to or include albumin,

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:10.640
and so it's not the goal to
free up all your testosterone,

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:13.180
but getting free testosterone into a range

01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.620
that works for your
particular goals and needs

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:17.210
is an attractive one,

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:19.740
and that's why we're discussing
these particular tools.

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.710
The amounts of boron that people take,

01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:24.330
and you can find this,
again, on PubMed or Examine,

01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:26.450
but people take a couple
grams of it a day,

01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:28.160
I'm not aware of any
specific side effects,

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.290
but you always, always,
always want to examine

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.010
for the particular side effects

01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:34.630
and people with different
backgrounds and conditions,

01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:37.140
as we talked about for
menopause and estrogen,

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.140
have to be careful

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:40.930
because when you're starting
to modulate hormones,

01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:44.080
you're starting to modulate
not just the tissues

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.930
that thrive on binding of those hormones,

01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:51.270
but remember, the reason why
there's so much breast cancer

01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:53.370
and there's a reason why there's
so much testicular cancer

01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:57.270
is that any tissue that
undergoes rapid reproduction

01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:58.280
of particular cells,

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.700
so there's a lot of reproduction of cells

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:01.930
in shedding of uterine lining

01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:04.460
and the reproduction of
cells and eggs in the ovary,

01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:06.300
and in the testes, there's the production

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.270
of Leydig and sertoli cells,

01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:12.710
and there's this kind of
ongoing production of sperm,

01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:15.490
that's why those tissues
are particularly vulnerable

01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:16.680
to the development of cancers,

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.910
and many of those cancers
are androgen-sensitive,

01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:21.280
that's why one of the major treatments

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:23.770
for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer

01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:26.770
is to give anti-androgenic drugs, okay?

01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:29.850
It's not just to shut down all things

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:33.070
related to being androgenized,

01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:35.760
it's really about trying
to prevent testosterone

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.700
from encouraging growth of tumors,

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:41.590
so I want to really
emphasize the caution there

01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:43.520
because it's easy when thinking

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.800
about optimizing estrogen and testosterone

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.520
to just think, oh, more is better,

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.970
more is definitely not better,

01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:50.750
and it's not just because
they can aromatize

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.440
or convert into other things,

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.120
it's because cancers,

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:57.810
or any tissue that has a
lot of turnover of cells,

01:46:57.810 --> 01:47:00.360
is going to thrive on androgen,

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.610
anything that promotes growth

01:47:01.610 --> 01:47:03.570
is going to thrive on estrogen,

01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:05.790
remember, brain tissue
doesn't turn over that much,

01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:07.690
there isn't really much
production of new neurons,

01:47:07.690 --> 01:47:09.640
brain cancers happen but
they're kind of rare,

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.650
and when they do happen,

01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:11.950
they tend to be glial cells,

01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:13.560
which have a lot of proliferation,

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.970
glial cells can proliferate,

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.120
adult neurons don't
create more of themselves,

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:18.990
they don't create more neurons,

01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:21.890
in general, except in a few
places in the brain and body,

01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:26.890
so any tissue that recycles
itself is prone to cancers,

01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:31.300
and those tissues thrive
on androgens and estrogens

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:32.630
to create more tumor,

01:47:32.630 --> 01:47:34.090
so you have to be careful

01:47:34.090 --> 01:47:35.600
anytime you're modulating hormones,

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.450
especially androgens and estrogens,

01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:40.040
and in my scouring of the literature

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:41.860
and looking at kind of what's out there

01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:43.900
and what people are talking about,

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.730
and I also mean in the
scientific literature,

01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:49.890
one of the things that
is new to me, anyway,

01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:54.440
probably not new to a lot
of the gym rats out there,

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.510
or the people that spend a
lot of time on YouTube videos

01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:58.850
talking about androgens,

01:47:58.850 --> 01:48:01.570
are these, forgive me for
butchering the name again,

01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:03.670
are these ecdysteroids,

01:48:03.670 --> 01:48:08.400
so ecdysteroids are molecules

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:12.130
that come from things like
spinach, believe it or not,

01:48:12.130 --> 01:48:16.470
that have a lot of similarity
to the cholesterol molecule,

01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:19.260
the one that's being discussed
a lot out there right now

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:21.900
is something called turkesterone,

01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:23.560
I wish I knew why it
was called turkesterone,

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.050
someone tell me why it's
called turkesterone,

01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:27.400
does it have anything to do with turkeys?

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.500
I don't know why it's called turkesterone,

01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.340
perhaps someone will know.

01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:34.120
In any case, these ecdysteroids

01:48:35.043 --> 01:48:36.890
are similar enough to cholesterol,

01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:39.340
and remember, cholesterol is the precursor

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:42.080
to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen,

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.840
and it appears that some
of these ecdysteroids

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.110
do have bioavailability,

01:48:48.110 --> 01:48:50.000
or their metabolites are bioavailable,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.660
and this was something
that, for many years,

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:55.250
people talked about whether
or not insect hormones

01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:56.780
or hormones from other species

01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:58.980
could actually be used by humans

01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.370
or whether or not it would
have any effect at all,

01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:03.510
and it's pretty clear based on a study

01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:04.450
that I was able to find,

01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:07.020
there's a paper that came out in 2019,

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.160
it's a comparative study in
the "Archives of Toxicology,"

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.960
this is Isenmann et al.,
I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al.,

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.890
that talks about the ecdysteroids

01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.580
and it was given in conjunction

01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.930
with strength training
or no strength training,

01:49:22.930 --> 01:49:24.360
this was a 10-week intervention,

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.570
and their conclusion is
that these ecdysteroids

01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:31.400
had a fairly significant,
above placebo controls,

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:35.000
increases in muscle mass,
strength, hypertrophy effects,

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.060
all the sorts of things
that one would expect

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:39.570
with increases in androgen,

01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:43.590
their conclusion of this
study is not my conclusion,

01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:45.320
although I may or may not agree with them,

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.570
this isn't about my opinions,

01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:47.520
it's just, I want to be clear,

01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.990
these are their words, not mine,

01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:52.710
but they say that, in their words,

01:49:52.710 --> 01:49:54.197
quote, "Our results strongly suggest

01:49:54.197 --> 01:49:55.487
"the inclusion of ecdysteroid

01:49:55.487 --> 01:49:56.960
"in the list of prohibited substances."

01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.620
So they're saying these
things are so powerful

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:00.280
that they should be on the
list of banned substances,

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:04.370
which might be upsetting to some,

01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:07.430
or some of you might be
thinking, well, who cares?

01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:12.430
The whole issue of
augmenting hormones in sports

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.650
is a very interesting issue,

01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.940
in fact, if you just want a
little anecdote about that,

01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.890
I can't reveal names here, of course,

01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:21.910
but what I learned recently
was very surprising to me

01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:24.900
which is that many athletes in pro sports

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:27.040
are taking testosterone,

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.600
and they are able to do that legally

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.540
not just because it's
available by prescription,

01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:33.890
but they are allowed to do that

01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:35.880
under the rules of their sport

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.830
in the fine print that no one,
including me, had ever seen,

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.170
if they've had an injury,

01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:44.010
so if athletes are injured,
then it opens up the door

01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:47.600
for certain forms of
testosterone augmentation

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.500
and other types of augmentations

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.790
that are not available to
them if they're not injured,

01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:54.180
which always makes me wonder now

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:55.210
when I see them getting injured

01:50:55.210 --> 01:50:57.700
whether or not that's an attempt
to get some of the support

01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.100
because there's absolutely no question

01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:04.020
that estrogens and testosterones
modulate gene expression,

01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:06.420
modulate strength, modulate
the way the brain works,

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:09.710
modulates our relationship to
effort and anxiety, et cetera,

01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:11.850
and while we're talking
about supplementation,

01:51:11.850 --> 01:51:13.423
the effects of supplementation,

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.150
I would say, in some individuals
can be quite dramatic,

01:51:17.150 --> 01:51:19.733
but they're always, always, always,

01:51:20.770 --> 01:51:25.000
except in extreme cases,
going to be far subtler,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.520
excuse me, far more subtle,

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.960
to use the proper English,

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:31.630
far more subtle than would be,

01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:34.590
for instance, just in
injecting testosterone

01:51:34.590 --> 01:51:36.820
or injecting estrogen, et cetera,

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:40.053
so I think we should just be
honest and upfront about that.

01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:45.040
So thus far in terms of talking
about optimizing hormones

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.453
and in the discussion of supplementation,

01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:49.830
I haven't really talked about things

01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:51.760
that actually affect the brain directly,

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.820
that increase the pituitary
output and things of that sort,

01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.930
we've mainly been talking about things

01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:58.750
that free up testosterone
or that increase estrogen

01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:00.630
at the level of the periphery,

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:01.720
but if you remember way back

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.050
to the beginning of this episode,

01:52:03.050 --> 01:52:05.160
hormones are made in different
locations in the body

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.730
and there are hormones

01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:09.410
that promote the release and
the production of hormones

01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:10.490
from other tissues in the body,

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.640
and one of the main hormones for that

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.160
is luteinizing hormone,

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.370
luteinizing hormone, again,
comes from the pituitary,

01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:18.870
circulates and either goes to the ovary

01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:23.870
to promote various
aspects of egg maturation

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.700
as well as production of estrogen,

01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:29.130
and to the testes to promote

01:52:29.130 --> 01:52:31.740
testosterone and sperm production,

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:35.400
and the prescription version

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:38.010
of increasing luteinizing hormone

01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:40.760
is something called hCG, or
human chorionic gonadotropin,

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.950
which has been synthesized

01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:44.520
and is now available
as a prescription drug,

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:48.920
it's taken in various contexts
for increasing fertility

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:51.080
both by males and by females,

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:54.710
it can increase, for all the
reasons that now make sense,

01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:56.060
it can increase sperm production,

01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:59.040
it can produce ovulation frequency,

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.150
it can produce the number of eggs, even,

01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:03.690
that are deployed in a given ovulation,

01:53:03.690 --> 01:53:06.470
although that's not always a good thing,

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:08.910
it basically is pro-fertility,

01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:11.070
pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen

01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:12.980
depending on your background,

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.920
and what's interesting is

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:19.600
hCG was initially synthesized,

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.260
collected and synthesized
from pregnant women's urine,

01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:27.040
and believe it or not, before
it was synthetically made

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.760
and sold as a prescription drug,

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:33.600
there was actually a black
market for pregnant women's urine

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.300
where people would buy the urine,

01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.870
I don't know, I'm guessing
that they probably

01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:40.620
just consumed it, which is weird,

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:44.220
but in any case, human
chorionic gonadotropin

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:46.360
is now available as a prescription drug

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.580
and it's one of the things
that many people use

01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:51.210
to increase testosterone or estrogen

01:53:51.210 --> 01:53:52.640
for increasing fertility,

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:54.020
in some cases I think it's used

01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.800
to increase sports performance

01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:59.150
or when people have shut down their gonads

01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:01.990
for whatever reason because
of excessive hormone therapies

01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:05.030
or they have some sort of,

01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:07.630
sometimes there are actually
lesions to the pituitary,

01:54:07.630 --> 01:54:10.250
sometimes people have a
tumor in the pituitary,

01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:11.960
it's actually not common,

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:14.350
but among brain tumors and neural tumors,

01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:15.960
it's one of the more common ones,

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.217
and then you get
deficiencies in LH and FSH,

01:54:18.217 --> 01:54:20.950
and so people will take hCG
to stimulate the gonads,

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:21.940
so there are a variety of reasons

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.870
why these drugs were created,

01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:26.440
but there are certain
supplements, not many,

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:29.020
that apparently can
increase luteinizing hormone

01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.010
and thereby can increase
testosterone and estrogen,

01:54:32.010 --> 01:54:36.360
and one of the more well-documented
one is Fadogia agrestis,

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:39.160
that's F-A-D-O-G-I-A,

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:42.930
separate word, A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,

01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:45.960
which, at least according
to the literature

01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.070
that I was able to find,

01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:49.120
can increase levels of luteinizing hormone

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.490
and thereby levels of testosterone
or levels of estrogen,

01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:55.960
and again, if an individual
were to take Fadogia agrestis,

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.050
what they would probably find

01:54:57.050 --> 01:55:00.000
is that testosterone and
estrogen would increase

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.360
in anyone of any chromosomal
or gonadal background,

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.620
but remember, it's the ratio of both,

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.450
if someone has low estrogen
and high testosterone,

01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:10.300
let's say they have testes
just by way of example,

01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:13.370
then both of those would
be expected to increase,

01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:15.860
and if someone has high
estrogen and low testosterone,

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:17.930
and let's just say has ovaries,

01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:19.570
then both of those would increase

01:55:19.570 --> 01:55:22.000
by taking Fadogia agrestis.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.290
The side effect profile
of Fadogia agrestis

01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:26.100
hasn't really been documented,

01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.580
so it's a little unclear,

01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:29.380
I just want to emphasize

01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:32.323
that anytime someone's going
to start taking supplements,

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.940
or modifying sex steroid hormones,

01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.780
getting blood work done
is extremely important

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:39.700
for safety reasons,

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:42.130
and also just to know whether
or not things are working,

01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:43.900
and because all of these things

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:45.880
are subject to negative feedback,

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:48.740
talked about this previously
on a previous episode,

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.610
but if testosterone
goes high, or too high,

01:55:51.610 --> 01:55:54.350
it can feed back and shut
down luteinizing hormone,

01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:57.250
which will then shut down
further testosterone production,

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:59.620
likewise, if estrogens are going too high

01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:02.190
or they're going too high at
various phases of the cycle,

01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:05.490
that can start to throw
off various other hormones,

01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:09.940
including FSH, progesterone, LH,

01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:11.180
the menstrual cycle itself

01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:13.840
is a just absolutely exquisite balance

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.530
of feedback of luteinizing
hormone kept low and constant,

01:56:17.530 --> 01:56:19.850
at least for the first
14 days of the cycle,

01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:21.400
then mid cycle, there's a peak,

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.220
and that's typically
when ovulation occurs,

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.990
that's why pregnancy is most likely

01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:28.170
during the middle of the 28-day cycle,

01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:33.160
FSH kind of goes up and then
down across the first 14 days,

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:36.160
so taking anything or really modifying

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:38.270
one's estrogens or testosterone

01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:40.410
on that background of the menstrual cycle

01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:42.830
is really going to disrupt
the way those things interact,

01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:45.140
and it's just such an
exquisite feedback loop,

01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:48.230
so I'm not saying don't do that,

01:56:48.230 --> 01:56:50.880
but you definitely want to be
aware of what you're doing,

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.900
and blood draws are one way to do that,

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.820
monitoring cycles for ovulating females

01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.730
is another way to do that,

01:56:56.730 --> 01:56:58.950
and in males, having a good window

01:56:58.950 --> 01:57:01.290
into what's going on
with testosterone, DHT,

01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:05.510
aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera,

01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:06.490
is just vital,

01:57:06.490 --> 01:57:09.790
and it's really part and
parcel with the practice

01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:12.390
of thinking about optimizing
these incredible things

01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:13.980
that we call sex steroid hormones,

01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.380
estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives.

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.630
The list of supplements and molecules

01:57:18.630 --> 01:57:22.250
that can adjust estrogen
and testosterone is vast,

01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:24.280
and I only touched on a few of these,

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.040
I really tried to emphasize the ones

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:29.310
for which there are human studies

01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:32.670
or that have mostly human studies,

01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:34.350
or maybe even just one human study,

01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:36.740
there are other things out there

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:38.170
for which there are scientific data,

01:57:38.170 --> 01:57:39.780
things like Bulbine natalensis,

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:42.980
which definitely has support
for increasing testosterone

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:45.220
but all the studies were in rats,

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:46.810
I think there is some evidence in humans

01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:48.700
but the evidence mainly comes in the form

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:50.690
of what we call sponsored research,

01:57:50.690 --> 01:57:52.820
so companies paying for research,

01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:54.900
which is different than
independent research

01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:58.380
by people who are not biased
in terms of the outcome,

01:57:58.380 --> 01:57:59.520
and the reason I didn't

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:01.250
throw out things like Bulbine natalensis

01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:04.120
is they seem to have liver toxicity

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:08.270
similar to high levels of
anabolic exogenous steroids,

01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:10.600
there's some problems associated with them

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:14.750
that make them, you know,
important to think about

01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:18.390
if you're curious about this
area and the endocrinology,

01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:21.410
but also somewhat precarious,

01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:23.760
and you know, that's one category,

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.110
so stuff that doesn't have
a lot of evidence in humans,

01:58:26.110 --> 01:58:28.610
might actually be dangerous,

01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:30.380
the other category of things

01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.030
that has been shown to improve levels of,

01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:36.020
or increase, I should say,
I don't want to say improve

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:36.853
because it's up to you whether or not

01:58:36.853 --> 01:58:39.700
you want to increase or decrease
estrogen and testosterone,

01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:41.860
that's highly individual,
how could I know,

01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:43.800
are the things that are
kind of housekeeping

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:45.870
for production of
estrogen and testosterone,

01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:49.910
things like magnesium, things
like D3, things like zinc,

01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:50.930
you know, those are the things

01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:54.880
that are going to create an overall milieu

01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.470
of opportunity to produce
normal endogenous levels

01:58:58.470 --> 01:59:01.740
rather than increasing
endogenous levels further,

01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:03.580
and so I really want to highlight

01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:05.210
that there's a difference
between taking something

01:59:05.210 --> 01:59:08.620
to create a kind of
backdrop of general support

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:11.770
and taking something that's
going to create a big inflection

01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:14.080
in the levels of a given hormone.

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.210
So once again, we covered

01:59:15.210 --> 01:59:17.350
a tremendous amount of information,

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:20.700
we covered some basic science
of hormones and pheromones,

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:23.380
estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives,

01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:26.440
we talked about
supplementation and behaviors,

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.250
competition and parenting,

01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:30.330
and how all these things interact,

01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:32.590
and I hope that you'll come away from this

01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:34.660
with a deeper mechanistic understanding

01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:37.530
of how the brain and body are interacting

01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:39.590
to control the output

01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:42.750
and the ways in which
these incredible things

01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:45.960
that we call sex steroid
hormones work and influence us,

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:47.640
I hope you'll also come
away with some ideas

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:48.910
of things that you can do,

01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:52.490
in particular, behavioral
practices that can improve sleep

01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:54.760
and your relationship to light, et cetera,

01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.850
because those things
really set the foundation

01:59:57.850 --> 02:00:01.600
not just for healthy
steroid hormone output,

02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.700
but for all sorts of health effects

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:08.010
and for both the
psychology and the biology

02:00:08.010 --> 02:00:09.980
of your nervous system,

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.010
so I'm sure there'll be many questions,

02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:14.836
there are many things that
I couldn't get to today,

02:00:14.836 --> 02:00:17.040
I do try and limit these
episodes to about 90 minutes,

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.840
which is the optimal
ultradian cycle for learning,

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:21.790
it's a lot of information,

02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:23.410
but we've timestamped everything for you,

02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:26.440
so feel free to look over it in parts

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:29.550
or circle back where you might
want deeper understanding,

02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:32.700
and please put your questions
in the comments section below,

02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:35.370
please put suggestions for future episodes

02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:36.970
and things that relate to hormones

02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:39.510
in the comments section
below, we do look at those

02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:41.770
and we do use them to inform the content

02:00:41.770 --> 02:00:43.570
for subsequent episodes.

02:00:43.570 --> 02:00:45.900

anyone that you think might also benefit

02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:04.640
from the information that we're covering,

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:06.590
that really helps us grow our audience

02:01:06.590 --> 02:01:09.020
and bring more information to you.

02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.170
As well, please check out our sponsors

02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:13.370
mentioned at the
beginning of each episode,

02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:15.220
and we also have a Patreon,

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:18.838
that's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:21.040
At the Patreon, you can
help support the podcast

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.080
at any level that you like.

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.860
As well, we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.290
which is a supplement company,

02:01:29.290 --> 02:01:30.253
the reason we partner with Thorne

02:01:30.253 --> 02:01:32.620
is that they have the
highest levels of stringency

02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:35.610
in terms of the quality of
the supplements that they make

02:01:35.610 --> 02:01:37.790
and the quantity of the
individual ingredients,

02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:40.140
something that's not always the case

02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:41.620
with various supplement companies,

02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:43.660
but Thorne is exquisitely good

02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:45.470
about the stringency of their products,

02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:46.900
they partner with the Mayo Clinic

02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:48.880
and all the major sports teams.

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:50.050
If you want to check out Thorne

02:01:50.050 --> 02:01:51.630
and see the supplements that I take,

02:01:51.630 --> 02:01:56.180
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:58.370
and if you do that, you can
see the supplements I take,

02:01:58.370 --> 02:02:00.980
but as well, it will
allow you to get 20% off

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:01.990
any of those supplements

02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:04.670
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes,

02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:07.173
that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

02:02:08.097 --> 02:02:11.430
.com/u/huberman

02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:14.180
to get 20% off any Thorne supplements.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.540
In closing, I hope you'll
leave today's episode

02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:19.270
with a much richer
understanding of the mechanisms

02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:21.360
that control the endocrine
and nervous system

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.080
in the context of
estrogen and testosterone,

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.030
as well as take away various tools

02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:28.140
that you might choose to apply,

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:31.290
and next week, we'll be
back with another episode

02:02:31.290 --> 02:02:32.660
about the role of hormones

02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.677
and its important interactions
with the nervous system,

02:02:35.677 --> 02:02:36.770
and that will, of course,

02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:39.740
include both mechanisms and tools as well,

02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:42.317
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
