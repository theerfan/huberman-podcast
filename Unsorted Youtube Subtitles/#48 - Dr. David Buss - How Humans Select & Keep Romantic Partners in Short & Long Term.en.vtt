00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.963
for everyday life.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.480
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.340
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.330
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.780
My guest today is Dr. David Buss.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.830
Doctor Buss is a Professor of Psychology

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.800
at the University of Texas, Austin,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.130
and he is one of the founding
members and luminaries

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.840
in the field of evolutionary psychology.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.210
Doctor Buss's laboratory is responsible

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.440
for understanding the
strategies that humans use

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.520
to select mates in the
short- and long-term.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.560
And he is an expert in sex
differences in mating strategy.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.640
His laboratory has explored for instance,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540
why women cheat on their spouses

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.820
or their long-term partners,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.580
as well as why men tend to cheat

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.200
on their spouses and long-term partners.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.760
He's also explored a
number of things related

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.500
to the courtship dance that we call dating

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.280
and securing a mate,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.240
including the use of deception

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.420
related to proclamations of love

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.410
or promises of finances
or sexual activity.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.760
Doctor Buss's laboratory
has also evaluated

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.590
how status is assessed,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590
meaning how we evaluate our own worth,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.680
and our potential as a mate, and who is,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.850
let's just say within
range of a potential mate,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030
both in the short- and long-term.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.740
For instance, today we
talk about how people

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890
don't just make direct assessments

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.020
of their own and other people's
value as a potential mate,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.300
but also using the assessments of others

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300
to indirectly determine whether or not

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.240
they stand a chance or
not in securing somebody

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.200
as a short- or long-term mate.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.240
His laboratory has also focused on

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.790
some of the complicated
and varied emotions

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.150
related to mating,
love, and relationships,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.570
such as lust and jealousy.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.400
And he's extensively explored

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.270
something called mate poaching,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.570
or the various strategies
that men and women use

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.920
to make sure that the person
that they want to be with,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.580
or the person they are with,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.570
is not with anyone else
or seeking anyone else,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.400
and indeed that other people
don't seek their mate.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.110
Doctor Buss's work also relates

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.610
to how biological
influences, such as ovulation

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460
or time within the menstrual cycle

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.700
influences mate selection

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.970
or tendency to have sex or not

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.730
with a potential short- or long-term mate.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.710
And more recent work from
Doctor Buss's laboratory

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.220
focuses on the darker aspects of mating

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.680
and sexual behavior in humans,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.500
including stalking and sexual violence.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.080
Today, we discuss all those topics.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.370
We also discuss some of the
strategies that humans can use

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.890
to make healthy mate selection choices,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.560
and for those that are already
in committed relationships

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.220
to ensure healthy progression

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.920
of those committed relationships.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.490
In addition to publishing dozens

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.840
of landmark scientific studies,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.810
Doctor Buss has authored
many important books,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.010
a few of those include,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.540
The Evolution of Desire,
and Why Women Have Sex.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.860
And his most recent book

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.560
is the one that I'm reading
now, which is called,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.020
When Men Behave Badly: The Hidden Roots

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.650
of Sexual Deception,
Harassment, and Assault.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.980
And it's an absolutely fascinating read.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.980
It has endorsements from

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.010
Doctor Robert Sapolsky,
Professor at Stanford,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.560
who's been on this
podcast as a guest before,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.780
as well as Steven Pinker
and Jonathan Haidt,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.240
who wrote The Coddling
of the American Mind.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.450
It's a really important book I believe,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.870
and one that doesn't just
get into the darker aspects

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.880
of human mating behavior and violence,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.510
but also strategies that
people can take to ensure

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.710
healthy mating behavior and relationships.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.690
There's so much rumor, speculation,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.210
and outright fabrication of ideas

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.680
about why humans select particular mates

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.290
in the short- and long-term,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.840
what men and women do
differently, and so on.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.530
What I love about Doctor Buss's work

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.390
is that it's grounded
in laboratory studies

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.590
that are highly quantitative
using rigorous statistics.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.250
And so throughout today's discussion,

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.280
you'll notice that I'm
wrapped with attention,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.470
trying to extract as
much information as I can

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.300
from Doctor Buss about the real science

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.090
of human mate selection
and mating strategy.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.700
I'm certain that everyone will take away

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.910
extremely valuable
knowledge that they can use

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.050
in existing or future relationships

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.300
from this discussion with Doctor Buss.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.320
Before we begin,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.110
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.120
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.270
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.220
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.350
about science and science-related tools

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.740
to the general public.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.790
In keeping with that theme,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.490
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.490
Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.350
Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.790
that are the absolute highest quality.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.040
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.670
and I can tell you that
the cells and connections

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.100
of our brain and visual system

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.310
have to contend with an
enormous number of challenges

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.630
in order to see clearly.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.970
For instance, when you go from
a brightly lit environment

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.490
to a dimmer environment or into a shadow,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.490
your visual system has to adjust.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.930
The problem with a lot of sunglasses

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.990
and eyeglasses out there

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.020
is that they don't work
well with those adjustments.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.170
Roka has overcome those
challenges, and as a consequence,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.720
no matter what environment you're in,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.600
you see with crystal clarity.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.930
Roka eyeglasses and
sunglasses are also terrific

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.540
because they are extremely lightweight,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.570
so you don't even notice
that they're on your face.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.550
And they can be worn when
working or for school

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.830
or just walking about, but
also when running or cycling.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.660
And indeed, if you get sweaty,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.280
they won't slip off your face.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.550
That's a terrific feature,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.490
but they can be worn to do anything.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.640
I wear readers at night,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.770
and sometimes when I drive at night,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.460
and a wonderful thing about
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.930
is that unlike a lot of other
performance glasses out there

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.870
that make people look like cyborgs,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.440
or make it look like you're
definitely off to exercise,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.870
Roka eyeglasses and
sunglasses have a range

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.490
of terrific aesthetics that
you could wear anywhere.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.080
If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.890

and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.030
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.010
Inside tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.670
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.300
to help you better understand your body

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.470
and help you reach your health goals.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.560
I've long been a believer

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.130
in getting regular blood work done,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.130
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.170
that strongly impact your
immediate and long-term health

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.920
can only be assessed from
a quality blood test.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.660
And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.070
you can get additional information

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.860
about how your body and
your nervous system work,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.970
your immune system,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.900
in ways that can inform
better health choices.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.030
The problem with a lot of
blood and DNA tests out there

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.690
is that you don't get any information

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.740
about what to do with
the data that you get.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.350
Inside Tracker solves that problem.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.470
They have a very easy to use dashboard,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.380
so when you get your numbers back,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.600
it can direct you towards
specific nutrition,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.860
supplementation, or lifestyle
changes that you can make

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.350
in order to bring the numbers

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.770
for given hormones, metabolic factors,

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.810
immune factors into the
range that's ideal for you.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.640
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.270

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.320
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.910
Headspace is a meditation
app that's supported

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.060
by 25 peer-reviewed published studies,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.650
and benefits from over
600,000 five star reviews.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.900
There is now a plethora of scientific data

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.160
pointing to the fact that a
regular meditation practice

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.770
is immensely beneficial
for reducing anxiety,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.250
improving sleep, improving focus,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.530
many, many other aspects of
mental and physical health.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.290
The challenge many people have, however,

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.640
is maintaining a regular
meditation practice.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.680
And indeed, I am one of those people.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.550
I've been meditating on
and off for about 30 years,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.560
and I confess a lot of
times it's more off than on,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.540
until a few years ago

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.300
when I started using the Headspace app,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.800
and then I found it very easy,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.030
and I continue to find it easy

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.260
to maintain a daily meditation practice.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.510
And that's because Headspace

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.630
has many meditations to select from.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.410
So even if I only have
five minutes or 15 minutes,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.660
I'm able to do a meditation.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.260
I really enjoy those meditations,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.880
and I always see the benefits
of those meditations.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.740
In fact, if I just miss a couple of days,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.900
I start to notice that
I'm not doing as well

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.350
as when I'm meditating regularly.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.900
The Headspace app makes
it exceedingly easy

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.440
to meditate regularly.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.570

And now my conversation
with Doctor David Buss.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.930
David, delighted to be here.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.270
I've followed your work
for a number of years,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.340
and I'm excited to ask
you a number of questions

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.610
about these super interesting topics

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.173
about how people select mates,

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:50.570
how they lie, cheat,
and, but also behave well

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.390
in this dance that we call mate choice.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.340
- Yes, fortunately, there
are well-behaving humans

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.870
in the mix here.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.703
- Good to know.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.500
Just to start off,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.530
perhaps you could just
orient us a little bit

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.120
about mate choice.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.530
You know, some of the primary criteria

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.440
that studies show men and women use

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.170
in order to select mates,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.240
both, shall we call them transient mates

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.300
as well as lifetime mates?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.990
- Right, well, that's
a critical distinction,

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.720
because what people look for

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.030
in a long-term committed mateship,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.260
like a marriage partner or a
long-term romantic relationship

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.400
is different from what people look for

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.280
in a hookup or casual sex,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.993
or one night stand, or
even a brief affair.

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:41.470
So that's actually critical.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.910
I wonder if we could maybe
just back up a second

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.130
and just talk a little bit
about the theoretical framework

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.660
for understanding mate choice.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.220
So it basically stems from

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.510
Darwin's theory of sexual selection,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.570
and most people, when they
think about evolution,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.410
they think about, the cliche
is like survival of the fittest

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.180
or nature, red in tooth and claw.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.120
And Darwin noticed that
there were phenomena

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.450
that couldn't be explained

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.020
by this so-called survival selection,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.930
things like the brilliant
plumage of peacocks,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.510
sex differences, like in,
you know, stags, for example,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.290
have these massive antlers

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.513
and the females of the species do not.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:23.130
And so he came up with the
theory of sexual selection,

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.860
which deals not with the
evolution of characteristics

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.980
due to their survival advantage,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.420
but rather due to their mating advantage.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.350
And he identified two causal processes

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.980
by which mating advantage could occur.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.360
One is intrasexual competition
with the stereotyping,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.330
two stags locking horns in combat

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.790
with the victor gaining
sexual access to the female,

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.150
loser ambling off with a broken antler

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.220
and dejected in low self-esteem

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.273
and needing psychotherapy perhaps,

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:57.803
or mate value improvement therapy.

00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:00.770
And the logic was whatever qualities

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.140
led to success in these same-sex battles,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.860
those qualities get passed
on in greater numbers.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.030
And so you see evolution,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.440
which is change over time
and increase in frequency

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.990
of the characteristics
associated with winning these,

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.460
what Darwin called contest competition.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.000
And we know that the logic
of that is more general now

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.080
and involves things like in our species

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.310
competing for position
in status hierarchies.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.450
So anyway, so intrasexual
competition is one,

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.000
but the second most
relevant to your question

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.020
about mate choice is
preferential mate choice,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.420
that was the second causal pathway.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.810
And the logic there is that

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.330
if members of one sex
agree with one another,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.160
if there's some consensus

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.480
about the qualities that are desired,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.080
then those of the opposite sex

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.880
who possess the desired qualities

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.070
or embody those desired qualities,

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.830
they have a mating advantage.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.400
They get chosen, they get preferred.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.910
Those lacking desired
qualities get banished,

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.970
shunned, ignored,

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.450
or in the modern
environment become incels.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.240
And so the logic there is very simple,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.940
but also very powerful.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.930
And that is that whatever
qualities are desired,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.120
consensually desired,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.220
if there's some heritable basis to those,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.260
then those increase in
frequency over time.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.770
And so, and in the human case,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.510
these two causal processes
of sexual selection

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.410
are related to each other,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.670
in that the preferences, the
mate preferences of one sex

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.160
basically set the ground
rules for competition

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.290
in the opposite sex.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.120
So if, for example,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.490
hypothetically women
preferred to mate with men

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.170
who were able and willing
to devote resources to them,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.110
then that would create
competition among men

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.780
to claw their way, you know,

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.100
and beat out other men
in resource acquisition,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.340
and then displaying that their willingness

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.180
to commit that to a particular woman.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.780
And same with women though.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.780
One of the interesting things about humans

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.170
is that we have mutual mate choice,

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.620
which is not true in all species.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.990
And that is that it's not
just a matter of, you know,

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.710
you selecting someone to be your mate,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.960
they have to reciprocally select you.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.623
And so with mutual mate choice,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.850
we have both preferences,
mate preferences,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.200
that women have, and mate
preferences that men have,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.070
and consequently competition among men

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.660
for access to the most desirable women

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.790
in competition among women for access

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.870
to the most desirable man.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.420
So that's sort of a little
bit of theoretical backdrop.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.320
So you asked, well,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.340
what are the qualities
that men and women desire,

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.360
and maybe we'll start
with long-term mating,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.190
and then shift to short-term mating.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.290
And long-term mating is interesting

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.600
in and of itself in that it's very rare

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.290
in the mammalian world.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.240
So there are more than 5,000
species of primates of which,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.660
I'm sorry, more than
5,000 species of mammals,

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.010
of which we are one,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:09.010
but the percentage of mammals
that have anything resembling

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.720
like a pair bond of
long-term mating strategy,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.620
it's about 3-5%.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.680
It's extremely rare.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.093
And even our closest primate
relatives, the chimpanzees,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.490
they don't have a
long-term mating strategy.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.766
They don't have anything
resembling pair bond in mating.

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:28.040
In chimps, the females come into estrus,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.970
almost all the sexual activity occurs

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.850
during the estrous phase.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.570
After that, males and females

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.110
basically ignore each
other for the most part,

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.713
with some exceptions.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.813
But with humans,

00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:42.680
you have the evolution of
long-term pair bonding,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.680
attachment, a heavy male
investment in offspring,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.580
relatively concealed by ovulation.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.940
And so these are kind of unique aspects

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.930
of the human mating system.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.100
So to get to your question,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.340
so what are the qualities?

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.147
So the best, the most large scale study

00:15:04.147 --> 00:15:05.200
that's been done on this,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.540
is a study that I did a while back

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.530
of 37 different cultures.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.960
And it's now been replicated
by other researchers,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.810
but basically what we found
is three clusters of things.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.150
We found qualities that
both men and women wanted

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.940
in a long-term mate.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.490
We found some qualities that
were sex differentiated,

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.580
where women prefer them more than men

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.520
or men prefer them more than women.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.410
And then we found some attributes

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.300
that were highly variable across cultures

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.360
in whether people found these

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.030
as desirable or indispensable
or irrelevant, in a mate.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.110
And so I could give
examples of each of these.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.330
- Yeah, that would be great.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.120
I'd love to know what some
of the common themes were

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.420
across these cultures
in terms of what's being

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.040
mate and sexually select for.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.760
- Yeah, so some of the things that were,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.810
so we talk about universal desires,

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.450
so things that men and women share.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.820
There are things like
intelligence, kindness,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.240
mutual attraction and love,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.160
which is really kind of heartwarming

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.660
because some people think that love

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.400
is a recent western invention
by some European poets,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.630
but it turns out it's not true.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.500
You can go to the Kung San in Botswana,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.470
and they describe pretty
much the same experience

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.220
as a falling in love as we do.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.210
And even describe the distinction

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.760
between this kind of
infatuation stage of love

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.313
and the attachment phase where,

00:16:37.404 --> 00:16:39.330
you can't maintain this frenzy

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.360
of infatuation and
obsession for very long,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.843
six weeks, maybe six months at most,

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:50.200
otherwise you can get nothing
else done in your life.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.423
Those are those dopamine circuits
firing at high frequency.

00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:59.680
- Yeah, so mutual attraction, love,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.723
good health, dependability,

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:05.960
emotional stability,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.720
although there's a bit
of a sex difference there

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.970
with women preferring
it a bit more than men.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.300
And so basically, and
these may seem obvious.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.300
So no one wants a stupid, mean,
ugly, disease-ridden mate.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.060
And so perhaps obvious, but,

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.690
but no one knew this in advance
of the 37 culture study.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.530
So these were some universal preferences.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.237
So you go to the Zulu tribe
in South Africa or, you know,

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.060
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil or

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.293
Portugal or Oslo,

00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:43.830
or anywhere in the world,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.390
and these are qualities that
people universally desire

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.420
in long-term mates.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.350
Sex differences.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.550
So sex differences basically
fell into two clusters.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.940
So women more than men

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.253
prioritized good earning capacity,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.210
slightly older age,

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.330
and the qualities associated
with resource acquisition.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.870
So these are things like
a man's social status.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.423
Does he have drive? Is he ambitious?

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.310
Does he have a good
long-term resource trajectory

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.810
is one way that I like to phrase it,

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.510
because women often they
don't look at necessarily

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.790
the resources that a guy
possesses at this moment,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.210
but what is his trajectory?

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.330
- Just sorry to interrupt, but may I ask,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.140
is there anything known
about the commonalities

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.180
of how that is assessed?

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.670
You know, is it, you know,

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.210
he's rolling out of bed
early in running eight miles,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.130
he's showing proficiency in school,

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.590
he handles himself well
socially at parties,

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.053
isn't drinking too much, but knows when,

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.100
obviously they're
integrating multiple cues,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.550
the brain is a complex place,

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.097
but is there any information

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:03.990
about what those variables
are across cultures?

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.470
- Yeah, well I think that

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.130
there's been less attention to that,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.010
so that's a great question.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.840
One of the things that we
do know across cultures

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.060
is that women attend to
the attention structure.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.200
So the attention structure
is a key determine of status.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.720
So the people who are high in status

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.140
are those to whom the most
people pay the most attention.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.460
- So the attention of others to them,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.260
not how well a given potential mate

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.840
can focus and pay attention, necessarily.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.673
- Yeah, exactly.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:38.870
And, but women look, I mean, you know,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.250
is the guy, even in
the modern environment,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.493
the guy spending eight hours
a day playing video games,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.030
eating Cheetos and drinking beer,

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.193
or is he devoting effort to
his professional development?

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.820
So hard work, ambition.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.050
Does he have clear goals or
is he in an existential crisis

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.300
not knowing what he's
going to do with his life?

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.500
So those are some of the
qualities that people look for.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.770
And also women use

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.850
what's called in the
literature, mate choice copying.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.430
And this is related in part
to the attention structure,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.840
that is, guys who have

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.043
passed the filters of multiple women.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.990
Those are like, pre-approved men.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.640
So we've done studies
where you just take a guy,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.640
photograph him alone
versus, take the same guy,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.150
put an attractive woman next to him,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.970
or put two women next to him,

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.110
and women judge exactly the same guy

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.485
to be much more attractive,

00:20:43.485 --> 00:20:45.920
if he's paired with women,

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.320
then if he's not.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.820
And some guys exploit
this in the modern world

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.340
by hiring wing women to go with
them on dates and so forth,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.483
this is my sister or a former
girlfriend or whatever.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.133
So,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.673
but you're correct in,

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:10.460
in that women use multiple
cues to assess these things,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.203
and they change over time. You know, so,

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.670
in the modern environment,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.810
even when things like
the attention structure,

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.500
does this guy have a
million Twitter followers

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.230
or three Twitter followers.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.790
So that is an index of
the attention structure

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.770
and hence the status of the guy

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.763
within the broader community.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.400
So, and from an evolutionary perspective,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.680
it's reasonable that women
would prioritize these qualities

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.570
because of the tremendous asymmetry

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.590
in our reproductive biology,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.080
namely that fertilization
occurs internally within women,

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.010
not within men,

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.520
women bear the burdens of
the nine month pregnancy,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.690
which is metabolically expensive,

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.460
as well as creating opportunity costs

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.270
in terms of mobility and,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.520
and solving other tasks
that people need to solve

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.710
in the course of their lives.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.300
And so one way to phrase
that is that the costs

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.170
of making a bad mate choice
are much heavier for women

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.420
when it comes to sexual
behavior certainly,

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.370
because, and the benefits correspondingly

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.780
of making a wise mate choice

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.420
are higher for women
in the sexual context.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.330
But as I said, we have mutual
mate choice in our species.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.523
And so what do men value more than women?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.833
Physical attractiveness.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.410
- They ranked that as a
more important criteria

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.800
than do women about men?

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.130
- Yes, exactly.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.260
- Consistently across cultures?

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.520
- Consistently, and it's not that women

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.490
are indifferent to it.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.750
So women do pay attention to
a guy's physical appearance,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.360
his fitness and so forth,

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.300
and guys are actually off base

00:22:56.507 --> 00:22:59.430
in thinking that women
prefer more muscular men

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.810
than they actually do.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.350
So like in muscle magazines,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.380
these men with bulging
biceps and so forth,

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.720
women don't find that especially,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.080
but they do prioritize fit men,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.810
a good shoulder to hip ratio

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.160
and other qualities of
physical appearance,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.497
as well as things like cues to health.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.470
So physical appearance provides
a wealth of information

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.740
about a person's health status,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.370
but also provides for men
a wealth of information

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.100
about a woman's fertility,
her reproductive value.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.070
Now not that men think
about that consciously.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.210
I mean, men don't walk down the street

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.840
and see a woman and say,
oh, I find her attractive

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.760
because I think she must be very fertile.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.310
Maybe a few weird people do that,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.350
but most men just it's like,

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.950
they just find those cues attractive.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.610
And the cues are cues
associated with youth and health

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.640
because we know that youth
is a very powerful cue

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.320
to fertility and reproductive value.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.887
So men prioritize physical appearance,

00:23:59.887 --> 00:24:02.370
and in the field of psychology,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.890
I was taught when I was an undergraduate

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.150
that you can't judge a book by its cover,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.940
that physical attractiveness
was infinitely arbitrary,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.370
infinitely culturally variable.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.730
And it's simply not true.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.280
We know now based on the last 20 years

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.880
of scientific studies,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.650
that the cues that men
find attractive women

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.610
are not at all arbitrary.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.080
There is some variation across cultures,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.823
like in relative
plumpness versus thinness,

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.620
but things like clear skin,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.593
clear eyes, symmetrical features,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.723
a low waist to hip ratio,

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.520
full lips, lustrous hair,

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.830
all these are qualities that
are associated with youth

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.600
and health, and hence have heavy evolved

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.391
to be part of our standards
of attractiveness.

00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:57.570
And so, it's not just that men

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.350
are these superficial creatures

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.940
who evaluate women on
the basis of appearance,

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.503
there is an underlying
logic to why they do so.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.270
And as I said, relative youth,

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.620
this age thing is one of
the largest sex differences

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.860
that you find in long-term mate selection,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.630
with women preferring somewhat older men,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.240
and men preferring somewhat younger women.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.730
Is there a consistent age gap

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.480
to relate to that statement?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.810
- Yes, there is.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:30.810
So the age gap though depends
on the age of the man.

00:25:31.412 --> 00:25:34.790
So, we can document this,

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.740
so in my studies,

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.380
what we found is that men preferred women

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.690
who were about three to four years

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.360
younger than they were on average.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.930
And I'll qualify this in a second.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.711
Women preferred guys who were about

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:49.370
three and a half to four
and a half years older

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.203
than they were.

00:25:50.203 --> 00:25:51.130
So there was a sex difference

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.883
going in the opposite direction.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.830
But as men get older,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.880
they prefer women who are

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.430
increasingly younger than they are.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.770
So one way to gauge this,

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.830
so there are actual marriage statistics,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.900
and then there are expressed preferences,

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.040
and both sexes kind of converge.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.440
So if you look at, you
know, first marriage,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.040
second marriage, third marriage,

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.220
if people get divorced and remarried.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.970
Average age gap is, in America anyway,

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.650
is three years at first marriage

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.113
with the guys being older,

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.140
five years at second marriage,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.093
and eight years at third marriage.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.050
So that is, as men are getting older

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.700
and getting divorced and remarried,

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.640
they are marrying women

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.150
who are increasingly
younger than they are.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.940
In terms of preferences,

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.030
it's also expressed in preferences.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.110
So it doesn't go down, so like a,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.410
say a 25-year-old man would say,

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.250
prefer a woman who's
20 or in her early 20s,

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.480
35-year-old man might prefer a woman

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.993
who's in her late 20s or early 30s.

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:02.270
A 50-year-old man might prefer a woman

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.953
who is say, 35 to 38.

00:27:05.908 --> 00:27:09.090
So the preferences do go up,

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.940
but the gap gets increasingly larger.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.440
And the reason that you
don't see things like,

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.170
why aren't men preferring women?

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.953
So peak fertility in humans
is around age 24, 25.

00:27:22.317 --> 00:27:23.310
And so you say, well,

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.150
why aren't the 60-year-old men

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.540
prioritizing 25-year-old women?

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.180
Well, as I mentioned,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.897
it's a reciprocal mutual
mate choice phenomenon.

00:27:34.897 --> 00:27:36.790
- She constraints the equation.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:37.960
- Well, she constrains it,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.080
but also a marriage and long-term mating

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.810
are things other than reproductive unions

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:45.970
in the modern environment.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:46.803
That is they're,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.020
you know, you're supposed
to do things as a couple.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.150
And if you get too large an age gap,

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.450
then essentially you're
in different cultures.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.063
You grow up with different songs,

00:28:01.185 --> 00:28:02.840
and if the cultural gap gets too large,

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.214
you don't understand each other.

00:28:05.214 --> 00:28:07.770
So, there are constraints on that,

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.170
but if you look at contexts

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.610
where there are no
constraints of that sort,

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:17.610
so historically kings,
emperors, despots, et cetera,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.373
and I'll give one more modern example,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.520
they basically prefer young,
fertile, attractive females.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.840
And if they have harems,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.390
they stock the harems with those,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.820
and then circulate them out
when they're 30, and so forth.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.560
And so if you look at marriage systems

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.073
that are unconstrained,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.240
the preferences are more
likely to be revealed,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.180
or within cultures.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.440
That is, if you look at men

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.040
who were in a position
to get what they want.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.500
So as Mick Jagger noted,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.960
you can't always get what you want,

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.100
but if you try sometimes,
you get what you need.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.750
- I hear that most of the
time he got what he needed,

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.067
- He got what he wanted,
and maybe what he needed,

00:29:01.067 --> 00:29:03.280
but he was in a position.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.030
I don't know if he still is,
he's in his seventies now,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.550
but he was in a position
as was, let's say,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.010
Rod Stewart, to take another
example, or Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.570
If you were a male who's in a position

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.720
where there are thousands of women

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.970
potentially available to you,
and you can have your pick,

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:26.070
then you see that clearer
expression for younger females.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.880
There was a chart that was
floating around the internet

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.880
of the girlfriends of Leonardo
DiCaprio as he got older.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.780
And as he's getting older and older,

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.120
and the graph of the
age of his girlfriends,

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.470
it basically stayed the same,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.830
it was in the early twenties or so.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.273
- He values consistency.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.033
- Consistency.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.360
But, so anyway, the data converge on that.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.260
So these are universal sex differences

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.430
in long-term mate selection.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.497
So now when we shift to,

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:02.540
and I should mention cultural variability,

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.620
because that's a critical thing,

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.660
because there is in my 37 culture study,

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.110
what I found was the
preference for virginity,

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.390
that is no prior sexual experience,

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.350
that was the most variable
desire across cultures.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:23.350
So you had cultures, like at
the time of the study, China,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:28.990
it was basically indispensable
that a partner be a virgin.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.470
And then at the other end,

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.220
you have Sweden where
Swedes typically place

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.337
close to zero value on it,

00:30:35.337 --> 00:30:37.690
and some even find it undesirable.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.310
Like, you're weird if you're a virgin.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.450
And so you have this whole spectrum.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.763
- This is virginity in the
female, or is this also,

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.310
in China was it preference

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.070
that the male and the female be virgins?

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.580
It's a mutual mate a selection?

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.680
- Yeah, it was a
preference for both sexes.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.900
- Interesting.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.550
- But it's a good question,

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.740
because where there was a sex difference,

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.330
it was always in the direction

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.750
of males preferring
virginity more than females,

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.610
and we've gone back to China.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.150
So I still do research in
China among other places.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:13.480
And we've gone back and retested
modern urban populations,

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.820
and the importance of virginity
has gone down in China,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.670
especially in the urban areas,

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.650
and the sex difference
that didn't exist before,

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.010
has now emerged, where males
value it more than females.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:30.160
And I think part of it
was in previous times,

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.450
you hit ceiling effects, you
know, where both sexes say,

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:36.733
yeah, it's absolutely
important to be a Virgin.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.310
So, there's cultural variation
and cultural change over time

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.013
in some of these qualities.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.190
But the sex differences that I described

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.480
have remained invariant over the years.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.500
So since my 37 culture study,

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.040
this has been replicated in,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.783
at least a couple of
dozen different cultures,

00:31:58.783 --> 00:32:01.030
and we've gone back to
some of the cultures.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:06.030
So I mentioned, we've gone back
to China, Brazil, and India,

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.560
to look at cultural changes over time,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.720
and there have been,
you know, in some cases,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.070
dramatic cultural changes over time.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.140
But the sex differences that
I described are invariant.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.520
They haven't changed a bit.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.940
- I'd be remiss if I didn't ask

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.620
about truth telling and deception,

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.350
because some of the measures
that you're describing,

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.350
age, for instance, one can
potentially lie about, right?

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.560
I'm guessing that there are people

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.233
who do that on online
profiles and whatnot.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.840
From what I understand,

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.040
people also lie about
height and other features

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.120
on online profiles,

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.750
but some of them are much
harder to hide, right?

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:49.210
Eventually the truth comes out about some,

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:50.670
if not all of these things.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.300
So, if you would,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.410
could you tell us about how men and women

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.930
leverage deception versus truth telling

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.310
and communicating some of the things

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.960
around mate choice selection?

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.793
- Yeah, well,

00:33:04.793 --> 00:33:09.060
so basically both men
and women do deceive,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.840
so we have the modern cultural
invention of online dating,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.130
which, you know,

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.020
was little-used 10 years ago,

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.513
and virtually absent 20 years ago.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.210
And people do lie, but they
lie in predictable ways.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.710
They lie in ways that attempt to embody

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.700
the mate preferences of the person

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.090
they're trying to attract.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.050
And so men do lie.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.610
They deceive about their
income, their status.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.783
So they exaggerate their
income by about 20%.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.600
They tack on about two
inches to their height.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.163
So if they're five ten,
they round up to six feet.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.170
So they don't like, if they're five ten,

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.150
they don't say that they're gigantic,

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.150
but they kind of round it up

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.373
in the more desirable direction.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.980
Women tend to deceive about weight.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.320
So they tend to shave about 15 pounds

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.560
off of their reported weight,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.550
and both sexes post photos that
are not truly representative

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.980
of what they actually look like.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.430
So they might post photos
of themselves when they were

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:18.493
younger, or they're even advice,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.710
tips on how to create the best
selfie, of the best angle,

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.400
that will maximally, you know,
enhance what you look like.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.010
- Or just doctoring of
photos I'm guessing.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.460
- Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:39.390
And one of the things about
it now, you say, well,

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:42.800
do people find out, of
course, people do find out.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.210
I'll just give you one story
about a colleague of mine,

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.150
who is a male, who's
doing internet dating.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:53.020
And he picked only women
who self-described as sevens

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.850
on the one to seven on attractiveness.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:58.180
So the most attractive, as self-reported,

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.600
and se he went out with this one woman,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.510
and she was missing her front teeth.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.500
And he said, well, call me picky,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.510
but missing her front teeth.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.050
And she thinks she's like
the top of attractiveness,

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.830
he was a little disappointed about that.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.860
And women of course are disappointed,

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.320
they meet a guy who they
think is this physically fit,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.050
you know, athletic guy,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.340
and he comes up he's, you know,
300 pounds and overweight.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.819
So people do find out.

00:35:27.819 --> 00:35:31.310
And there are some
internet dating sites have

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.660
kind of a vetting of the
accuracy of something.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.100
So some things you can look
up through public records,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.590
and does this guy have a
criminal record, for example,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:47.590
is he on a, you know, a
sexual offenders website?

00:35:49.846 --> 00:35:51.670
So there's some things you can verify.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.573
But what I tell people is,

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.470
you really have to meet the
person and interact, you know,

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.000
because in part because of the deception,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.010
but also because what
happens with internet dating

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:07.930
is that the photograph tends to overwhelm

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.040
all the other cues and all the other cues

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.610
are written statements.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:17.200
And we weren't really evolved
to process written statements,

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.743
but we were evolved to
respond to physical cues, but,

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.420
and men tend to attend to the visual cues

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.590
much more than women.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.490
So women in their mate selection,

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.890
they have olfactory cues to
what does the guy sound like?

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.283
His vocal qualities,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.980
that's auditory cues,

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.330
but olfactory cues,
what does he smell like?

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.080
And so women have a more acute
sense of smell than men do.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.690
And so if the guy doesn't smell right,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.970
even if he embodies all these
other qualities women want,

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.093
that's a deal breaker.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.730
And so I encourage people just, you know,

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.340
stop with a hundred texts
back and forth or messaging,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.380
and meet a person for a
cup of coffee and interact.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.670
And then you'll, you know,

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:09.940
you'll get a more accurate
bead on the person.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.930
And then of course, some
qualities you can't assess

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.170
even with a half-hour
interaction, you can tell a lot,

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.090
but things like emotional stability,

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:22.880
or things that have to
be assessed over time.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.600
And so one of the things
that I advise people to do,

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.220
and I'm not in the advice-giving business,

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.029
but people ask me all the time.

00:37:30.029 --> 00:37:32.630
If they find out what I
study, they say, well,

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.240
I got this problem,
can you give me advice?

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.510
But one of the things to assess,

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.490
things like emotional stability,

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.810
which is absolutely critical
in long-term mating,

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.910
is to do something like
go on a trip together,

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.430
take a vacation where you're

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:51.250
even in an unfamiliar environment where

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.039
you have to cope with things
that you're not familiar with.

00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:57.170
And as opposed to an environment

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.820
where it's very predictable,

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.290
and so you get a greater exposure,

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:06.290
because one of the hallmarks
of emotional instability

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.550
is how they respond to stress.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.870
So emotionally unstable people
tend to have a long latency

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.500
to return to baseline
after a stressful event.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.460
And so this is the sort of information

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.720
you can't get on a coffee date,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.520
you can only get by
assessing it over time.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.530
- Somebody whose laboratory studies stress

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.203
and tools to combat stress.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.010
That's great, it's yet
more incentive for people

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.913
to develop self-regulatory
mechanisms for themselves.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.230
I'm guessing many of the
features of deception

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.860
in this context were present
long before internet dating.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.363
And so is it, it's somewhat
dark to think about, but is,

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.640
is deception built into this dance

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.770
that we call mate selection?

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.208
And has it been built in for a long time,

00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:02.190
or is this something that
you think has emerged more

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.840
as people are approaching each other

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.110
through these electronic,
web-based mediums?

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.540
- I mean, some forms of
deception have been there

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.920
for a long time over human
evolutionary history.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.040
So one form of deception,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.700
which we haven't mentioned is deception

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.090
about whether you're interested

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.790
in a long-term committed relationship

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.160
or a short-term hookup.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.630
And so there's deception about that,

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.070
especially on the part of men.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.240
So men who were
interested, like on Tinder,

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.210
it has been reported,
although Tinder denies this,

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.690
there's been reported that something like

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.560
30% of the men on Tinder,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.610
are either married or in
long-term committed relationships,

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.680
and they're looking for
something on the side, but

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.820
in terms of successfully
attracting a mate,

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.140
the overt display that,

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.655
hey I'm interested in
just a short-term hookup.

00:39:54.655 --> 00:39:57.590
I'm interested in sex, so I
want to have sex right now.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.740
Let's just go back to my apartment.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.120
These are very ineffective tactics.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.500
And so effective tactics for
men are often displaying cues

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.260
to long-term interests.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.090
And so, and of course
that's effective for a woman

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.153
who's seeking a long-term interest.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.240
And so, that's a deception.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.410
So we find in our studies of deception,

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.110
that men tend to exaggerate

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.100
the depths of their feelings for a woman,

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.180
exaggerate how similar they are,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.280
and how aligned they are in their values

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.230
and religious orientations

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.193
and political values and so forth.

00:40:34.275 --> 00:40:37.300
And so, I think there's
deception around that,

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.380
and I think that's
probably an evolutionarily

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.160
recurrent form of deception

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.340
that women have defenses
against by the way.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.890
But I think that modern internet dating

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.630
opens the door for certain
types of deception,

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.930
that were at a minimum,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.660
more difficult to accomplish ancestrally.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:01.110
So like things like
Photoshopping, you know,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.793
wasn't available back then.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.240
plus we evolved in the
context of small group living,

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.910
where you not only had

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.970
your own personal observations
of someone's qualities,

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.460
you had also your relatives, your friends,

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.387
allies, the social
reputation that someone had.

00:41:21.387 --> 00:41:24.390
And these are all critical
sources of information

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.150
that are less available
in modern environments

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.300
because, you know, people migrate,

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.313
they move from place to place.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:38.470
They can close down one internet
profile and put up another,

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.400
or that could have six
going simultaneously.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.310
So the modern environment
opens up the door

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:48.500
for forms of deception
that weren't available

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.490
or weren't available to the
same degree, ancestrally.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.080
- I see.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.133
Very interesting.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.380
Would you mind touching
on some of the features

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.960
that are selected for,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.420
in terms of sexual partner choice?

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.480
We talked a little bit about mate choice,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.600
but in terms of sexual partner choice,

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.590
are there any good studies exploring

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.310
what people are selecting for,

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.198
or is it that they are
both just in a state

00:42:19.198 --> 00:42:22.510
of pure hypothalamic drive?

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.534
I'm a neuroscientist, after all.

00:42:24.534 --> 00:42:27.820
And therefore it's hard to
recreate in the laboratory.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.653
- Well, no, no.

00:42:28.653 --> 00:42:30.060
We do know something about that,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.750
and we know something
about how the preferences

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.440
for a sex partner differ

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.800
from preference for a long-term mate.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.020
There is overlap of course,

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.700
but one thing is physical appearance.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.150
So physical appearance for women

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.220
is important in long-term mating,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.260
not as important as it is for men,

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.290
but it becomes more important
in short-term mating.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.810
And so it is the guy good-looking?

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.403
So those physical attributes
are more important for women.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.080
They are, they remain important for men,

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.160
physical appearance in short-term mating,

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.980
but with the footnote that men are willing

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.290
to drop their standards
in short-term mating,

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:20.290
if it's low commitment,
low risk, just sex,

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.133
without entangling commitments.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:30.200
Women are more likely to prioritize

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.080
what I call bad boy qualities.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.070
So guys who are very self-confident,

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:42.010
guys who are strut, guys
who are a little arrogant,

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:46.620
guys who are risk-taking,
guys who defy conventions,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.020
women are more attracted to those guys

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.023
in short-term mating
than long-term mating.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.850
And whereas in long-term mating,

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:57.150
they go more for the good dad qualities.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.550
Is this guy dependable?

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.803
Is he going to be a good
father to my children?

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.560
And then also in short-term mating

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.560
women use that mate-copying a heuristic.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.030
That is, if there are
thousands of other women

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:17.040
who find him attractive,
women find him attractive.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.000
And so that's why you have
the groupie phenomenon.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.460
So, with the rock stars, for example,

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.500
there are thousands of screaming women,

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.600
all of whom want to sleep
with this famous rock star.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.140
And they use that as
information they find,

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.550
if you took like a still photo
of some of these rock stars

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.000
and asked women how attractive the guy is,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.550
versus tell 'em he's a famous rock star

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.320
and showed the thousands
of women screaming at him,

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.703
that they judge him entirely differently,

00:44:45.671 --> 00:44:47.743
in terms of his attractiveness.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.920
So even, and this is an important point

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:58.000
that women's attraction to
men is more context specific,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.893
and varies more across contexts,

00:45:00.893 --> 00:45:03.460
than men's attraction to women.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.360
And so I'll give you
just an example of that.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.030
This is a female colleague
of mine went to a conference,

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.260
an academic conference,

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.050
and she found the organizer
of this conference

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.330
to be really attractive,

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.630
and then saw him six
months later and wondered,

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.570
well, what was I thinking?

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.530
He doesn't seem very attractive at all.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.580
And what it was is when
he was the organizer,

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.550
he was at the center of
the attention structure.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.090
You know, he was the guy up
on stage directing everybody

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:31.920
and everyone was attending to him.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.820
And then when he was
just a normal presenter

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.100
at a conference,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.620
he didn't command the attention structure

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.840
like he did when he was the organizer.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.780
And so this is just an illustration of how

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.700
circumstance-dependent women's
mate attraction is for guys.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.040
It depends on, you know, his status,

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.310
the number of women that
are attracted to him,

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.530
the attention structure,

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.750
how he interacts with a puppy, or a baby.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.840
If he's ignoring a baby in distress

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.883
or positively interacting
with a young child.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.690
All these things, whereas for
men, it almost doesn't matter.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.310
Context is more irrelevant.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:19.240
They're honing in on the
specific psychophysical cues

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.210
that the woman is displaying,
and context be damned.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.273
- Very interesting.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:31.453
Let's talk about infidelity
in committed relationships.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:37.373
What are some of the consistent
findings around reasons for,

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.380
and maybe even long-term
consequences of infidelity

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.050
for men and women, and
this could be marriage,

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.870
or long-term partnership, or, you know,

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:50.381
infidelity of any kind, I suppose.

00:46:50.381 --> 00:46:51.781
I'm guessing it does happen.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.130
How frequent is it?

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.840
- Yeah, that's the interesting thing.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.800
Well, how frequent it is,

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.260
is difficult to gauge because,

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.740
it's one of the forms of human conduct

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.303
that people like to keep secret.

00:47:07.303 --> 00:47:11.300
So, if you go back now say 70 years

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.700
to the classic Kinsey studies,

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.960
the questions about infidelity

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.790
were the questions that most
people refused to answer.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.800
And when the question was brought up,

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.217
caused more people to
drop out of the study.

00:47:24.217 --> 00:47:26.660
And so that kind of tells
you something that, I mean,

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.450
what do people conceal?

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:31.430
You know, infidelity, incest, murder,

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.413
there is a small handful of things

00:47:33.413 --> 00:47:35.760
that people universally want to conceal,

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.383
and infidelity is one of them.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:39.690
So, but people do it.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:43.650
And so Kinsey estimated
26% of married women

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.300
committed an infidelity at some
point during their marriage,

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.380
and about 50% of men.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.150
Other studies have given lower figures.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:55.550
And so the exact figures
bounce around, depending on,

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.280
you know, anonymity provided

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.010
and how comfortable they are

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.997
with the interviewer and so forth.

00:48:00.997 --> 00:48:02.525
- And by infidelity,

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:04.580
does that mean intercourse
with somebody else?

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.700
So we're not talking about quote
unquote, emotional affairs.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.910
We're talking about just sex with somebody

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.520
other than their committed partner

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.660
unbeknownst to their partner.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.493
- Right, right.

00:48:14.493 --> 00:48:15.810
And there are other forms of infidelity,

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:16.820
which we could get into,

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.330
including emotional infidelity
and financial infidelity.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.040
But here, we're just talking about,

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.340
for the moment, sexual infidelity.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.240
And the interesting thing
about sexual infidelity

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.870
is that the sexes really
differ fundamentally

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:36.500
in the motives for committing infidelity.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.330
So for men, the primary motive,

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.170
and these are on average sex differences.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.890
So whenever I talk about sex differences,

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.330
I'm talking about on
average sex differences,

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:50.013
cause there's overlap
in the distributions.

00:48:51.812 --> 00:48:54.763
So these are generalizations
of which there are exceptions.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:00.830
So for men, it's mainly a
matter of sexual variety.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.950
So about 70% of the men,

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.720
it's the opportunity presented itself,

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.540
I was out of town and
I had this opportunity.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:13.240
So low risk, low cost
pursuit of sexual variety,

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.440
sexual novelty, is a
key motivation for men.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.570
- Sorry to interrupt.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:22.570
So 70% of men that cheat
that's the primary cause,

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.010
or is it that 70% of men do cheat?

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:27.624
- No, no, no.

00:49:27.624 --> 00:49:29.820
Of the men who cheat, 70%,

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.380
thank you for that clarification,

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.603
of the men who do cheat 70%
cite that as the key motive,

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.289
the key reason why they
committed an infidelity.

00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:41.040
- Sort of like why mountain
climbers climb mountains,

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.060
because they're there?

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:42.893
- Right, right.

00:49:42.893 --> 00:49:43.726
Because they're there,

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.070
the comedian, I think
it was Chris Rock said,

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.290
men are only as faithful
as their opportunity.

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:54.010
- Or how available their
password on their phone is

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.040
to their partner.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.510
- Right, right.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.493
So, but, and that's an exaggeration,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.660
but if you look at women, this
just desire for pure novelty,

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.713
sexual variety, is much less of a motive,

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.600
but women who have affairs

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.770
cite that they're unhappy with
their primary relationship,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.070
emotionally unhappy, or sexually unhappy,

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.660
and typically both.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.470
And this may seem like
totally obvious that,

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.303
well, of course,

00:50:26.303 --> 00:50:27.777
people if they're
unhappy in a relationship

00:50:27.777 --> 00:50:29.820
are more likely to stray,

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.340
but in fact, it's not true for men.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.700
So if you compare men who are
happy with their marriage,

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.540
and men who are not happy
with their marriage,

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.000
there's no difference in
their infidelity rates.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.430
And I think it goes down
to that issue of, you know,

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.660
motive for seeking variety.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.513
So now why do women do it?

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.770
Because it's a risky endeavor.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.950
She risks her long-term mate
or losing her long-term mate.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:51:00.423
It's risky in terms of
reputational damage for both sexes.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.333
So it's a risky thing.

00:51:02.333 --> 00:51:03.683
Why do women do it?

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:09.660
And there are two competing
hypotheses, at least two,

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.050
but there are two primary
competing hypotheses

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.850
in the evolutionary literature.

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:16.740
One is called the dual
mating strategy hypothesis,

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.640
where women are seeking to
get resources and investment

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.303
from one guy and good
genes from another guy.

00:51:25.308 --> 00:51:28.620
And in principle that can work.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.490
And I initially this wasn't a
hypothesis original with me.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:35.280
This is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.500
and some others, Marty Hazelton,
a former student of mine,

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.920
have advocated this dual
mating strategy hypothesis.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.750
And originally I was endorsed it,

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.847
because the data seemed to support it,

00:51:47.847 --> 00:51:50.770
and we can get into which
data seemed to support it.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.840
But over time I became
more and more dubious

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.010
about this hypothesis,

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.900
and instead have advocated

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.730
what I call the mate switching hypothesis.

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:05.250
And so if you look at a
whole host of information

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.420
around why women have affairs,

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.720
it's not compatible

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.860
with the dual mating strategy hypothesis.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.450
So, and is compatible
with the mate switching,

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:18.720
that is, women who are looking to either

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.520
divest themselves from
an existing mateship,

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.820
or trade up in the mating market to a mate

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:30.650
who's more compatible with
them or higher in mate value,

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.590
or simply see whether they're
sufficiently desirable,

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.500
so that it eases the transition
into the mating pool,

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.950
or keeping a mate made as
a potential backup mate,

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.190
what I call mate insurance.

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:47.466
You have car insurance if
something bad happens to your car,

00:52:47.466 --> 00:52:49.230
house insurance,

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.772
we also have mate insurance, you know.

00:52:51.772 --> 00:52:54.910
One women said, men are like soup,

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:57.260
you always want to have
one on the back burner.

00:52:59.852 --> 00:53:03.250
So, whether that's the
best analogy or not,

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:07.520
I'm not sure, but it kind
of captures something,

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.560
about why so, well, what
evidence am I talking about?

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.000
Well, for one thing,
women who have affairs,

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.653
and this is about 70% of them.

00:53:16.772 --> 00:53:19.143
- Again, sorry, just, I want to make sure.

00:53:19.143 --> 00:53:21.360
Of women who have affairs.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.290
- So let's say, ballpark,

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.870
Kinsey was, let's say roughly right,

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.710
25-26% of women will have affairs.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.350
Let's just assume that he's right.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.233
And we don't know exactly,

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.670
but of the women who do have affairs,

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.560
about 70% say they have fallen in love

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.050
with their affair partner.

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:43.110
They become deeply emotionally involved

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.653
with their affair partner.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:46.910
And to me,

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:50.670
if you're just trying to
get good genes from a guy,

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.290
that is the last thing you want to do

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.790
is fall in love with them
or get emotionally involved,

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:58.823
but it's very compatible if
you want to switch mates.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:04.180
And so that's sort of,
that's one piece of evidence

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.853
that suggests that women,

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.920
the mate switching function of infidelity

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.250
is a more likely explanation.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.180
Now, these two are not inherently
incompatible hypotheses.

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.290
In other words,

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.540
it's possible that some women

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.160
do pursue a dual mating
strategy hypothesis,

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.700
but there's other evidence that suggests,

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.533
so for example,

00:54:25.533 --> 00:54:29.220
what are the actual rates
of genetic cuckoldry?

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.640
Well in the modern environment
anyway, they're pretty low.

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.770
It turns out they're like 2-3%.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.110
- Could you just explain for the audience

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.380
what genetic cuckoldry is?

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.510
- So this is where the woman,

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:44.010
where the man believes he is
the genetic father of a child,

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.570
but it turns out he's not,

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.410
might be the mailman or
the next door neighbor

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.100
or the guy she's having an affair with.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.600
So mistaken paternity

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:59.460
and genetic cuckoldry is
just one way to capture it.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.280
- Named after the cuckoo bird, right?

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.890
- Named after the cuckoo bird, yeah.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.940
- Who sneaks its eggs into
the nest of the other,

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.090
destroys the future offspring of the bird,

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:12.790
and then basically offloads
all the work onto another.

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:13.690
- Right.
- Father.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:16.920
- Parasitizes, yeah
the parental investment

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.483
of different bird species.

00:55:22.004 --> 00:55:22.970
So anyway,

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:23.827
so I think that,

00:55:23.827 --> 00:55:27.170
and there's other sources of
evidence that I think points,

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:28.810
so one of the sources of evidence

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:31.380
that initially seemed to support

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.350
the dual mating strategy
hypothesis was ovulation shifts.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:37.803
So in other words,

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.750
it looked like from the early studies

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:42.230
that when women are ovulating,

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:45.200
these are among non-pill-taking women,

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.530
women not on hormonal contraceptives,

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:49.520
that they experienced a preference shift

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.790
toward more men who were
masculine and symmetrical,

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:57.460
which were hypothesized
markers for good genes.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.733
And there's an explanation for that,

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:03.290
but it turns out the effects of ovulation

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:05.750
on women's mate preferences are far weaker

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.940
than the initial studies looked like.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:09.773
And in fact,

00:56:09.773 --> 00:56:10.840
some larger scale studies

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.250
have failed to replicate them entirely.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:18.140
And so that was one of the
key sources of evidence.

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.380
These ovulation shifts

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:21.190
that women were going after the genes,

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.320
because it's only when she's ovulating,

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.920
and she can get pregnant by
having sex with another man

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.170
that it would make sense for her

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:32.030
to have sex with another man.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:34.010
And there was even some early evidence

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.290
that women were timing their affairs,

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.250
timing sex with their affair partners

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.216
to coincide with when they were ovulating.

00:56:42.216 --> 00:56:43.240
But, as I said,

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.610
some of these subsequent studies

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.380
have failed to replicate
these early findings,

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:51.220
calling into question the
dual mating strategy notion.

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:54.593
And so I've shifted my views on this,

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.550
and now endorse the mate
switching hypothesis

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:01.267
as a more likely explanation

00:57:01.267 --> 00:57:04.010
for why most women have affairs.

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:07.113
- The way you describe
this makes me wonder if,

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.550
of the women that have affairs,

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.070
do those affairs tend
to be more long lasting

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:14.460
than the affairs that men have,

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:15.460
because the way you describe it,

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.920
as men are seizing an opportunity

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.970
to sort of a carpe diem
type approach to infidelity,

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.190
and women potentially on average,

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.900
are capitalizing on something
that is longer term.

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.920
Now, of course, if they're
doing this around ovulation,

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.630
then it would constrain
the amount of times

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:34.640
they would need to see or have sex with

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:38.150
this other person that
they're not married to.

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:39.420
But is there any evidence

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.420
that women have more ongoing affairs

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.140
and men have more transient affairs?

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.080
- Yeah, there is.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:49.140
And so if you look at
people who have affairs,

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.840
there's a sex difference there.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.920
So that women tend to have
affairs with one person,

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.280
and become emotionally involved

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.440
with that one person over time.

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.410
Men who have affairs tend to have affairs

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:04.170
with a larger number of affair partners.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:07.730
And so, which then by definition,
can't be long lasting.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:09.390
You can't have long-term affairs

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:10.880
with six different partners.

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.260
- Unless he's juggling multiple
phone accounts or something.

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.093
- Right, right.

00:58:16.093 --> 00:58:17.160
And some men try to do that,

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.320
but I think it could be very taxing.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.237
- Yeah, and in this day and age,

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.550
it's easier to meet more people

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:28.590
by virtue of online communications,

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:30.530
but it's also easier to get caught,

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:33.750
meaning it's harder to
conceal interactions.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.120
Everything's in the cloud anyway.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:35.953
A good friend of mine

00:58:35.953 --> 00:58:39.070
who is former very high
level in special operations,

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:43.140
said anything that's not in
your head and only in your head

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.623
is available for others to
find, should they want it,

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.170
and I think that's largely true.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.083
- Yeah so,

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.690
phone information, text messages,

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:56.900
and people are very good
at hacking into their

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.210
partners' phones, computers.

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:01.090
And then also there are
video cameras everywhere.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.630
So sneaking off to this
quiet restaurant, I mean,

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:07.610
there are probably eight video cameras

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:11.510
that can record you walking
in and out of that restaurant.

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:12.943
- Everything can be found.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.000
I'm certain of that.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.080
You mentioned emotional affairs

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.453
and financial infidelity, as well.

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.490
I had a girlfriend once who,

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:26.500
as a early date discussion said,

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.220
not that I get the
impression that you are,

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.530
but I want to be very clear.

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:33.420
She said, that you are not emotionally,

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.160
physically or financially
tied to any other women.

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.570
And I thought it was very interesting

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:39.700
that now you bring up
financial infidelity.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:44.700
She's quite happily partnered
now and not with me, but,

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.350
but it's interesting, it's the first time

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:48.420
I heard anyone spell it
out that way as a list,

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.270
almost like specific aims in a grant.

00:59:52.342 --> 00:59:53.680
What is emotional infidelity?

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.610
What is financial infidelity?

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:56.443
- Yeah, yeah.

00:59:56.443 --> 00:59:58.117
Well, this is a very smart woman,

00:59:58.117 --> 00:59:59.453
she tapped into all three.

01:00:00.659 --> 01:00:04.000
So, and I assumed you
gave honest responses

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.710
to all of those three questions.

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:08.273
- As I recall I did, but as we now know,

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:10.760
you can ask her at some point.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.593
- Right, right.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:15.960
- And there is self deception
in the service of deception

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.970
that is another issue.

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:20.360
So emotional infidelity is basically

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.960
exactly what it sounds like.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.800
It's falling in love with someone else,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.200
becoming psychologically
close to someone else,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.200
sharing intimate or private
information with someone else.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.780
That's what I mean by
emotional infidelity.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.850
And one of the hallmarks of this

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.290
is a study done by a
former student of mine,

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:42.730
Barry Cooley, it was
very clever I thought.

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:44.580
He analyzed, there used to be

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.220
this reality TV show called Cheaters,

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.800
where they would hire detectives,

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.250
and they would, when the
detective would like,

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.190
say follow someone to a hotel room,

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:57.200
they'd call up the partner and say,

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.160
your husband just walked
into the hotel room

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.310
with someone else.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:04.330
Would you like to come down
to the hotel and confront him?

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:07.370
And a certain percentage
of people would confront,

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.710
and what he analyzed,

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.480
so he analyzed all these episodes

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.790
of this show called Cheaters.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:16.230
And what he examined was
the verbal interrogations

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:18.390
when people confronted their partners.

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:20.920
And when men confronted their partners,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.370
the first question they want to know is,

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:24.333
did you fuck him?

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.560
Women, their first question
was, do you love her?

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.450
And so this kind of
captures that difference

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:35.070
between sexual infidelity
and emotional infidelity,

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.370
and also kind of captures
another sex difference

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.590
when it comes to sexual
jealousy, you know,

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.630
where men tend to be more focused

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:46.610
on the sexual components
of the infidelity,

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:51.610
because those are what compromise
his paternity certainty,

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.220
his certainty that he's
actually the genetic father

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.860
of whatever offspring ensue,

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:03.170
whereas love is a cue to, do you love her?

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:06.250
That's a cue that he's going
to leave you, the woman,

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:09.230
for another woman,

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:10.063
as a cue that,

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:13.020
to the long-term loss of that investment

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.763
and commitment from that partner.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:18.200
And so the sexes seem to differ

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:22.230
in which aspects of the infidelity,

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.290
with women were attuned
to or more upset by

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:26.710
the emotional infidelity,

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.470
men, more by the sexual infidelity.

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:32.933
Now, financial infidelity
has been explored much less,

01:02:32.933 --> 01:02:35.930
but in my new book, When Men Behave Badly,

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:38.460
I have a section on financial infidelity,

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.380
where I summarize all the
research that has been done.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:45.100
And I was kind of flabbergasted
by the percentage of people

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.650
who do things like have credit cards

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.550
that their spouse doesn't know about,

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.590
keep secret bank accounts,

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.890
have the credit card bills
mailed to their office

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.960
rather than their home,

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.890
have basically resources and expenditures

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:04.610
of pooled resources that
they keep from their partner,

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:06.003
and both sexes do it.

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:10.090
And the percentages vary
from study to study,

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:13.550
but they range from like
30 to 60% of all people

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:16.600
who are keeping financial information

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.080
from their spouse in one way or another.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.290
It could be the woman's
out buying designer purses,

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:23.793
or designer handbags.

01:03:25.181 --> 01:03:28.300
It could be the guys
out going to strip clubs

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:32.000
or taking his affair
partner to restaurants,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.020
and doesn't want those charges
to show up on, you know,

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.590
a jointly held credit card.

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:40.390
So financial infidelity is critical.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:44.380
And then even things like
diverting pooled resources

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.300
to one set of genetic
relatives versus another set

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.040
is another thing that
people tend to keep secret.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.410
So there are forms of
financial infidelity, as well.

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:58.490
So, yeah, infidelity, you're absolutely,

01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:59.450
it's a great question,

01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:02.760
because it shouldn't be
confined to sexual infidelity,

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.140
which is what most people think about,

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.670
but also emotional and financial.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:11.123
Interestingly, if you ask people,

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.070
what is infidelity in a marriage?

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:17.150
Men tend to say, well, it's obvious

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:22.150
as she has sex with someone
else, that's infidelity.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.870
Whereas women are more likely

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:27.340
to have a broader
definition of infidelity.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.790
They will cite things
like emotional infidelity,

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.600
financial infidelity, as
part of the definition.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.440
Whereas men have that
more narrow definition.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.273
- Interesting.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:39.800
I have a good friend
who's a couples counselor,

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.450
a clinical psychologist,

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:44.300
and she told me something
interesting that relates to this,

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.830
which is that in cases of infidelity,

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:51.120
oftentimes some of the
arguments between couples

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.980
boil down to whether or not
contraception was used or not.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.210
That becomes a key feature,

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:59.080
and she always thought
that that was, you know,

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.240
homing in on a detail,

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.580
which of course is an important detail

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.760
as it relates to both
paternity issues and pregnancy,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.970
but also disease, right.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:10.193
But as we're talking about all this,

01:05:11.263 --> 01:05:14.510
it makes me think that
this may have deeper

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.633
evolutionary roots in our,

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.700
further down in the brain,

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.174
as we say in neuroscience literature.

01:05:21.174 --> 01:05:22.174
- And yeah,

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:26.650
using a condom versus not using a condom,

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.590
not using is a more intimate act in a way,

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.850
you were literally
physically more intimate

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.350
with someone else,

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:35.893
than if you do use a condom.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.130
But whether evolutionary roots to this,

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.550
I don't know, I mean condoms

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:45.790
are probably relatively recent,

01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:47.370
or at least the widespread use of them

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:50.630
are relatively recent
in evolutionary time.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:53.480
So I doubt we have adaptation
specifically for them.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.470
- No, and presumably before condoms,

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:57.733
that one can only speculate
because as we say,

01:05:57.733 --> 01:06:02.113
when it comes to behavior,
there's rarely a fossil record,

01:06:03.311 --> 01:06:04.144
but sometimes there is,

01:06:04.144 --> 01:06:07.170
it would be the withdrawal
method of contraception,

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.280
which a good friend of mine who studies,

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.330
whose laboratory works
on reproductive biology,

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:14.270
says the reason that's a
poor choice of contraception

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.313
is because it was designed not to work.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:21.560
So note to those trying to
avoid unwanted pregnancy.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.170
So we talked a little bit about status

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:27.230
in terms of what men and
women are selecting for,

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.693
for different types of relationships.

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:32.310
Is there anything else about status

01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:35.500
that you find particularly
interesting, and you know,

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.780
what men are finding attractive
besides these, you know,

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:43.780
waist to hip ratios and
quality of potential mothers

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:45.463
and so forth.

01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:49.330
Are there any kind of a
hidden gems in the literature

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.350
around this that I
might not have heard of?

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:53.183
- Well, yeah.

01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:55.283
So you mean among,

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.670
things like sex differences

01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.713
in what leads to high status?

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.870
- For instance, or what,

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:06.220
or perhaps things that are surprising

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.210
in terms of what people are selecting for.

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.530
Do people even know what
they're selecting for?

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:12.830
Or is this all subconscious?

01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:15.970
Any and all of those topics
are of interest to me.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.410
- So we'll have to take
them in reverse order.

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:21.240
You know, I think a
lot of it is conscious,

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.700
but some of it is certainly unconscious,

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:27.280
or there are elements which
are totally unconscious.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.450
So I mentioned one earlier

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:31.130
where a man looks at a woman,

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:34.510
he's not, he's aware that
he's attracted to her

01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:36.270
and attracted to her physical appearance,

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:38.610
but he might not be aware of why.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.610
We didn't evolve to be aware of why,

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.460
just like with food preferences,

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.850
we find certain things delectable

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:47.880
and other things nauseating,

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.760
we don't understand the adaptive logic

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.650
of why our food preferences
exist and why we have them.

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.260
And the same is true of mating, you know?

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:02.260
And so men find women with a
low waist-hip ratio attractive,

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:07.890
but they might not, they almost rarely,

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:09.770
rarely will they know, oh,

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.330
low waist ratio is actually associated

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:16.053
with higher fertility, lower
endocrinological problems,

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.740
lower age, et cetera.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.990
So, we're sometimes aware of what we want,

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.663
but we are unaware of why we want it.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.230
So, there are unconscious elements

01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:32.870
that the whole topic of status

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:35.253
and what leads to high
status or low status,

01:08:35.253 --> 01:08:37.630
it's a topic I'm currently investigating,

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:40.193
published a couple
scientific articles on it.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.470
And so maybe we'll hold off on that

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.621
for a future discussion,

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.450
but it intersects, I'll mention one,

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:51.700
it intersects with mating
in interesting ways,

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:54.860
in that higher status

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.860
gives people the ability to choose

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.340
from a wider pool of potential mates

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.373
than they would if they have low status.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:08.740
And so one of the reasons
that people strive for status

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.200
is because they have access
to more desirable mates.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.363
Conversely,

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:19.287
having desirable mates endows
you with higher status.

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:20.660
And so if you have,

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:21.493
if you're a male,

01:09:21.493 --> 01:09:25.210
you have a very attractive
woman on your arm

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:27.010
that leads to high status.

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.410
And so there's a reciprocal link

01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.240
between status and mating in that way.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.840
And there've been studies where,

01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:37.930
say they pose a kind
of an unattractive guy,

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.600
older unattractive guy, and
a stunningly beautiful woman

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.800
as his girlfriend.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.560
And they say, well,
what's this guy all about?

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.320
And they say, oh, he must
be very high in status.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.410
He must be very wealthy.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:52.893
He must have a lot going for him,

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:59.103
whereas the reverse people don't
make the same attributions.

01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:02.430
And so there is an
interesting reciprocal link

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.690
between status and mating success,

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:07.600
where mating success leads to high status,

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.850
and high status leads
to more mating success.

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:11.840
- Over and over again,

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.570
there are these instances
that you describe

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:16.440
where the assessment of potential mates,

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.240
sexual or long-term partnership,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.400
are being made in the contents

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.050
of good statistical practices,

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:24.730
looking at the choices of others

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:27.376
as a readout of your own choices.

01:10:27.376 --> 01:10:28.890
This seems to be a theme

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.670
that this is not being made
in a very narrow context,

01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:32.667
but paying attention to what other people

01:10:32.667 --> 01:10:34.100
are paying attention to.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.900
It seems to come up again and again.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.190
Slightly off center from that,

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.370
but still paying attention to what

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.220
other people are paying attention to.

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:46.263
What's known about jealousy
in men versus women?

01:10:47.779 --> 01:10:50.430
And how frequent it is, how intense it is,

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:52.490
and what people do with that jealousy.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:54.180
I mean, we hear,

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.337
or I've heard at some point that

01:10:56.337 --> 01:10:57.450
a large fraction of homicides

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:00.043
are the consequence of jealous lovers.

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:03.640
That's the darkest angle of all this,

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:08.640
but in evolutionary psychology
context, what is jealousy?

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:13.210
Does it relate to paternity issues only?

01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:14.180
What can you tell us about jealousy?

01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.330
Yeah, that's great set of questions,

01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.940
and when I first started
studying jealousy,

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.150
I reviewed all the prior
publications on jealousy.

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.240
And at that time,

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.240
jealousy was regarded
as a sign of immaturity,

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.263
a sign of insecurity,

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.360
a sign of a neurosis or pathology,

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.773
or in some cases delusion.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.210
And what I argued is,

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.210
and do argue, is that
jealousy is an evolved emotion

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:52.780
that serves several
adaptive functions, okay?

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.790
One of which you mentioned

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:56.263
is a paternity certainty function.

01:11:57.150 --> 01:12:00.490
But to back up a second,

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:01.990
basically, once you have the evolution

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:04.470
of long-term mating, long-term pair bonds,

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.260
you're talking about
from a male perspective,

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.027
investing a tremendous amount
of resources in a woman

01:12:10.027 --> 01:12:13.830
and her children over years or decades,

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.380
even with boomerang kids now,

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.830
it may go more than two decades.

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:19.230
- Boomerang kids?

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:23.175
- Kids who leave home and then
come back and live at home.

01:12:23.175 --> 01:12:24.570
- That happens?

01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:25.530
- Oh yeah, that happens.

01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:26.620
- I don't have children.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.170
- Okay yeah, no that's a big thing.

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:32.496
- But if I do I'll just
expect that they'll come back.

01:12:32.496 --> 01:12:34.120
- They'll come back because
they can't find a job,

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.320
or they find it cheaper

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.560
to live at the parent's
house, or whatever.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.393
- Oh, goodness.

01:12:38.393 --> 01:12:39.226
I can't think of anything worse.

01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:40.400
I mean, I love my parents.

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:44.180
- I know, I can't imagine,

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:47.080
but it happens and it's
happening more and more,

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.680
given the current economic situation.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.790
But, so once you have long-term mating,

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:56.440
you need a defense

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.440
to prevent or preserve the investment

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.500
that you've made and are
making in long-term mateship.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.650
And so jealousy serves this
mate guarding function,

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:08.960
if you will, or mate retention function.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.010
So in other words, one
way of phrasing this,

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:14.950
is that we know that they are affairs,

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:17.350
we know that people break
up, they get divorced,

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.740
but people have adaptations

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.900
to want to hold on to their mates, okay?

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.800
And that's what jealousy's in part about.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.220
And so jealousy gets activated
when there are threats

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.540
to that romantic relationship.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.480
And there are other forms of jealousy,

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.090
like sibling jealousy and so forth,

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:38.480
but we're focusing on mating
jealousy in this context.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.860
So now what's interesting
is that the threats

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.460
to an ongoing, valued
romantic relationship

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.150
come from many sources.

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:48.983
So they could be,

01:13:48.983 --> 01:13:52.273
you detect cues to your
partner's infidelity,

01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:58.941
or cues of a lack of an emotional distance

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.100
between you and your partner.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.040
You say, I love you to your partner,

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.040
and your partner says,

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.720
I wonder how the hell the Knicks are doing

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.460
this scoring season, or whatever.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.600
If you get an unreciprocated
I love you is a bad cue.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.870
- Or a half, or some people
are so tuned to this,

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:16.570
if there's a half millisecond delay,

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:18.590
they can detect delays in responses.

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:19.423
- Yes, yeah.

01:14:19.423 --> 01:14:22.390
Delays in responses, but even things like,

01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:25.290
so that's one set of cues,

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:28.450
but then there's another set
of interested mate poachers.

01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:32.330
So, you know, if you're mated
to someone who's desirable,

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:35.350
which many people are, other
people still desire them,

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.700
and so sometimes try to poach them,

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.590
or lure them away from you

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:42.110
for a short term sexual encounter,

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.750
or for a longer term relationship.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.550
And so we have to be, so
jealousy motivates people

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:50.010
to be attentive to potential mate poachers

01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:51.770
in their environment,

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:56.720
but even more subtle things
like mate value discrepancies

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.330
can trigger jealousy.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:00.250
So even if there are no mate poachers

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:02.350
and no accused infidelity,

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:06.650
if a mate value discrepancy
opens up in a relationship.

01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:08.450
So in the American system,

01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:11.690
like you're a six or an eight or a ten,

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:13.800
and people generally pair off

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.680
based on similarity and mate value.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:18.200
- So that tends to happen,
sixes end up with sixes,

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.493
sevens end up with
sixes, plus or minus one.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.730
These are somewhat subjective scales.

01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:24.610
- Somewhat subjective,

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.440
but there's still some
consensus about these things.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.040
So even colloquially people,

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.233
colloquially people say things like,

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.280
he's not good enough for you, you know,

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.640
or I think you could do better to people

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.500
who implicitly have a notion
of relative mate value

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
and discrepancies therein,

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.810
but discrepancies can open up
where none previously existed.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:50.040
So you get fired from a job.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.570
All of a sudden, you know,

01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:53.820
and most people are very understanding

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.240
and forgiving about that,

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.250
if it's not too long, but you
go six months, eight months,

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:02.000
people start having problems,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.930
or if someone's career takes off.

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:07.730
Let's say a woman becomes
a famous singer or actress,

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.870
or a man does, career takes off.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.270
All of a sudden there's
a mate value discrepancy

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.380
where you have access to a
larger pool of potential mates

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.743
and higher mate value potential mates.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.240
So, people are attentive to
mate value discrepancies.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.690
And so jealousy can get activated,

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:28.720
even if there are no immediate
threats to a relationship,

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.050
but the mate value discrepancy is a threat

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.860
that looms on the horizon
of the relationship,

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.840
because we know statistically
the higher mate value person

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.380
is more likely to have an
affair and is more likely

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:46.140
to dump the other person and
trade up in the mating market.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.410
- And when people find new partners

01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:52.910
for long-term relationships,
do they tend to trade up?

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:54.193
- On average yes,

01:16:55.388 --> 01:16:57.533
if the discrepancy is sufficiently large,

01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:01.053
so there are costs
associated with breaking up,

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.790
divorcing for example, I
mean, it's emotionally,

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:08.270
financially, it's a costly thing.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:11.180
And so if you have like a half a point

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.680
mate value discrepancy,

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.140
you're not going to see a lot
of breakups, but you know,

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:17.320
if you have larger mate
value discrepancies,

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:21.313
that's going to augur more for
trading up in the mating market.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.650
So, then you get into,

01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:27.860
so what jealousy is,

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:31.720
it's an emotion that gets
activated by these circumstances.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.310
And then what people do about it

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:36.010
depends on what their options are.

01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:38.260
And people do things that I,

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:40.400
in my published scientific work,

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.550
I say range from vigilance to violence.

01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:45.400
So this whole spectrum of things.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.040
In fact, I've identified
19 different tactics

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.040
that people use to deal with
problems once they get jealous,

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.640
and one is increased vigilance,

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.473
and the other extreme violence.

01:17:56.473 --> 01:17:59.120
- Vigilance for the behavior of the mate.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.080
- Yeah, vigilance for
the behavior of the mate.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.210
And that can include stalking, following,

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:08.093
hacking into iPhones or computers,

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:13.700
monitoring the behavior of mate poachers,

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:18.190
looking at eye contact between
other men and your partner.

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:20.770
There's a whole suite
of things that you know,

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:22.713
is involved in vigilance.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.630
And then at the other extreme,

01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:27.180
and we can talk about things in between,

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.290
but the other extreme is violence.

01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:32.700
And so in my new book,
When Men Behave Badly,

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.590
I have a whole chapter on
intimate partner violence.

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:37.877
And this is what I argue,

01:18:37.877 --> 01:18:42.250
and this is really unfortunate,
and I'm not endorsing it.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.720
It's illegal, it's bad, don't do it.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.770
But people will engage

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:48.700
in intimate partner violence in America,

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:53.090
something like 28 to 30% of
all people who are married

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:55.400
will experience intimate partner violence

01:18:56.546 --> 01:18:59.617
in their relationships, so
it's not a trivial percentage.

01:18:59.617 --> 01:19:01.260
- And that violence is
between the two partners.

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.710
- Between the two partners, yes.

01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:05.230
There's also violence that gets directed

01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:06.680
to our potential mate poachers,

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.130
but that's a somewhat separate issue.

01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:15.130
But one of the things that is
functional about the violence

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.970
is that it tends to reduce

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.820
perceived mate value discrepancies.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.003
So in other words,

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.120
guys tend to engage in the
violence more than women do,

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.300
although some argue that there's more

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.280
equality in the violence,

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.640
but at a minimum men
tend to do more damage

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.110
when they do the violence.

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:36.460
- And when you're talking about violence,

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.220
is this ever emotional violence?

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.677
- Yeah, there there's that as well.

01:19:39.677 --> 01:19:41.990
And in fact, the two
tend to be correlated.

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:44.253
So in my studies of married couples,

01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:48.300
verbal violence is a good predictor

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.260
of physical violence happening as well.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.810
So one of the things that'll happen,

01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:54.350
just to give a concrete example,

01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:57.470
guys will start insulting
their partner's appearance.

01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:59.260
You're really looking ugly today.

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.534
Your thighs are heavy or, you know,

01:20:03.534 --> 01:20:04.367
you're not looking very good,

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:06.600
so they try to denigrate
the woman's appearance,

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.970
which is a key component
of woman's mate value.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:11.060
- So they're trying to adjust more closely

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.160
the mate value discrepancy.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.860
- Yeah, they're trying
to reduce her perceived,

01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:17.500
self-perceived mate value.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.720
So if, let's say he's
a six, she's an eight,

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.553
and he can convince her that
she's actually only a six,

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:28.410
then she's going to be more
likely to stay with him.

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:29.470
- Very diabolical.

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.220
- It's terribly diabolical.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:36.220
But the fact is women don't
feel good about themselves

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:39.740
when they get beaten up by their partner.

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:44.030
In fact, in the cases where
it leaves physical evidence,

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:47.503
women wear sunglasses or
turtlenecks or cover up,

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.020
the bruises is it literally
does lower the mate value

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.427
of the woman by injuring
her physical appearance.

01:20:55.427 --> 01:20:58.870
- And getting her to conceal
herself, stay home, et cetera.

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:01.407
Yeah, taking her out of the,

01:21:01.407 --> 01:21:03.750
the literally reducing her visibility.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.070
- Right, and that's actually

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:07.280
one of the predictors of violence,

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.330
is if he starts doing
things other than violence,

01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:12.850
like cutting off her relationships

01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:14.680
with her friends and her family,

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.780
trying to sequester her,

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.250
and prevent her from getting exposed

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:22.110
to potential other partners.

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.870
And so it is a very diabolical,

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:28.070
but I think important
to understand, you know,

01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:29.810
the potential functionality

01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:33.110
of intimate partner violence.

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:34.780
- What about, sorry to interrupt again,

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.930
but I'm just so curious.

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:39.310
So oftentimes my audience will
say you interrupt too often,

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:41.550
but I want to make sure that
I don't miss an opportunity

01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:43.480
to ask you about the
intimate partner violence

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.520
in the other direction, female to male,

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.790
where stereotypically speaking
that the opportunity for

01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:51.350
physical violence is still there,

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:54.450
but the idea in mind is that it would be

01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:55.850
more of a psychological nature.

01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:57.430
Although I think there is evidence

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:59.940
that some women beat their husbands,

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.430
but I'm guessing it's not
as frequent or am I off?

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:04.850
- Well, different studies,

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:08.900
so it depends on whether you
just simply count up acts,

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.363
or whether you look at
the damage it has done.

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:13.270
And, as I mentioned,

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.240
men tend to do more physical damage,

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.930
so there are shelters for battered women

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:19.410
all over the country.

01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:22.310
As far as I know, there's
one for battered men.

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:23.400
Now it may be,

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.370
and this is partly true
that men are more ashamed

01:22:27.370 --> 01:22:29.000
if they get beaten up by their partner,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.290
clocked with a frying pan,

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.140
and it's possible,

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:36.400
and there's evidence that police
don't take it as seriously.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.470
So there's one case
that I report in my book

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:41.350
where a guy called the police,

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:44.640
and his wife had clocked
him with something,

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.690
and police shows up and he says,

01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:51.870
if she so much as broke a
fingernail in this altercation,

01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:53.660
they'll charge you and not her.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:58.593
And so there is a police bias,

01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:01.750
a potential police bias in this.

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.680
And so there may be under-reporting

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.283
of women beating up men as a consequence.

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:11.540
But, the motivations are often different.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:14.320
So one is that

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.320
male sexual jealousy will trigger
him to attack his partner,

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:23.250
and then she will use physical
violence to defend herself.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:26.793
So she might pick up a frying pan,

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.460
or a weapon of some
sort to defend herself.

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:35.460
and so the motivation is his
sexual jealousy on his part,

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.930
but self-defense on her part.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.410
And so that accounts for some

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:42.750
unknown percentage of the
cases, and in some cases,

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.810
it is women who were outraged

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:46.080
when they discover their partner's

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.000
been having sex with someone else,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
an infidelity of a sexual,
financial, or emotional nature.

01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:55.770
And so there is some
female to male violence

01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:57.393
that absolutely occurs.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:03.280
But the reduction of a
perceived mate value discrepancy

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.940
is a key function from male perspective.

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.790
Again, not that he thinks about this,

01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:12.590
he's just angry and
wants to hurt her, okay?

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:17.110
Okay, but here's one other
thing that is really interesting

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:19.130
about the intimate partner violence,

01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:23.130
and that's the specificity of
it depending on circumstances,

01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:26.680
and namely, when the woman gets pregnant,

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.130
she's more vulnerable
to physical violence,

01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:31.680
and when the man suspects

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.430
that he's not the father
of that pregnancy,

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:36.810
he's more likely to direct the violence

01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:39.220
toward blows to her abdomen.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.210
It's that specific.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.360
And so in that case the function

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.270
is hypothesized function,

01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:50.883
is to terminate the
pregnancy by a rival male,

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.380
as opposed to deterring the woman

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.970
from committing an infidelity,

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:58.470
or from leaving the relationship entirely.

01:24:58.470 --> 01:25:01.908
So that's why one function
of intimate partner violence,

01:25:01.908 --> 01:25:03.167
is just sequestering the woman

01:25:03.167 --> 01:25:05.293
and keeping her all to himself.

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.630
So it's both to prevent infidelity
and to prevent defection.

01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:13.320
- I have a friend whose

01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:16.840
wife told me

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:21.040
that if he cheats I'll kill him,

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.090
that's what she said,

01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:24.540
but it's actually just much easier

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.070
to keep him very, very busy.

01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:29.810
And that statement now leaps to mind,

01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:31.540
because of what you're describing,

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.800
that there are many
tactics by which people

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.500
can engage this effort to reduce
the mate value discrepancy,

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.823
not all of which are overtly violent,

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.720
but all of which are designed
to constrain their behavior.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.553
- Right, right.

01:25:46.553 --> 01:25:47.710
Yeah, so these would fall under

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.183
what I would call mate retention tactics,

01:25:52.371 --> 01:25:54.270
and only one or two of which

01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:56.530
fall under the violence category.

01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:58.433
Yeah, they're even, yeah,

01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:03.310
within partner psychological manipulations

01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:04.143
about these things.

01:26:04.143 --> 01:26:05.790
So there are psychological manipulations

01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:07.793
about perceived mate value,

01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:11.253
no one else would want you,

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.460
you're a loser there's
denigration of partner

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:16.893
within the relationship,

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.480
even feigning anger to make the partner

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.802
feel guilty about say,
looking at someone else.

01:26:25.802 --> 01:26:29.950
So there's all kinds of
inter nesting warfare

01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:31.800
that goes on within relationships

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.450
to manipulate perceptions of these things.

01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:36.490
This is, I'm creating
a much too jaded view

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:38.380
of romance and love, I think.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.883
- Oh no, we will get to the happy endings.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.730
I mean, there are certainly many

01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.503
happy relationships out there.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.310
As a neuroscientist, I hear about this,

01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:50.790
and the immediacy of

01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:55.760
how people fall into
a pattern or jealousy,

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.515
or a pattern of cheating and, not always,

01:26:59.515 --> 01:27:01.740
it just speaks to a brain circuitry

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.580
that's evolved to protect something.

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.930
And I'm sure this statement
is not exhaustive,

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:09.090
but I think it's accurate
to say that every species,

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:11.240
but especially humans,

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.920
wants to make more of itself
and protect its young,

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.180
but these issues of paternity
and resource allocation,

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.450
I think they're vital.

01:27:19.450 --> 01:27:20.370
Yeah, I look forward to a day

01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:23.060
where evolutionary
psychology and neuroscience

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.550
can merge at the level
of underlying mechanism.

01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:27.810
But I don't think it's dark,

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:31.163
I think it's just the way
we're wired at some level.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.240
Speaking of dark, could you
tell us about the dark triad?

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.600
- Yeah, so the dark triad,

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.620
so we've been talking about
sex differences on average,

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.400
but there are critical within-sex
individual differences,

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.740
and the dark triad is one
of the most important ones.

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:49.060
The dark triad consists

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.860
of three personality characteristics,

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:56.690
so narcissism, Machiavellianism,
and psychopathy.

01:27:56.690 --> 01:28:00.550
Hallmarks of narcissism are
things like grandiosity,

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:04.390
the person thinks that
they're more intelligent,

01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:06.380
more attractive, more dazzling,

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.147
more charming than they actually are.

01:28:08.147 --> 01:28:11.970
The think they're the greatest
person since sliced bread.

01:28:11.970 --> 01:28:13.420
Importantly, with narcissism,

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.660
you also get a sense of entitlement.

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.200
So they feel entitled to
a larger share of the pie,

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.150
whether that be the financial pie,

01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:24.603
the status pie, or the sexual pie.

01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:29.720
Machiavellianism is high scorers

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.170
tend to pursue an
exploitative social strategy.

01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:36.830
So they might feign
cooperation, but then cheat,

01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.633
you know, on subsequent moves.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.070
They view other people as
pawns to be manipulated

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.143
for their own instrumental gains.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.560
And then psychopathy, one of
the hallmarks of psychopathy

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.330
is a lack of empathy.

01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:53.230
So most people have a
normal empathy circuit

01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:56.200
where if a child falls down and gets hurt,

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.960
we feel compassion for the harm

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.430
that that person is undergoing.

01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:04.900
Or if a puppy gets a hit
by a car or whatever,

01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:08.320
we feel compassion, psychopaths don't.

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.640
That is those high on this,
it's a dimensional thing,

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.180
it's not a categorical thing.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.520
So those high on psychopathy
basically lack empathy.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.540
And so if you combine these qualities,

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.400
narcissism, psychopathy,
and Machiavellianism,

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.140
you have well, some very bad dudes.

01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:31.500
And I say bad dudes
'cause men tend to score

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.350
higher on these things than women,

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:36.810
especially on the psychopathy dimension.

01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:39.520
So when you talk about
clinical levels of psychopathy,

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.117
it's estimated to be
something like 1% of women

01:29:43.117 --> 01:29:45.150
and about 4% of men.

01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:48.370
So men are much higher on that.

01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:50.350
So why is this important?

01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:52.690
Well, it's important
in the mating context,

01:29:52.690 --> 01:29:57.360
because those who are
high on dark triad traits

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.120
tend to be sexual deceivers for one.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.770
So they're very often very charming,

01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:06.780
very good at seducing women,

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.800
and then abandoning them sometimes with,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.533
after fleecing them or
draining their bank account.

01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:19.093
They're very good at the art of seduction,

01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:24.420
they also tend to be sexual harassers,

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.803
serial sexual harassers,
and sexual coercers.

01:30:29.150 --> 01:30:34.040
So when it comes to
forms of sexual violence,

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.170
high dark triad guys tend
to be perpetrators of this.

01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:41.760
And so like most men I think, would be,

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.730
find it ethically abhorrent

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:46.670
to sexually harass a
woman in the workplace,

01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:50.750
dark triad guys, in part maybe
they feel entitled to it,

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.700
and in part they do.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.230
I mean, in some cases
that I report in the book,

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:56.910
there are like literal descriptions

01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.610
where the guys are
writing in these journals,

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.528
I knew she was attracted to me.

01:31:01.528 --> 01:31:05.720
You know, that's why she
met me in the Xerox room

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.800
just when I was there,

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.150
'cause she wanted to admire
my bulging biceps or whatever.

01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:11.390
- It's all about them.

01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:12.240
- Yeah, and they,

01:31:13.621 --> 01:31:15.930
and this gets into a
bias that I talk about,

01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:19.450
which is the male sexual
misperception bias,

01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:21.020
where a woman smiles at a man,

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:23.730
man thinks, oh, she wants my body,

01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:24.770
she's attracted to me.

01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:27.510
And women are thinking, oh,
I'm just being friendly,

01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:29.883
I'm being polite or professional.

01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:33.237
But these guys high dark triad guys

01:31:33.237 --> 01:31:37.800
are more susceptible to the
sexual over-perception bias,

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.460
and they literally believe that the woman

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.730
is attracted to them and
sending them signals,

01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:46.883
green lights to sexually approach.

01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:50.450
And so if you combine dark triad traits

01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:52.990
with the dispositional pursuit

01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:54.900
of a short-term mating strategy,

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.450
that's an especially deadly combination.

01:31:57.450 --> 01:32:01.350
That's when you get sexual
harassment, sexual coercion.

01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:04.290
So these are very bad dudes,

01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:08.130
also predictors of
intimate partner violence.

01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:11.550
- What approximate frequency
in the male population

01:32:12.433 --> 01:32:14.100
have all three of the dark triad traits.

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.710
And I realize that they're on a continuum,

01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:17.040
sociopathy, narcissism.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.310
- That's why you can't say
because they are on a continuum,

01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:23.250
and it's sort of arbitrary
where you draw the line.

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:26.380
But I think it's a minority of men.

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:30.280
It's a subset of men who
commit the vast majority

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.260
of these acts of sexual violence.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.920
And that's why it's not like,

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.020
if you look at victims of sexual violence,

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.290
they're more numerous

01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:41.490
than the perpetrators of sexual violence,

01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:42.970
because the perpetrators tend to be

01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:45.670
serial offenders, so to speak.

01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:46.940
One guy in the workplace,

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.520
harassing 15 different women,

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:53.230
one guy sexually coercing,
you know, multiple women.

01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:56.590
That's why you have like, in
well-known cases in the news,

01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:58.710
like Harvey Weinstein, you know,

01:32:58.710 --> 01:33:01.670
probably over a hundred different women,

01:33:01.670 --> 01:33:03.860
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein,

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.120
some of these more famous cases,

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.900
these are a large number of victims,

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.900
but pretty much [indistinct]
the perpetrators.

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.160
And there's no question that these guys

01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:19.680
like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.453
were definitely high on dark triad traits.

01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:26.453
- You mentioned stalking briefly.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.900
Maybe we could just talk about

01:33:30.810 --> 01:33:34.430
some of the less known
features about stalking.

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:37.070
I think I once heard you
give a lecture where you said

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:40.400
that one of the scariest
things about stalking

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.730
is that sometimes it works.

01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:43.740
- Yes, yeah.

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:48.340
So, well stalking has
multiple motivations,

01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:51.300
but one of the most frequent motivations

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:54.820
is a mating motivation,

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.350
where either there's a breakup

01:33:58.350 --> 01:34:00.230
and the woman dumps the guy

01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:02.620
and the guy doesn't want to get dumped,

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.010
he wants to maintain a
relationship with her.

01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:06.520
And I should say that,

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.160
when it comes to criminal stalking,

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.450
there's a huge sex difference.

01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:14.143
About 80% of the stalkers tend
to be men, about 20% women.

01:34:14.143 --> 01:34:16.193
So there are women stalkers, but they're,

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.260
about a fourth of the
number compared to men.

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.330
So the motivation of the guys tends to be

01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:30.330
either an attempt to get
back together with the woman,

01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:33.693
either sexually or in a relationship or,

01:34:34.845 --> 01:34:39.845
and/or to interfere with
her future mating prospects.

01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:43.930
And it works in some of
the time in two senses.

01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:48.430
One is it does interfere
with her attempts to remate.

01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:51.120
So in fact, it scares off some guys.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.640
So like you show up and pick
up a woman at her apartment

01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.130
for a date and her ex is sitting
out there glaring at you.

01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:03.770
- Or, I'm actually familiar
with the circumstance

01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.440
where early in a relationship,

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.990
somebody mentions that an ex has made

01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:12.400
veiled threats about
surveillance, for instance.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.770
I've actually had that happen

01:35:13.770 --> 01:35:15.440
several times in my dating history

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.840
where someone would say,

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.920
you started opening up

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.680
about previous relationships a little bit,

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.630
as it's appropriate, and someone says,

01:35:21.630 --> 01:35:24.360
yeah, you know, he mentioned
that he was going to, you know,

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.650
send someone around to, you
know, to surveil me, you know,

01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:29.630
that kind of thing,

01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:33.790
which is a very interesting
factoid to pick up.

01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:36.283
But I heard it enough times,

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:39.950
and people I know have reported
hearing this enough times

01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:42.000
that I'm guessing that that's

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.630
probably more frequent than
people actually trailing people

01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:47.260
in cars and things of that sort.

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.093
But planting that,

01:35:48.093 --> 01:35:50.450
it's like the psychological
seed of surveillance

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:52.670
is a form of harassment in some sense.

01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:53.660
- Yes, absolutely.

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:54.790
I think that you're right,

01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:57.610
there's that planting
the psychological seeds,

01:35:57.610 --> 01:36:00.000
but then also with surveillance,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.140
some surveilers remain hidden,

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.780
so you don't know necessarily.

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.420
- Yeah, I confess in this case,

01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:07.800
it did not act as a deterrent

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.653
for continuing the relationship,
but that's another story.

01:36:13.794 --> 01:36:17.690
So, how often do women respond?

01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:20.180
I have to put this in quotes
for those that are listening,

01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.530
air quotes end quotes,
positively to stalk.

01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:23.710
I mean, how often does it work

01:36:23.710 --> 01:36:27.200
to re-secure the partner after
they've been broken up with.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.590
- So in our studies,

01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:34.310
it's a minority of cases
that it works to reestablish.

01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:38.480
I think something like 15%
of the time that it works,

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.970
either to temporarily reestablish
a sexual relationship,

01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:46.900
or lure the woman back in for
a more permanent relationship.

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.933
So most of the time it doesn't work.

01:36:51.325 --> 01:36:53.343
But one woman in our study said,

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.140
the guy, every time she
went out with another guy,

01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.160
he would threaten the other guy.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.400
And she said after about six months,

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.410
there were no other guys.

01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:04.670
He basically scared
off all the other guys.

01:37:04.670 --> 01:37:06.090
And so she went back to him

01:37:06.090 --> 01:37:07.620
because there were no other guys around.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:10.340
- Yeah, I experienced this
when I was in college,

01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:13.273
I lived in a small town,
very population dense.

01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:16.300
Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara.

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.630
And there was a couple

01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:20.620
where every time this
woman would date someone,

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:23.750
he'd basically beat up
whoever the new suitor was.

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.170
And pretty soon no one would go near them.

01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:28.490
They got a reputation as the
kind of Sid and Nancy couple,

01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:30.270
and indeed it worked,

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:33.890
it worked in the sense that
no one dare go near her

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:35.240
and they ended up together.

01:37:36.503 --> 01:37:38.400
So I've seen real life examples of this.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:43.180
- Yeah, so it happens,
but it is in general,

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.470
not a successful strategy.

01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:45.890
- Oh no, and that's not
what I'm suggesting.

01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:47.420
I was just shocked to learn that,

01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:50.310
'cause we hear stalking and we have this,

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:52.050
there's one very extreme image of it.

01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:54.715
But the underlying motivations I think,

01:37:54.715 --> 01:37:57.700
reveal something about mating dynamics.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.200
- Yeah, and I think that the circumstances

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.530
are often a mate value discrepancy

01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:06.420
where the guy realizes correctly

01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:09.240
that he will be unable to replace her

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.020
with a mate of equivalent mate value,

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.130
or in some cases any
mate, you know, it's like,

01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:18.160
well she was with me once,

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.283
maybe I can get her back with me again.

01:38:23.148 --> 01:38:26.513
So the psychology is very understandable,

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.690
but it tends not to work because,

01:38:29.690 --> 01:38:30.770
and then the other thing we found,

01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:34.260
we did a study of 2,500
victims of stalking.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.780
This is with Josh Duntley,
a former student of mine,

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:39.280
who's now a professor in
the criminology department.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.630
And what we found is there were large sex,

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.940
large differences between the stalker

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.610
and the victim of the stalker,

01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:50.430
where the stalker tends to be much lower

01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:52.960
in mate value than the victim.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.680
And so basically it's typically the woman

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:00.150
who realizes she can do a lot
better on the mating market,

01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:03.440
and the guy realizes I
am never going to be able

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.330
to replace her with a woman
of equivalent mate value.

01:39:07.330 --> 01:39:11.300
And so I'm going to use this
last ditch desperate measure

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:14.313
to try to get her back,
and occasionally it works.

01:39:16.312 --> 01:39:20.303
- I'm thinking more about
this mate value thing,

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.580
this number, this metric,
the eight, ten, six,

01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:27.250
whatever it is.

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:29.760
And mate value discrepancy
playing such a strong role

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.323
in all these dynamics.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.820
I should have asked this earlier,

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:38.310
but what is the impact on mate value

01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:43.310
perceived or real of a woman
having already had children?

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.280
You know, for instance, there,

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.210
friends of mine who are
married and divorced

01:39:49.210 --> 01:39:50.043
who have children,

01:39:50.043 --> 01:39:51.530
will often post pictures of themselves

01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:53.880
with their children in
their online profiles,

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.600
because it shows a strong
sense of paternal instinct.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.523
You know, there's the puppy thing.

01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:04.270
People with dogs or puppies demonstrating

01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:07.940
a capacity to care, and for caretaking.

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.860
In women, the opposite is also true.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:11.480
Women with children show capacity,

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.650
it demonstrates fertility,
at least at one point,

01:40:14.650 --> 01:40:17.373
perhaps fertility that's still present.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.570
Does it positively, negatively,
or neutrally impact a woman

01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:25.740
to already have children
when seeking another mate,

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.290
regardless of whether
or not she was married

01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.240
or had the children out of wedlock?

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.580
- As a general rule,

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.260
it decreases for mate value,

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.190
because kids with another mate

01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:37.030
are viewed as a cost, not a benefit.

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:41.120
And there are costs on
multiple dimensions,

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.640
one of which they're going
to be a cost to the guy,

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:46.993
because he's going to
have to invest resources,

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:49.460
time, attention, so forth,

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:53.560
but also a portion of
her effort and resources

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.950
are going to be devoted toward kids

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:56.860
who are not genetically related to him.

01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:59.330
And which is one reason why step families,

01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:02.040
there's often a lot of
conflict within step families,

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.663
very explicable from an
evolutionary perspective.

01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:08.080
So in general, it's a cost, not a benefit.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.640
Sometimes it can be a benefit though.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:12.860
So I know one case where
a woman got divorced,

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:15.950
she had two kids and she
ended up successfully mating

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:18.030
with a guy who was also divorced

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.310
and had primary custody of his two kids.

01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:23.430
And so there was a compatibility there,

01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:24.930
but as a general rule,

01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:27.830
it will decrease a woman's
and a man's mate value

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:31.080
to have kids, especially
kids who are financially,

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.080
who are young and financially dependent.

01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:36.380
But, what happens is, let's say the woman

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.030
would be an eight without kids,

01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:43.140
a guy who's a six might
be able to attract her

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.710
and might feel lucky to attract her,

01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:50.340
because there's no way
he would've been able

01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.140
to attract her under other conditions.

01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:55.160
But that's why the display of effort,

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.270
investing in her kids,

01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:59.180
is often a mating tactic.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:02.130
He's showing, okay, I'm
willing to invest in kids.

01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:03.870
I'm willing to sacrifice.

01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:07.740
And so they in essence become
equivalent in mate value

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.480
as a result of that.

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.113
But will she be able
to attract on average,

01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:18.360
other eights, less likely,
but the same is true of guys.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.360
And this is why the reason

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.040
that it affects women more than men

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.020
is because more custody
tends to go with women.

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:27.870
That is the kids,

01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:30.580
women tend to have greater custody,

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:34.060
and women tend to invest more in the kids

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.920
throughout their lives.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.140
Now, there are other things like alimony

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:39.930
and child support payments, and so forth,

01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:42.980
but all the women I've talked to,

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:45.840
I've talked one-on-one
with many women about this.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.120
They view a guy with kids
as a cost, not a benefit,

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.830
unless the kids are old
enough and they've left home,

01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:55.660
and are no longer a financially dependent.

01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:58.113
- And everything you just
described is consistent

01:42:58.113 --> 01:42:59.640
with what you said earlier,

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.000
which is that with subsequent marriages,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.330
or as men get older,

01:43:03.330 --> 01:43:05.960
the tendency is to seek mates

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:08.480
that are progressively younger?

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.313
- Right.

01:43:09.313 --> 01:43:11.460
- Because there's a
higher, lower probability

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.927
they'll already have children,
if they're much younger.

01:43:13.927 --> 01:43:15.192
- Right, right.

01:43:15.192 --> 01:43:17.460
And if the guy's successful,

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:21.140
if he has status and resources
and has other qualities

01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.720
associated with higher mate value,

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.270
then he will remain
attractive to younger women.

01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:28.790
- I realize it's not your
specific area of expertise,

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:31.050
but these days there's a lot of discussion

01:43:31.050 --> 01:43:35.520
about how early childhood
attachment to parents

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.480
influences mate choice later on,

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.380
this kind of general
categorization of avoidant

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.683
and anxious and anxious avoidant
and all this kind of thing.

01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:47.550
And again, putting my hat on
as a neuroscientist, I think,

01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:52.050
you know, it makes sense
that the neural circuits

01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:56.140
for attachment in
childhood would be somehow,

01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:57.720
partially or in whole,

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.590
repurposed for other forms of attachment.

01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:00.880
We don't just tend to say, okay,

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.030
that brain circuitry was
from when I was a kid

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.863
and now I'm an adult,

01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:05.790
and so I'll develop this
new attachment circuitry.

01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:07.890
I'm guessing it evolves and whatnot,

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:12.890
but is there anything
interesting about that,

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.870
about childhood attachment strategies

01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:19.140
vis-a-vis stability of
long-term partner choice,

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:21.080
or is that too big of a
leap for us to make here?

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.400
- Yeah well, I mean,

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.400
I can offer some sort of
informed speculation about it,

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.470
and as you point, it's
not my area of expertise,

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:32.020
but I know a little bit about it,

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.250
and I mean, I think that,

01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:37.010
you know, a secure attachment style,

01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:39.090
if both partners have a
secure attachment style,

01:44:39.090 --> 01:44:41.123
that's conducive to a longterm mateship.

01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:45.070
Avoidant attachment styles,

01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:49.160
avoidant people tend to have
more difficulty with intimacy

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.693
and also higher probability of infidelity,

01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:56.590
and anxious attachment style,

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:59.850
I don't know, can create
problems of its own, you know,

01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:03.150
in the overly clingy dependent, you know,

01:45:03.150 --> 01:45:06.160
absorbing what I call
high relationship load.

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:06.993
So, you know,

01:45:06.993 --> 01:45:08.530
there's like mutation load,

01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:10.470
which we all have a certain
number of mutations.

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:14.570
There's parasite load.

01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:16.590
There's also what I
call relationship loads.

01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:18.750
So what is the baggage that someone brings

01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:20.120
to the relationship?

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.270
- Probably correlated with
the frequency of demand

01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:24.750
of immediate text message responses.

01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:26.480
Well, I think that the
frequency of demand,

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.610
like the latent, the expected low latency

01:45:29.610 --> 01:45:32.000
of text message responses

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.880
plays out consistently in
relationships, you know,

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.120
early on, there's a very
low expectation of response.

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.360
And then as people get attached,

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.940
depending on their level of anxiety,

01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:42.920
if they don't hear back from
somebody really quickly,

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.090
where the mind goes is a
very interesting aspect,

01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:47.950
you know, do you become suspicious?

01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:48.783
Do you become anxious?

01:45:48.783 --> 01:45:50.863
Can you stabilize your
own internal milieu,

01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:54.930
or do you need to see the dot
dot dot, that's coming back?

01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:56.670
I'd love to see a study
on that at some point.

01:45:56.670 --> 01:45:58.630
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's a good one.

01:45:58.630 --> 01:46:02.030
And my intuition suggests
that your prediction

01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:04.408
about that would pan out.

01:46:04.408 --> 01:46:06.950
It would be the insecure
that would really be,

01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:08.650
you know, getting upset if there were,

01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:11.750
if there were not that
immediate response to the texts.

01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:12.780
- I have a friend,

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.830
a female friend who deliberately

01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:17.280
quote unquote using her language,

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.490
trains her potential partners

01:46:20.490 --> 01:46:24.100
to be comfortable with a
variable response latency.

01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.830
But then I asked her if she's
comfortable with a variable

01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:29.370
response latency, and
she said, absolutely not.

01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:32.973
So there's an asymmetry,
at least in that case.

01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:37.100
This is almost certainly
a more rare circumstance,

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:40.640
but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.423
unconventional relationships.

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.260
These days, I don't think

01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:47.690
it's just by virtue of
living in California,

01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:51.310
you hear more and more about monogamish,

01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:53.770
as opposed to monogamous,

01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:57.570
and various forms of
polyamory that may or may not

01:46:57.570 --> 01:46:59.003
include the -amory part.

01:47:00.610 --> 01:47:02.623
You know, passes and permission,

01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:08.090
based on seasoned circumstance
and prior infidelities,

01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:11.570
like, okay, somebody
had a mishap early on,

01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:15.190
you know, you have one pass, so to speak,

01:47:15.190 --> 01:47:18.311
and you hear this kind of
language getting thrown around.

01:47:18.311 --> 01:47:22.270
And it's intriguing to me
because it seems like an effort

01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:25.083
to bypass some of the more,

01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:27.840
if you will, hardwired,

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.850
or at least culturally
hardwired aspects of mate choice

01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:32.780
and sexual partner choice.

01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:34.790
You know, acknowledging jealousy,

01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:36.930
but confronting it by
allowing your partner

01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:39.000
to be with somebody else, for instance.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.690
I confess, I have friends

01:47:40.690 --> 01:47:43.100
who have unconventional relationships.

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.590
I have friends with
conventional relationships.

01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:48.060
Any thoughts on the polyamory.

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.490
- Yeah, I do have a
couple of thoughts on it.

01:47:50.490 --> 01:47:52.100
I haven't studied it extensively,

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:56.970
but I think that the
way I would phrase it is

01:47:56.970 --> 01:48:01.970
that there's an attempt to overcome

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.410
certain evolved

01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:07.540
features of our mating psychology,

01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:10.520
but often in the service of other aspects

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.730
of our mating psychology.

01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:13.070
So what I mean by that is this.

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:15.690
So I talk about polyamory, first of all,

01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:16.993
there's a sex difference,

01:48:18.774 --> 01:48:19.607
on average, that is,

01:48:19.607 --> 01:48:21.770
men are more likely to want to initiate

01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:24.110
a polyamorous relationship than women.

01:48:24.110 --> 01:48:25.310
There are lots of exceptions.

01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:29.643
And I actually know of at least
one exception, personally,

01:48:29.643 --> 01:48:33.300
friends of mine who were in
a polyamorous relationship,

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.640
but the motivation for men

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.870
is that evolved desire for sexual variety.

01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:43.870
So it gives him access to a
wider variety of sex partners,

01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:46.950
which is part of our
evolved sexual psychology,

01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:48.850
especially for men.

01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:51.080
Women, one motivation,

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.590
women also have a desire
for sexual variety,

01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:56.890
on average tends not to be
as great as that of men,

01:48:56.890 --> 01:48:58.420
but also have it.

01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:02.600
But some women agree to a
polyamorous relationship

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.620
as a mate retention tactic.

01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:08.280
That is, this guy in order to keep him,

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.987
she has to agree to the relationship.

01:49:10.987 --> 01:49:14.050
And so, the motivations
for engaging in polyamory

01:49:14.050 --> 01:49:16.420
are somewhat sex differentiated.

01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:17.253
- [Andrew] On average.

01:49:17.253 --> 01:49:19.570
- On average, on average,
there are lots of exceptions.

01:49:19.570 --> 01:49:22.490
So now when it comes to sexual jealousy,

01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:25.190
there is this recognition that there,

01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:26.320
the way that I would frame it,

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.400
there's this evolved emotion where

01:49:29.290 --> 01:49:32.490
it triggers sexual jealousy,
seeing your partner having sex,

01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:34.320
or imagining your partner having sex,

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.580
or falling in love with someone else.

01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:38.180
And, but interestingly,

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:39.890
and there haven't been studies on this,

01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:42.320
but I know of this one polyamorous couple

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.863
where they reported to me,

01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:46.580
both of them reported to me.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.040
She said she doesn't,

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.410
it doesn't bother her
at all if her husband,

01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:53.710
they're married, has sex with other women.

01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:54.543
They allow it.

01:49:54.543 --> 01:49:57.220
I think it's like every
Thursday night or whatever,

01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.870
different couples that
have different rules.

01:49:59.870 --> 01:50:02.840
But one time she saw him
walking down the street,

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.360
hand in hand affectionately
with a former girlfriend

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.640
and she got extremely jealous.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:11.340
So because it signaled
an emotional connection.

01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.290
So the sexual didn't bother
her, the emotional did.

01:50:14.290 --> 01:50:16.653
She happened to be bisexual.

01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:22.090
And her partner said
that it really upset him

01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:23.920
when she slept with other men,

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.980
but it was fine if she
slept with other women.

01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.120
- I think that's a fairly common thing

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:29.960
that among the men that I know

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.220
that are in polyamorous relationships,

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:33.150
that that's a fairly common statement.

01:50:33.150 --> 01:50:34.600
- Yeah, and so he kept trying

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:38.300
these inter-nesting manipulations,

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:41.620
trying to encourage her
to sleep with other women,

01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:43.103
but not with men.

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.490
And in her case,

01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:47.800
encouraging him not to
get emotionally involved

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.400
with other women, but the sex was okay.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.000
So I think that, you know,

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.190
I think that in the modern environment,

01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:56.620
we have a very rich and complicated

01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.650
evolved mating psychology.

01:50:58.650 --> 01:51:03.110
And what we're doing in these
novel forms or semi-novel,

01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:06.653
because these things have a
pretty deep history themselves,

01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:11.090
that we're attempting to

01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:13.970
maximize some of our evolved desires

01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:18.600
while keeping quiescent
other evolved aspects

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:21.000
of our sexual psychology, like jealousy.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.070
So satisfying or desire
for sexual variety,

01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:26.020
but keeping jealousy at bay,

01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.650
and different couples
do it in different ways,

01:51:27.650 --> 01:51:29.750
so as you alluded to.

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:34.487
So I know one couple live in
Los Angeles and the woman,

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:35.810
the woman said,

01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:38.150
she gives her husband
permission to have an affair,

01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:38.983
sleep with other women,

01:51:38.983 --> 01:51:41.930
as long it's outside of
the city limits of LA.

01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:45.690
And this other couple, it
has to be Thursday night,

01:51:45.690 --> 01:51:47.740
you know, and so different
people have different plans.

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:48.940
- Putting constraints on,

01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.160
but the constraints are specific

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.641
and somewhat arbitrary
to the relationship.

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:56.470
- Yeah, they're specific.

01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:59.160
And often in polyamorous relationships,

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.900
people talk it out,

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:04.000
and come to an agreement
on what is acceptable

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.253
and what's out of bounds.

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:10.320
But in a way, I mean,
it, in a way it's just,

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:13.580
you know, we can't change our
evolved sexual psychology,

01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:14.590
I don't think.

01:52:14.590 --> 01:52:17.860
What we can do is we can
activate certain elements of it,

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:22.480
and keep others quiescent
and that's all good.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:25.680
And in a way we do in
the modern environment.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:28.830
So even to take it outside of polyamory,

01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:33.810
pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography,

01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:34.830
what does that do?

01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:36.240
Well, there's a big sex difference there.

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.040
Men tend to consume it
a lot more than women.

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.070
The forms of the
pornography are different,

01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:43.690
but in a way, the pornography,

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.640
what it does is it parasitized

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.060
men's evolved desire for sexual variety.

01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:48.893
So they can,

01:52:50.578 --> 01:52:52.230
in some sense,

01:52:52.230 --> 01:52:55.660
psychologically experience sexual,

01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.620
a variety of different women sexually

01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.210
without actually doing it,

01:52:59.210 --> 01:53:01.320
by just looking at their computer screen.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.620
And so, in a way,

01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:04.600
another way of phrasing that,

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:09.600
is that we create modern
novel cultural inventions

01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:14.290
in ways that satisfy our evolved desires

01:53:14.290 --> 01:53:16.500
and our evolved sexual desires.

01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.893
- Yeah, it's interesting with the

01:53:18.893 --> 01:53:20.710
kind of explosion of online pornography.

01:53:20.710 --> 01:53:24.020
I have a colleague at Stanford
in psychiatry, Anna Lembke,

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.340
who studies the dopamine system,

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:27.750
and she mentioned two things of interest.

01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:31.240
One is that not only is
there a tremendous variety

01:53:32.423 --> 01:53:33.720
of experiences that are available

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.040
to people to view in pornography,

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.753
but the intensity is also quite high,

01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:41.470
so much so that at least for young people

01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:43.700
who are observing a lot of pornography,

01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:46.440
it's possible, and there are
studies looking at this now,

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.090
that their brain circuits become wired

01:53:48.090 --> 01:53:49.540
to observing sexual acts,

01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:50.990
as opposed to being engaged in them,

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:53.580
which can be extremely problematic.

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:58.580
So it's a sharp blade, so to
speak this pornography thing.

01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:01.563
It isn't what it once was,
and it's evolving quickly.

01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:04.423
Very interesting.

01:54:05.690 --> 01:54:08.910
So how should one frame all this?

01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:10.970
So I imagine the number
of people listening

01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:14.593
are in relationships, or would
hope to be in a relationship.

01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:18.760
In terms of understanding
what we are selecting for,

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:21.390
consciously or subconsciously,

01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:22.770
it seems like there are common themes.

01:54:22.770 --> 01:54:27.293
It's people want to feel
attractive and attracted.

01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:30.790
People want to make sure

01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:32.500
that there's stability
of the relationship.

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.790
So when we hear about security,

01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:36.840
oftentimes I think of this
kind of warm, oxytocin,

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.040
serotonin like thing,

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.620
but this mate value, it seems
so powerful in all this,

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:44.810
assessing mate value.

01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:48.120
So how objective are people

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:51.890
about assessing their own value

01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:54.950
in terms of finding,
securing, and over time,

01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:56.120
maintaining a relationship.

01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.220
Securing is dynamic,

01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:59.463
because people age at different rates.

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.950
Is there an objective
metric of this stuff?

01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:09.050
I guess you get a lot of
statistics about somebody's image,

01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:11.590
and you come up with an average value

01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:13.130
based on the population,

01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:15.090
but how should people assess themselves?

01:55:15.090 --> 01:55:17.070
Because it seems like one of the features

01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:18.620
that would be very powerful

01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:23.200
for leading to happiness,
of good partner selection,

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:25.000
with that stable,

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.910
where one doesn't have to
resort to these Machiavellian,

01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:30.830
or diabolical, or any of
these other strategies,

01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:34.090
would be to be very honest with oneself.

01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:36.130
And how does one do that?

01:55:36.130 --> 01:55:38.390
- Yeah, great questions.

01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:42.833
And, I don't think that the
science all the answers,

01:55:44.358 --> 01:55:45.191
so a couple things.

01:55:45.191 --> 01:55:48.080
So one is that I think
people are generally

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:51.203
pretty good at self-assessing mate value.

01:55:52.130 --> 01:55:56.500
And even self-esteem has been hypothesized

01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:01.500
to be one internal monitoring
device that tracks mate value.

01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:03.190
So when we get a promotion at work,

01:56:03.190 --> 01:56:04.340
or we get a rise in status,

01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.900
we feel an elevated sense of self-esteem.

01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.550
We get fired, we get
rejected, we get ostracized,

01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:12.043
our self-esteem plummets.

01:56:13.401 --> 01:56:15.090
So, our self-evaluation,

01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:19.130
I think does track mate
value to some extent.

01:56:19.130 --> 01:56:22.290
There are people who
overestimate their mate value,

01:56:22.290 --> 01:56:25.760
people high on narcissism in particular,

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.020
and some people underestimate
their mate value.

01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:33.040
Another important element is that there's

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.890
consensual mate value.

01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:38.860
So that is if you asked a
group of a hundred people,

01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.290
there's a fair amount of consensus

01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:42.900
that this person's an
eight, that person's a six.

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:46.210
But there are also individual
differences in mate value.

01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:48.900
So one example is I know a woman

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:53.900
who's a professor and she
places a high premium on guys

01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:57.470
who are deeply steeped
in Russian literature,

01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:59.220
which she is, so that she can have

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:01.830
in-depth conversations
about Russian literature.

01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:04.480
- Note to young men,
learn Russian literature.

01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:06.210
- Well, but this is high,

01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:09.270
and it's a dimension of mate
value that's important for her,

01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:12.387
but probably not important
for a lot of other people.

01:57:12.387 --> 01:57:15.040
And so, whereas other
people let's say might be,

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.040
let's say you're into
football or some sport,

01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:23.960
and the other partner
thinks sports are stupid,

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:26.410
you know, then that's, you know,

01:57:26.410 --> 01:57:27.980
someone who's also into sports

01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:29.870
is going to be higher
in mate value for you.

01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:31.820
So there are these individual differences

01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:34.130
in components of mate
value, which is good,

01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:35.330
because that means if everyone

01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:37.780
were going after the same people,

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:40.440
and there was total
consensus on mate value,

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.047
then there would be a
lot of mateless people,

01:57:43.047 --> 01:57:45.310
and a lot of problems in the world,

01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:47.935
and a lot of dissatisfied people.

01:57:47.935 --> 01:57:49.860
So, both are important,

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:53.610
the consensual aspects
and the individually

01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:56.923
differentiated components of mate value.

01:57:58.590 --> 01:58:02.183
But in terms of accuracy of assessment,

01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:06.540
there are no good measures
scientifically to do this,

01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:09.610
because it's sufficiently complicated.

01:58:09.610 --> 01:58:13.420
So I mentioned, you know,
we've mentioned maybe half,

01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:16.840
maybe a dozen different
components of mate value,

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:19.810
physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability,

01:58:19.810 --> 01:58:21.333
health status, et cetera.

01:58:23.110 --> 01:58:24.830
And these aren't the only ones.

01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:28.600
So I teach a course on
psychology of human mating.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.760
And I ask the people, it's a large course,

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.320
a couple of hundred people,

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:34.760
tell me, what do women want in a mate?

01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.620
And so I start it with the blackboard.

01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:38.000
This is back in the old days

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.410
when there was a blackboard, a
piece of chalk, and they say,

01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:42.120
I want a mate who has
a good sense of humor.

01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:43.460
So I write sense of humor.

01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:45.300
Intelligent, kind.

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:49.020
And so I go through this, and
I go through five blackboards,

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:51.780
and then I run out of
space, over what women want.

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:52.707
Now I do the same for men,

01:58:52.707 --> 01:58:54.320
and men kind of run out of space

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.180
after about a blackboard and a half.

01:58:56.180 --> 01:59:00.300
But what that tells me
is that these qualities

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.960
are large in number and
complicated in nature.

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:06.810
So you say you want a guy
who's nice and generous?

01:59:06.810 --> 01:59:07.643
And they say, yeah.

01:59:07.643 --> 01:59:09.570
So like a guy who at
the end of every month

01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:10.610
takes his whole paycheck

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:14.080
and gives it to the
wino, a homeless person.

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:17.450
Well no, not that generous,
generous toward me,

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:19.580
but not toward everyone else.

01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:21.210
Nice in general,

01:59:21.210 --> 01:59:24.930
but not so nice that
they're getting exploited.

01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:27.710
So, or even, now there's something,

01:59:27.710 --> 01:59:29.290
you can't be too healthy.

01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:31.470
So if you put it, that's uni-dimensional,

01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:32.580
but you want a guy,

01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:36.800
women want a guy who's
confident, but not too confident,

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.240
because too confident will
mean he's either arrogant,

01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:43.223
narcissistic, or not
sufficiently manipulable.

01:59:45.450 --> 01:59:47.750
So anyway, my point is that

01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:48.840
because there are so many

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.940
different components of mate value,

01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:54.410
and that they vary in amount.

01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:57.210
So it's not just listing the
qualities and summing them up.

01:59:57.210 --> 01:59:58.630
They vary in amount.

01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:02.430
It's a very complicated
endeavor to assess accurately,

02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:06.000
but I think people have
a good intuitive sense

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.200
of people's relative mate value,

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.280
especially if you're in a group

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:13.040
and you've been able to interact
with them for a long time.

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:17.530
And one indication is, again,
that attention structure.

02:00:17.530 --> 02:00:18.970
How many other people

02:00:18.970 --> 02:00:20.920
will really want to mate with this person?

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:23.550
That's a good cue that
they're high in mate value.

02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:25.170
Nobody wants to mate with you,

02:00:25.170 --> 02:00:27.543
then cue that your low in mate value.

02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:30.900
- Reminds of the time when
one is trying to decide

02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:32.313
who to ask to the prom.

02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:35.650
There's a complicated assessment

02:00:35.650 --> 02:00:38.240
based on who one would like to go with,

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.140
whether or not you're already partnered,

02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:41.580
who would say yes, who would say no,

02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.780
because there's a risk in rejection too,

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.430
because that if I'm guessing correctly,

02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:50.980
could lower one's own
perceived mate value.

02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:52.310
- Getting rejected.
- Right.

02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:55.090
Frequency of rejections probably
doesn't lend itself well

02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:59.600
to increasing one's own
view of their mate value.

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:01.870
- Right, which is why many guys have

02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:04.750
what I call mating anxiety.

02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:08.180
That is, they don't approach women

02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.460
because they risk getting shot down.

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:13.033
- They're trying to maintain that number,

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:16.440
by reducing the amount of data.

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.850
- [David] Right.

02:01:17.850 --> 02:01:18.950
- Very interesting.

02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:23.005
- But it backfires in
the modern environment.

02:01:23.005 --> 02:01:25.660
So, there's a famous
psychologist, Albert Ellis,

02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:29.110
who had mating anxiety and
he assigned himself the task

02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:31.140
of asking, like,

02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:32.430
I can't remember what the number was,

02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:34.900
but let's say 50 women out on dates.

02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:37.210
He lived in New York City,
so there was a lot of women.

02:01:37.210 --> 02:01:39.507
- He could just stand still
and they would stream past him.

02:01:39.507 --> 02:01:44.507
- And he asked 50 women on a
date, you know, every week.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:47.840
And he said, after two weeks
his mating anxiety disappeared,

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.887
because most of them said, buzz off creep,

02:01:50.887 --> 02:01:52.450
[indistinct]

02:01:52.450 --> 02:01:55.250
Actually getting rejected didn't
cause my world to collapse.

02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:56.387
And it actually was okay.

02:01:56.387 --> 02:02:00.180
And so he kind of inured
himself to this rejection.

02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:02.950
And so it ended up,

02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:05.090
he ended up doing quite
well on his mating life.

02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:08.130
- Another point for cognitive
behavioral desensitization.

02:02:08.130 --> 02:02:08.963
- [David] Exactly.

02:02:08.963 --> 02:02:10.490
- He ran the experiment.

02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:11.900
Just a couple more questions.

02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:15.853
Earlier, you mentioned
self-deception-based deception,

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.360
or something of that sort.

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.570
Self-deception that people aren't

02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:23.260
always trying to convince
somebody else of something

02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:24.810
that secretly they know isn't true,

02:02:24.810 --> 02:02:27.600
but that they deceive themselves.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:28.930
Could you embellish on that a little bit?

02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:31.220
- Well, this is actually, this hypothesis

02:02:32.066 --> 02:02:34.520
is the famous evolutionary
biologist, Robert Trivers,

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.740
first advanced this
hypothesis in the preface,

02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:42.360
in 1976 to Dawkins'
book, The Selfish Gene.

02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.080
And he's subsequently
written more about it,

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.920
both in scientific article
and in a more popular book.

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:54.920
But the idea is, the core idea
is that successful deception

02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:57.800
is facilitated by self-deception.

02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.600
So if you really believe that in X,

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:04.740
then you're going to be a
more successful salesman

02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.740
to convince other people of X.

02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:08.310
So if you believe you're,

02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:10.380
let's say a 10 in mate value,

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:13.600
you truly believe it, even if you're not,

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.780
I'm going to have a more successful time

02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.830
convincing you that I am as well.

02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:20.220
And so the hypothesis is basically

02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:24.470
that people self-deceive
in order to increase

02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:26.843
the effectiveness of actual deception.

02:03:29.590 --> 02:03:31.660
But I think that there are people who

02:03:33.970 --> 02:03:36.910
are so in one other
dimension I'll mention too,

02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:39.610
is that as that animals
often take each other

02:03:39.610 --> 02:03:41.790
at our own word for things.

02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:43.620
So if we're self-confident,

02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:46.100
people assume that we must have the goods

02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:48.040
to back up that self-confidence.

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:50.370
If we're a quivering mass of insecurity,

02:03:50.370 --> 02:03:51.500
people believe, well,

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:54.240
we don't have the goods
to back up anything.

02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:58.210
And so people use other people's displays

02:03:58.210 --> 02:04:01.840
of their self-confidence
as a cue to their goods.

02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:04.920
And it's in general,
a pretty reliable cue,

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:07.660
but then they are over
overestimates and underestimates,

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:10.350
as we've talked about,
like with narcissism.

02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:13.215
- Yeah, we see this
with the job candidates.

02:04:13.215 --> 02:04:16.590
You are taught to look very
carefully at the application

02:04:16.590 --> 02:04:18.540
and consider all aspects,

02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:22.010
but ultimately you consider
that also in light of, you know,

02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:24.360
how firmly someone believes in the vision

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:27.980
of what they're trying to
bring to the profession.

02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:31.250
And that's a, I think, largely
a subconscious process,

02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:33.820
and being aware of it
can be helpful, but yeah,

02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:35.550
when somebody is confident
and you tend to think that

02:04:35.550 --> 02:04:37.580
they're going to get where
they say they're going to go

02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:40.550
and it acts as a bit of a heuristic,

02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:44.080
for not needing, the impulses,
that one then doesn't need

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:46.260
to go vet all the information
quite as carefully.

02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.040
But if, I guess if one
is aware of it, then,

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:49.983
you know, to dig deeper,

02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:54.200
because it seems like there's
a lot of deception going on.

02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:55.873
- Yeah well,

02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:00.750
and something we talked about earlier,

02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:05.610
people high on psychopathy
are very good at deception.

02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:09.950
I don't know whether they
are good at self-deception,

02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:12.453
or whether they're just
really good deceivers.

02:05:14.712 --> 02:05:16.262
But they can be very effective.

02:05:17.435 --> 02:05:20.200
Out in California, you
live out in California,

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:23.550
I'm sure you've seen your
fair share of cases like that.

02:05:23.550 --> 02:05:24.743
- Oh yeah, I think,

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:29.200
across today's discussion and
various examples pop to mind

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:32.930
of seeing these features in humans.

02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:34.120
It's so interesting.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:36.640
I find the work that you
do incredibly interesting.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.620
I think this field of
evolutionary psychology

02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:40.033
is fascinating.

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:43.850
And, I hope, I said it
before, but I'll say it again.

02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:46.030
I feel like neuroscience
and evolutionary psychology

02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:48.160
are nudging towards one another.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:51.640
And it's only a matter
of time before they merge

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:53.240
in some formal way.

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.420
I mean, there is the work for instance,

02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:56.700
on polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct],

02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:58.010
and levels of vasopressin,

02:05:58.010 --> 02:05:59.900
but it's a big leap to go from vasopressin

02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.380
in a [indistinct],

02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:03.100
no disrespect to that beautiful work,

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:04.480
but to humans and say, oh,

02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:07.320
vasopressin inhaler are going to make you

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:08.891
monogamous or something.

02:06:08.891 --> 02:06:10.320
I think that's probably got the direction

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.200
of the effect wrong,
but you get the point.

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.620
- Yeah, no, I think
you're absolutely right.

02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:15.700
And I think it will happen.

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.270
I think it's starting to happen.

02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:20.300
And it will happen because
getting at the neuroscience

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:22.150
is getting at the underlying mechanisms

02:06:22.150 --> 02:06:23.870
that are driving the process.

02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:25.110
So, you know,

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:27.930
what an evolutionary
perspective brings to bear,

02:06:27.930 --> 02:06:32.120
is evolved function and
ultimate explanation,

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:35.160
the selective forces
that created adaptations,

02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:37.200
the functions of those adaptations,

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.850
and the neuroscience brings well,

02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:40.840
what is the underlying machinery

02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:43.763
that these mechanisms are instantiated in?

02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.290
- It'd be wonderful to
collaborate someday.

02:06:46.290 --> 02:06:48.120
Maybe we'll do a brain imaging study

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.570
on jealousy or something,

02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:52.737
and I don't know, you're the psychologist.

02:06:52.737 --> 02:06:55.587
You would come up with the
beautiful experimental design.

02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:58.290
I'm certain that people are going to want

02:06:58.290 --> 02:06:59.670
to learn more about your work.

02:06:59.670 --> 02:07:00.950
Certainly we will give them links

02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:03.530
to your social media
and other other sites.

02:07:03.530 --> 02:07:04.910
You've written a tremendous number

02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:06.363
of really interesting books.

02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:09.440
Tell us about your most recent book,

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.610
and maybe some of the others,

02:07:10.610 --> 02:07:12.460
that if people are
interested in these topics,

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:15.280
and they want to learn more,
that they could explore.

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.790
- Sure.

02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:17.950
Okay so, well,

02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:21.310
my most recent book is
called, When Men Behave Badly:

02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:23.990
The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,

02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:25.860
Harassment, and Assault,

02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:29.140
and that book deals with
conflict between the sexes,

02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:30.310
sexual conflict.

02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:33.190
And so it deals with them both

02:07:33.190 --> 02:07:36.950
in what I call mating market conflicts.

02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:38.640
Some of the topics we've
been talking about,

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:42.010
deception in internet
dating, and things like that.

02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:46.080
Second is conflict that occurs
within mating relationships,

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.250
of the sort that we've
been talking about as well,

02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:50.610
financial infidelity,
emotional infidelity,

02:07:50.610 --> 02:07:52.340
sexual infidelity,

02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:55.270
coping with conflict
within a relationship.

02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:57.300
And I actually have some suggestions

02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:59.690
for strategies for coping with conflict

02:07:59.690 --> 02:08:01.400
within a relationship.

02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:05.150
Coping in dealing with
the aftermath of breakups.

02:08:05.150 --> 02:08:06.620
So often there's an asymmetry.

02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:08.970
One person wants to break
up, the other doesn't.

02:08:08.970 --> 02:08:11.860
So I talk about coping in the aftermath.

02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:15.190
And then I also talk in this
book, When Men Behave Badly,

02:08:15.190 --> 02:08:18.350
about some of the darker
sides of human mating,

02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:20.683
like intimate partner violence,

02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:25.570
stalking, sexual
harassment, sexual coercion.

02:08:25.570 --> 02:08:26.900
So that's what that book's about.

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:27.743
And I think it,

02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:31.450
it's gotten well-reviewed
and people find it

02:08:31.450 --> 02:08:33.700
very useful in understanding

02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:37.230
what is otherwise a lot
of baffling phenomena.

02:08:37.230 --> 02:08:39.920
Why do men and women seem
at odds with each other

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:41.200
in so many domains?

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.650
Why does some of these recurrent forms

02:08:43.650 --> 02:08:45.740
of sexual conflict occur?

02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.820
So that's what that book's about.

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:50.160
My previous book, so my first book,

02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:51.570
which I've had the good fortune

02:08:51.570 --> 02:08:54.120
to be able to revise a couple of times,

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:57.510
deals more broadly with
human mating strategies.

02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:59.410
It's called, The Evolution of Desire:

02:08:59.410 --> 02:09:01.360
Strategies of Human Mating.

02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:03.300
And it gives people a broad overview

02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:05.910
of what people want in a mate,

02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:09.600
tactics of attraction,
tactics of mate retention,

02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:11.970
and so forth, throughout
the whole mating process,

02:09:11.970 --> 02:09:15.700
serial mating, causes of
divorce, and so forth.

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:18.250
And then even more broadly,

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:19.630
I have a textbook called,

02:09:19.630 --> 02:09:23.550
Evolutionary Psychology:
The New Science of the Mind,

02:09:23.550 --> 02:09:26.840
which is in its sixth edition right now,

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:29.190
and it's the most widely used textbook

02:09:29.190 --> 02:09:33.800
in evolutionary psychology
around North America and Europe.

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.450
And actually it's been translated

02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:38.240
even into Arabic and other countries.

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:41.130
So that deals somewhat with mating,

02:09:41.130 --> 02:09:43.890
but also deals with survival problems,

02:09:43.890 --> 02:09:46.543
our evolved fears and phobias,

02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.680
issues about kin and family,

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:54.470
extended family, friendships,
social hierarchy,

02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:59.160
status hierarchies,
warfare, and other topics.

02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:01.630
So the evolutionary psychology textbook

02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:03.360
is the broadest book.

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:05.620
And then maybe the second broadest is

02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:09.350
The Evolution of Desire:
Strategies of Human Mating.

02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:12.720
And then for those interested
in conflict between the sexes,

02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:15.650
the latest book, When Men Behave Badly.

02:10:15.650 --> 02:10:16.603
- Fantastic.

02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:19.570
I love your work.

02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:23.150
I'm so grateful for the
clarity and depth and rigor

02:10:23.150 --> 02:10:26.040
with which you do it,
and you convey it to us.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.240
I know I speak for many people

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.730
when I just want to say thank you.

02:10:29.730 --> 02:10:32.650
This is a tremendously
informative conversation.

02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:33.634
- Thank you.

02:10:33.634 --> 02:10:34.957
Well, it's been a delight to talk with you

02:10:34.957 --> 02:10:38.900
and I hope we do engage in
that research collaboration

02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:41.470
of merging neuroscience and
evolutionary psychology.

02:10:41.470 --> 02:10:42.350
- Let's do it.

02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:43.183
- All right.
- Great,

02:10:43.183 --> 02:10:44.016
thank you David.

02:10:44.016 --> 02:10:44.849
- Thank you.

02:10:44.849 --> 02:10:45.682
- Thank you for joining me

02:10:45.682 --> 02:10:48.220

02:11:42.610 --> 02:11:44.700
In many episodes of the
Huberman Lab podcast,

02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:46.450
we discuss supplements.

02:11:46.450 --> 02:11:48.700
While supplements might
not be for everybody,

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.110
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,

02:11:51.110 --> 02:11:52.950
for things like sleep and focus

02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:55.870
and other aspects of human
performance in daily life.

02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:56.960
One issue with supplements

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:59.680
is that many of the
supplement companies out there

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:02.260
are subpar with respect to quality,

02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:05.750
and they are not precise
about the specific amounts

02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:08.940
of the various supplement
contents that they include.

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:10.610
For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,

02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:13.250
T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements

02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:15.780
are known to have the
highest levels of stringency,

02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:17.720
in terms of the quality
of the ingredients,

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:20.090
and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients.

02:12:20.090 --> 02:12:20.923
In other words,

02:12:20.923 --> 02:12:24.170
what's listed on the label is
what's actually in the bottle.

02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:25.640
If you want to see what
supplements I take,

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:30.340
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.290
There, you can see the supplements I take.

02:12:32.290 --> 02:12:34.490
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:37.150
And if you navigate further
into the Thorne site,

02:12:37.150 --> 02:12:40.290
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:12:40.290 --> 02:12:41.970
you can also get 20% off

02:12:41.970 --> 02:12:44.500
any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes.

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:45.360
Thank you once again,

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.010
for joining me for my discussion
with Doctor David Buss

02:12:48.010 --> 02:12:50.350
about human mate selection and strategy,

02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:53.610
and many other extremely
interesting topics today,

02:12:53.610 --> 02:12:55.380
and last but not least,

02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:57.330
thank you for your interest in science.
