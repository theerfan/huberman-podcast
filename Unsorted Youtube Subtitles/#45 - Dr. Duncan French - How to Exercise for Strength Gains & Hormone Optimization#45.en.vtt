00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.920
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.690
where we discuss science,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.963
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.010
and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.230
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.180
Today, I have the pleasure of
introducing Dr. Duncan French

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.150
as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.600
Dr. French is the Vice
President of Performance

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.760
at the UFC Performance Institute,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.950
and he has over 20 years of experience

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.300
working with elite, professional,
and Olympic athletes.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.640
Prior to joining the UFC,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.740
French was the Director
of Performance Science

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.700
at the University of Notre Dame,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.900
and he has many, many
quality peer-reviewed studies

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.920
to his name, exploring, for instance,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.270
how the particular order of exercise,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.490
whether or not one
performs endurance exercise

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.370
prior to resistance
training or vice versa,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.470
how that impacts performance
of various movements

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.350
and endurance training protocols,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.230
as well as the impact on hormones,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.390
such as testosterone, estrogen,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.000
and some of the stress
hormones such as cortisol.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.730
He's also done fascinating work

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.010
exploring how neurotransmitters,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.960
things like dopamine and epinephrin,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320
also called adrenaline,
can impact hormones,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.100
and how hormones can impact
neurotransmitter release.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.750
What's particularly unique
about Dr. French's work

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.100
is that he's figured out
specific training protocols

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.290
that can maximize, for
instance, testosterone output

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.860
or reduce stress hormone output

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.740
in order to maximize
the effects of training

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.690
in the short-term and in the longterm.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.020
So, today, you're going to
learn a lot of protocols.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.630
Whether or not you're
into resistance training

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.900
or endurance training, you
will learn, for instance,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.190
how to regulate the
duration of your training

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.380
and the type of training that you do

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.130
in order to get the maximum benefit

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.220
from that training over time.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.650
So whether or not you are somebody

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.820
who just exercises
recreationally for your health,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.670
whether or not you're an
amateur or professional athlete,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.200
or whether or not you're just
trying to maximize your health

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.530
through the use of endurance
and/or resistance training,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.890
today's discussion will have
a wealth of takeaways for you.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.150
There are only a handful of people

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.500
working at the intersection
of elite performance,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.810
mechanistic science, and
that can do so in a way

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.290
that leads to direct,
immediately applicable protocols

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.060
that anybody can benefit from.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.510
Dr. French also provides some
incredibly important insights

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.050
about the direction
that sport and exercise

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.750
are taking in the world today,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.200
and their applications towards
performance and health.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.100
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.950
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.100
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.050
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.890
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.020
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.890
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.960
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.940
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.727
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:53.630
I have spent my career
working on the visual system,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.890
and I can tell you that everything

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.550
about the way that ROKA eyeglasses

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.290
and sunglasses were designed
was with performance in mind.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.060
First of all, they're
extremely lightweight

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.580
so you actually forget
that you're wearing them

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.530
most of the time.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.010
Second of all, even if you get sweaty,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.920
if you're running or
biking or it's a hot day

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.850
or you're running around and just happen

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.190
to be perspiring quite a lot,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.210
they don't slip off your
face, which is terrific.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.470
They also have a great aesthetic

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.960
and they have a lot of
different styles to choose from.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.080
The clarity of the lenses is superb.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.430
I don't think there's
a match for the clarity

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.630
of ROKA glasses out there.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.740
And if there is, I'm not aware of it.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.700
They are absolutely crystal clear.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.160
And that's true in any environment,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.830
whether or not you're
working in a dim environment

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.170
or a bright environment,
the clarity is unmatched.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.890
If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.510
you can go to roka.com.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.410

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.190
to save 20% off your first order.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.440
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.400
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.110
that are uniquely tailored
to your sleep needs.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.670
All of us have unique sleep needs,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.060
and we should be sleeping on a
mattress that's ideal for us.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.420
If you go to the Helix site,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.150
they have a quick two minute quiz,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.740
ask you a number of questions
about whether or not

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.500
you sleep on your side,
your back, your stomach.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.630
Do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera?

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.150
Maybe you don't have the
answers to those questions,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.100
which is fine.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.420
They'll match you to the mattress

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.760
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.490
I took that quiz and about 10 months ago

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.110
I started sleeping on
the Dusk Helix mattress.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.420
That's D-U-S-K.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.050
That's the mattress that's ideal for me,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.640
and I'm sleeping better
than I ever have before.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.410
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.180
go to helixsleep.com/Huberman,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.630
take their two minute sleep quiz,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.480
and they'll match you
to a customized mattress

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.580
and you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.830
and two free pillows.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.630
That's helixsleep.com/Huberman.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.370
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.880
Headspace is a meditation app

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.590
that's backed by 25 published studies.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.650
By now I think most
people have heard about

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.330
or experienced the benefits of meditation;

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.200
improved focus, better
sleep, reduced stress,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.850
more creativity and insight.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.090
There are just so many studies out there

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.810
that support those claims.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.680
The challenge, however,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.680
is sticking to a meditation practice.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.150
And over the years, I
confess there have been times

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.790
when I've meditated regularly
and then I stopped meditating,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.700
even though it always
provides benefits for me

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.290
the first time I do it
and every time I do it.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.740
With the Headspace app,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.000
it makes it very easy
to meditate consistently

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.240
because they have different
types of meditations

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.040
to select from, and they
come in different durations.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.320
So sometimes I only have three
or four minutes to meditate.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.270
They have those sorts of meditations.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.270
They also have longer meditations
of 20 minutes or more.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.410
If you want to try Headspace,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.550
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.150
And if you do that, you'll
get a free one month trial

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.510
with Headspace's full
library of meditations

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.810
that you can use in any situation.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.040
This is the best deal offered
by Headspace right now.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.170
So, again, if you're interested,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.253
go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.950
And now, my conversation
with Dr. Duncan French.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.310
Duncan French, great to see you again.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.633
- Likewise, likewise, thank you.

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:52.250
I don't often have many
Stanford professors

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.717
in the Performance Institute,
so I'm really excited.

00:05:54.717 --> 00:05:56.270
- Oh, well, this place is amazing,

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.790
and you have a huge role
in making it what it is.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.040
The reason I'm so excited
to talk with you is that

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.200
you're one of these rare beasts
that you have been involved

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.210
in human performance
and athletic performance

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.860
at the collegiate level.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.577
You are obviously very
involved in MMA now,

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:18.850
in the UFC Performance Institute.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.880
And you also had the fortunate experience,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.060
I like to think, of doing a PhD in...

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.850
What exactly was the PhD in?

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.740
- It was exercise physiology.
- Exercise physiology.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.480
So, you're familiar also
with designing studies,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.050
control groups, all the sorts
of things that in my opinion,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.420
anyway, are kind of lacking
from the internet social media

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.720
version of exercise science,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.700
which is that people throw
out all sorts of ideas

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.990
about how people should be training,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.560
what they should be doing and eating

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.230
and not eating and doing.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.670
And certainly, science
doesn't have all the answers,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.780
but I just think it's
so rare to find somebody

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.950
that's at the convergence of
all those different fields.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.920
And so, I have a lot of
questions for you today

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.720
that I'm sure the audience are going to be

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.280
really interested in.
- Well, listen,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.480
I mean, I appreciate that.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.920
It's very humbling, and yeah,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.310
I've worked hard to get to where I am,

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.960
but I've always tried to be authentic.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960
And I think authenticity comes
alongside academic rigor,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.080
and objectivity, and insight
and knowledge base, right?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.870
At the end of the day, it's
about having confidence,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.611
having expertise and being
able to deliver that expertise

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.593
to, in my world, to athletes.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.770
And I think, and that's what
I've always tried to do.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.820
I've tried to have many strings to my bow

00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:34.180
so that I can talk with
many different hats on.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.000
You know, one day I'm talking to a coach,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.200
the next day I'm talking to an athlete,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.820
the next day I'm talking to a CEO,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.950
the next day I'm talking
to an academic professor.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.580
And so, I think being able
to wear those different hats

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.470
is certainly a skillset
that I've tried to build

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.303
throughout my career.

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:51.860
And like you said, I've
been blessed to work with,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.060
I think it was 36 different
professional or Olympic sports

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.957
last time I counted.
- Amazing.

00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:58.930
- So, yeah, it's been a wild ride.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.763
It's been great.

00:07:59.763 --> 00:08:01.833
- Which of those sports
was the most unusual?

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.620
- I've worked with crown green bowling.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.453
- Wait, what?
- Which I don't know,

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:07.932
as an American guy, I don't know-

00:08:07.932 --> 00:08:08.987
- I've never heard of it.
- How well you'd know that,

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:13.987
but basically imagine a 20
foot by 20 foot square of turf

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.720
with a small raise in the
middle, i.e. the crown.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.620
So, it slopes to the edges.
- Okay.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.430
- And then, you throw out a
white jack, a smaller ball,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.990
and then you roll out larger balls

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.048
to try and get closest to the jack.

00:08:30.048 --> 00:08:32.517
It's a very European thing, let's say.

00:08:32.517 --> 00:08:34.600
- Interesting.
- But yeah, sports performance

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.122
in crown green bowling, and there you go.

00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:37.540
- All right.
[Duncan laughing]

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.452
Wow, and then to mixed
martial arts, fighters-

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:43.137
- Absolutely, there you go.
- And everything in between.

00:08:43.137 --> 00:08:44.550
So, along those lines,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.630
can you give us a little
bit about your background?

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.520
Where'd you start out?

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.070
Where are you from originally?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.330
- Yeah, I'm from the northeast of England.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.210
So I'm from a town called
Harrogate, which is in Yorkshire,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.140
which is a northern kind of area

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.370
of the UK-
- Nice sunny weather

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.780
all year long?

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.300
- Yeah, you can imagine.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.797
Yeah, with the two weeks of
summer that we get, you know?

00:09:02.797 --> 00:09:03.710
[Duncan laughs]

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.140
But yeah, I mean, I did
my undergraduate studies

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.544
there in sports science.

00:09:07.544 --> 00:09:09.080
I did teacher training to be

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.450
a physical education teacher after that.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.170
Like most people I then
worked as a high school

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.710
physical education teacher.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.860
You know, great experience
working with kids,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.180
developing athletic qualities.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.580
But something in the
back of my mind always,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.960
I wanted more, I wanted
to be at the higher end

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.220
of elite sport.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.570
I was a failed athlete like many people.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.150
I represented my country in
different sports and things,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.953
but I never made it professionally.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.980
So, that little seed was sown
and as much as I then started

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.810
to reach out to different
areas to do a PhD,

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.920
whether it was in the UK or also,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.753
chance my arm, took a punt,

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.620
see if I could get over to the states.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.180
I mean, all my buddies
were going on gap years

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.280
after they finish university or whatever,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.020
and going to Bali and
hanging out or whatever,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.080
traveling through Thailand.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.800
And I figured, well, I've
always loved the states

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.660
and can I go and kill
two birds with one stone

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.290
and do something academic,
continue my studies,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.880
but also do it in a different environment

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.670
and get some life experience.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.140
And many, many rejections,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.440
as I'm sure you kind of aware
from different professors,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.140
whether it was Roger
Noecker or William Kramer-

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.260
- So you wrote to these folks?

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.627
- I just cold called and send
out information and saying,

00:10:21.627 --> 00:10:24.640
"Yeah, so have you got any opportunities?"

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.240
Pushed back from them all,
but dogged and kept asking,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.330
and yeah, Dr. William Kramer,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.920
who was at Ball State University
in Indiana at the time,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.960
a muscle neuroendocrinologist
and researcher

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.393
in muscle physiology
using resistance training,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.750
he basically said, listen,
I can guarantee your funding

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.020
for the first year of your
studies, but not the next three.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.498
- Sounds like a typical academic response.

00:10:46.498 --> 00:10:48.067
- Yeah.
- I can take care of you,

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:50.320
but not that well necessarily.
- Right.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.610
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah, so, I spoke

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.490
to my parents and said,
"Hey, can we take a punt?"

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.340
And they were great in supporting me.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.670
And yeah, long story short,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.990
came out to begin my PhD at Ball State.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.960
After a year, Dr. Kramer
transferred to UConn,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.470
Connecticut, in Storrs,
in the Northeast there.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.350
And I transferred with him and yeah,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.525
four great years with my
PhD and getting my PhD

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:16.960
with a really prolific
research group that looked at

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.990
neuroendocrinology, hormonal work,

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.610
but using a resistance training

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.310
primarily as an exercise
stressor as a major mechanism,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.150
and then looking at all
the different physiologies

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.770
off the back of resistance training.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.730
- Yeah, you guys were
enormously productive.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.220
I found dozens of papers
on how weight training

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.223
impacts hormones and your
name is on all of 'em.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.890
And it's remarkable.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.230
I have a question about this.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.380
I'll just inject a question

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.620
about weight training and hormones.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.450
You hear this all the
time that doing these big,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.820
heavy compound movements
or resistance training

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.150
increases androgens, things
like testosterone, DHT,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.393
DHEA, and so forth.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.780
Does anyone know how
that actually happens?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.780
Like what is it about
engaging motor neurons

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.657
under heavy loads sends a
signal to the endocrine system,

00:12:07.657 --> 00:12:09.680
"Hey, release testosterone."

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.940
I've never actually been able
to find that in a textbook.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.047
- [Duncan] Yeah, well, I mean-

00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:15.387
- And how can I do more of that?

00:12:15.387 --> 00:12:16.220
[both laughing]

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.470
- Yeah, as much as I know, and again,

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.570
I'm digging out into the
annals of Duncan French's

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.370
kind of brain now, but yeah.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.000
I mean, I think it's a
stress response, right?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.170
It's mechanical stress
and it's metabolic stress.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.700
And these are the downstream
regulation of testosterone

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.363
release at the gonads comes
from many different areas.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.950
My work primarily looked at catecholamines

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.100
and sympathetic arousal.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.660
- So things like epinephrin, adrenaline?

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.280
- Correct, yeah, epinephrin,
adrenaline, and noradrenaline,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.100
how they were signaling;

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.190
the signaling cascade using the HPA axis,

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.100
releasing cortisol,
and then looking at how

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.250
that also influenced the
adrenal medulla to release

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.010
androgens and then signaling
that at the gonads.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.440
- That raises an interesting question.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.980
So, in presumably weight
training in women,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.733
people who don't have testes
also it increases testosterone.

00:13:11.733 --> 00:13:13.100
- Yes, yeah.
- And is that purely

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.040
through the adrenals?

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.080
When women lift weights,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.770
their adrenal glands release testosterone?

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.603
- Absolutely.

00:13:17.603 --> 00:13:19.140
I mean, that is the only area

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.440
of testosterone release for females.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.590
And yes, it's the same downstream cascade.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.370
Obviously the extent to which it happens

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.310
is significantly less in females,

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.580
but there's good data out there that shows

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.340
females can increase their
anabolic environment,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.520
their internal anabolic milieu

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.490
using resistance training as a stressor.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.890
And then they get the
consequent muscle tissue growth,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.410
whether it's tendon,
ligament, adaptations,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.360
the beneficial consequences
of resistance training,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.860
which is driven by anabolic stimuli.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.390
- Yeah, I have two questions about that.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.830
The first one is something
that you mentioned,

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.630
which is that the androgens,
the testosterone comes from

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.410
the adrenals under
resistance loads in women.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.090
Is the same true in men?

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.380
I mean, we hear that the
testes produce testosterone

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.370
when we weight train for
men that have testes,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.590
but do we know whether
or not it's the adrenals

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.170
or the testes in men that
are increasing testosterone

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.020
more or both-
- Yeah I think that-

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.270
- A little bit from each?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.990
- The field is divided presently
in as much as understanding

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.990
the acute adrenergic response
in terms of anabolic response

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.050
to exercise in an acute phase
and the exposure to a stimulus

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.340
that is stress driven,
which might be partly

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.670
from the adrenal glands,
partly from the gonads,

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.530
versus a longitudinal exposure
to anabolic environments,

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.910
which is primarily driven
by obviously the gonads

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.540
and the endocrine
environment from testosterone

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.800
release at the gonads.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.220
So, the field is split in terms
of how exercise is promoting

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.750
hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:00.280
And whether that is very
much an adrenal stimuli,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.960
or if that's significant
enough in these acute responses

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.960
versus the longitudinal
exposure to just elevated

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.730
basal levels of anabolic
testosterone habitual level.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.500
- So, it sounds like with most
things, it's probably both.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.502
It's probably the adrenals-

00:15:14.502 --> 00:15:15.660
- Absolutely, yeah.
- And the gonads.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.850
And then you mentioned that testosterone

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.980
can have enhancing
effects or growth effects

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.740
on tendon and ligament also.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.190
You don't often hear about that.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.860
People always think, testosterone, muscle.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.030
But testosterone has a lot
of effects on other tissues

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.840
that are important for
performance it sounds like?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.090
- Yeah.
- Yeah what's the story there?

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:39.020
- Yeah, absolutely, I think
the testosterone hormone is...

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.640
I mean, listen, there's androgen receptors

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.860
on neural tissue on neural axons.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.740
- Pretty much everywhere.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.250
Yeah.
- Exactly, so,

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.750
the binding capacity of
testosterone and influence

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.680
in different tissues within the body,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.340
I touched on muscle tissue,
but the ligaments, the tendons,

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.220
even bone to some extent,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.850
testosterone has potential
to influence that

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.330
in terms of removing osteopenic

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.970
kind of characteristics, et cetera.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.970
So, yeah, it's a magic hormone let's say,

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.610
and with many end impacts
in terms of adaptation.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.210
- I definitely want to get
back to your trajectory,

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.040
but as long as we're on the
interactions between androgens,

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.690
testosterone and its derivatives
and different tissues,

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.060
from the work that you
did as a PhD student

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.490
and throughout your career,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.750
could you say that there
are some general principles

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.540
of training that favor
testosterone production,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.920
in terms of that somebody who's not

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.620
an elite athlete could use?

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.980
Somebody who's already adapted
to weight training somewhat,

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.240
like they know the difference between

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.260
a dumbbell and a barbell,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.820
and they know the various movements,

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.050
they're not going to damage themselves.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.960
But once they're doing that, I mean,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.890
I've heard shorter sessions are better

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.150
than longer sessions, but
in rep loads, weight...

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.070
Now, there's a lot of parameter space.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.830
But if you were going to throw
out some of the parameters

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.430
that you think are most
important to pay attention to

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.270
for the typical person who's
trying to use weight training

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.970
to build or maintain muscle.
- Yeah.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.320
- Lose body fat, so body
recomposition and/or stay strong

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.610
and healthy for sport of a different kind.

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.530
- Yeah, so the work that we obviously,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.510
I was exposed to back in my PhD,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.860
it was a double-edged sword.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.140
And as much as testosterone
is really stimulated

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.430
by an intensity factor
and also a volume factor.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.120
Now, growth hormone is
a little bit different.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.630
That's largely driven by
an intensity factor alone.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.463
- Oh, really?
- Correct.

00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:31.600
- I always thought the growth
hormone was driven my volume,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.550
which just goes to show you.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.730
- Maybe I've got that wrong.
- No, no, no, no.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.250
I think you're probably right
which just goes to show you

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.533
that most of what's out
there on the internet-

00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:39.118
- Right, right.
- Is completely...

00:17:39.118 --> 00:17:41.390
Not only is it wrong,
it's usually backwards.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.280
So, no trust-
- I trust my instinct.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.630
- No, trust your instinct
because I think people

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.980
just make this stuff up.
- Right.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.390
- Because it's very hard to measure

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.990
growth hormone and testosterone.

00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:55.080
And I can't imagine most of
the stuff that I see out there

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.960
they're taking drips and
measuring free versus bound

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.793
and all this kind of stuff,

00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:01.210
but that's what you do in laboratories.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.043
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:18:02.043 --> 00:18:04.160
- You look at total composition
and you look at how much

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.390
of that is free circulating-
- Yeah.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.980
- In the system, how much is bound,

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.980
and therefore biologically
active bound to receptor,

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.000
creating an adaptation.
- Right.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.060
- But yeah, coming back
to testosterone in terms

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.670
of the training strategies,

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.030
it's largely driven by both an intensity

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.230
and a volume factor.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.650
So if you look at many of
the exercise interventions

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.280
that we use to try and investigate

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.601
and interrogate testosterone,

00:18:26.601 --> 00:18:30.570
it was usually a six by 10 protocol.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.080
So, you're touching at about-
- Six by 10 meaning?

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.470
- Yeah, six sets of 10 repetitions,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.390
which is quite a large...

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.510
60 repetitions is quite a large volume

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.460
for a single exercise.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.980
And that was usually
pitched at about 80% intense

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.970
of one repetition max intensity.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.970
- Okay, so 80% of the one
rep max, six sets of 10 reps,

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.640
separated by rest of like-

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.610
- Two minutes.
- Two minutes,

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.120
which is actually pretty fast.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.090
- Yeah.
- At least to me.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.690
Anytime you see these
two to three minutes,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.500
when you're actually watching the clock,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.560
those two minute rest
periods go by pretty fast.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.190
- By the third, fourth set
you're dying for more, yeah.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.860
- Yeah.
- And I think we formulated

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.050
that kind of exercise
protocol to really target

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.220
the release of testosterone
and try and drive up

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.910
these anabolic environments to study

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.200
the endocrine consequences.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.290
But I think that's the type of protocol

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.480
that is most advantageous for
driving anabolic environment.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.910
- And that was it for the workout?

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.130
That was it?
- Yeah, I mean,

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.200
we would do that in a back squat.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.230
So, a multi-joint, challenging exercise,

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.020
multi-muscle, multi-joint,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.810
80% load of your one repetition max.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.070
And then, six by 10.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.090
We did play around with your
classic German Volume Type,

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.710
10 by 10 kind of protocols,

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.345
but they were just
unsustainable at that 80%.

00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:52.040
The key to what we also did was
we always adjusted the loads

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.710
to make sure that it was 10
repetitions that were sustained.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.190
So if the load was too high
and an athlete or participant

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.330
had to drop the weights
on the sixth repetition,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.830
we would unload the bar and make sure

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.060
they completed the 10 repetitions.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.290
- I see.
- Bringing me back

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.920
to the point of it's an
intensity and a volume derivative

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.940
that is going to be most advantageous
for testosterone release.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.900
- That's really interesting.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.160
And one thing that you mentioned there

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.730
is especially interesting to me,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.290
which is you said when
you go from six sets

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.630
of 10 repetitions to 10
sets of 10 repetitions,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.560
it's not as beneficial and
might even be counterproductive.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.130
But to me, the difference
between six and 10 sets

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.010
is only four sets.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.310
It doesn't even sound that much.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.270
So that sort of hints at the
possibility that the thresholds

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.920
for going from a workout
that increases testosterone

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.310
to a workout that diminishes testosterone

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.060
is actually a pretty narrow margin.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.540
- Yeah and I think it comes back

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.240
to that intensity factor then.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.780
What we saw were that 10
by 10 protocol really sees

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.640
pretty significant drop-offs in the load.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.380
And again, we're trying to
stimulate with intensity,

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.960
with mechanical strain through intensity,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.210
as well as metabolic
strain through volume.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.810
And I think that's the paradigm
that you've got to look at

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.500
is that the mechanical
load has to come from

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.210
the actual weight on the bar,

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.270
and the volume is the metabolic stimulus.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.690
How much are we driving lactate?

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.962
How much you were driving glycogenolysis

00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:17.830
in terms of that type of energy system for

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.520
executing a 10 by 10 protocol?

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.100
And what we often saw was
just a significant reduction

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.400
in the intensity capabilities
of an athlete to sustain that.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.350
So we shortened the volume to try

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.090
and maintain the intensity.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.940
- Interesting.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.290
And you could imagine just
taking very long rest,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.730
keeping the session, being a big,

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.450
lazy bear in training.
- Right.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.283
- I sometimes do this.

00:21:40.283 --> 00:21:42.190
I tell myself I'm going
to work out for 45 minutes

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.710
and then two hours later, I'm done,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.310
but not because I was huffing
and puffing the whole time,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.970
but because I was training really slowly.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.880
- Right.
- Is there any evidence

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.330
that training slowly can offset
some of the negative effects

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.610
of doing a lot of volume?

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.980
- Well, it's an old adage of...

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.440
Two responses to your question.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.520
I mean, the first one, I
would say there's a difference

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.770
between 10 sets of six and six sets of 10.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.910
And I think that comes back
to the volume conversation.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.323
Six sets of 10 is driving
up metabolic stimulus.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.010
If you're doing 10 sets of six,

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.610
you can probably take it
to a higher intensity,

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.860
but you're not going to get
the same metabolic load.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.020
You're not going to get the same
internal metabolic environment

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.430
that drives the lactate release,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.920
that they will then signal
further anabolic testosterone

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.120
release because of the
lactate in your body.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.640
That's a key consideration.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.280
The rest is often the
consideration that's overlooked

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.750
out there in general population,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.180
and in many sporting environments.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.660
That the rest is as important
a program and variable

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.480
as the load and the intensity of the load,

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.920
the volume, et cetera.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.750
And yes, if you extend the volume,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.820
if you extend the duration
of your rest periods,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.990
what you're ultimately
doing is influencing

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.600
that metabolic stimulus again.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.310
You're allowing the flushing of the body,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.190
the removal of waste products,

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.530
lactate to be removed from the body,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.243
and then the metabolic
environment is reduced.

00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:09.300
- So, if I understand correctly,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.369
you want to create a metabolic stress.

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:13.460
- Absolutely.
- So, the way that I've

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.440
been training, slow and lazy,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.860
is not necessarily the best way to go?

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.730
I could, in theory, do a
45 or 60 minute session

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.870
where I pack in more work per unit time.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.480
I'm not going to be able to
quote unquote perform as well.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.396
I won't be able to lift as much.

00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:30.800
- Yep.
- I might have to unweight

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.070
the bar between sets or
maybe even during sets

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.910
if I have someone who could do that,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.830
but it sounds like that's the way to go.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.030
So, the old adage of high
intensity, short duration

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.660
is probably the way to go.
- Correct.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.920
And in layman's terms,
if the same objective,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.450
the same training goal is
just muscle tissue growth,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.530
and we're not talking
about maximal strength

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.880
or any of those type of parameters,

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.820
we're just talking about growing muscle.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.810
If there's an athlete A
and they do six sets of 10

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.970
with two minutes rest,

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.760
and there's athlete B
that does six sets of 10

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.340
with three minute rest,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.920
athlete A will likely see
the highest muscle gains.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.790
- Hm.
- Muscle hypertrophy gains

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.100
because of the metabolic
stimulus that they're driving

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.460
with the shorter rest periods.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.300
- Interesting.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.200
And for all the years that I've spent

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.470
exploring exercise
science and trying to get

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.890
this information from the
internet and various places

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.180
that this is the first time it's ever been

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.170
told to me clearly.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.920
So, basically I need to put my ego aside

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.000
and I need to not focus so
much on getting as many reps

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.760
with a given weight and
keep the rest restricted

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.390
to about two minutes.
- Yeah.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.560
- Get the work in, and then
I'll derive the benefits.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.290
- I mean, you've absolutely
nailed it to be honest.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.140
And again, if you think about human nature

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.490
and how we approach, we're
inherently lazy, right?

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.500
As humans, we want to take that rest.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.870
We want to take the time out
to recover and feel refreshed,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.610
but we're trying to create
a training stimulus.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.580
We're trying to create
a very specific stimulus

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.870
internal to the body,

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.820
and that is often driven by
the metabolic environment

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.940
at that moment in time.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.660
Now, if we allow the metabolic
environment to change

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.790
by extending the rest periods,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.640
we're not going to see as
beneficial gains at the end of it.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.890
- Very interesting.
- So, it is very much

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.247
a motivational and ego
thing rather than saying,

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:18.050
"Okay, I'm going to push
my loads as high as I can,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.820
and really challenge maximal strength,

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.370
do fewer repetitions, take
longer periods of time."

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.620
It's a completely different
approach to training.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.330
It's a different end goal.
- Interesting.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.600
And you mentioned lactate,
so it seems still a bit

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.160
controversial as to what
actually triggers hypertrophy.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.910
You hear about lactate buildup or people,

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.370
the common language is the muscle

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:37.920
gets torn and then repairs,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.100
but I don't know, does
the muscle actually tear?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.930
- I mean microtrauma.
- Okay, microtrauma.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.140
- Yeah, disruption within
the muscle tissue for sure.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.973
- Interesting.

00:25:45.973 --> 00:25:48.770
And we're talking now about
non-drug assisted people-

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.470
- Correct, yeah.
- Whose, let's just say,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.280
let's define our terms here.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.600
That whose testosterone
levels are within the range

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.933
of somewhere between 300 and
1,500 or whatever, 1,200,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.010
because it does seem that
athletes who take high levels

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.960
of exogenous androgens can do more work

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.770
and just get protein synthesis
from just doing work.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.603
- Yeah.

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:13.309
- I've seen these guys in the gym, right?

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:15.600
The telltale signs are
not that hard to spot

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.050
where they're just doing a ton of volume,

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.680
not necessarily moving that much weight,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.030
they're just bringing
blood into the tissue.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.540
And then they're loading up on,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.650
they're eating a ton of protein,

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.630
presumably 'cause they're
basically in puberty part 15.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.580
- Right.
- Right, they're on their

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.690
15th round of puberty
where during puberty,

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.560
you are a protein synthesis machine.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.210
I mean, to me, that's
pretty clear about puberty.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.043
Interesting.

00:26:40.043 --> 00:26:42.850
So, and then, in terms of,

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.900
because I know the audience
likes to try protocols,

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.823
so you described a protocol very nicely.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.530
What about day-to-day recovery?

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.280
I mean, the workout that you described

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.420
is intense, but short,

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.470
how many days a week can
the typical person do that

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.280
and sustain progress?

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.500
- Yeah, I mean, I think that
comes back to your training age

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.360
and your training history.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.860
Obviously there's a
resilience and a robustness

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.750
with an incremental training age.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.367
So, that's not a protocol
that I would advise

00:27:09.367 --> 00:27:12.170
anyone to go out and start tomorrow.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.553
- They'll be mopping
them off the gym floor.

00:27:13.553 --> 00:27:16.280
- Right, but at the same time,
it's also relative, right?

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:21.280
So 80% of your maximum at a
young training age is still 80%

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.300
versus I've been training
10 years, it's still 80%.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.083
But yes, the mechanical load
is going to be significant,

00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:28.853
it's just more tonnage, right?

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.760
But yeah, I think a protocol like that,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.990
we would look at two times a week,

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.700
something that's pretty intensive
like that, because again,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.040
it comes back to the point you make

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.310
is that you really need to
be, for want of a better term,

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.030
suffering a little bit
through that type of protocol,

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.690
both in terms of the
challenge of the load,

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.000
but also being able to
tolerate the metabolic stress

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.150
that you're exposed to.

00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:55.730
It's a bit of a sicko feeling
because of the lactate

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.580
that you're driving up.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.390
So, I wouldn't promote an athlete doing

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:03.460
that type of modality
multiple, multiple times unless

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.430
you are from the realms of bodybuilding.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.660
And then, you really,
that's the sole purpose

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.870
of what you're trying to achieve.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.870
Most athletes in most sports
have diverse requirements

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.060
in terms of outcomes that
they're trying to achieve.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.640
They're not just targeting muscle growth.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.200
Muscle growth is a conduit
to increased strength,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.980
increased power, increased
speed, obviously.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.440
So, yes, trying to get a
bigger cross-sectional area

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.500
of a muscle means that
we can produce more force

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.540
into the ground or wherever it may be,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.210
if we're a locomotive athlete.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.450
But usually, sports, men and women,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.410
are not just purely seeking muscle growth.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.961
They look for different
facets of muscle endurance

00:28:41.961 --> 00:28:45.100
or maximal muscle power, muscle strength.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.820
So, then you've got to be very creative

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.270
in how you build the workout.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.520
If it's a bodybuilder,
absolutely they're chasing

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.110
muscle growth and they're going to do so

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.530
with these types of protocols,

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.670
which sees high intensities
and high volumes of workload

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.570
on a pretty regular basis.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.290
If it's just somebody, a
weekend warrior that wants

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.020
to keep in shape and
look good, I would say,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.700
two times a week for a really
challenging workout like that,

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.830
and then flex the other types
of workouts within the week

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.900
to have more of a volume emphasis,

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.270
where you reduce the intensity

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.860
and you might just look
at larger rep ranges

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.750
from 12 to 15 to 20.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.910
Another workout where you're
looking at reducing the volume,

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.790
but increasing the intensity
and really trying to drive

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.620
different stimulus to give you
more end points of success.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.500
- Mm hm, great.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.140
No, that's really informative.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.370
Along the lines of
androgens and intensity.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.370
When I think intensity, I
think epinephrin, adrenaline.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.430
And since you have a background

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.950
in catacholamines and testosterone,

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.610
last time I was here at the
UFC Performance Institute,

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:49.840
we had a brief conversation,

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.150
and I want to make sure
I got the details right.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.650
That in the short term, and a
big increase in stress hormone

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.000
can lead to an increase in testosterone,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.410
like a parachute jump.
- Correct.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:06.410
- But so, stress can promote
the release of testosterone?

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.210
- Yeah.
- That was news to me.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.043
- Right.

00:30:09.043 --> 00:30:11.310
- We always hear about stress
suppressing testosterone,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.750
stress suppressing the immune system,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.790
all these terrible things.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.730
But in the short term,
you're saying it can actually

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.823
increase the release of testosterone.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.400
So, I have that right?
- Correct, yeah, yeah.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.720
- Okay, and so then
the second question is,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.300
does my cognitive
interpretation of the stressor

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.160
make a difference?

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.230
In other words, if I
voluntarily jump out of a plane

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.230
with a parachute, does it
have a different effect

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.300
on my testosterone than if
you shove me out of the plane

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.133
against my will?

00:30:40.133 --> 00:30:41.540
Well, presumably with a parachute too.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.620
- Right, I mean, so this
was what all my PhD work

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.423
was looking at was the
exposure to a stressor,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.500
and the pre-arousal of
how your body essentially

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.590
prepares for that stressor,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.230
and then how it manages it throughout

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.510
the exposure to the stress.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.700
And it was actually motivated
from parachute jumpers.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.800
There was an older study looking

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.730
at parachute jumpers into combat.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.630
And then, they were studying the cortisol,

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.770
the stress response, and
the epinephrin response

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:14.900
of these parachute jumpers.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.953
So, it got us thinking about, hold on,

00:31:16.953 --> 00:31:19.030
there's certain workouts
that you do that are just,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.560
they're daunting, you know?

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.360
It's like, okay, it's squat
Saturday or whatever it may be.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.510
Oh my gosh, this is going to destroy me.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.857
- Or I have to talk to this
person I don't want to talk to

00:31:29.857 --> 00:31:31.466
or you know, right?
- Exactly, yeah.

00:31:31.466 --> 00:31:33.884
- I mean, something, or
a PhD dissertation exam-

00:31:33.884 --> 00:31:35.030
- Exactly or speaking-
- Or something, yeah.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.750
- Giving public speaking
or whatever it may be.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.310
Now, we used an exercise,

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.670
we used a resistance training
protocol that these athletes

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.100
knew was going to be
very, very challenging.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.163
There's going to have
some anxiety to doing it,

00:31:48.163 --> 00:31:50.530
they knew there were going
to be some physical distress

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.000
from doing it.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.050
And therefore, their mindset
of how they were going to

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.760
approach that was already set.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.450
So what we saw 15 minutes
prior to the start

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.240
of an exposure to the
workout, the epinephrin,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.460
the noradrenaline, the
adrenaline was already starting

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.340
to prepare the body sympathetically
to go into what it knew

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.060
was going to be a very,
very challenging workout.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.570
So, that brings you back
to exercise preparation,

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.020
competition for certain preparation...

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.100
Preparation for certain
competition, excuse me.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:26.230
Pre-workout routines, the use of music,

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.930
all these different things
that we know can now

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.467
anecdotally in the gym we put into place,

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:35.270
but the data that I
presented showed that...

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.180
It was a first of its kind to
show that this link between

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.340
epinephrine and norepinephrine
release and arousal,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.140
and then consequent performance.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.930
So, force output throughout the workout

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:47.940
was intimately linked.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.310
- So, what was the takeaway there?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.650
Is it beneficial for people
to get a little stressed

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.840
about the upcoming impending event?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.880
Whether or not it's a lift in the gym

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.330
or whether or not it's talking
to somebody that you might be

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.810
intimidated to talk to, or an exam?

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.830
Is the stress good for
performance or is it harmful?

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.860
- Yeah, and I think
that's a great question.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.290
And I think I can only
talk to physical exertion,

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.510
which is what we were exploring.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.700
And I don't want to tread on
the toes of the psychologists

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.250
with flow state and these types
of things, because clearly-

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.070
- I think you're in the
position of scientific strength

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.903
on this one.
- Right.

00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:26.040
- I think you have the leverage.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.380
- All right.
- I mean, I have a lot

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.360
of friends in that community
as I'll just say as a buffer

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.410
to the answer you're about to give,

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.970
that there's very little
science around flow,

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.420
and there's very little neuroscience

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.500
related to most
psychological states anyway.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.540
So I think we've got a lot
of degrees of freedom here.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.600
- All right, I can breathe easy.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.170
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you for that.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.950
- Anything you like, credit Duncan,

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.180
anything you dislike, send
the mean comments to me.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.480
- Yeah, I think from my data, certainly,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.736
the greater the arousal, the
higher the performance was

00:33:57.736 --> 00:34:00.110
from a physical exertion perspective.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.240
And I think that was the
intriguing part of some

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.240
of my findings were there's definitely

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.160
an individual biokinetics to some of these

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.880
hormonal kind of releases.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.770
And as much as those
guys that had the highest

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.410
androgenic response in
terms of epinephrin release,

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.340
norepinephrine release
also sustained force output

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.590
for a longer period of the
workout than those that didn't.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:28.010
So, the individuals that
had a lower stimulus

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.420
of the sympathetic arousal, let's say,

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.850
certainly didn't perform as
well throughout the workout.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.860
Now, the intriguing thing
then becomes is okay,

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.160
and I think this really segues
into what we're doing here

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.570
with combat athletes, with
mixed martial artists.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:45.910
There's a philosophy, there's
a paradigm now for myself

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:48.040
in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.760
You know, the more you do
that challenging workout,

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.980
do you get the same
psychological stimulus?

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.580
Do you still get the same stress response?

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.840
And the assumption is unlikely.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.710
You accommodate, you become
accustomed to the stress

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.200
or your body will therefore adapt.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.910
And that's the classic
overload principle, right?

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.250
You then need to take the
stressor down a different route.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.960
But I think when you look at the athletes

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.910
that we work with here,

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.070
it's a fist fight at the end of the day.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.650
There's nothing more stressful than that.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.970
But I think just the exposure
to the rigors of training,

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.730
to understand the bad
positions, the bad situations,

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.120
to know that they can get
out of certain situations,

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.040
out of certain submission
holds or whatever it may be,

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.180
I think that really ties
in with some of my PhD work

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.670
in terms of what these guys do to approach

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:39.160
what is a really
challenging sporting arena

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.993
in mixed martial arts.

00:35:39.993 --> 00:35:43.500
- Yeah, it's definitely the
extreme of what's possible

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.050
in terms of asking does stress
favor or hinder performance?

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.960
Because yeah, like you
said, at the end of the day,

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.930
it's someone trying to hurt you as much

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.180
as they possibly can within

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.367
the bounds of the rules.
- Right.

00:35:55.367 --> 00:35:56.590
- And you're trying to do the same.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:00.320
So, I find your thesis work fascinating.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.550
Were you never to be at the
UFC Performance Institute,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.720
luckily they made the right
choice and brought you here,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.520
but were you have never to come here,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.300
I was still fascinated by
this because over and over

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.540
we hear that stress is bad,
stress is bad, stress is bad,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.880
but everything I read from
the scientific literature

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.820
is that stress and
epinephrin in particular

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.800
is coupled to the testosterone
response to performance

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.950
and to adaptation, provided
it doesn't go on too long.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.992
So, unless I'm saying
something that violates that.

00:36:32.992 --> 00:36:34.450
- Absolutely, I agree.
- I mean, that's your work.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.410
So it's a really important
and beautiful work.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.855
And I refer to it often,
so I'm just glad that-

00:36:40.855 --> 00:36:42.710
- Thank you.
- We could bolt that down,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.360
because I think the
people need to know this,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.420
that that discomfort is beneficial.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.930
Now, there's another side to
this that I want to ask about,

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:56.630
which is the use of cold, in particular,

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.560
things like ice baths, cold showers,

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.560
or any other type of cold
temperature exposure.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.610
In theory, that's stress
also, it's epinephrin.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.680
And so, how should one think about

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.360
the use of cold for recovery?

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.760
So, if colds causes stress,

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.850
then how is cold used for recovery?

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.200
That's what I don't understand.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.970
And maybe you just want to
share your thoughts on that.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.817
- Yeah, no, and I think
it's a great question,

00:37:28.817 --> 00:37:32.250
and I think the jury is
still out there, certainly,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.450
knowing some of the conversations
that we've been having.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:36.270
But I think, when we talk about stress,

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.220
it's your classic fight,
flight or freeze approach.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.430
And throwing your body into
a cold tub, an ice bath,

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.560
or whatever it may be
certainly is going to have

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.410
a physiological stress response.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.070
Now, people are using that
for different end goals.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.860
And again, I think that's
where the narrative

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.850
has to be explained.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.300
If you are using the stress specifically

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.050
to manage the mindset,

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.860
to use it as a specific stress stimulus,

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.130
that's the same as me
doing six by 10 at 80%.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.250
You're just trying to find
something to disrupt the system,

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.670
to do something that's very,
for want of a better term,

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.660
painful, discomfort, whatever.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.790
You're just finding a
stressor and then being able

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.410
to manage the mindset.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.520
But if you're using cold,

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.790
specifically from a physiological
perspective to promote

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.510
redistribution of vascularity,

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:35.180
of blood flow to different
vascular areas of muscle

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.850
that you feel have gone through a workout,

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.670
that are damaged or whatever it may be,

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.790
I think we've got to understand

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.823
what that stress mechanism is.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.980
And the data, the literature
is certainly still out there

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.040
with respect to
cryotherapy and cold baths,

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.040
and some of these cold exposures
in terms of what they do

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.330
at the level of the muscle tissue.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.870
If that's the target,

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.100
if you're trying to promote
a flushing mechanism,

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.120
or you're trying to promote redistribution

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.460
of the blood flow,

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.430
what you've got to understand
is that cold is going to

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.592
clamp down every part
of the vascular system.

00:39:10.592 --> 00:39:13.440
And we've really got to
understand how the muscle

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.260
would be redistributed
to areas of interest.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.150
So, I think the stress
response is a real thing

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.350
with respect to cold exposure.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.300
But I think the narrative around

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.010
what are you using the
cold for has to precede

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:34.100
the conversation because yes,
it's like putting your hand

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.560
over a hot coal.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.070
That's a stress the same way as jumping

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.042
in a cold bath is.

00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:41.390
- Yeah, I think most
people don't realize that.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.180
You're going to get the
epinephrin release from holding

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.400
your hand too close to flame.
- Absolutely.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.090
- And you're going to get it
from getting in the ice bath.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.830
- Your body doesn't know
the difference, right?

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.470
Your body does not know the difference.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:55.470
It has a primordial kind
of physiological response

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.840
that it's created over
millions and millions of years.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.020
And I think that that
physiology is not changing.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.573
And it's fixed in a
particular way right now,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.590
that it doesn't understand
the difference between whether

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.180
it's six by 10 doing a
challenging workout over here,

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.030
whether it's putting my
hands on the hot coal,

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.940
whether there's a lion stood
in front of me or whatever,

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.250
that epinephrin response
from the level of the brain

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.370
down to the whole signaling
cascade is the same.

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.880
- Mm hm, and cold, I've
heard can actually prevent

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.000
some of the beneficial
effects of training.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.440
That it can actually get in the way

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.050
of muscle growth, et cetera.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.780
- Yeah, there's some pretty
robust data out there now

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.830
showing that it definitely
has an influence

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.540
on performance variables like strength

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.380
and power in particular,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.620
but absolutely in terms
of muscle hypertrophy.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:47.040
And there's a big kind
of theme in the world

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.390
of athletic performance right now,

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:52.710
in terms of periodization of cold exposure

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.690
as a recovery modality.
- Interesting.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.590
- When do you use cold?

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.390
Should you be using cold
for recovery in periods

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.570
of high training load when
you're actually pursuing,

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.244
it might be general preparatory work,

00:41:05.244 --> 00:41:06.950
or are actually trying
to pursue muscle growth?

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.640
Well, that's usually where
you get the most sore.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.820
It's usually where you
feel the most fatigued,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.010
but it's probably not the
most beneficial approach

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.330
to use an ice bath in that scenario,

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:21.020
because you're dampening,
you're dulling the mTOR pathway

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.070
and the hypertrophic signaling pathway.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.230
Whereas in a competition
phase where actually

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.440
quality of exercise and
quality of execution of skill

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.630
and technical work has to be maintained,

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.260
you want to throw the kitchen
sink of recovery capabilities

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.070
and recovery interventions
in that scenario

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.470
because the muscle building
activity should be in the bank.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.460
That should have been done in
the general preparatory work.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.700
And now you're focusing
on technical execution.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.430
So, you're absolutely right.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.263
- No, it's interesting.

00:41:53.263 --> 00:41:55.844
So, if I understand correctly,

00:41:55.844 --> 00:41:59.890
if I want to maximize
muscle growth or power

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.010
or improvements and adaptations,

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:04.620
then the inflammation response,

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.170
the delayed onset muscle soreness,

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.810
all the stuff that's
uncomfortable and that we hear

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.950
is so terrible is actually
the stimulus for adaptation.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.530
And so, using cold in that situation

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.730
might short circuit my progress.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.680
But if I'm, I don't know
that I'll ever do this,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.220
but if I were to do an
iron man or something,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.560
or run a marathon, under those conditions,

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.000
I'm basically coming to
the race, so to speak,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.700
with all the power and
strength I'm going to have.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.680
And so, there, reducing
inflammation is good

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.290
because it's going to allow me to perform

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.970
more work, essentially.
- Absolutely, yeah.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.330
You have to be strategic
about when you use

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.860
some of these interventions.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.280
And the time when you
preparing for a competition

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.970
is not the appropriate time...

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.750
Excuse me, is the appropriate
time when you want

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.773
to drive recovery and make sure
that your body is optimized.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.220
When you're far away
from a competition date

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.750
or out of season or whatever it may be,

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.970
and you're really trying to just tear up

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:05.320
the body a little bit, to
allow its natural healing

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.550
and adaptation processes to take place,

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.410
well, you don't want to negate that.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.433
You want the body to optimize
its internal recovery

00:43:11.433 --> 00:43:14.080
and that's how muscle growth
is going to happen, so.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.010
- So interesting.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.010
- There's a time kind of
consideration that you need to make

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.430
with these interventions, for sure.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.260
- At the UFC Performance Center,

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.100
are the fighters periodizing
their cold exposure?

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.130
Or are they just doing cold at will?

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.650
- Well, it's not just the UFC.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.580
And again, I talk about
my personal experiences

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.420
with different sports.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.107
I think just education
around where science is at

00:43:37.107 --> 00:43:39.740
and our understanding of concepts

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.140
like the use of cold exposure
for recovery, ice bath.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.850
Everyone wants to jump in an ice bath.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.900
But I think as we've
stepped back and scientists

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.340
have started to figure out
and look at some of the data,

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.830
we're now more intuitive about, well,

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.260
actually that might not be the best

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.550
or the most optimal approach.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.700
And I think that's any given sport.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.740
So, yes, certainly here at the UFC,

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:05.090
we're trying to educate
our athletes around

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.150
appropriate timing.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.273
And it's the same with nutrition,

00:44:07.273 --> 00:44:09.670
it's the same with an
ice bath intervention,

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:11.300
it's the same with lifting weights,

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.570
it's the same with going for a run

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.260
or working out on the bike.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.460
There's tactics to when you do things

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.370
and when you don't do things.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:22.410
And I think stress and cold exposure,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.510
we have to have a consideration
around that as well,

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.880
but it's not just MMA
fighters, that's any athlete.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.200
And I think it's the best professionals,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.960
the most successful professionals
do that really well.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.730
They listen, number one,
they educate themselves,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.340
and then they build structure.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.810
And I think at the most elite level,

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.730
we always talk about it here at the UFC,

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.260
but at the most elite level,

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.160
you're not necessarily training
harder than anybody else.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.790
Everybody in the UFC trains hard,

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:55.690
like everyone is training super
hard, but the best athletes,

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:58.180
the true elite levels are
the ones that can do it

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.570
again and again and again on a daily basis

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.710
and sustain a technical
output for skill development,

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.190
therefore their skills can improve,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.210
or physical development,

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.290
their physical attributes can improve.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:11.540
So that ability to reproduce
on a day-to-day basis

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.610
falls into a recovery conversation.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.530
Now, when is the right
time to use something

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.830
like an ice bath and when isn't,

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.670
is part of the high-performance
conversation, for sure.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.110
- So really they're scientists;

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.480
they're building structure,
they're figuring out variables.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.700
- Yeah.
- But it sounds like

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.420
the ability to do more
quality work over time

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.640
is one of the key variables.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.040
- I mean, it's fundamental.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.300
I mean, garbage in, garbage out.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.120
Quality in, quality out.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.230
But in our sport, I talk
about mixed martial arts,

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:43.390
it's truly a decathlon of combat.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.070
So there's so many different attributes,

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:46.940
whether it's the grappling,
whether it's the wrestling,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.210
whether it's the transition work,

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.770
whether it's a standup striking.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.810
So, the different facets
of a training program

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:56.120
in this sport are significantly large

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.170
compared to something like
a wide receiver in football.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.810
And that's no disrespect
for wide receivers,

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:02.953
but they run routes.

00:46:02.953 --> 00:46:06.210
They're going to run a
route, a passing tree,

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.360
and that's all they need to do.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.800
These guys have to be on the ground.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.660
They've got to be great on the ground.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.750
They've got to be great standing up.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.030
They've got to be great with
the back against the fence.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.000
So there's so many different
kind of facets to our sport.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.860
So managing the distribution
of all the training components

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.470
is one of the biggest
challenges of mixed martial arts

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.810
and the best guys get that right.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.560
They allow their body to
optimize the training.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.330
And remember, why are we doing training?

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.830
We're doing training for technical
and tactical improvement.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:38.230
Now, if your body is
fatigued or you just can't

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.000
expose yourself to more
tactical development

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.630
or technical development,

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.680
then you're essentially
doing yourself a disservice.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.450
You're going to be behind the
curve with respect to those guys

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.760
that can reproduce that
day-in and day-out.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.210
- On the topic of skill
development, regardless of sport,

00:46:55.210 --> 00:47:00.150
we hear all the time and it
certainly is intuitive to me

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.940
that the person who can focus the best

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.300
will progress the fastest.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.133
But it's kind of interesting,

00:47:06.133 --> 00:47:09.230
sometimes I talk to athletes and they seem

00:47:11.292 --> 00:47:14.250
a little bit laid back about
their training sometimes,

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.850
and yet they obviously
know how to flip the switch

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:19.530
and they can really dial in the intensity.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.610
Do you think that there
are optimal protocols

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:24.700
for skill learning in terms
of physical skill learning?

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.420
Like, could it ever be parametrized

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.703
like the six sets of 10 reps?

00:47:30.123 --> 00:47:31.710
And this gets to the
heart of neuroplasticity,

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:34.230
which is still, it's not a black box,

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.160
but it's kind of a black box

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.530
with portions of it
illuminated, I like to say.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:42.020
But what are your thoughts
on skill development?

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.710
For somebody that wants
to get better at sport,

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:48.510
do you recommend a particularly long

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.400
or short training session?

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.800
Does intensity matter or is it just reps?

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.310
- Yeah, I think, no, it's
not a volume driven exercise.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.150
It's a quality driven exercise.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.750
And listen, my expertise
is not in motor learning

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.800
and motor skill acquisition.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.710
I tend to default to
Dr. Gabriele Wulf here

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.420
at UNLV for that.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.460
She's one of the leading
proponents in this area.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:17.140
But if you look at true skill development,

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.410
it is about rehearsal
of accurate movement,

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.143
accurate movement mechanics.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.870
And as soon as that becomes impacted

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.410
by fatigue or inaccurate movement,

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.580
you're now losing the motor learning,

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.910
you're losing the accuracy of the skill.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.190
People can call it muscle memory

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.160
or whatever they want, right?

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.410
But essentially you're
grooving neural axons

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.460
to create movement patterns
and they're situational

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.030
throughout sport, right?

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.660
Whether it's a Cruyff turn in soccer

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.700
or a jump shot in basketball,
or a forehand down the line,

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.840
you can carve out that particular posture

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.440
and position and skill,
and you can isolate it,

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.520
and you can drill it
again and again and again.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.136
Now, as soon as fatigue is
influencing that repetition,

00:49:02.136 --> 00:49:03.930
it's time to stop.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.770
And the best coaches understand that.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.370
They understand that it's
quality over quantity

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.290
when it comes to skill acquisition.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.650
So to answer your question
in a roundabout way,

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.890
I would say, yes, it's shorter sessions

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.820
that are very high quality.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.820
And I think the best
athletes in my experience

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:24.560
are the ones that
consciously and cognitively

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.189
are aware of it at every
moment of the training session.

00:49:28.189 --> 00:49:30.030
They should leave the training session

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.910
not necessarily just physically fatigued,

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.440
but mentally fatigued because
they're completely engaged

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.873
in the learning process.

00:49:37.625 --> 00:49:39.250
The problem then becomes okay,

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.470
if we just do lots of 30 minutes sessions,

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:45.280
we've got to do a lot of
30 minutes sessions to get

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.760
the volume exposure of the repetition

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.650
and the rehearsal of this skill
again and again and again.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.680
So, it's a bit of a paradox.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.580
It's a bit of a double-edged sword,

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.163
but a three hour session
versus a 90 minute session,

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.910
we'll take the 90 minute session any day

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.440
when it comes to skill acquisition,

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.430
because that's going to be
driven by quality over quantity.

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.470
- Yeah, training and skill learning

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.730
is incredibly mentally fatiguing.

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:13.060
I've often wondered why
when one works out hard,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.660
whether or not it's with
run or with the weights,

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.950
why it's hard to think later in the day.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.700
- Right.
- Yeah, there really does

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.490
seem to be something to it.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:26.490
And I've wondered is it depletion
of adrenaline, dopamine?

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.490
I sometimes think it might be dopamine,

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.453
and here I'm totally speculating.

00:50:29.453 --> 00:50:31.340
I don't have any data to support this,

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.310
but if you hit a really
hard workout or run

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.990
early in the day, oftentimes
the brain just doesn't

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.900
want to do hard mental work.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.020
Which gives me great
admiration for these athletes

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.533
that are drilling their mind and body

00:50:43.533 --> 00:50:46.990
all day, every day, with breaks.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.539
But so what are your thoughts?

00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:53.250
What leads to the mental fatigue
after physical performance?

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.080
- Well, again, I don't want to talk out,

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.870
I'm talking to the man here, you know?

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:57.910
- Well, we're just two scientists-

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.860
- Yeah, yeah.
- Speculating on this point.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.510
Up until now, you've
been giving us concrete

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.350
peer-reviewed study based
feedback on my questions.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:07.886
But if we were to speculate,

00:51:07.886 --> 00:51:09.080
I mean, I think this
is a common occurrence.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.070
People think if I get that
really good workout in

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:12.800
in the morning, I feel better all day.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.633
- Right.
- That's true,

00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:17.450
unless that workout is really
intense or really long.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.120
- Yeah.
- And then you just,

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.940
the mind just somehow won't
latch on to mental work

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.120
quite as well.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.120
- I mean, just philosophically
and I think coming back

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200
to this kind of stress consideration,

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.410
like public speaking or taking an exam.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.250
I mean, if you have an amazing
coach who is setting up

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.640
training in a particular
way, it's challenging,

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.947
there's a strain related to it,

00:51:41.947 --> 00:51:43.470
and I'm not talking physical strain,

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:47.450
I'm talking figuring things
out, figuring out the skill.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.180
And I think that can be stressful.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.410
Like the learning
process can be stressful.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.820
So, we've touched on stress.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:58.500
I also think if they
hit the right technique,

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.060
that reward center in the brain,

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.030
that dopamine shot is
going to fly up there.

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.530
And there's only so many
times that we can get that

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.390
before that becomes dampened.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.530
And I think there's an
energetic piece to it.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.640
There's the fueling of the brain.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.720
There's the carbohydrate fuel
in exercise that actually

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.590
the strategy around how
you fuel for learning

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:23.350
and fuel for physical training
is actually pretty similar.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:25.370
- Glucose.
- Yeah, it's glucose,

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:26.830
it's sugar at the end of the day, right?

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:30.340
So, are you fueling accordingly

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.940
around your training sessions,
be that very physical,

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.773
because everyone thinks,

00:52:33.773 --> 00:52:35.780
okay, I'm going to jump on a treadmill

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.100
and I'm going to bang out
15 sprints at max effort,

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.750
and I'm going to be dropping
off and laying on the floor

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:43.583
at the end of it.

00:52:43.583 --> 00:52:44.690
I need to refuel.

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.180
Well, what about the
refueling of the brain

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.400
in a very demanding
exercise or drilling session

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.750
where you're looking at technique,

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.040
that you're trying to figure out,

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.360
that's very challenging
for your mind to figure out

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.830
the complexity of it,

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.940
that still needs to be fueled
or refueled afterwards.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.350
And I think that's obviously
might be an area where athletes

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.420
do themselves a disservice
by not appropriately fueling

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.800
from what might be considered to be

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:13.760
a lower intensity session,
but the cognitive challenge

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.330
has been significantly high.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.470
- So, they're skill work or drill work,

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:19.810
and it's taxing the brain.
- Correct, yeah.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:23.240
- And they're thinking, oh,
I wasn't pushing hard lifts

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.523
or doing sprints, and so I can just go off

00:53:25.523 --> 00:53:29.270
into the rest of my day, but
then their mind is drifting.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.950
- Yeah, I mean, I speculate.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.000
- Yeah, that sounds very reasonable.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.170
I mean, I know that here and presumably

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:36.710
with the other athletes
you've worked with,

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.390
nutrition is a huge aspect of that.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.350
And I think the general
public can learn a lot

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.650
from athletic nutrition
because at the end of the day,

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:48.010
the general public is trying
to attend to their kids,

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:49.760
attend to their work, whether
or not they're lawyers

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.300
or whatever, they need to focus.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.300
Nutrition is a barbed wire topic.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.160
- Oh yeah [chuckling].

00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.130
- But since we're free
to do what we would do

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:01.760
if we were just sitting
in each other's offices,

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.660
which is to just speculate a bit,

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.940
for the typical person,

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.300
do you think these low
carbohydrate diets...

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.120
A typical person who
exercises, runs, swims, yoga,

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.810
lifts weights, maybe not all those things,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.840
but some collection of those,

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.760
pushes themselves to do those
things and to do them well,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.620
but isn't necessarily a
highly competitive athlete.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.750
Do you think that nutrition
that doesn't include

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:30.060
a lot of glucose, doesn't
include a lot of carbohydrates,

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.370
is a problem or is it okay?

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.470
What do you recommend for athletes?

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.200
What do you recommend for typical people?

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.260
- Yeah, again, disclaimer,
I'm not a dietician, but I-

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.590
- That's okay, the dieticians don't know

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.330
what to recommend to athletes either.

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.810
And I say that from
having spent a lot of time

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:49.169
with the literature now,
it's a complete mess.

00:54:49.169 --> 00:54:50.230
- Right, yeah.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:51.595
- It's like, I thought
we didn't understand

00:54:51.595 --> 00:54:52.428
anything about the brain,

00:54:52.428 --> 00:54:54.770
the nutrition science stuff
is all over the place.

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:56.650
- Right.
- So I think we have, again-

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:58.740
- We have some freedom.
- Large degrees of freedom.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.903
- Right, right, right.

00:54:59.903 --> 00:55:04.380
I mean, I think it comes
down to metabolic efficiency.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.880
So we would never advocate a high...

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.080
I never say never, okay?

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.893
But we rarely advocate a
high performance athlete

00:55:11.893 --> 00:55:16.363
in a high intensity
intermittent sport, like MMA,

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.957
being totally ketogenic or-

00:55:19.957 --> 00:55:21.210
- You do not recommend that?

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.520
- No, because at the end of the day,

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:27.240
some of those high intensity
efforts usually require

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.830
carbohydrate fueling for
the energy that's produced

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.500
at those high intensities.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.880
So, we try to navigate around that.

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.610
Now, listen, there are fighters
in the UFC and elsewhere,

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.570
Matt Brown is a great example,

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:45.410
who promotes the ketogenic
approach and it works for him.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.520
But we look at the science and the nature

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.497
of the characteristics of our sport,

00:55:49.497 --> 00:55:51.090
and we don't necessarily promote that.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.330
- Can I interrupt you real quick?

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:54.630
What about ketones for people

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.650
that are ingesting carbohydrates?

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.700
This is an interesting area
because people always hear

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.710
ketones and they think,
oh, I have to be ketogenic

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:02.860
to benefit from taking ketones.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.693
- Right.
- But there are a number

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:07.390
of athletes and recreational
athletes now as well,

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:11.370
taking liquid or powder-based ketones,

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.910
even though they do eat rice and oatmeal

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.810
and bread and other things.

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.210
So are there any known
benefits of ketones,

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.940
even if one is not in a state of ketosis?

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:26.940
- So, the use of ketones
that I'm primarily aware of

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.350
in our sport, is after the event.

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:33.700
In terms of the brain health with athletes

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.520
that are potentially taking
trauma to the brain, et cetera,

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.130
and looking to maintain the fueling

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.950
and the energy supply to the brain.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.160
But yes, it's probably a
little bit out of my remit.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.930
So I don't want to talk
on that because I'm not

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:46.970
fully familiar with that.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.860
- Well, I've heard that
ketones after head injury

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.650
can provide a buffering component.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:52.710
- Correct.
- It's not going to reverse

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:54.860
brain damage, but it
might be able to offset

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:56.040
some of the micro-damage.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.390
- Right, so that's how we use it,

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.020
just to sustain the
energy supply to the brain

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.600
that might be compromised
through brain trauma.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.550
So that's why we use ketones.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:08.900
To come back to your original question.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.410
If it's a general population then yes,

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:13.990
I think there's a place
to argue that actually

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:15.910
being on a ketogenic diet at times,

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.693
and maybe it's a cycling
exercise, maybe not...

00:57:18.693 --> 00:57:23.070
I don't mean cycling a
bike, I mean cycling ketosis

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.190
is beneficial because I
think it's going to lead

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:29.010
to better metabolic management
and metabolic efficiency,

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:31.760
at those lower intensities
where we should be fueling

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.770
our metabolism with lipids and fats.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:39.300
Clearly the Western diet
and the modern day diet

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.870
is heavily driven by processed
foods and carbohydrates

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:45.810
that people become
predisposed to utilization

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:50.800
of that fuel source
above lipid use, fat use,

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.690
at intensities that are very low.

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:56.410
So, some of our data with the
fighters shows that as well.

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:59.500
But I think the challenge for
us is that we're working with

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:03.310
a clientele that require high
intensity bouts of effort.

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:07.020
So, fueling appropriately
is very important for that.

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:11.840
Now, we use tactics here where
we essentially have athletes

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.500
on what you would say,
kind of is a largely

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.560
a ketogenic diet, but then
we will fuel carbohydrates

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.420
around training sessions.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.610
So, we'll do very timed
exposure to carbohydrates.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:24.950
So it's not-
- Post-training?

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:27.860
- Post-training, immediately pre, during,

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.220
and then immediately post.

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.780
And then the rest of their diets,

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.020
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.790
are what would look like
ketogenic type approaches.

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:38.250
So we're trying to be very
tactical in the exposure

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:41.850
to maximize the intensity for the training

00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:44.910
and then return to a
metabolically efficient diet,

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:47.810
which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:50.870
because we've fueled the
sessions that need it.

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:54.610
- I'm smiling because
once again, this place,

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:57.900
the UFC Performance Center is
doing things scientifically,

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:01.940
which to me, the idea, and
I'm pleased to hear that,

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.540
because to me this idea
that the ketogenic diet

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.390
is the best and only diet or carbohydrates

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.570
and low protein diets are the best diet.

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:11.130
It's just, it's ludicrous.
- Right.

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:13.360
- Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.060
I think some people might
be familiar with that term,

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.260
some perhaps not,

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.890
but the way I understand
metabolic efficiency is that

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:26.167
you teach the body to
use fats by maybe doing

00:59:26.167 --> 00:59:30.220
long bouts of cardio, maybe
lowering carbohydrates a bit.

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.560
So teaching the body to
tap into its fat stores

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.440
for certain periods of training.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.660
And then you also teach the
body to utilize carbohydrates

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.250
by supplying carbohydrates
immediately after training

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.083
and before training.

00:59:41.083 --> 00:59:43.150
You teach the body to use ketones,

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:44.870
and then you use them
at the appropriate time,

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:47.300
as opposed to just deciding
that one of these fuel sources

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.050
is good and all the others
are bad or dispensable.

00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:51.690
Do I have that correct?
- You've nailed it.

00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:56.690
I mean, from Bob Seebohar,
formerly of USA Triathlon,

00:59:57.421 --> 00:59:59.418
is the guy that kind of came up with

00:59:59.418 --> 01:00:02.700
the concept of metabolic efficiency,

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.190
but yes, you're absolutely right.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:07.290
I mean, at low intensities of exercise

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.240
or just day-to-day living,
we shouldn't be tapping into

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.010
our carbohydrate fuel sources extensively.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.480
That's for higher intensity work

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.993
or the fight or flight needs of stress.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:26.150
If athletes or any individual
has a high carbohydrate diet,

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.450
they're going to start to
become predisposed to utilizing

01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:32.620
that fuel source preferentially.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.870
Now, at low intensity,
that can be problematic,

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:35.940
certainly for an athlete,

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.500
because if they preferentially
use carbohydrate

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.880
at lower intensities,
when the exercise demand

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.130
goes to a higher intensity,

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.460
they've already exhausted
their fuel stores.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.050
They can't draw upon fat
because the oxidation

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.080
of that fat is just too slow.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.630
So they're essentially now become fatigued

01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:56.730
because they've already utilized
their carbohydrate stores.

01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:59.440
So what we try to do yes,
through diet manipulation

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.300
and a little bit of exercise
manipulation is as you say,

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.760
teach the body or train
the body to preferentially

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.500
use a specific fuel source;

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.270
fat, obviously at lower intensities,

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:09.850
and carbohydrate at high intensities.

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:12.370
And we will look at
specifically the crossover point

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.530
between the two, tell us a lot in terms of

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.230
how an athlete is ultimately,

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:18.950
how their metabolism is working.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:21.370
- Well, again, I'm smiling
because I love this

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:25.130
because it's grounded in
something real and scientific,

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:27.010
which is that we have these
different fuel sources.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.290
The body can adapt to use any
number of them or one of them.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.280
I think most people are looking for that

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.490
one pattern of eating, that
one pattern of exercising

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.190
that's going to be best
for them or sustain them.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:41.920
And they often look back
to the time when they felt

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.100
so much better switching
from one thing to the next,

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.410
but the adaptation process
itself is also key, right?

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:48.483
Teaching the body.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.940
So if we were to just riff on this

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:55.910
just a little bit further, if somebody,

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:57.150
I'll use myself as an example,

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:00.820
since I can only speculate
what other people's

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.860
current nutrition protocols are,

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.590
but if somebody is eating
in a particular way

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:09.650
and they want to try this kind
of periodization of nutrition,

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.560
could one say, okay, for a
few weeks I'm going to do more

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.620
high intensity interval
training and weight training,

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.210
and I'm going to eat a
bit more carbohydrate

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.810
'cause I'm depleting more glycogen.

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:21.260
Then if I switch to a phase
of my training where I'm doing

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:24.320
some longer runs, maybe I'm training less,

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.443
maybe I'm just working at
my desk a little bit more,

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:29.120
then I might switch to a
lower carbohydrate diet.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.953
Do I have that right?

01:02:29.953 --> 01:02:32.940
And then if I'm going to enter
a competition of some sort,

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.730
certainly not UFC-
- Right.

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:36.633
- Or MMA of any kind to be clear,

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.670
not because it isn't a wonderful sport,

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:42.830
but because that wouldn't be
good for my other profession.

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:45.100
But if I were going to do that,

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.740
then I would think about
stacking carbohydrates,

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.390
ketones, and fats.

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:51.876
Do I have that more or less right?

01:02:51.876 --> 01:02:53.630
- Yeah, you've said it eloquently.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:57.070
At the end of the day, you're
consciously understanding

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:01.950
what the exposure to physical exertion is,

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:03.700
and you're flexing your day
accordingly and I think that-

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.470
- So, it's need-based eating.

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:07.510
- Exactly, for want of a better term,

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:09.690
you can call it whatever fancy terminology

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:13.680
there is out there, but yes,
it's needs-based eating,

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.760
but you're very conscious and cognizant

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.423
of what is my current exercise status.

01:03:18.423 --> 01:03:20.790
If I'm taking some time off,

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.960
then don't gorge on the carbohydrates.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.030
We probably need to be cut,

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.700
it's going to be lower intensity work,

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.450
or even just habitual
day-to-day walking around,

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:29.770
doing your groceries.

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:33.410
That doesn't require massive
amounts of glycogen storage

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.530
and carbohydrate fueling.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.853
So, you can potentially go
more ketogenic in nature,

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:43.490
oxidizing lipids for that fuel.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:47.030
If you are in a high period
of high intensity training,

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:50.000
then you have to consciously
flex your diet to support that.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.650
That's not normal, you've made a change,

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:54.080
you've elevated the demand.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.640
So, the fueling requirements
for the regenerative,

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.060
not only fueling the exercise,

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.140
but the regenerative
requirements of your body

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.100
after that type of work is going to be

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.080
really important as well.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.010
So, yes, take on more carbohydrates.

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:08.520
So, I think it's consciously
interpreting the nature

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.750
of your diet against where
you are at any moment in time.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:12.710
- Yeah, I like that.

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:15.030
I think the listeners of my podcast

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.510
generally are experimenters.
- Right.

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:19.010
- They are scientists of themselves,

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.680
which makes me happy obviously.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.040
And I like to think that
they're paying attention

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.600
to the changes they're making

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.710
and how they're affecting themselves.

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:31.080
And they seem more open to trying things,

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.630
provided they can do it safely,

01:04:34.086 --> 01:04:35.460
and seeing what works for them.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.080
And I'm certainly going to
try some of the change up.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.150
I also am really a creature of habit.

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:41.880
And I think that talking to you today,

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.520
I realize I'm probably
doing a number of things

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.260
truly wrong in my training,

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.300
but also that I don't
tend to vary my nutrition

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.120
with my training quite
as much as I should.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.423
I'm just locked into a protocol.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.950
We covered a number of things related

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:59.760
to your PhD thesis work,
but I cut you off early on

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.720
related to your trajectory.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.560
After you finished your thesis.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.230
- Yeah.
- I know you were

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:06.520
at Notre Dame for a while.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.820
Was that your first spot
after your PhD thesis?

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.430
- No, no, I basically finished my PhD

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:15.680
and I dropped into the
British Olympic system

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.943
for about 14 years.
- Oh my, okay.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:23.890
- I've done three full Olympic
cycles with different sports,

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:26.520
largely as strength and conditioning coach

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.880
as a practitioner.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.730
I was always working in
universities and academia alongside,

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:35.240
in terms of continuing
to publish and write

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.170
and do research and teach as well.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.410
'Cause I enjoy teaching.
- That explains the huge

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:40.204
volume of publications.
- Yeah [chuckling].

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:41.730
- I don't think people
realize all the work

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.830
that goes into getting a quality
peer-reviewed publication.

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:48.340
It's not, what do they call
it now on Instagram, anecdata?

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.050
Where people would do something once.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.290
- Right.
- They have this experience

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:52.650
and then they put it in
the world that it's a-

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:55.310
- Yeah.
- Anecdata are,

01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:58.250
I don't even know that
we should call it data.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:01.640
So, 14 years in working with
the British Olympic team.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.840
- Yeah, so whether it was GB boxing,

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.770
primarily with the Beijing cycle,

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:11.420
but also lightweight
rowers and gymnastics.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.500
And for the London Olympic games,

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.070
that cycle I was the lead
strength and conditioning

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.360
and physical performance
coach for British basketball.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.450
So, GB basketball.

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:24.030
I had about three years in
the English Premier League

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:26.620
with Newcastle United and the soccer team,

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.050
and then for the Rio Olympic cycle,

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.820
I was with Great Britain Tae Kwon Do.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.580
So, again, another combat sport.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.090
After I'd finished there,

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.130
I kind of moved to the
University of Notre Dame,

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:40.920
where I went into more
of a managerial position

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.700
working across all the
different technical services;

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.160
medical, nutrition,
strength and conditioning,

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.170
sports psychology and sports
science, whatever it may be,

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:54.010
as the Director of Performance Sciences

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.550
for Notre Dame athletics.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.347
And then, after about 16 months there,

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.380
the UFC came knocking
and they recruited me

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.213
out of Notre Dame.

01:07:01.213 --> 01:07:03.240
So, it's been a great ride,

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.210
and I've got lots of
athletes have taught me

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.400
a lot along the way, lots of coaches.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.560
Every day is a school day,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.960
I still try and keep that mentality.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.563
And in this world we call
it white belt mentality.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:21.050
I'm a PhD, I've got 25 years of experience

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:24.450
in high performance
sport, but I still learn

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.560
every single day from these
people out on the mats

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.830
and in the ring and it's
impressive to see what they do.

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:29.780
- Yeah, it certainly is.

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.840
I got introduced to MMA
just a few years ago.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.250
I think the first time I came
out here was one of the first

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.070
times I'd heard of MMA
'cause I was kind of

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:39.230
in my laboratory, nose down.

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.580
And it's a really interesting
sport because it incorporates

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.827
so many different types
of movement as you said-

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:45.630
- Right.
- It's not just

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.810
stand up boxing, it's not just kicking,

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.370
it's ground game, everything,

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:52.060
and I'm still learning about it.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.060
But as you mentioned, going
in with that beginner's mind,

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:59.440
the white belt mentality,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.260
what has been the most
surprising thing for you

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.920
in terms of being exposed
to MMA in particular,

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.990
as opposed to other sports?

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.070
Like what's unique about MMA fighters,

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:14.070
besides that they have this
huge variety of tactical skills

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:16.473
that they have to learn and perfect?

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.760
- Yeah, that's a great question.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.702
I would say two things.

01:08:20.702 --> 01:08:21.620
I'm going to answer two questions.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.500
One actually reiterates
what you've already said.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.600
Like the degrees of freedom
in mixed martial arts

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.163
are exponential, like no other sport.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.020
We've got 11 different weight classes.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.140
We have men's classes.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.110
We have women's classes.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:38.170
We have kickboxers,
wrestlers, jujitsu fighters,

01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:40.500
judoka, karate fighters.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.623
The stylistic backgrounds are infinite.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.130
We're a weight classification sport.

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:48.440
There's a whole issue
relating to making weight

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.840
and then rebounding to
fight about 24 to 30 hours.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.900
Like just the variability in this sport,

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:59.550
the considerations that you
have to make are unprecedented

01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:02.260
compared to any other sport
that I've worked with.

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:06.360
And a lot of them go against
and are the antithesis

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.160
of what you would expect
for high performance.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.410
In terms of we don't
always have a very clearly

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.340
defined competition schedule.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.630
Once these guys fight,
they don't necessarily know

01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:18.840
when their next fight is going to be.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.920
- What's the closest spacing of a fight?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.713
- I mean, listen, I think
the record is around,

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.110
it's just over a month, I believe.

01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:28.400
- Oh, my goodness.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.140
- So, you know, that's a quick turnaround,

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.310
but most of these guys are fighting

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:33.650
three or four times a year,

01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:36.380
three times a year is pretty normal.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.080
The bigger fighters,
maybe two times a year.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.190
But invariably, the guys
don't know when that next date

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:43.023
is going to be.

01:09:43.023 --> 01:09:45.640
So we're in this gray area
of, okay, what do we do?

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.420
Like, are we taking some time off?

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.260
Are we just going to do
some general prep work?

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:53.410
Are we going to try and keep the
knife sharpened in case I get-

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:54.250
- I didn't realize this.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.930
In that way it's a lot
like special operations.

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.533
- Absolutely, you don't know when the call

01:09:58.533 --> 01:09:59.940
is going to happen.
- They have to be ready

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.773
at all times.

01:10:00.773 --> 01:10:02.830
There isn't this, like, let's
get ready for the season.

01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:03.670
- Right, yeah.

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:06.420
Like when I was with the
British Olympic Association,

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.190
I knew it was the British
Open, the Spanish Open,

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:11.160
the French Open, the
European Championships,

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.880
the Israeli Open, the American Open,

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.080
the Canadian Open, the Olympic games.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.100
- It's a circuit in your brain.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:16.933
- Right, yeah.
- I can tell, yeah.

01:10:16.933 --> 01:10:18.830
- You just plan like you know

01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:20.050
where all the targets are going to be.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.480
Here, it's a moving
target because you might

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.440
be just hanging out doing
some general prep work,

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.240
and then you might get
a short notice fight.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.090
They give you a quick call

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.730
and it's in six weeks or five weeks.

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:31.540
And okay, I've got to ramp
everything up really quickly.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.500
So, that's a real challenge
in terms of just managing

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.430
all these different components

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:39.793
of a mixed martial arts alone.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.180
To come back to your question,

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.800
the other thing which is truly fascinating

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.280
about these individuals is
just their mental resilience.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.080
And again, we've touched
on it in the talk,

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.650
but the ability to do what
they do on a daily basis,

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.890
to look at all the different skillsets

01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.630
that they have to try and engage in

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.760
and bring into their training.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.510
To do that and embrace the grind,

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.370
embrace the process of just learning,

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:10.550
the physical side of our
sport is unprecedented.

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.240
But the mental side, we
have a funny saying here.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.410
We always say it's 90% mental

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.540
apart from the 60% that's physical.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.540
So, it's just more and more and more.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.426
And these guys' ability to
just do that on a daily basis

01:11:26.426 --> 01:11:28.500
is very impressive.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.950
Like their resilience,
their internal drive

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:34.070
and their resilience is
really impressive to see.

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:35.510
- Yeah, all the fighters I've met here

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:36.610
have been really terrific.

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:39.243
It's interesting every
time I meet a fighter,

01:11:40.487 --> 01:11:41.640
I shouldn't be surprised when they're

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.743
often very soft-spoken.
- Right.

01:11:42.743 --> 01:11:44.620
- [Andrew] They're
always extremely polite.

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.500
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know?

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.370
And fighting is such a...

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.780
It comes from a very primitive
portion of the brain, right?

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.470
But a large portion of
the brain, nonetheless.

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:55.030
- But I think that's another
skill is that switch.

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:57.500
And again, that's the
recoverability piece, right?

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.360
Like you cannot be Taipei

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.400
or you cannot be like super
charged 24 hours a day

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.090
because you're going to
just fry your system, right?

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:07.640
And I think that's something
else where we're really trying

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.000
to manage this whole process,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.230
be it through nutritional interventions,

01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:12.970
be it through education around sleep,

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:16.620
be it through training program management,

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.963
be it through psychological interventions.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.500
You could look at fighters and
say like, these guys are go,

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.020
like they're red alert and
they'll run through a brick wall,

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.240
but actually again, their
ability to turn it on and off

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.420
means that they can do what they do.

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.240
They can bring it down and be very normal,

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.200
very polite, very accommodating.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.650
- Maybe even better than most people

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:40.630
because one of the reasons I'm obsessed

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.810
with human performance,
and high-performance,

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:46.229
and people like fighters,
and elite military,

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:50.820
or even bodybuilders for that
matters that they experiment.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.610
- Yeah.
- They find the outer

01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:53.740
limits of what's possible.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.400
But one of the things
that they have discovered,

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.670
as you're describing, is
this ability to toggle

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:01.090
between high alert states and calm states.

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.710
Most typical people can't do this.

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:05.790
They see something that
upsets them on the internet

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:08.470
or something on the news
or some external event

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:10.140
pressures down on them
and they're stressed

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.410
for many, many days and weeks,

01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:13.787
and sometimes it goes pathological, right?

01:13:13.787 --> 01:13:15.640
And I don't say this as a criticism,

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.470
it's just that most human
beings, within our species,

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:21.460
most members of our species never learn

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.780
to either flip the switch
or to just voluntarily

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.480
toggle between states.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.740
I think athletes learn how
to do that extremely well.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.070
And it sounds like MMA
fighters do that even better

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.240
than perhaps many other athletes.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.290
- I mean, yeah, there's the odd one or two

01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:38.123
that would struggle with,

01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:41.080
but I think in terms of
that chronic exposure,

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.960
we see that coming from challenges around

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.440
cyclical weight cutting,
and metabolic disruption,

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.350
and metabolic injury,

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:50.643
not necessarily from
the psychological drive.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.810
They do understand that
this is a job for them.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:57.340
And the time on the mats,

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.550
most of them can turn it off a little bit

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:02.194
and downgrade things when
they're off the mats.

01:14:02.194 --> 01:14:04.530
It's impressive to see, because again,

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:08.110
like, as a layman, just
looking at the fight game,

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.650
you think it's going to be crazy chaotic,

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:13.220
100 miles an hour every hour of every day,

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.490
but that's clearly not the case.

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:19.810
They manage their energy and
their efforts pretty well.

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:21.490
- So it's a little bit like science.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.390
Although maybe scientists
could take a lesson from-

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:25.510
- Yeah, that evidence-based practice

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:26.594
or practice-based evidence, right?

01:14:26.594 --> 01:14:27.427
- Oh, I like that.
[Duncan chuckling]

01:14:27.427 --> 01:14:28.830
That's good.

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:31.120
A couple more questions,
I can't help myself.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.120
I know we talked about temperature earlier

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.060
when we discussed cold,
but I can't help myself,

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.890
I have to ask you about heat.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.290
Because earlier we were
having a conversation

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:43.530
about heat adaptation,
about how long does it take

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:47.410
for the human body or
athlete or typical person

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:50.450
that's maybe exploring
sauna or things of that sort

01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:52.950
to learn to be a better sweater?

01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:55.060
It sounds like something
none of us would want to do.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.820
We all want to stay
cool, calm and collected.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.520
But one of the reasons to deliberately

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.640
expose oneself to heat is for things

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.770
like growth hormone release, et cetera.

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:06.490
We can talk about this,
but a couple of questions.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.220
One, is heat exposure
stress in the same way

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.440
that the ice bath or
cold exposure is stress?

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.230
The second one is, is there any difference

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:16.710
there that's important?

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:19.570
And the other one is
how does one get better

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:21.220
at heat adaptation or at
least what are you doing

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:24.050
with the fighters to get them
better at dealing with heat?

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.883
How long does that take?

01:15:24.883 --> 01:15:25.980
So the first question,

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.974
just 'cause I threw
three questions at you,

01:15:27.974 --> 01:15:30.610
[Duncan chuckling]

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:33.410
is heat stress like cold is stress?

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:34.243
- Yeah, I think it is.

01:15:34.243 --> 01:15:36.490
And I think heat shock
proteins for example,

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.300
are driven by that stressful exposure

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.580
to a change in environment.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:46.230
So, I think we do graded response in terms

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:50.200
of heat acclimation strategies, but yes,

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.070
we've touched on it earlier
in the conversation.

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:54.290
For me, heat is still a stressor.

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:57.020
And if it's managed incorrectly,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.610
you can have detrimental responses

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:01.190
rather than beneficial responses.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:03.280
- So barring like hyperthermia and death,

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.160
like I mean, obviously you
heat up the brain too much,

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.040
people will have seizures and
die, but you lose neurons.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.490
But what's the right
way to acclimate heat?

01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:15.020
Taking into account
that people should check

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:16.160
with their doctor, et cetera.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.900
We do all these disclaimers,
but let's just say,

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.700
I want to get better at dealing with heat,

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.340
or I want to extract
more benefit from heat.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:26.010
I mean, how many minutes a day are people

01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:27.800
typically exposing themselves to heat?

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.330
How often and over what periods of time?

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:32.290
- Yeah, so, we normally start with

01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:34.040
about 15 minutes of exposure.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.430
Now, if someone's really
lacking acclimation to heat,

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:40.120
you can do that in three,
five minute efforts.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:40.953
Do you know what I mean?

01:16:40.953 --> 01:16:42.250
And actually take-
- This is a hot sauna?

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.050
- [Duncan] Yeah, hot sauna,
take time to step out-

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:45.350
- 200 degrees or something like it?

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:46.840
- Correct, yeah.
- Fahrenheit, yeah.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.510
- 200 Fahrenheit, yes.

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:51.340
And we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.980
to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.580
Now, we have to understand,

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.030
what's the advantage of heat
acclimation for our athletes?

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:05.030
Ultimately their ability to
sweat and to lose body fluids

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:08.670
is going to be advantageous
to their weight cut process.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.210
So, their ability to make weight.

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:12.720
It is a technique that
some of these guys adopt.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.250
So, if you don't have high sweat rates,

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.170
it means you're going to
have to sit in the sauna

01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.690
for longer and longer and longer

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:23.550
to get the same delta in sweat release.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:24.867
So the more acclimated you are,

01:17:24.867 --> 01:17:28.430
the more your body is
thermogenically adapted,

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:31.550
the more sweat glands you
have, there's more pores,

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.690
you can sweat more and
therefore you'll lose

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:36.280
that fluid quicker, and you
spend less time in the sauna.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.260
So, that's why we do it,
to try and promote...

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.360
To limit the exposure.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.920
And it comes back to your first
question, is it a stressor?

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.170
It absolutely it's a stressor
if you've got to spend

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:51.240
two hours over a four hour period,

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.670
two hours of it sat in a sauna.

01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:53.855
- Yeah, where the phone-
- Because you just don't

01:17:53.855 --> 01:17:55.381
sweat enough.
- Doesn't work, so you can't.

01:17:55.381 --> 01:17:56.214
No, I'm just kidding.
- Right.

01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:57.720
- People, divorce them from their phone

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.090
and that's a stressor in itself.

01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:02.680
- Right, I mean, yes, I think there's a...

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.130
What we do is like anything,
we build up in temperature,

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:08.310
but we build up in volume of exposure.

01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:11.560
So, we start with 15 minutes
and then we just try to add on

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.050
and add on across a time.

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:17.840
And now, for us, we kind of
found about 14 sauna exposures

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.823
starts to really then
drive the adaptations

01:18:19.823 --> 01:18:20.880
that we're looking for.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.890
So it's not a quick fix.

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:26.480
A heat acclimation strategy
has to happen long before

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.420
fight week or long before the fights.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.260
This is a process that has
to begin eight to 10 weeks

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.710
before the fight so that we can actually

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:37.140
get that adaptation and that
tolerance to the stressor,

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.253
to the exposure of heat.

01:18:38.253 --> 01:18:40.410
- This is interesting, until today,

01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:42.500
when we were talking about
this earlier, and again now,

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.770
I didn't realize that,

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:46.940
but it makes perfect
sense now that I hear it,

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.010
that heat adaptation is possible,

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:51.510
that you basically can train the body

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:53.530
to become better at cooling itself,

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:54.743
which is what sweating is.
- Yeah.

01:18:54.743 --> 01:18:56.790
- I mean, I should have known that before,

01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:59.630
but you don't see that in
the textbooks and so, yeah.

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:03.350
- I mean, listen, it's the same

01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:04.990
as the ketogenic conversation.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.830
You're training your body to
be more metabolic efficient,

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:10.389
you're training your body
to tolerate heat more,

01:19:10.389 --> 01:19:11.450
you're training your body...

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:15.920
Like the body as an organism,
as an organic system,

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.720
it's hugely adaptable,
it's hugely plastic.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.900
But I think the skill is
understanding the whens,

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:26.150
the whys and the whereofs in
terms of changing the overload,

01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:29.410
changing the stimulus to
drive specific adaptation.

01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:32.490
And philosophically that's
how we go about our work here.

01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:35.660
We talk about adaptation-led programming.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.670
Now, adaptation-led programming fits into

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:40.930
every single category,
not just lifting weights

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:41.950
or running track.

01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:43.320
It fits into nutrition.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.250
It fits into sitting in the sauna.

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:47.170
It fits into being in a cold bath or not.

01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:49.490
It fits into so many
different things because

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.980
we're driven by scientific insights.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.490
And that's how we really want
to go about our business.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:55.730
- I love it, I love this concept

01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:58.080
of adaptation-led
programming and doing that,

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.470
not just in the context of
throwing another plate on the bar

01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:02.303
or something like that,

01:20:02.303 --> 01:20:06.716
but in every aspect of one's
training and performance.

01:20:06.716 --> 01:20:08.330
And I think there's a lot
here that's applicable

01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:10.240
to the recreational athlete, too.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.560
- Yeah.
- Would you say that,

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.380
what comes to mind is 12 weeks.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.260
It feels like 12 weeks is a
nice block of time for someone

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.376
to try something in terms
of to try something new,

01:20:20.376 --> 01:20:22.350
see how they adapt, adapt,

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.160
and then maybe switch to something new.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.110
I realized that it's very
hard to throw a kind of pan

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.320
timeframe around something,
but in terms of if someone

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.460
wanted to experiment with heat adaptation

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.190
or experiment with cold adaptation

01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:37.990
or change up their
training regimen or diet,

01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:40.450
and look at metabolic efficiency,

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:43.710
do you think 12 weeks
is a good period of time

01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.500
to really give something a thorough go?

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.410
And gain an understanding of how well

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.350
or how poorly something works for oneself?

01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:51.840
Or would you say eight is enough?

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.980
Or three?

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:55.070
- I mean, that's the how
long is a piece of string

01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:56.730
kind of response, right?
- Yeah.

01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:59.710
- I mean, yes, if we're just
talking arbitrary numbers-

01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:01.970
- Recreational experimenter.
- Yeah, like three months

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:05.080
exposure, 12 week training strategy,

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.192
12 week intervention is
more than adequate to say

01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:12.090
for 99% of things that
change within the body,

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:14.780
that physiologically adapt
to a training stimulus

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.680
or an overload stimulus,

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.100
you're going to start to see
either regression or progression,

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.840
beneficial or detrimental
effects within three months.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.370
Absolutely, I would say so.

01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:27.650
Now, listen, I say that in as
much as we do training blocks

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.010
here that are three weeks long.

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.160
- Right, well, that's
because of this constraint

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.960
that sometimes people suddenly have to,

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.220
they get the call to fight.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.053
- Correct, yeah.

01:21:35.053 --> 01:21:37.020
So it's like super condensed.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.850
And in that scenario,

01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:44.850
we're always conscious of is
their body or this individual,

01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:48.700
do they have the ability to
tolerate that super overload,

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.590
that super condensed exposure?

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:52.070
Now, we might be doing that purposefully.

01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:54.210
We might be trying to do
an overreaching strategy

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.430
where we're really trying
to damage or flex something.

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:59.200
And I don't mean like negatively damage,

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.470
but like we're trying to damage tissue

01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:04.800
to really get an adaptive
response versus a more drawn out

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.680
12 week strategy, which is more coherent,

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.720
more planned out, more
structured in nature.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.580
But yeah, for all your listeners,

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:16.501
I would say 12 weeks
to engage in a process

01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:19.780
of trying to change and adapt your body

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.200
or expose yourself to something
is more than sufficient

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.000
to see if it's going to be
the right approach for you.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.960
And I think, the
individual interpretation,

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.570
it always has to be considered.

01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:34.100
And I think that's where
it comes back to be

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:37.830
a thinking man's athlete or
be a thinking man's trainer,

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:40.660
like someone that's
going through exercise,

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:44.780
you have to consciously
understand where your body's at

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:45.810
any moment in time, you know?

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:47.320
You've got to be real with yourself.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.620
You create a journal, create
a log of your training,

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.910
create a log of your feelings,
your subjective feedback

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:54.433
of how you felt, your mood, your sleep.

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:56.789
- Do your athletes do that?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:22:56.789 --> 01:22:58.700
We try to promote that because again,

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.553
that's part of this process, you know?

01:23:02.543 --> 01:23:03.510
It might be 12 weeks for you,

01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:06.140
but I might get the same
responses in eight weeks.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:11.090
And I think that's another
critical theme here is that

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:15.320
we could put 15 guys on the mat

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.550
and give them the same workout,

01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:20.420
and there's going to be
15 different responses

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.540
to that same workout
because the human organism

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.880
is so complex.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.080
And in nature, it's going
to adapt differently.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.430
Some people will tolerate it.

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:31.150
Some people are going
to be challenged by it.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:33.040
Some people have got a metabolic makeup

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040
that's going to promote it.

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.531
Some people are metabolically
challenged by it.

01:23:36.531 --> 01:23:38.850
There's just so many different things

01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:39.810
that we have to consider.

01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:41.820
And that's what we try to do here.

01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:44.370
It's the cross we bear is
that we try to understand

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:47.753
on an individual level how to
optimize athletic performance.

01:23:47.753 --> 01:23:48.990
- I think it's terrific,

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.670
and the athletes here are
so fortunate to have this.

01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:54.200
And most people out there,

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.160
I've certainly been
trying to encourage people

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.940
to learn some science and some mechanism

01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.080
and become scientists
of their own pursuits,

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.220
whether or not skill learning

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.373
or athletic pursuit, et cetera.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.440
As sort of a final question,

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.387
what are some things about
the UFC or something about

01:24:09.387 --> 01:24:11.750
the UFC that perhaps people don't know

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.470
in terms of its overall mission

01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:14.940
or what you guys are trying to do here?

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.620
I mean, I think, I've become a fan of MMA

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.840
and I am more and more as time moves on.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.180
Some people might be into MMA,

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.540
some people not into watching MMA,

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.370
but what are some things
that the UFC is interested in

01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:30.807
and doing that most people
might not know about,

01:24:30.807 --> 01:24:33.090
and certainly I might not know about?

01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:37.203
- Yeah, I mean, I think,
we try to be cutting edge.

01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:41.510
We try to be super progressive.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:43.960
We think we've got an
amazing platform here,

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.580
particularly at the Performance Institute

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.990
to do some really cool things that can

01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:48.670
inform many different people.

01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:51.930
And that doesn't just mean
the 600 or so athletes

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:54.020
that are on our global roster.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:58.190
What we're trying to do is,
is influence global community

01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:00.930
around optimizing human performance.

01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:02.640
So, any moment in time,

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.630
we're engaging in different technologies

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.730
with different vendors,
different partners,

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:10.740
exploring opportunities
to learn more, share data,

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.620
understand what's the best mechanisms

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:14.397
for interpreting your body,

01:25:14.397 --> 01:25:17.060
interpreting how your body's
responding to training,

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:20.600
interpreting your nutrition
or whatever it may be.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.960
We're in a really privileged
position to do that.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.810
But we've also, hence
you being here today,

01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:30.490
we're also trying to venture
into some really cool areas

01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:33.830
of science and research
that's got applicability,

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:35.910
that you can take from
high performance athletes

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:40.120
and apply to yourself, to Joe
Blow walking down the street,

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.820
out there that is really interesting.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.120
And that's everything
from whether it's CBD

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.510
and psychedelics, through
to different technologies

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.110
for thermal monitoring and
Bluetooth heart rate monitoring

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:54.330
or whatever it may be,

01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:56.860
through to data management, et cetera,

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.240
and anything in between.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.070
We've got some great partners
on the nutrition side,

01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:03.540
on the psychology side, on the data side.

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:07.330
And I think we always try
to just push the envelope

01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:08.163
a little bit more.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.710
I think we keep our core
mission with our athletes,

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:15.220
but I think a lot of what
we do, hence your podcast,

01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:17.610
an amazing platform, you
do such a great job of it,

01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:21.760
that we can all learn
and take from the elite

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.450
and interpret how it might help us,

01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:25.230
and just in the general population.

01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:29.610
So, I think that's our north
star is to provide our athletes

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:32.683
the best integrated service of care,

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.680
but we also want to influence
just the global community

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.781
and put the UFC at the forefront of that.

01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:40.147
- That's great, well, you
guys are certainly doing it,

01:26:40.147 --> 01:26:43.580
and we can't let the cat
out of the bag just yet.

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.350
But the things that we're gearing up

01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:46.797
to do with my laboratory-
- Yeah, I'm excited.

01:26:46.797 --> 01:26:49.580
- And the work together,
hopefully we'll be able

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.700
to talk about that and share
that in the year to come,

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.170
but we're very excited about that.

01:26:55.170 --> 01:27:00.170
And, Duncan, look, I have
this filter that I use

01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:03.150
when I talk to people,
academics or otherwise,

01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:04.730
which is some people,
they open their mouth,

01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:06.760
and it doesn't make much difference,

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.170
but when you speak, I learn so much.

01:27:10.170 --> 01:27:13.150
I'm going to take the protocols
that I've heard about today,

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:14.487
I'm going to think about how I'm training

01:27:14.487 --> 01:27:16.190
and how I could train
differently and better,

01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:19.960
how I'm eating, how I could
eat differently and better

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.373
for sake of performance
and just in general.

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:27.740
Thank you so much for your
time, your scientific expertise,

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.630
the stuff you're doing in the
practical realm, it's immense.

01:27:30.630 --> 01:27:33.320
So, hopefully we can do it again.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.300
- Yes, thank you.

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.133
This has been a blast.

01:27:35.133 --> 01:27:37.200
I appreciate it and yeah,
keep doing what you're doing

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.670
'cause I know there's a
lot of people out there

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:39.590
that love the platform.

01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:40.990
So, thanks for the invite.

01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:42.360
It's been awesome.
- Oh, thank you.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.020
Thanks so much.

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.100
Thank you for joining
me for my conversation

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:47.840
with Dr. Duncan French.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.720
I hope you found it as insightful
and informative as I did.

And there you can support the podcast

01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:25.540
at any level that you like.

01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:28.360
Many previous episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.750
we discuss supplements;
supplements for sleep,

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:34.360
supplements for focus and for
other health benefits as well.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.160
While supplements may
not be for everybody,

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.450
if you're going to use supplements,

01:28:37.450 --> 01:28:38.900
you want to make sure
that those supplements

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.810
are of the very highest quality.

01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:44.450
For that reason, we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:47.910
because Thorne supplements are
of the very highest quality

01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:51.150
and the amounts of ingredients
listed on the label

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:53.170
of Thorne supplements precisely matches

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:55.550
what is actually contained
in those capsules,

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:57.650
bottles and pills and
powders and so forth.

01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:58.790
This is extremely important.

01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:01.530
A lot of analysis of supplements
and supplement companies

01:29:01.530 --> 01:29:05.020
have shown that what's listed
on the bottle is often not

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.530
what's actually contained in the bottle.

01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:09.400
Thorne's stringency is unmatched.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.860
They've partnered with all
the major sports teams,

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.230
with the Mayo Clinic.

01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:15.380
And so, there's a lot of
trust in Thorne supplements

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.720
for all the right reasons.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.530
If you'd like to try Thorne supplements,

01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:20.280
you can see the supplements that I take,

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:25.280
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.040
There, you can see the
supplements that I take.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.280
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.250
And if you navigate into the Thorne site

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:35.010
through that portal, you can get 20% off

01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:37.280
any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.300
I'd also like to mention
that if you're not already

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:42.160
following us on Instagram @hubermanlab,

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.140
you might want to do so.

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:47.150
There I do brief science
tutorials and offer science-based

01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:50.170
protocols for all sorts of
things that are often separate

01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:51.750
from the protocols and information
