00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:00.941
[upbeat music]

00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:01.930
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.720
where we discuss science

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.410
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.600
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.860
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.460
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.660
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870
to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.940
about science and science-related tools

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.700
to the general public.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.570
Along those lines,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.310
I want to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.960
Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens, which is an all-in-one

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.100
vitamin mineral probiotic
liquid supplement.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.580
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.270
because I really like getting
my total vitamin mineral

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.060
base covered in one
easy to consume product.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.010
It also tastes really good.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.530
I mix mine with a little
bit of lemon juice.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.680
I've been doing that
well over a decade now.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.100
And the inclusion of probiotics
is important to me because

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.040
there's a lot of data out there right now

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.540
about the importance of gut health

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.890
for the immune system for, mood.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.940
And so by combining all
these things in one product

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.600
you get all those things at once.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.140
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.360
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.590
and that will give you a special offer

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.230
where you will get a year supply
of liquid vitamin D3 and K2

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.340
vitamin D3 has been shown to be important

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.300
for various aspects of immune function

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.380
as well as other biological functions.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.750
And so once more, if you
want to try athletic greens

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.430
and get the year supply of vitamin D3 K2

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.290
just go to athletigreens.com/huberman.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.610
The other sponsor of today's
podcast is InsideTracker.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.590
InsideTracker is a way to
measure metabolic factors,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.230
hormones, and DNA related factors

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.580
by way of blood tests and saliva

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.930
in order to assess one's health.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.990
I'm a big believer in blood
tests and saliva tests

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.950
for assessing one's health
markers, because I like data.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.270
And there's really no other way to measure

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.480
what's going on in one's body

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.310
without taking the occasional
blood test or saliva test.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.260
You can guess what's going on

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.966
but if you really want to know
what's going on under the hood

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.700
InsideTracker can be of great help.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.320
One of the problems with a
lot of products out there

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.690
or just regular blood testing

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.920
is that you get a lot of
data back about the levels

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.930
of various hormones,
metabolic factors, et cetera,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.960
but you don't know what
to do with those data.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.410
Great thing about InsideTracker
is provided in a format.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.350
They have an online dashboard

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.040
that given your particular
levels of various things

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.873
directs you

00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:39.390
toward potential lifestyle related changes

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.230
like changes in exercise, or
changes in sleep patterns,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.640
or changes in nutritional patterns,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.890
that can really help move
those markers and those numbers

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.130
on those metabolic factors,
hormones, et cetera

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.990
in the direction that you want.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.570
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.710
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.547
And if you do that,

00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:02.740
you'll 25% off their program at checkout.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.660
Okay, let's get started.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.720
Today is episode three of the podcast

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.440
and it is office hours.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.480
Office hours as many of you
know, it's where students

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.430
come to the office of the professor,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.390
sit down and ask questions,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.690
requesting clarification about
things that were confusing,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.880
or to simply go down the
route of exploring a topic

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.220
with more depth and detail.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.810
I asked for your questions to be listed

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.100
in the comment section of
the previous two episodes

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.170
of the podcast on YouTube,
as well as on Instagram.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.050
And I first of all just want to thank you

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.810
for the many questions,
they are excellent.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.200
We read them all.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.240
We distilled from that
large batch of questions

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.500
to two types of questions.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.420
Questions that were asked very often

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.390
and were light very often with
a little thumbs up like tab

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.700
as well as questions that we
thought could really expand

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.510
on the topics that we've
covered previously.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.570
And today we're going
to cover both of those.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.890
If we did not get to your
question, please don't despair.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.290
We will keep track of those.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.630
And we have several more
episodes devoted to this topic

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.460
of sleep and wakefulness and learning

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.493
during the month of January, maybe even,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.430
leaking over a little bit
into the month of February.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.030
So, we have time that's
one of the unique formats

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.730
of this podcast is that
we have time for dialogue,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.970
we have time for your questions

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.620
and we have time to really
go deep into these topics.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.840
It's official Costello is
sleeping in the background.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.190
So if you hear snoring, Costello
is going to be keeping time

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.430
with his deep and melodic snoring.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.490
There he goes.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.490
So the questions that we
received, I batched crudely

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.820
into a couple of different categories,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.820
light, exercise, supplementation,
temperature, learning,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.190
plasticity, and mood, and sort
of mood related disorders.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.000
There were a lot of questions about those.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.630
Before we begin any of this

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.150
I want to point out something that I,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.500
I always say it sounds like boiler plate

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.350
but it's important not just to protect me

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.380
but to protect you, which is
that I am not a physician.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.370
I'm not a medical doctor.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.670
I don't prescribe anything,
including behavioral protocols.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.503
I'm a professor.

00:05:12.503 --> 00:05:13.640
So I profess a lot of things

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.853
based on quality peer reviewed studies.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.090
You should take that information.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.120
You should filter it
through whatever it is

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.680
that you currently happen
to be dealing with,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.990
whether or not that's health
or illness, you should consult

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.280
with a licensed healthcare
professional before you add

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.293
or remove anything from
your daily life protocol.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.010
I'm not responsible for your health.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.318
You are, so be smart with this information

00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:41.393
and be a stringent filter, as we say.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.363
Okay, very well let's get
started on the actual material.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.290
Somebody asked, what is the
role of moonlight and fire,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.450
I'm presuming they mean fireplace

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.510
or candle or things of that
sort, in circadian rhythms.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.330
Is it okay to view moonlight at night

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.720
or will that wake me up?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.270
Will a fire in my fireplace
or using candle light

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.900
be too much light.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.790
Great question, also
offers me the opportunity

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.940
to share with you

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.320
what I think is a quite
beautiful definition

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.750
of what light is in a quantitative sense.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.330
So I've mentioned a few
times the use of apps

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.920
and light meters and things
to measure things like locks,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.660
which sometimes are also
described in terms of Kendals.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.600
So those are the two units
for measuring light intensity.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.960
Typically lux, L-U-X is the, is the unit.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.720
And so before we go forward
and discuss this many lux

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.010
or that many lux, I want to
just tell you what a lux is

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.800
because it relates to this question.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.800
One lux equals the illumination
of one square meter surface

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.730
at one meter away from a single candle.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.563
Think about that.

00:06:53.563 --> 00:06:55.800
So somebody actually decided at some point

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.290
that the amount of illumination
at one square meter surface,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.840
one meter away from a single
candle, that equals one lux.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.040
So when we talk about 6,000
lux of light intensity

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.460
or 10,000 lux of light
intensity, now you have a kind of

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.720
a reference or a framework that
would be the equivalent of,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.960
you could think of it as 6,000 candles

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.790
all with their light intensity shown

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.850
on one square meter from
one meters distance away.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.920
Or of course, if it was
a different number of lux

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.430
it would be a different number of candles.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.830
So you get the idea.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.700
Here's the great thing.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.310
It turns out that moonlight, candle light,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.980
and even a fireplace, if you
have one of these roaring fires

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.710
going in the fireplace,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.110
do not reset your circadian clock at night

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.070
and trick your brain into
thinking that it's morning

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.020
even though if you've ever
sat close to a fireplace

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.090
or even a candle, that
light seems very bright.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.900
And there are two reasons for
that that are very important.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.320
The first one is that
these neurons in your eye

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.100
that I discussed in the previous episode

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.660
these melanopsin ganglion cells

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.960
also called intrinsically
photosensitive ganglion cells.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.990
Those cells adjust their
sensitivity across the day,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.300
and those cells respond best
to the blue-yellow contrast

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.860
present in the rising and setting sun,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.780
so-called low solar angle sun,

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.010
also discussed in the previous episode,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.690
but those cells adjust
their sensitivity such that

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.810
they will not activate
the triggers in the brain

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.810
that conveyed daytime signals
when they view moonlight,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.530
even a full moon a really
bright moon or fire.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.250
Now this does raise an
interesting kind of thought point,

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.210
which is, you know, a lot of people talked

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.550
about lunacy and the fact that
when there's a full moon out

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.050
people act differently
and behave differently.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.370
There's a lot of lore around that.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.460
There's actually a little bit
of quality science around that

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.320
that maybe we can address in the future.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.850
But, moonlight is typically
not going to wake us up

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.630
too much, except maybe
the moon is really full

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.020
and really bright, there's
possibility for that.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.690
So, providing you're not going
to burn down the structure

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.370
you're in, you're not going
to burn down the forest,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.130
enjoy your, your fireplaces,
enjoy your lights from candles.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.590
And those are perfectly safe

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.310
without disrupting your circadian rhythm.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.760
Because we talked about
just how crucial it is

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.800
to avoid bright lights

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.740
between the hours of about
10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.338
Except when you need to view
things for sake of safety

00:09:21.338 --> 00:09:24.530
or work or so and so forth.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.610
I also received a lot of
questions about red light.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.270
Now, I think I was asked those questions

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.800
because red light is used

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.950
in a number of different
commercial products

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.770
where these products
tend to include a sheet,

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.650
of very bright red lights.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.470
That one is supposed to
view early in the day.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.360
And there are various claims attached

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.130
to these red light devices

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.970
that they improve mitochondrial function,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.090
that they improve metabolism there-

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.360
I'm going to be really honest
and I can't name brands,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.440
and I'm not going to
name particular studies.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.460
'Cause what I'm about to say

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.993
about these studies is
not particularly unkind

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.600
but let's just say that none
of the studies that I've seen

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.740
except for one that I'll
talk about in a moment,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.350
pointing to the positive
effects of red light

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.850
on the visual system are
published in blue ribbon journals.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.260
They tend to be published in journals

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.163
that I had to work hard to find.

00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:21.170
I'm not sure what the peer
review and stringency level is.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.060
Now, that's not to say
red light isn't beneficial

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.340
because there is one study in particular

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.850
that came from Glen Jeffrey's Lab

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.200
at the University of College, London

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.240
it was published last year.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.970
Glen is somebody I happen to know

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.720
is an excellent reputation,
excellent vision scientist,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.420
what this study essentially showed.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.000
And again, this is a study that

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.800
I very much liked the data

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.190
and think it was done
with very high standards.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.690
What this study shows is
that, viewing red light

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.090
for a few minutes each morning

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.190
can have positive effects on mitochondria

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.430
in a particular retinal cell
type, that tends to degenerate

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.200
or decline in function with age in humans.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.950
And that cell type is the photoreceptor.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.380
The photoreceptor is a
type of cell in your eye

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.120
that sits at the back of the eye.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.600
It's kind of some distance
away from the ganglion cells.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.020
And it's the cell that
converts light information

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.650
into electrical signals that the rest

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.380
of the retina and brain can understand.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.010
These are vitally important
cells without them,

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.170
people are blind.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.780
And many people's vision
gets worse with age.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.780
In particular, age related
macular degeneration

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.270
but also related to some other factors

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.510
including photo receptor functionality

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.740
just getting worse with time.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.800
And what Glen showed was
that red light flashes

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.870
delivered in particular early in the day

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.630
but not late in the day can
help repair the mitochondria.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.910
Now this study needs more support

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.830
from additional studies of course.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.070
They are doing a clinical trial.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.520
They did report on what I
think it was 12 patients.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.160
And so the work is ongoing,
but that was very interesting.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.030
And it points to some
potentially really useful things

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.530
about red light.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.740
However, most of the questions I got

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.140
about red light for sake of office hours

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.550
were about the use of red
light later in the day.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.930
So here's the deal, in principle red light

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.730
will not stimulate the
melanopsin retinal neurons

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.240
that wake up the brain and circadian clock

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.040
and signal daytime.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.780
However, most of the red lights
in particular the red lights

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.390
that come on these
sheets of these products

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.930
that people are supposed
to view them in order to

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.730
access a number of
proclaimed health effects,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.410
those are way too bright

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.410
and would definitely wake
up your body and brain.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.280
So if you're going to use those products

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.300
and I'm not suggesting
you do, or you don't,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.460
but if that's your thing,
you would want to use those

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.293
early in the day.

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:43.050
Who knows you might
even derive some benefit

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.180
on mitochondria function
in these photo receptors.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.270
But if you're thinking about red light

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.100
for sake of avoiding the
negative effects of light

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.250
later in the day and at night,
then you want that red light

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.410
to be very, very dim,
certainly much dimmer

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.303
than is on most of those
commercial products.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.040
Now, do you need red lights? No.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.620
Although red lights are rather convenient

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.850
because you can see
pretty well with them on,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.770
but if they're dim, they won't
wake up the circadian clock.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.350
They won't have this
dopamine disrupting thing

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.180
that we talked about in
the previous podcast.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.550
So there's a role for red light

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.930
potentially early in the day

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.720
and for mitochondrial repair
in the photoreceptors,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.940
there's a role for dim red light

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.570
later in the day and at night.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.810
So you're starting to notice
a theme here which is that,

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.120
there's no immediate prescription
of look at these light,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.290
it's look at these lights potentially

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.597
if that's what you want to
do at particular times of day

00:13:32.597 --> 00:13:34.430
and we're particular intensities.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.040
It brings us back to the blue light issue

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.380
which is so many people are obsessed

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.010
with avoiding blue light, but you actually

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.570
want a ton of blue light early in the day

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.403
and throughout the day.

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:43.210
So don't wear your blue blockers then

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.550
or maybe even don't wear them at all.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.160
And at night, it doesn't matter
if you have blue blockers on

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.180
if the lights are bright
enough, then you're still

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.800
going to be activating
these cells and mechanisms.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.650
I just want to add something

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.560
about the science behind
the blue blocker confusion.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.330
So these melanopsin retinal
cells do react to blue light.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.910
That that is the best stimulus

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.250
for one of these
melanopsin cells, which led

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.300
to the belief that blue
blockers would be a good thing

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.930
for preventing resetting of
the circadian clock at night

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.040
and deleterious effects
of screens, et cetera.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.230
However, the people
that made these products

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.360
fail to actually read the
papers from start to finish

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.130
or if they did, they didn't
comprehend a critical element

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.930
which is that most of
those papers early on

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.440
took those neurons out
and put them in a dish.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.580
And when they did that,
they divorced those neurons

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.660
from their natural connections in the eye.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.400
It turns out in your IMI right now,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.960
because that's what we care
about, these cells exist

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.310
and the cells respond to blue light

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.330
but also to other wavelengths of light

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.870
because they not only
respond directly to light

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.750
as they do in a dish, they also respond

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.410
to input from photo receptors.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.500
So if you talk to anyone in
the circadian biology field,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.107
they'll tell you, "Oh,
yeah this blue light thing,

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.590
has really gotten out of control."

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.950
Because people assume that
blue light is the culprit

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.670
because blue light is the best stimulus.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.120
That doesn't mean that blue
light is the only stimulus

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.930
that will trigger these cells, okay?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.250
So like many things a
scientific paper can be accurate

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.500
without being exhaustive.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.690
And a lot of claims about
products can be accurate,

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.523
but not exhaustive.

00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:20.570
So blue light during the day is great.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.370
Get that screen light, get that sunlight

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.137
especially getting overhead lights.

00:15:24.137 --> 00:15:27.050
I'll talk about all this
in the previous podcast,

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.050
but at night you really want
to avoid those bright lights.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.140
And it doesn't matter if it's
blue light or something else.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.610
And so there was a real confusion about

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.160
the papers and the data when most

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.483
of those product
recommendations were made.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:42.830
Okay.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.800
While we're on that topic,
let's talk about light

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.040
in other orifices of the body.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.070
I made a kind of a joke about
this, the last podcast episode

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.840
but a couple of people
wrote to me and said,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.800
well, I've seen some
claims that light delivered

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.050
to the ears into the ears
or the roof of the mouth

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.770
or up the nose can be beneficial

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.463
for some setting circadian rhythms, no.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.740
Not directly anyway.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.120
And this is a great opportunity
for us to distinguish

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.200
between what is commonly
called the placebo effect

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.020
but a more important way to
think about any manipulation

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.000
behavioral or otherwise
that you might do is

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.210
the difference between
modulation and mediation.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.970
There are a lot of things that
will modulate your biology.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.830
Putting a couple of lights up your nose,

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.390
please don't do this.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.080
Might modulate your biology by way

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.920
of the stress hormone that's released

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.860
when you stuffed those
things up your nose.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.760
Remember earlier a previous
podcast, I said that

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.220
virtually anything we'll face
shifts your circadian rhythm

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.300
if it's different and dramatic enough.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.000
So the question is, is
it the light delivered

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.920
up the nose or through the ears

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.880
or some other orifice that's
mediating the process?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.900
Is it actually tapping
into the natural biology

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.710
of the system that you're
trying to manipulate?

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.960
And this is where I like to distinguish

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.240
between real biology and hacks.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.950
I don't like the word hack

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.450
or frankly neuro hacking or bio hacking.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.460
I just don't like the
term because a hack is

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.810
is using something for a purpose

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.080
for which it was not intended, right?

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.440
But where you can kind
of, it's kind of a cheat

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.680
and that's not how biology works well.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.930
So I try and distinguish

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.620
between things that really
mediate biological processes

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.550
and things that Modulate them.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.530
There are a number of
commercial products out there

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.050
with some studies attached to them,

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.020
claiming that light delivered
to the ears or wherever can

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.800
adjust your wakefulness
or adjust your sleep.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.840
I've looked at those papers again,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.470
I'm probably going to lose
some friends by saying this

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.410
but maybe I'll gain a few as well.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.410
Not blue ribbon journals, frankly,

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.550
oftentimes read the small print.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.360
There was a conflict of
interest clause there

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.180
related to commercial interests.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.050
If somebody disagrees
with me outright on this

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.390
and can send to me a peer reviewed paper,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.750
published in a quality journal

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.250
about light delivered anywhere,
but the eyes of humans

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.730
that can mediate circadian,
rhythms, wakefulness et cetera,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.450
I'm more than happy to take a look at that

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.610
and change my words and stance on this

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.470
and do it publicly, of course.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.670
But until then I'm guessing that

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.820
the proper controls were not done

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.300
of adjusting for heat
that could be delivered

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.860
which can definitely
shift circadian rhythms.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.000
We're going to talk about temperature

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.200
and other things like that.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.620
So light to the eyes folks is
where these light effects work

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.050
in humans, in other animals,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.773
they have extra ocular photo
reception in humans, no.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.930
And just be mindful, I mean,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.910
I'm not trying to encourage people

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.260
to avoid certain products in particular

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.900
but just be mindful of this difference

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.570
between modulation and mediation.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.470
A mediating, a process
through a hard wired

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.860
or long-standing biological
mechanism is really

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.240
where you're going to see the
powerful effects over time.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.550
I also, as you've probably noticed,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.010
I really tend to favor behavioral tools

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.760
and zero cost tools first,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.010
and getting those dialed
in before you start,

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.240
plugging in and swallowing
and putting things

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.140
in various places just
to really figure out

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.210
how your biology works and explore that,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.730
unless there's of course a clinical need

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.120
to take a prescribed drug in which case,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.230
by all means, listen to your doctor.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.490
Okay, a huge number of
people asked me about

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.720
what about light through windows?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.693
And I actually did an
Instagram post about this look,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.640
setting your circadian clock with sunlight

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.277
coming through a window
is going to take 50

00:19:31.277 --> 00:19:32.750
to 100 times longer.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.000
If you want the date on that,
I'd be happy to send you

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.720
to the various papers that were described

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.140
in the previous podcast that
Jamie Zeitzer from Stanford.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.280
And I have discussed also elsewhere

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.630
but here's really the key thing with us.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.650
Do the experiment.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.220
You can download the free app Light Meter.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.950
You can have a bright day outside

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.470
or some sunlight hold up
that app, take a picture.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.050
It'll tell you how many lux
now, you know what lux are.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.160
It will tell you how many
lux are in that environment.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.620
Now close the window.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.640
And if you want close the
screen or don't open the screen

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.720
you can do all sorts of experiments.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.410
You'll see that it will at
least half the amount of lux.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.820
And it doesn't scale linearly.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.340
Meaning let's say I get
a 10,000 lux outside,

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.450
5,000 looking out through an open window

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.290
and then I closed the
window and it's 2,500 lux.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.870
It does not mean that you just
need to view that sunlight

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.253
for twice as long if it's
half as many lux, okay?

00:20:25.253 --> 00:20:29.010
It's not like 2,500 lux
means you need to look

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:29.843
for 10 minutes

00:20:29.843 --> 00:20:33.090
and 5,000 lux means you
look for five minutes.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.690
It doesn't scale that way

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.030
just because the biology
doesn't work that way.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.490
Best thing to do is to
get outside, if you can,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.990
if you can't next best thing to do

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.600
is to keep that window open.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.170
It is perfectly fine to
wear prescription lenses

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.600
and contacts.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.060
Why is it okay to wear
prescription lenses and contacts,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.880
when those are glass also,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.900
but looking through a window,
diminishes the effect.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.590
Well, we should think about this.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.830
The lenses that you wear
in front of your eyes

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.280
by prescription or on your eyes

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.470
are designed to focus the
light on to your neural retina.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.770
In fact, that's what near-sightedness
is, is when the image

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.160
because your lens
doesn't work quite right.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.350
The image falls in front
of the neural retina,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.080
wearing a particular lens in front of that

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.400
focuses the lens onto your
retina onto these very neurons.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.590
So they can communicate that to the brain.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.870
It's Costello is loving this light.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.010
He's deep in sleep.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.100
And if we, maybe we
could play him some tones

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.020
and he'll remember it
later, based on the studies,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.953
we're going to talk about in a little bit.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.150
I don't know how we'd know
if he remembered it or not,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.380
but prescription lenses are fine.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.940
In fact, they're great for this reason

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.980
they're actually focusing
the light onto the retina.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.980
So think about this logically

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.840
and all of a sudden it makes
perfect sense your glass window

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.280
or your windshield or the
side window of your car,

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.030
it isn't optically
perfect to bring the image

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.570
and the light onto your retina.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.220
In fact, what it's
doing is it's scattering

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.680
and filtering light in particular

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.470
the wavelengths of light that you want.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.910
So, if you live in a low light environment

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.090
lots of questions about this.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.800
We talked about this, the previous podcast

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.420
but just get outside for longer or,

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.890
and/or use really bright lights inside.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.420
Okay, so let's think about

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.140
why I'm making some of
these recommendations

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.540
because I think it can really empower you

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.840
with the ability to change your behavior

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.530
in terms of light
viewing and other things,

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.260
depending on time of year,

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.050
depending on other lifestyle factors.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.960
The important point to understand
is that early in the day,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.830
your central circadian clocks

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.240
and all these mechanisms are
looking for a lot of light.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.570
I mean, they don't have
a mind of their own,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.030
but it needs a lot of light to
trigger this daytime signal,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.263
alertness et cetera.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.270
And early in the day, but
not in the middle of the day,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.950
you can sum or add photons.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.240
So there's this brief period
of time early in the day,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.270
when the sun is low in the sky

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.500
when your brain and body are expecting

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.330
a morning wake up signal

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.570
where let's say, it's
not that bright outside.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.820
Someone sent me a picture or
a little movie of their walk

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.010
in England, and it was pretty overcast

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.410
and they were using
light meter and they said

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.090
it's only about 700
lux or maybe even less.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.610
And I said, well, stay outside longer.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.200
But when you get inside, turn
on the lights really bright

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.960
and overhead lights in particular,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.780
because those will be best for
stimulating these mechanisms.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.110
And that's because at least

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.560
for the first few hours of the day,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.840
you can continue to some
or add photon activation

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.370
of the cells in the eye and the brain.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.700
In the middle of the day, once
the sun is overhead, or even

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.340
if you stay inside all morning,

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.040
and then you're in the
circadian dead zone,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.470
which sounds terrible and it is terrible.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.280
You doesn't matter if you
get a ton of artificial light

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.160
or even sunlight,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.570
you're not going to shift
your circadian clock.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.990
You're not going to get
that wake up signal.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.790
And then in the evening,
you want to think about

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.480
this whole system as being vulnerable

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.450
to even a few photons of light
because of their sensitivity

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.210
to light really goes up at night.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.530
And I talked last time
about how you can protect

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:10.220
against that sensitivity by
looking at the setting sun

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.250
and watching the evening sun,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.870
even if it's not crossing the horizon

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.350
around the time of sunset.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.960
And that's because it adjusts
your retinal sensitivity

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.160
and your melatonin pathway

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.780
so that light is not as
detrimental to melatonin at night.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.800
Think about the afternoon
sunlight viewing as kind of a,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.400
I think of it as kind of
a Netflix inoculation.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.760
It allows me to watch a little bit

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.210
of Netflix in the evening,
although it's very

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.310
hard to watch a little bit
of anything on Netflix.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.960
It seems like there's some
other neuro-biological process

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.040
that going on there where I have to watch

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.420
episode after episode after episode.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.730
But in any case, you can protect yourself

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.440
against some of that bad
effect of light at night

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.730
by looking at light in the evening.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.160
It really does adjust down
the sensitivity of the system.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.080
Okay.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.540
I want to talk about seasonal changes

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.870
in all these things as they
relate to mood and metabolism.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.750
So depending on where
you are in the world,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.340
Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.350
at the equator or closer to the poles,

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.720
the days and nights are going
to be different lengths.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.140
That just makes sense.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.680
But that translates to
real biological signals

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.370
that impact everything from
wakefulness and sleep times

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.060
but also mood and metabolism.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.740
So here's how this works.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.970
Now, after seeing the previous
episode of the podcast

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.620
and paying attention here, you are armed

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.710
with the knowledge to
really understand how it is

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.350
that believe it or not, every
cell in your body is tuned

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.840
to the movement of the
planet relative to the sun.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.360
So as all of you know,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.110
the earth spins once every
24 hours on its axis.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.070
So part of that day
were bathed in sunlight

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.860
depending on where we are
the other half of the day

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.850
or part of the day we're in darkness.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.360
The earth also travels
around the sun 365 days

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.410
is the time that it takes, one year,

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.893
to travel around that sun.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.080
The earth is tilted.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.160
It's not perfectly upright.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.220
So the earth is tilted on its axis.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.790
So depending on where we
are in that 365 day journey

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.650
and depending on where we
are in terms of hemisphere,

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.770
Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.240
some days of the year
are longer than others.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.150
Some are very short, some are very long.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.050
If you're at the, at the equator

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.590
you experience less variation

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.150
in day length and therefore nightlife.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.930
And if you're closer to the poles,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.760
you're going to experience
some very long days.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.410
And you're also going to
experience some very short days

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.900
depending on which poll you're at

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.570
and what time of year it is.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.900
The simple way to put this
as depending on time of year

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.220
the days are either getting
shorter or getting longer.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.380
Now, every cell in your
body adjusts its biology

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.380
according to day length, except
your brain, body and cells

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.810
don't actually know
anything about day length.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.980
It only knows night length.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.240
And here's how it works.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.963
Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.750
If days are long and getting longer,

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.200
that means melatonin is reduced.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.500
The total amount of melatonin is less

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.130
because light is more,
therefore melatonin is less.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.440
If days are getting shorter,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.510
light can't inhibit melatonin as much,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.310
through the summing of photon mechanisms

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.980
that we talked about before,

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.840
and that melatonin
signal is getting longer.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.300
So every cell in your body actually knows

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.760
external day length and
therefore time of year

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.870
by way of the duration
of the melatonin signal.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.710
And in general, it's fair to
say that in diurnal animals,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.870
meaning animals like us
that tend to be awake

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.430
during the daytime and
not nocturnal animals,

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.053
which tend to be awake at night.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.700
The longer the melatonin
signal, the more depressed

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.760
not necessarily clinically depressed,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.770
although that can happen

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.173
but the more depressed
our systems tend to be.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.300
Reproduction, metabolism, mood,
turnover rates of skin cells

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.890
and hair cells all tend to be diminished

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.210
compared to the spring and summer months

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.600
for some Northern hemisphere,
spring and summer months,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.910
or the times in which days are very long.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.700
And there's less melatonin that tends to,

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.900
in almost all animals,
including humans, more breeding,

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.610
more hormone elevation of the hormones

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.372
that stimulate breeding reproduction

00:28:28.372 --> 00:28:33.372
and fertility metabolism
is up, lipid metabolism

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.140
fat-burning is up,
protein synthesis is up.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.830
These things tend to
correlate with the seasons.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.050
Now, some people are very, very

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.330
strongly tied to the seasons.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.280
They get depressed,
clinically depressed in winter

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.570
and light therapies are very
useful for those people.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.960
Some people love the winter
and they're happiest in winter

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.470
and they feel kind of depressed in summer.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.650
Although that is far more rare.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.880
That doesn't mean depression
cannot exist in the summer,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.680
but when we're talking
about seasonal depression

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.080
that tends to be true.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.203
It's more depression in winter.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.900
Now there's other things that
correlate with seasonality.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.640
Suicide rates tend to
be highest in the spring

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.980
not in the winter,

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.800
but that has to do with some of the more

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.150
complicated and unfortunately
tragic aspects of suicide

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.910
which is that oftentimes
people will commit suicide

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.420
not at the very depths
of their energy levels,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.720
but as they're emerging from
those depths of low energy.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.660
So we'll talk about
suicidality and mood disorders

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.040
in a later podcast season,
meaning a month later.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.800
But for now, just understand that

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.850
everybody is going through
these natural fluctuations

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.840
depending on the duration
of the melatonin signal.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.110
Now this might lead you to say, "Well,

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.160
then I should just really
get as much light as I can

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.830
all the time and reduce melatonin
feel great all the time."

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.050
Unfortunately, doesn't work that way

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.370
because melatonin also
has important effects

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.883
on the immune system.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.640
It has important effects

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.900
on transmitter systems
in the brain, et cetera.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.860
So everybody needs to
figure out for themselves

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.970
how much light they need early in the day

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.250
and how much light they need to avoid

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.160
late in the day,

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.650
in order to optimize
their mood and metabolism.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.560
There is no one size fits all prescription

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.180
because there's a range
of melatonin receptors,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.480
there are a range of
everything from metabolic types

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.410
to genetic histories,
family histories, et cetera.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.730
There is no one size fits all prescription

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.040
but by understanding that
light and extended day length

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.650
inhibit melatonin and melatonin tends

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.360
to be associated with a more depressed

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.400
or reduced functioning of
these kinds of activity driving

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.500
and mood elevating signals,

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.010
and understanding that
you have some control

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.930
over melatonin by way of
light, including sunlight

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.460
but also artificial light,
and that should empower you

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.290
I believe, to make the adjustments

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.960
that if you're feeling low you might ask,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960
how much light am I getting?

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.580
What am I getting that light?

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.930
Because sleep is also important
for restoring mood, right?

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.770
So you need sleep.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.910
You can't just, just crush
melatonin across the board

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.270
and expect to feel good because

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.010
then you're not going to
fall asleep and stay asleep.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.920
Melatonin, not incidentally comes from,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.680
is synthesized from serotonin.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.770
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
that is associated

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.470
with feelings of well-being
provided to proper levels,

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.440
but well-being of a particular kind.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.390
Well-being associated
with quiescence and calm

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.840
and the feeling that we
have enough resources

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.110
in our immediate kind of conditions.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.150
Is the kind of thing that
comes from a good meal

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.220
or sitting down with friends
or holding a loved one,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.740
or conversing with somebody
that you really bond with.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.730
Serotonin does not stimulate action.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.630
It tends to stimulate stillness.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.300
Very different than the
neuromodulator dopamine

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.170
which is a reward feel good neuromodulator

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.730
that stimulates action.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.040
And actually dopamine is the cursor

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.570
to epinephrin, to adrenaline

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.130
which actually puts us into action.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.460
There it's actually made
from dopamine, right?

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.260
So, you can start to think how about light

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.470
as a signal that is very powerful

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.660
for modulating things
like sleep and wakefulness

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.530
but also serotonin
levels, melatonin levels.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.270
And I talked about this previously

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.200
but I'll mention once more,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.210
that light in the middle of the night

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.570
reduces dopamine levels to the point where

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.510
it can start causing problems

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.680
with learning and memory and mood.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.760
That's one powerful reason
to void bright light

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.308
in the middle of the night.

00:32:37.308 --> 00:32:38.950
Okay.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.410
Seasonal rhythms have a number of effects

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.460
but humans are not
purely seasonal breeders.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.950
Unlike a lot of animals,
we breed all year long.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:52.390
In fact, there's a preponderance
of September babies

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.050
in my life, not actual babies,

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.220
because they're born in September

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.170
which means that they were
conceived in December,

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:01.143
without knowing the details
we can fairly assume that.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.470
And December, at least in
the Northern hemisphere

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.490
at days tend to be shorter
and nights tend to be longer.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.890
So clearly humans aren't seasonal breeders

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.200
but there are shifts in
breeding and fertility

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.240
that exist in humans,

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.700
but also much more
strongly in other animals.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.290
So seasonal effects vary.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.360
Some of you will experience
very strong seasonal effects

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.020
others of you will not.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.110
I think everybody should be taking care to

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.050
get adequate sunlight and to
avoid bright light at night

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.063
throughout the year if possible.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.960
Throughout this podcast
and in previous episodes,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.830
I've been mentioning neuromodulators,

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.330
things like serotonin and dopamine

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.370
which tend to buy a certain brain circuits

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.030
and things in our body to
happen in certain brain circuits

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.340
and things in our body not to happen.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.000
One of the ones I've mentioned
numerous times is epinephrin

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.030
which is a neuromodulator that
tends to put us into action,

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.540
make us want to move.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.617
In fact, when it's released
in high amounts in our brain

00:33:56.617 --> 00:33:59.240
and body, it can lead
to what we call stress

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.933
or the feeling of being stressed.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.590
Several people ask me,
what's the difference

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.360
between epinephrin and adrenaline.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.960
Adrenaline is secreted
from the adrenal glands

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.920
which sit right above our kidneys.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.140
Epinephrin is the exact same molecule

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.520
except that it's released
within the brain.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.220
And so people use these
phrases or these words

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.910
rather interchangeably, epi means near

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.260
or on top of sometimes and neph, neph

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.220
Anytime you see nephron
or ph it means kidney.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.300
So it means near the kidney.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.310
So epinephrin actually
means near the kidney.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.640
So it was used originally
to describe adrenaline,

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.430
but epinephrin and adrenaline
are basically the same thing

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:42.540
and they tend to stimulate
agitation and the desire to move.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.540
That's what that's about.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.590
Which brings us to the topic of exercise.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.970
Got a lot of questions about exercise.

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:53.610
What forms of exercise are
best for sleeping well?

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.573
When should I exercise et cetera.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.790
There's a lot of them individual
variability around this,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:04.360
but I can talk about what I
know from the science literature

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.223
and what I happened to do myself.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.280
There are basically two forms of exercise

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.670
that we can talk about although, of course

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.210
I realize there are many
different forms of exercise.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.410
There's much more nuance to this,

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.630
but we can talk about
cardiovascular exercise,

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.670
where the idea is to repeat a movement

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.180
over and over and over continuously.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.860
So that'd be like running, biking, rowing

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.040
and cycling this kind of thing.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.930
Or there's a resistance
exercise where you're moving,

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.800
lifting, presumably putting down also

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.010
things of progressively
heavier and heavier weight

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.223
that you couldn't do
continuously for 30 minutes.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.890
So cardiovascular exercise is typically

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.840
the more aerobic type exercise
and resistance exercise

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.690
of course is the more
anaerobic type exercise.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.070
And yes, there's
variation between the two.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.290
Most studies of exercise have
looked at aerobic exercise

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.990
because that's basically the
thing that you can get a rat

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.280
or a mouse to do.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.880
You know what's really
weird about rats and mice,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.730
they like to run on wheels so much,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.100
that someone actually did this study,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.570
it was published in
science they put a wheel,

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.500
a running wheel in the middle of a field

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.960
and mice ran to that wheel
and ran on the wheel.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.010
They turns out that what
they like is the passage

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.170
of the visual image of the
bars in front of their face,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.030
which I find kind of remarkable

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.440
and troubling because it
seems so like trivial,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.547
but anyway they love aerobic exercise.

00:36:27.547 --> 00:36:29.660
And so most of the studies
were done on these mice

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.700
that love running on wheels.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.700
Whereas so far as it's
been challenging to find

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.120
conditions in which mice
really liked to lift weights

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.880
or we'll do it in a laboratory.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.210
So any weight bearing exercise studies

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.030
really have to be done in humans.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:46.690
And since humans are
what we're interested in,

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:50.300
there are some studies
looking at these two things

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.040
and when they tend to work best.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.110
Now you will see some
places aerobic exercise

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.410
is best done in the morning

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.870
and weight training is
best done in the afternoon.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.933
I think there's far more
individual variation than that.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.840
I think there are however,
a couple of windows

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.780
that the exercise science literature

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.400
and the circadian literature points to as

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.560
windows related to body temperature

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.433
in which performance, injury,

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.200
in which performance is optimized

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.300
injury is reduced and so on.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.820
And those tend to be 30
minutes after waking.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.830
And that probably correlates
with the inflection in cortisol

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.330
associated with waking whether or not

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:31.520
you've gotten light or not,
three hours after waking,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.360
which probably correlates to
the rise in body temperature

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.120
sometime right around waking.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.310
And the later afternoon,
usually 11 hours after waking

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.800
which is when temperature tends to peak.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.140
So some people like to
exercise in the morning.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.650
Some people like to
exercise in the afternoon.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.200
It really depends.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.290
I think for those of us
with very busy schedules,

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.870
it's advantageous to be
able to do your training

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.510
whenever you have the
opportunity to do it,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.550
unless you can really
control your schedule.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.900
And so I would never want
these recommendations

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.940
to seem like recommendations,
what I'm really describing

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.600
are some opportunities,
30 minutes after waking,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.270
three hours after waking
or 11 hours after waking

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.980
has been shown at least in some studies

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.327
to optimize performance, reduce injury

00:38:17.327 --> 00:38:18.447
and that sort of thing.

00:38:18.447 --> 00:38:21.370
But you really have to figure
out what works for you.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.000
A note about working out
first thing in the morning.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.430
Last time we talked about
non-photo phase shifts.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.280
If you exercise first
thing in the morning,

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.510
your body will start to develop
an anticipatory circuit.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.190
There's actually plasticity
in these circadian circuits

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.680
that will lead you to want to wake up

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.430
at the particular time that you exercised

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.090
the previous three or four days.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.660
So that can be a powerful tool

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.740
but you still want to get light exposure.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.140
Because it turns out that
light and exercise converged,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.290
so giving even bigger, wake up
signal to the brain and body.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.070
So you might want to think about that.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.320
Some people find if they
exercise late in the day

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.960
they have trouble sleeping

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.920
in general intense exercise does that,

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.030
whereas the kind of lower
intensity exercise doesn't.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.060
I found some interesting literature

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.250
that talked about sleep need and exercise.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.170
I found this fascinating that

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:17.210
if one is waking not feeling
rested and recovered from

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.860
and yet sleeping the same
amount that they typically have,

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.940
it's quite possible that
the intensity of exercise

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.430
in the proceeding two or
three days is too high.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:31.650
Whereas if one can't recover

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.390
no matter how much sleep they get,

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.200
they're just sleepy all the time,

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.830
I realized these things are correlated

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.450
that the volume of
training might be too high.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.920
Now I'm not an exercise scientist.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.430
We should probably get Andy
Galpin or somebody else on here,

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.999
who's really an expert
in this kind of stuff.

00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:48.760
I do realize as soon as
anyone talks about exercise

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.840
or nutrition publicly,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.830
they're basically opening themselves up

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.930
to all sorts of challenges

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.070
because you can basically find support

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.100
for almost any protocol in the literature.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.246
What I've looked at was
two journals in particular,

00:40:02.246 --> 00:40:04.340
International Journal Chronobiology

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.030
and journal Biological Rhythms.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.210
Excuse me, to assess these parameters

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.450
that I I've mentioned
just just a moment ago

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.500
because the studies tended
to be done in humans.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.400
They were fairly recent and they came from

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.764
groups that I recognized as well as

00:40:21.764 --> 00:40:24.700
knowing that those
journals are peer reviewed.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.550
Many of your questions were
about neural plasticity

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.450
which is the brain and nervous
system's ability to change

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.053
in response to experience.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.450
There was a question
that asked whether or not

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.910
these really deep biological
mechanisms around wakefulness,

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.400
time of waking sleep, et cetera

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.820
were subject to neuroplasticity
and indeed they are.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.700
Some of that plasticity is short-term

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.000
and some of it is more long-term.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.380
There's a really good
analogy here which is,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.610
if you happen to eat on
a very tight schedule

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:00.140
where every day say it
8:00 AM, noon and 7:00 PM

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.190
is when you eat your food
not suggesting you do this

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:05.470
but let's say you were to do
that for a couple of days.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.800
After a few days,

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.150
you would start to
anticipate those meal times

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.300
where no matter where
you were in the world,

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.800
no matter what was going on in your life

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.100
about five to 10 minutes
before those meal times,

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.990
you would start to feel hungry
and even a little agitated,

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.900
which is your body's way

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.110
of trying to get you to forage for food.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.690
And that's because of some peptide signals

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.260
that come from the
periphery from your body,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.150
things like hypocretin norexin

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.920
that signal to the hypothalamus

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.650
and brainstem to make you active

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.490
and alert and look for
food and feel hungry.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.070
So there's kind of an
anticipatory circuit,

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.010
that's a chemical circuit,
but eventually over time,

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.290
the neurons, the neural circuits

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.840
that control hypocretin orexin

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.350
would get tuned to the neural circuits

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:55.050
that are involved in eating
and maybe even smell and taste

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.960
to create a kind of eating circuit

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.400
that's unique to your
pattern, to your rhythms.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.100
The same thing is true for
these waking and exercise

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.770
and other schedules, including
all trade-in schedules.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.740
If you wake up in the morning

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.860
and start getting your
sunlight, you start exercising

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.170
in the morning or you
exercise in the afternoon,

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.360
pretty soon, your body will
start to anticipate that

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.050
and start to secrete
hormones and other signals

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.340
that prepare your body
for the ensuing activity

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.360
of waking up or going to sleep.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.070
So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.890
even if that rhythm
isn't down to the minute,

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.160
you'll find that there's
plasticity in these circuits

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.050
and it becomes easier to wake up early.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.270
If that's your thing or
exercise at a particular day

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.320
if that's your thing.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.220
That's the beauty of neuroplasticity.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.277
A number of people ask,

00:42:43.277 --> 00:42:45.837
"What can I do to increase plasticity?"

00:42:45.837 --> 00:42:48.310
And that really comes in two forms.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.950
There's plasticity that
we can access in sleep

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.180
to improve rates of learning
and depth of learning

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.090
from the previous day or so.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.370
And there's this an SDR
non-sleep deep breaths

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.350
that can be done without
sleeping, to improve rates

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.560
of learning and depth
of retention, et cetera.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.650
So let's consider those both

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.860
and you can incorporate
these protocols if you like.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.690
Again, these are based on
quality peer reviewed studies.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.290
First, let's talk about learning in sleep.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.690
This is based on some work that

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.930
I'll provide the reference for

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.700
that was published in the journal Science.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.070
Excellent journal, Matt
Walker also talks about some

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.910
of these studies done by others
in his book "Why We Sleep".

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.300
The studies just to remind you are

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.350
structured in he following
way an individual

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.900
is brought into a laboratory, Lowe does a

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.940
spatial memory task.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.870
So there tends to be a screen

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.520
with a bunch of different
objects popping up on the screen

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.480
in different locations.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.990
So it might be a Bulldog's
face that might be a cat,

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.310
and it might be an Apple
than it might be a pen

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:52.280
in different locations.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.010
And that sounds trivial easy

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.690
but with time you can
imagine it gets pretty tough

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.710
to come back a day later and remember,

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:01.140
if something presented in a given location

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.070
was something you've seen
before and whether or not

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.150
it was presented in that
location or a different location.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.100
If you had enough objects
and changed locations enough,

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.230
this can actually be quite difficult.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.640
In this study, the subjects either just

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.510
went through the experiment
or a particular odor

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:21.560
was released into the room
while they were learning

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.080
or a tone was played in the
room while they were learning.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.870
And then during the
sleep of those subjects

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.630
the following night and
the following night,

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.320
so this was done repeatedly
for several nights,

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.940
the same odor or tone was played

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.913
while the subjects were sleeping.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.500
They did this in different stages of sleep

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.770
non-REM sleep and rapid eye
movement, sleep REM sleep.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.235
They did this with just the tone in sleep.

00:44:50.235 --> 00:44:54.500
If the subjects had the
odor but not the tone,

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.520
they did it with putting the tone,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.300
if they had had the odor while learning.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.520
So basically all the controls,

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.570
all the things you'd want
to see done to make sure

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.960
that it wasn't some indirect
effects, a modulatory effect.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.793
Okay.

00:45:05.793 --> 00:45:10.640
And what they found was that
providing the same stimulus,

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.590
the odor, if they
smelled an odor or a tone

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.550
if the subjects heard
a tone while learning

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.080
if they just delivered that odor or tone

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.970
while the subject slept, rates of learning

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:26.230
and retention of information
was significantly greater.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:27.160
This is pretty cool.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.077
What this means that you can
cue the subconscious brain,

00:45:30.077 --> 00:45:33.500
and the asleep brain to
learn particular things

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.900
better and faster.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.210
So how might you implement this?

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.430
Well, you could play
with this if you want.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:40.810
I don't see any real challenge

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.930
to this provided the
odor and is a safe one

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.867
and then doesn't wake you up

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:49.140
and the tone is a safe one,
and doesn't wake you up.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.150
You could do this by having
a metronome, for instance,

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:53.550
while I'm learning something,

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.440
playing in the background
or particular music

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.100
and then have that very
faintly while you sleep.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.140
So you could apply this
if you like and try this.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.310
There are a number of groups I think now

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.460
that are trying this
using tactile stimulation.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.350
So slight vibration on
the wrist during learning

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.900
and then the same vibration
on the wrist during sleep.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.370
It does not appear that
the sensory modality,

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.550
whether or not it's odor or auditory tone

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.900
or tactile stimulation,

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.920
some as a sensory stimulation,
whether or not it matters.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.620
It's remarkable because it really shows

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.880
that sleep is an extension
of the waking state.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.360
We've known that for a long time

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.650
but this really tethers those two

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.410
in a very meaningful and actionable way.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.190
So I think I'll report back to you

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:36.540
as I learned more about these studies,

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.140
but that's what I know
about them at this point.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:39.973
As long as we're there

00:46:39.973 --> 00:46:41.120
we might as well talk about dreaming

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.460
'cause I got so many
questions about dreams.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.220
A couple of you, we want to
ask me what their dreams meant.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.120
Look, I don't even know what
my dreams mean half the time.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.810
I occasionally will wake up
from a dream and remember it.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.650
If you want to remember
your dreams better,

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.740
if you're somebody who has challenges

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.220
remembering your dreams,
you can set your alarms

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.450
that you wake up in the middle of this

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.870
one of these 90 minute
cycles which toward morning

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.500
tend to be occupied almost
exclusively by REM sleep.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.570
Remember early in the night,
you have less REM sleep

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.160
than later in the night.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.830
But you want to get as
much sleep as you can

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.663
'cause that's healthy.

00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:15.940
So I don't know that you
want to wake yourself up.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.200
Some people find that

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.070
writing down their thoughts immediately

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:19.980
first thing in the morning

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.040
allows them to relater
spontaneously remember

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.340
their dream they had.

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.070
There's some literature on that.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.630
The meaning of dreams is a
little bit controversial.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.180
Some people believe
they have strong meaning

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.410
other people believe that they can be

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.720
just spontaneous firing of
neurons that were active

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.680
in the waking state and
don't have any meaning.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.963
There are good data to show
that when you learn spatial,

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.490
new spatial environments that
there's a replay of those

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:51.640
environments, so-called place
cells that fire in your brain

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.650
only when you enter a
particular environment,

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:57.150
that those are replayed in
sleep in almost direct fashion

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.560
to the way that things were activated

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.510
when you were learning that spatial task.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.980
Dreams are fascinating, they're
were paralyzed during dreams

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.790
which brings us to another question.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.519
Somebody asked about sleep paralysis.

00:48:10.519 --> 00:48:13.160
We are paralyzed for much of our sleep,

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.160
so-called atonia so presumably

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.890
so we don't act out our dreams.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:20.450
Some people wake up and
they're still paralyzed.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.250
I've actually had this happen to me

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.900
not very many times, but a few times.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.890
And then they jolt themselves awake

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.410
and it actually is quite terrifying.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.570
I can say from personal
experience to wake up

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:33.220
be wide awake and you cannot
move your body at all.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.890
It's really quite frightening.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.000
There are a couple of
things that will increase

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.560
the intrusion of atonia
into the wakeful state

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.600
which is essentially
means you're waking up

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.520
but you can't, you can't move.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.680
One is marijuana, THC, a
I'm not a marijuana smoker.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.230
I'm not a copper.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.730
I don't know the legality where you live.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.820
So I'm not saying one thing
or another about marijuana.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.695
I'm just, the fact that
I had that experience

00:48:56.695 --> 00:49:00.360
without marijuana means that
it can happen regardless,

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.950
but marijuana smokers, for whatever reason

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.160
maybe it has something to do
with the cannabinoid receptors

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.010
or the serotonin receptors
downstream of the motor pathways.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.520
I don't know.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.040
I couldn't find any literature on this

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.100
but marijuana smokers
report, higher frequency

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.340
of this kind of paralysis and wakefulness

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.940
as you transition from
sleep to wakefulness.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:22.860
I suppose probably

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.720
one could learn to get
comfortable with it.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.820
For me, it was terrifying, 'cause I'm just

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.590
used to being able to
move my limbs fortunately

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:33.127
and I wasn't able to,
and it's a quite a thing,

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.830
let me tell you, okay.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.790
some other questions
about neuroplasticity.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.770
So the other form of neuroplasticity

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.950
is not the neuroplasticity
that you're amplifying

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:50.490
by listening to tones or
smelling odors in sleep,

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:52.180
but the neuroplasticity
that you can access

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.200
with non sleep deep rest.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.240
So NSDR, non sleep deep rest

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.410
as well as short 20 minute naps,

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.550
which are very close
to non sleep deep rest

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:02.910
because people rarely drop

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.090
into deep States of
sleep during short naps,

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.053
unless they're very sleep deprived.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.940
NSDR has been shown to
increase rates of learning

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:16.560
when done for 20 minute bouts for a proxy-

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.470
to match an approximately
90 minute about of learning.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.710
So what am I talking about?

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:24.810
90 minute cycles are
these ultradian cycles

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.410
that I've talked about previously.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:30.530
And we tend to learn very well
by taking a 90 minute cycle

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.570
transitioning into some focus
mode early in the cycle,

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.700
and it's hard to focus and then deep focus

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.340
and learning feels almost
like agitation and strain

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.570
and then by the end of
that 90 minute cycle,

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.740
it becomes very hard to maintain focus

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.700
and learn more information.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.040
There's a study published
in Cell Reports last year.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.180
Great journal, excellent
paper showing that

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.290
20 minute naps or light sleep

00:50:56.290 --> 00:51:00.320
of a sort of non sleep deep
rest taken immediately after

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.680
or close to it, doesn't have to be

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.620
immediately after you
finished the last sentence

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:07.120
of learning or whatever
it is, or bar of music.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.230
But you know, a couple of
minutes after transitioning

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.960
to a period of non sleep deep rest,

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.780
where you're turning off the
analysis of duration path

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.430
and outcome has been shown
to accelerate learning

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:19.050
to a significant degree.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.760
Both the amount of information

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.720
and the retention of that information.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.320
So that's pretty cool,

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:29.240
because this is a
cost-free, drug-free way of

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.600
accelerating learning without
having to get more sleep.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.690
But simply by introducing
these 20 minute bouts.

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.730
I would encourage people
if they want to try this

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.270
to consider the 20 minutes
per every 90 minutes

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.780
of ultradian learning cycle,
there you're incorporating

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.410
a number of different
neuroscience backed tools

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.090
90 minute cycles for focused learning.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:51.620
It could be motor, it could be cognitive,

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:55.390
it could be musical, whatever,
and then transitioned

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.360
to a 20 minute non sleep
deep rest protocol.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.520
I just want to cue you the
fact that in last` episode

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.210
in the caption on
YouTube, we provided links

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:06.026
to two different yoga nidra,
non sleep deep rest protocols

00:52:06.026 --> 00:52:08.880
as well as hypnosis protocols
that are clinically backed

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.660
from my colleague David Spiegel

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.520
at Stanford Psychiatry Department.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.540
All those resources are free.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:20.540
There are also a lot of other
hypnosis scripts out there.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.150
I like the ones from Michael Sealey

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:26.300
S-E-A-L, I think it's
E-Y, maybe it's just L-Y,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.090
you can find them easily on YouTube,

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.310
clinical hypnosis scripts
meaning not stage hypnosis.

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:33.600
They're not designed to
get you to do anything.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.600
In fact they're just designed to

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.320
help rewire your brain circuitry.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.620
Now, how does hypnosis work that way?

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.770
This has a lot to do with sleep because

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.980
it engages neuro-plasticity
by bringing together

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.390
two things that normally are
separate from one another,

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.240
one is the alert focused wakeful state

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.750
where you activate the learning.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.330
And then there's the deep
rest where the actual

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:57.160
reconfiguration of the neurons
and synopsis takes place.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.340
Hypnosis brings both the focus
and the deep rest component

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.020
into the same compartment of time.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.970
It's a very unique state in that way.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:10.050
So hypnosis kind of
maximizes the learning about

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.070
and the non sleep deep
breasts bow and combines them.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.740
But of course that requires
some guidance from a script

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.050
or from a hypnotist
clinically, a trained hypnotist

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:23.040
and it becomes hard to
acquire detailed information.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:28.010
It's more about shifts in state,
like fear to states of calm

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:33.010
or smoking to quitting smoking,
anxiety around a trauma

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.660
to release of anxiety around a trauma

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.470
rather than specific information
learned in hypnosis, okay?

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.050
So hypnosis seems more about
modulating the circuits

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:46.480
that underlie state as opposed
to specific information.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.720
Although I would not be surprised

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.340
if there weren't certain forms of hypnosis

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.550
that could increase retention and learning

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.210
of specific information, but I'm not aware

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.570
of any of those protocols out there yet.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.920
Which brings us to the
next thing about learning

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:04.399
and plasticity which is
nootropics, AKA smart drugs.

00:54:04.399 --> 00:54:05.770
[sighs]

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.170
This is a big topic that sigh was

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:12.070
a sigh of concern about
how to address nootropics

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:16.000
in a thorough enough, but
thoughtful enough way.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.150
Look, I have a lot of
thoughts about nootropics.

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:22.137
First of all, it means
smart drugs, I believe.

00:54:22.137 --> 00:54:24.700
And I don't like that phrase because

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.430
let's just take a step back
and think about exercise.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.180
You just say, I want to
be more physically fit.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.240
What does that mean?

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.750
Does it mean I would ask for
more specificity, I'd say,

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.470
Do you want to be stronger?

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:39.340
Okay, maybe you need to lift
heavier objects progressively.

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.300
Do you want more endurance

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.230
very different protocol
to access endurance.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.380
Do you want flexibility?

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.980
Do you want explosiveness or suppleness?

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.670
Huge range of things that
we call physical fitness.

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:51.700
Maybe you want all of those.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.780
If we were talking about emotional fitness

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:58.350
we would say, well,
inability to feel empathy

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.500
but probably also to
disengage from empathy

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.540
because you don't want to be tethered

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.010
to other people's emotions all the time.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:04.990
That's not healthy either.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.100
You would think about being able

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.780
to access a range of
emotions, but for some people

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.610
their range into the sadness
regime is really quite vast

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.360
but their range into the happiness regime

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.330
might be kind of limited.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:19.300
For other people who are in a manic state,

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.230
it might be, they can
access all that happy stuff

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:22.980
but not the sadder stuff.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.938
So I'm speaking by way of analogy here.

00:55:26.938 --> 00:55:30.990
But if we say we're
talking about cognitive

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.950
and cognitive abilities we have to ask,

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.010
okay, creativity, memory.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.200
We tend to associate
intelligence with memory.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.900
And I think this goes
back to like spelling bees

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.531
or something, the ability to
retain a lot of information

00:55:46.531 --> 00:55:48.500
and just regurgitate information

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.830
which will get you some distance

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.660
in some disciplines of life.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.500
But it won't allow you creative thinking,

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.670
it's necessary for creative thinking.

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:57.830
You need a knowledge base, right?

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.490
You can't just look up everything
on Google, despite what

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.830
you know, certain educators
or so-called educators say,

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:07.260
you need a database so that
you can have the raw materials

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.440
with which to be creative.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.660
So necessary to have memory

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.040
but not sufficient to be creative, right?

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.310
The creative could have a
poor memory for certain things

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:17.770
but certainly not for everything.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.330
They can't have anterograde
and retrograde amnesia.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.130
They'd be like the
goldfish that every time

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:24.430
around the tank, it, you know

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.456
I can't remember where it's at.

00:56:26.456 --> 00:56:27.790
I actually don't know that
they've ever done that experiment

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.530
by the way, but you know,
so no disrespect to goldfish

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:33.410
but you know, so you get the idea.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.140
You've got creativity, you have memory,

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.810
you have the ability
to task switch, right?

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.420
You have the ability to

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:43.090
strategy development, strategy implement.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.880
So the problem I have with
the concept of a nootropic

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.200
or a smart drug is it's not
specific as to what cognitive

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.700
algorithm you're trying to engage.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.590
We need more specificity.

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:57.150
That said, there are elements to learning

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:58.930
that we've discussed here before

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.070
that are very concrete things like

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:04.050
the ability to focus and put the blinders

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:06.010
on to everything else that's happening in

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.700
around you and in your head mainly, right?

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.440
Distractions about things
you should be doing,

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.310
could be doing or might be doing

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:14.200
and focus on what you need to do.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.540
And then that's required for
triggering the acetylcholine

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:21.440
neuromodulator that will then allow you to

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.210
highlight the particular
synopsis that will then

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:24.890
later change in sleep.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:27.590
So no nootropic allows
you to bypass the need

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.900
for sleep in deep rest.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.320
That's important to understand.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:36.320
So I daydream about a day
when people will be able

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.250
to access compounds that are safe,

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.500
that will allow them to
learn better meaning,

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.270
to access information, focus better,

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:50.400
as well as to sleep better
and activate the plasticity

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.970
from the learning about.

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.580
Right now most nootropics

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.440
tend to bundle a bunch of things together.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:59.620
Most of them include some
form of stimulant, caffeine.

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.780
Episode two, I'll tell you more probably

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.370
than you ever wanted
to know about caffeine,

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:04.600
adenosine and how that works.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.500
So refer there for how caffeine works.

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.790
But stimulants will allow
you to increase focus

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:12.550
up to a particular point.

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.360
If you have too little
alertness in your system,

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.310
you can't focus, too much however,

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:19.460
you start to cliff and focus drifts, okay?

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:23.130
So you can't just ingest more
stimulant to be more focused.

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:24.570
It doesn't work that way.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:28.030
Most nootropics also
include things that increase

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:30.420
or a desire to increase acetylcholine.

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:34.100
Things like alpha GPC and
other things of that sort.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.850
And indeed, there's some evidence

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.300
that they can increase acetylcholine.

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.300
I refer you again to
examine.com the website to

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.350
evaluate any supplements or
compounds for their safety

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:47.030
and their effects in humans
and animals, free website

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:49.950
as well as with links to studies.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:51.770
So we need the focus component.

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:52.990
We need the alertness component.

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:54.840
The alertness component
comes from epinephrin,

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.280
traditionally from caffeine stimulation.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.140
The acetylcholine stimulation
traditionally comes

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:03.860
from Coleen donors or alpha
GPC, things of that sort.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.030
And then you would want to
have some sort of off switch,

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.360
because anything that's going to really

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.390
stimulate your alertness,
that then provides a crash.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:14.030
That crash is not a crash

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:16.500
into the deep kind of restful slumber

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.540
that you would want for learning,

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.573
it's a crash into the kind of,

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.870
let's just call it lopsided
sleep, meaning it's deep sleep

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:29.360
but it lacks certain
spindles and other elements

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.230
of the physiology sleep spindles,

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:33.730
that really engage the learning process

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:35.930
and the reconfiguration of synopsis.

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:40.130
So right now, my stance
on nootropics is that

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:45.130
maybe, maybe for occasional
use, provided it's safe for you,

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.500
I'm not recommending it, but in general

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.610
it tends to use more of a shotgun approach

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:53.708
than is probably going to be useful

00:59:53.708 --> 00:59:56.940
for learning and memory in the long run.

00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:59.670
A lot of people ask about
Modafinil or armodafinil

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.570
which was designed for
treatment of narcolepsy.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:03.490
So right there, it tells
you it's a stimulant.

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.900
And yes, there is evidence, it
will improve learning memory.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.390
Modafinil is very expensive.

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.880
Last time I checked our Modafinil

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.620
I think is the recent
released a generic version

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.990
of this that's far less expensive.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.090
Most of these things look
a lot like amphetamine

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:21.410
and many of them have the
potential for addiction

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.133
or can be habit forming.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.410
But more importantly,
a lot of those things

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:28.830
also can create metabolic
effects by disruption

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.510
to insulin receptors and so forth.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:32.450
So you want to approach those with a

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.750
strong sense of caution.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.980
Now, there are the milder
things that act as nootropics

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.453
that I mentioned, some
of them like alpha GPC.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:42.323
Some people like Gingko.

01:00:42.323 --> 01:00:45.760
Gingko gives me vicious
headaches, so I don't take it.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.720
So people really differ.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.100
Last podcast, I recommend
magnesium threonate

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.010
if you were exploring supplements

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:55.640
I'm not recommending anything directly.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.620
I'm just saying if you're
exploring supplements,

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.636
magnesium threonate seems
among the magnesiums

01:01:00.636 --> 01:01:05.250
to be one of the more
bioavailable and useful for sleep.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:07.550
I recommended it actually
to a good friend of mine,

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:11.350
it gave him at very low dose,
he had stomach issues with it.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:12.870
He just had to simply stop taking it.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:14.027
So there's variability there.

01:01:14.027 --> 01:01:16.380
You just, it gave him
some stomach cramping

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.840
and just didn't feel good on it.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.580
Stopped it, he felt better.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.620
Other people take magnesium
threonate and feel great.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.040
I was asked, do magnesium need to be taken

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.210
with or without food or before sleep?

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:29.110
If you're going to go that route

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:31.380
it should be taken 30 to
60 minutes before sleep,

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.070
'cause it's designed to make you sleepy.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:36.460
And I'm not aware that it
has to be taken with food,

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.520
but again all of this has
to be run by your doctor

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.240
and this is your healthcare to govern not,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.820
these are not strict
recommendations so look into it.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.820
But magnesium threonate,
most people I recommend it to

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:52.190
have benefit from it tremendously.

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:55.300
Some people can't tolerate
it, so you have to find out.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.320
There were a number of questions
about other supplements

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.700
designed to access deep sleep,

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.830
in part to access neuroplasticity,

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:04.780
but now I'm just sort of
transitioning from neuroplasticity

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.160
to these compounds that
can regulate sleep.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.280
One of them that I discussed
at the end of the last podcast,

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.270
I got a lot of questions about is apigenin

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:15.600
A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.800
If you will look in the literature

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.310
the way it works is it
increases some of the enzymes

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.130
associated with GABA metabolism.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:24.680
It actually, GABA's an
inhibitory neurotransmitter.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.330
It's the neurotransmitter
that is increased

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:31.010
after a couple alcohol
drinks containing alcohol.

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:32.733
And that shut down the forebrain.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.540
Apigenin is a derivative of the camomile.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.350
I think that the proper pronunciation

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:41.690
of this is metric caria kemo mila.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:42.523
Although I always feel like

01:02:42.523 --> 01:02:44.963
I should be using a Spanish accent.

01:02:44.963 --> 01:02:47.110
Whenever I say something like that

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.360
other related things that
impact the GABA system

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.900
and increase GABA or
things like passion flower

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.147
which is [speaks in foreign language].

01:02:54.728 --> 01:02:57.340
[chuckles] I don't know why
the Italian, is that Italian.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.770
Anyway, my Italian
colleagues, please forgive me.

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:02.540
I have some very close Italian friends

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.740
and colleagues in Genoa.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.640
I butchered the Italian, sorry.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.640
In any event apigenin and
passion flower found in a lot of,

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.760
a lot of supplements designed
to increase sleepiness

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.640
and sleep because, and
they work presumably

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.870
because they increase GABA.

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:21.110
Actually they work on chloride channels

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.400
rather than give you a whole lecture

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.850
on membrane biophysics in neurons.

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:27.230
I'll just say that when
neurons are really active

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:31.780
it's because sodium ions,
salt rushes into the cells

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.720
and causes them to fire electrically.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.720
The cells tend to become
less active as more chloride

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.903
which is a negatively charged ion.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.880
This is probably taking
some of you back to the

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.260
either the wonderful times

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.330
or traumas of high school physics.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.140
The chloride is negatively charged so,

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.420
it tends to make cells
less electrically positive,

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.120
'cause carries a negative charge

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.510
and hyperpolarizes the neuron.

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:58.610
So apigenin works through
these increasing the activity

01:03:58.610 --> 01:03:59.720
of these chloride channels.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.110
Passionflower works by
increasing the activity

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:04.550
of these chloride channels
and GABA transmission.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.380
It tends to increase this
inhibitory neurotransmitter

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.530
that shuts off our thinking

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:11.633
our analysis of duration path and outcome.

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:14.270
So if you're going to explore these things

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:16.390
I suggest you at least know how they work.

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:19.330
You at least go to examined.com

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.250
that you talked to your doctor about them.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.780
Some people asked about serotonin

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.860
for getting to sleep and staying asleep.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.610
Now I understand the rationale here.

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:31.730
Just like I understand the
rationale of taking something

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:34.910
like Macuna Purina or
L-DOPA to increase dopamine

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:36.810
but sometimes what works on paper

01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:38.940
doesn't really work in the real world.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.130
I personally have tried
taking a supplement

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:45.260
which was Al tryptophan, which
is the precursor to serotonin

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.090
or five HTP, which is
designed to increase,

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:49.650
it is serotonin basically.

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:52.400
You're just a one biochemical step away

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.140
from actually taking actual serotonin.

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.860
And I'll be honest the sleep that I had

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.000
with increased serotonin

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.780
by way of tryptophan or
five HTP was dreadful.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.660
I fell asleep almost immediately.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.660
You say, well, that's great.

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.260
And 90 minutes later, I woke up

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.470
and I couldn't sleep almost for 48 hours.

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.540
Now that was me, I have
a pretty sensitive system

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.240
to certain things and not to other things.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.530
Some people love these things.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.390
So you really have to be thoughtful

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:18.510
and explore them with
that kind of awareness

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:22.080
of being thoughtful and
realizing that what works for you

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.110
might not work for everybody

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:25.810
and what works for everybody
might not work for you.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:26.643
Okay?

01:05:26.643 --> 01:05:27.760
I'd like to continue by talking about

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.410
the role of temperature
in sleep, accessing sleep,

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:34.983
staying asleep and wakefulness.

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.380
But first I want to tell a joke.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.460
Because I think this joke

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.650
really captures some of the
critical things to understand

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:45.363
about any self-experimentation
that you might do.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.270
So this is a story that was told to me

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:51.180
by a colleague of mine who's
now a professor of Caltech

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.273
not to be named.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.130
So there's a scientist
and they're in their lab.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.070
And they're trying to understand

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:01.130
how the nervous system works.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.804
So they go over to a tank
and they pick up a frog,

01:06:04.804 --> 01:06:08.200
and they take the frog and
they put it down on the table

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.440
And they clap.
[claps]

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.483
And the frog jumps.

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.350
So they think for awhile,
they pick up the frog, okay.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:20.180
They go over to the
cabinet and they take out

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:24.310
a little bit of a paralytic
drug and they inject it locally

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:29.310
into the back leg, set
it down and clap. [claps]

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:30.910
And the frog jumps,

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:33.460
but it kind of like jumps
to the side a little bit.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.430
They pick it up, they inject the paralytic

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:38.560
into the other back leg.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.110
They clap again, the frog jumps,

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:42.780
but it really doesn't jump well that time,

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.483
it kind of drags itself forward.

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:47.140
So they pick it up and
they inject the paralytic

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.350
into the remaining two legs.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:54.350
They set it down and they clap
and the frog doesn't jump.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.473
And they go,

01:06:55.473 --> 01:06:58.847
"Oh my goodness! The legs
are used for hearing."

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.330
Now they publish the paper.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:05.610
Paper comes out in a great
journal, news releases.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:08.470
It's a really big deal,
their career takes off.

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:11.750
20 years later, a really
smart graduate student

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:15.230
comes along and says, "Yeah
but that's loss of function.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:17.410
It doesn't really show gain of function."

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:18.853
So let's take a closer look.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:22.810
So they repeat the first
experiment and checks out,

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:26.540
everything happens the same
way, but then they take the frog

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:32.210
and they inject a drug into
all four legs that turns off

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.180
the paralytic, right?

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.600
It's an antagonist.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.270
They set the frog down, they
clap, and the frog jumps

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.220
and they go, "Oh my goodness! It's true.

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.220
The legs really are for hearing."

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.970
Now, first of all, I want
to make the point that

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.950
this is not to illustrate that science

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:52.900
is not a good practice, it is.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.510
We need to do loss of function

01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:56.750
and gain and function experiments.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:59.400
But just to show that
correlation and causation

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.260
is complicated.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.470
You need to do a variety
of control experiments,

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.840
and you really need to figure
out what works for you.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.440
And so while science can
provide answers about what works

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.420
under very controlled
conditions, it doesn't

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.140
and can never address all the situations

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.670
in which a given compound,

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:17.820
a given practice will or won't work.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.410
And it's not just individual variability

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:21.160
is that there are a number
of different factors.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.980
You all of course know
that light can activate

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.050
and shift your circadian
rhythm, but so can exercise,

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:27.290
so can food.

01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:28.980
The last point I want to
make is an important one,

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:32.050
which is that no frogs were hurt

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:34.020
in the telling of this joke.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.680
Okay. So let's continue.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.420
I want to talk about temperature.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.020
Temperature is super
interesting as it relates to

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.313
circadian rhythms and
wakefulness and sleep.

01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:48.170
First let's take a look
at what's happening to our

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:51.940
body temperature across
each 24-hour cycle.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.820
In general, our temperature
tends to be lowest

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.660
right around 4:00 AM and starts
creeping up around 6:00 AM,

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:04.660
8:00 AM and peaks sometime
between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.

01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:07.960
Now that varies from person
to person, but in general

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.850
if we were to continuously
monitor or occasionally monitor

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:12.970
temperature that's what we would see.

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:14.980
Now what's interesting is
that even in the absence

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:19.610
of any light cues or meal
cues, we would have a shift.

01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:22.130
We would have an oscillation
or a rhythm in our temperature.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.490
They would go from high to low.

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:26.710
This is why the idea that we're all 96.8

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:27.900
and that's our correct temperature.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.530
Forget that. That is no longer true.

01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:31.620
It never was true.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.260
It depends on what time of
day you measure temperature.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.360
However, there is a range
which is within normal range,

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.104
I think most of us associate
fever with somewhere around

01:09:40.104 --> 01:09:42.880
100, 101 103, that's concerning.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.000
And we will be very concerned

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.630
if temperature drop too low as well.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:50.170
The way that the temperature
rhythm that's indogenous,

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:52.740
that's within us and
rhythmic no matter what,

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:57.100
the way it gets anchored to
the pattern I described before,

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.560
or being lowest at 4:00 AM
and increasing again around,

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.550
through the day until about
four to 6:00 PM is by way

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:09.460
of entrainment or matching
to some external cue,

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.360
which is almost always going
to be light, but also exercise.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.150
Now you may have experienced
this temperature rhythm

01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:20.860
and how quickly it can become uninterested

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.520
or it can fall out of entrainment.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.940
Here's an experiment I
wouldn't want you to do

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.150
but you've probably
experienced this before,

01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:31.470
where you wake up, it's sunny outside,

01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:33.810
and maybe you have some email
or some things to take care of

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:35.440
or maybe you didn't sleep
that well the night before

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.710
and so you stay in doors.

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:39.380
You don't change anything
about your breakfast,

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.670
you don't change anything about
your within home temperature

01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:43.970
or anything like that.

01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:45.930
And somewhere right
around 10 or 11 o'clock

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:48.920
you start feeling kind of
chilled, like you're cold.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.290
Well, what happened was
the oscillators, the clocks

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.017
in your various tissues that
are governed by temperature

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:58.720
and circadian rhythm are
starting to split away

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.920
from your central clock mechanisms.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.340
So it's actually important

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.800
that your temperature match day length.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.633
Now there's another way

01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:08.490
in which temperature matches,
oh daytime, excuse me.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:09.910
There's also an important way

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.730
in which temperature matches
day length in general

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:15.620
as days get longer, it
tends to be hotter out.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.340
Not always, but in general,
that's the way it is.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.770
And as days get shorter, it
tends to be colder outside.

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:26.330
So temperature and day length
are also linked metabolically.

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:29.840
They're linked biologically
they're linked, excuse me,

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.370
and atmospherically they're linked

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.700
for the reason that we talked about before

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.767
about duration of day length

01:11:34.767 --> 01:11:37.470
and other climate features and so forth.

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.520
So one of the most powerful things

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.810
about setting your
circadian rhythm properly

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:44.240
is that your temperature
will start to fall

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.440
into a regular rhythm.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.460
And that temperature
has a very strong effect

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.480
on things like metabolism

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.890
and when you will feel
most willing and interested

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.080
in exercising, typically
the willingness to exercise

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.290
and engage in any kind of
activity mental or physical

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:03.640
is going to be when that rise
in temperature is steepest.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.260
When the slope of that line is greatest.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.080
That's why 30 minutes after waking

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.340
is one of those key windows,

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.127
as well as three hours after waking.

01:12:10.127 --> 01:12:12.380
And then when temperature actually peaks

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:17.380
which is generally, generally
about 11 hours after waking.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:21.760
So this is why we say that
temperature and circadian rhythm

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.350
are linked but they're actually
even more linked than that.

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:27.920
We've talked before about
how light enters the eye,

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.160
triggers activation of
these melanopsin cells,

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.430
which then triggers activation

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:32.960
of the super charismatic nucleus,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.690
the master circadian clock.

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.660
And then I always say the
master circadian clock

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.660
informs all the cells
and tissues of your body

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.800
and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.160
But what I've never answered
was how it actually puts them

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.690
into that rhythm.

01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:48.400
And it does it two ways.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.220
One is it secretes a peptide.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.990
And peptide is just a
little protein that floats

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:54.700
through the bloodstream
and signals to the cells.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.860
Okay, we're tuning your clock.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.810
Kind of like a little,
we know watch store,

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:00.340
the watch store owner
would tune the clocks.

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.730
But the other way is it
synchronizes the temperature

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:05.860
under which those cells exist.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.750
So temperature is actually the effector

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.690
of the circadian rhythm.

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:12.900
Now this is really important because

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.410
changes in temperature by way
of exercise, by way of eating,

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.800
but especially by way of exercise

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.250
can start to shift our circadian
rhythm pretty dramatically.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.960
But let's even go to in
a more extreme example.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.200
Nowadays, there's some
interest in cold showers

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.900
and ice baths, not everybody
is doing this I realize.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.240
People seem to either
love this or hate this.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.940
I don't mind the cold dunk thing.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.330
I get regular about this from
time to time and I'll do it.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:39.930
I haven't been doing it recently.

01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:41.810
It's always painful to do
the first couple of times

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.310
then you get kind of used to it.

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:46.000
However, I've taken people to
a cold, dunk or an ice bath.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.320
I have a family member who wouldn't get in

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.010
literally passed her toes.

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.000
She was like, this is
just too aversive for me.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.570
Some people really like the
cold, people very tremendously.

01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:57.890
Getting into an ice
bath is very interesting

01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:01.570
because you have a rebound
increase in thermogenesis.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.760
Now you should know from
the previous episode

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.060
that as that temperature increases,

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.020
it will shift your circadian rhythm

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.170
and which direction it
shifts your circadian rhythm

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.410
will depend on whether
or not you're doing it

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.810
during the daytime or late in the day.

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.950
If you do it after 8:00 PM,

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.760
it's going to make your day longer, right?

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.360
Because your body and your central clocks

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:24.750
are used to temperature
going up early in the day

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.830
and throughout the day and
peaking in the afternoon.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.150
If you then increase that further

01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:32.120
or you simply increase it
over its baseline at 8:00 PM

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.270
after temperature was already falling,

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.590
even if it's just by a half a
degree or a couple of degrees

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:37.830
or you do that with exercise

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:39.410
doesn't have to be with the ice bath,

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:42.960
you are extending, you are
shifting forward your phase,

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.320
delaying your clock.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.960
You're convincing your clock

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.360
and therefore the rest of your body

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.550
that the day is still going, right?

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:51.720
You you're giving it the
perception, the cellar

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.707
and physiological perception
that the day is getting longer.

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:57.610
And you will want to
naturally stay up later

01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.270
and wake up later.

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:00.260
Now you might say, "Wait

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.720
I do an ice bath late at
night, and I feel great.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.340
And I fall deeply asleep."

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.680
Well, cold can trigger
the release of melatonin.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.510
There's a rebound increase in melatonin.

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:11.790
So that could be the cause of that effect.

01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:13.350
You have to see what works for you,

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:17.520
but if you do the ice bath early
in the day and then get out

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.070
you will experience a more rapid rise

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:22.890
or cold shower early in
the day, a more rapid rise

01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:27.170
in your body temperature that
will phase advance your clock

01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:30.340
and make it easier to get
up early the following day.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.750
So for those of you that are
having trouble getting up

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.610
and this is going to
almost sound laughable

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:36.450
but a cold shower first
thing in the morning

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:40.300
will wake you up, but that's
waking you up in the short term

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.630
because of a different mechanism

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:43.010
which I'll talk about in a moment,

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.680
but it also is shifting your clock,

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.250
it's phase advancing your clock

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:49.970
in a way that makes you
more likely to get up

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:52.420
earlier the next day, okay?

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.670
So in other words,
increasing your temperature

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:59.100
by getting in an ice bath
or cold shower or exercising

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.040
which causes a compensatory
increase in body temperature.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.230
Think about the normal
pattern of body temperature.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:09.240
Low around 4:35 AM starts to
peak right around waking start,

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.660
excuse me, starts to
increase right around waking

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:13.880
then steep slope, steep slope to a peak

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.370
around four to 6:00 PM and then drops off.

01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:18.500
If you introduce an
increase in body temperature

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.023
by way of cold exposure early in the day,

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.190
let's say 6:00 AM or 5:00 AM

01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:27.030
if you're masochistic enough
to get into a cold shower

01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:28.760
at that time more power to you,

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.780
it's going to make, you want
to wake up about half hour

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.200
to an hour earlier the next
day than you normally would.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.060
Whereas if you do it while
your temperature is falling,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.450
it will tend to delay and
make your body perceive

01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.330
as if the day is getting longer.

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:43.520
These are phase advances and phase delays.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.610
We're going to get into
this in far more detail

01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:48.750
when we talk about jet lag
and shift work in episode four

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.300
as well as other other things.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.240
But temperature is,

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.910
again is not just one tool to manipulate

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:58.840
wake up time and circadian
rhythm and metabolism.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.160
It is the effector.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.280
It is the way that the
central circadian clock

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.430
impacts all the cells
and tissues of your body.

01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:06.130
If you want to read further about this

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:08.170
and you're really curious
about the role of temperature

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.780
work by Joe Takahashi

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.510
who used to be at Northwestern University

01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:15.409
and is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,

01:17:15.409 --> 01:17:19.220
incredible scientist and
has really worked out

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.780
a lot of the mechanisms around temperature

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.670
in circadian rhythms.

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:23.950
You can just Google his name

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.413
and you'll see a whole
bunch of studies there.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.180
I want to talk about
cold and cold exposure

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.870
because there's a great
misconception about this

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.820
that actually you can
leverage once you understand

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.890
how to use cold to either
increase thermogenesis

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:42.070
and fat loss, metabolism,

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:45.100
or you can use it for
stress, mitigation and mood.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.420
And it really depends
on one simple feature

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:49.820
of how you approach the
ice bath or cold shower.

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:54.040
If you get into an ice bath or cold shower

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.350
and you are calming yourself
you're actively calming

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.480
the autonomic nervous system.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.970
Maybe through some deep breathing,

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:02.620
maybe through visualization,
maybe you sing a song.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.230
You know, people do this stuff.

01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:05.330
They use various tools.

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:07.090
Some people find paying attention

01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:09.620
to an external stimulus is more helpful.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.080
You know, thinking about something

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.410
not the experience of the cold,

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:14.810
other people find that
directly experiencing the cold

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:18.293
in its most intense form and
kind of "going into the cold"

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.690
is the best way to approach it.

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:21.780
It really varies for people.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.230
There's no right or wrong
way to go about this.

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:28.140
But the goal of using cold
exposure for stress inoculation

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.850
and to raise your stress threshold

01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:32.910
to be able to tolerate heightened levels

01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:36.650
of real life stress, not the
ice bath, but real life stress

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:39.100
like work stress and
relational stress, et cetera

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:43.900
is by suppressing the activation

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.410
of the so-called
sympathetic nervous system,

01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:48.383
meaning the alertness or stress system.

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.670
That involves buffering

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:53.750
or trying to resist the shiver response.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.040
The shiver response is
an autonomic response

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.110
designed to generate heat, presumably,

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:01.000
and actually that is what it does

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.160
in order to counter the cold.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.800
So when you use cold exposure

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.390
and you're kind of muscling through it,

01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:09.130
or you're learning to relax within it

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:11.470
as a form of stress inoculation,

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:14.600
that's great and works
quite well for that purpose.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.950
And there's a reason why
cold exposure is used

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:20.630
in a variety of forms of
military stress inoculation,

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.670
most famous of which of
course is the Navy seal buds,

01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:26.010
a strep test really,

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.810
which is screening procedure
for becoming a seal

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:29.860
involves a lot of exposure to cold water.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:35.350
However, if you're interested
in using cold exposure

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:37.730
for fat loss and thermogenesis,

01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:40.620
you want to do the exact opposite thing.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.950
There was a paper published
in nature two years ago

01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:47.430
which showed that cold induced shiver,

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:52.370
the actual physical shiver
activates the release of

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:55.500
a chemical in the body from
muscle called succinate

01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.184
S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E.

01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:02.950
Succinate travel in the
bloodstream and then goes

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:05.920
and activates a particular category of fat

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.060
not the typical kind pink or white fat

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:10.010
that we think of is
like blubber in humans.

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:11.410
That the stuff that people will seem to

01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:12.733
generally want less of,

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.790
except for those genetic freaks
that seem to have none of it

01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:18.120
depending what they consume.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.203
Congratulations.

01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:23.210
Brown fat is called Brown fat

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:25.548
because it's actually
dark under the microscope.

01:20:25.548 --> 01:20:29.080
It's rich with mitochondria
and it exists mostly

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.120
between the scapulae
and in the upper neck.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.840
And it generates thermogenesis
and heat in the body.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.003
It's rich with a certain category
of agile anergic receptor,

01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:44.853
in insanely epinephrin binds
to adrenergic receptors.

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:50.310
These Brown fat cells increase metabolism,

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:52.860
it's called Brown fat thermogenesis

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:56.210
and cause fat burning,
burning of other kinds of fat,

01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:57.910
the pink and white fat.

01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:58.830
So what does this all mean?

01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:01.390
This means if you want to use the ice bath

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.620
in order to increase
metabolism, shiver away.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.660
If you want to use the
ice bath or cold shower

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.410
in order to stress
inoculate, resist the shiver

01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:14.193
and learn to stay calm
or "muscle through it".

01:21:14.193 --> 01:21:15.920
I mean, I don't know that
anyone's ever really talked

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.740
about this publicly because
I think the data are so new.

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.350
And I think that people
assume that the ice bath

01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:24.200
or cold exposure is just one thing.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.230
Here I've talked about it three ways

01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:28.750
to shift your circadian rhythm
depending on whether or not

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.000
you're doing it early in the day

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.580
while your temperature is
still rising or at its peak

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.840
or after that peak, in order
to extend the perception

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:41.950
of your day as continuing
and make you want to go

01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:44.093
to sleep later and wake up later.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.250
Now, and then the third
way of course is to either

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:51.080
activate brown fat thermogenesis
and increase metabolism.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.050
I suppose the fourth way would be to

01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.760
increase stress tolerance
or stress threshold, okay?

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.140
But remember, temperature is the effector

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.520
of circadian rhythms.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.913
Light is the trigger.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.010
The super charismatic nucleus
is the master circadian clock

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:10.320
that mediates all these changes,

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.250
also influenced by non-photic influence

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:15.670
like exercise and feeding
and things of that sort.

01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:17.323
But temperature is the effector.

01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:21.750
Now you can also shift your
circadian rhythm with eating.

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.790
When you travel and you
land in a new location

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:27.750
and your schedule is inverted 12 hours.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:29.720
One way that we know you
can shift your rhythm

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.890
more quickly is to get onto
the local meal schedule.

01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:34.450
Now that probably has
to do with two effects.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.200
One or changes in temperature inducer,

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.630
eating induced increases
in body temperature.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:41.490
Now you should understand
why that would work

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:45.290
as well as eating has this
anticipatory secretion

01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:47.860
of beta, of hyper cretin orexin

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.540
that I talked about it earlier.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.820
So, if this is getting a
little too down in the weeds,

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.450
don't worry about it.

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:55.570
I will get more into this in episode four

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:56.820
of how to shift one's rhythm.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.300
But I would love for people
to understand that light

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.420
and temperature are the
real heavy duty leavers

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:03.957
when it comes to moving
your circadian rhythm

01:23:03.957 --> 01:23:06.330
and sleep times and activity schedules

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:08.690
and exercise and feeding can help,

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:10.460
but really temperature and light,

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.540
with light being the primary
one are the most important

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:16.440
when it comes to sleep and wakefulness.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:20.258
Many people asked questions
about food and neurotransmitters

01:23:20.258 --> 01:23:23.700
and how those relate to
sleep, wakefulness and mood,

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:28.700
which is essentially 25 hours
of content for me to cover.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.530
But I'm going to try and distill
out the most common questions.

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:34.780
We've talked a lot about
neuromodulators like dopamine,

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:37.080
acetylcholine and norepinephrine.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.640
You may notice in those
discussions that the precursors

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.570
to say serotonin is tryptophan.

01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:44.970
Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.

01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:46.770
It comes from the foods that we eat.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.060
tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.190
It comes from the foods that we eat.

01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:55.430
And then once we ingest them

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.130
those compounds are
circulated to a variety

01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:03.437
of different cells and tissues,
but it is true that our food

01:24:03.437 --> 01:24:06.400
and the particular foods we can influence,

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.440
things like neuromodulator
levels to some extent,

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.470
it's not the only way,
because there are also enzymes

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:14.490
and biochemical pathways
that are going to regulate

01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:17.340
how much tyrosine gets
converted into dopamine

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.980
and there are elements of
the dopaminergic neurons,

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:22.150
the dopamine neurons
themselves that are electrical

01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:24.100
that have influence on this as well.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.520
But there are a couple fair
assumptions that we can make.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.950
First of all, nuts and meats
in particular red meats,

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:36.660
tend to be rich in things
like tyrosine, right?

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:37.940
That tells you right there,

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.280
that because tyrosine is
the precursor of dopamine,

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.860
and dopamine is the
precursor of norepinephrine,

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:47.670
and epinephrine that those
foods tend to lend themselves

01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:50.880
toward the production of dopamine

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.110
and epinephrin and the sorts of things

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:55.730
that are associated with wakefulness.

01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:58.260
Now, of course, the
volume of food that we eat

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.630
also impacts our wakefulness.

01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:01.470
If we eat a lot of anything,

01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:05.540
whether or not it's ribeye
steaks, rice, or cardboard,

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:06.810
please don't eat cardboard,

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.470
your stomach if it's
very distended it will

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:12.660
draw a lot of blood into your
gut and you will divert blood

01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.770
from other tissues and
you'll become sleepy.

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.310
So it's not just about food content,

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:18.700
it's also about food volume, all right?

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:22.870
Fasting states generally are
associated with more alertness,

01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:27.870
epinephrin so forth and fed
states are generally associated

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:31.670
with more quiescence and
relaxation, serotonin,

01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:34.840
and the kind of things that
lend themselves more towards

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.220
sleep and less toward alertness.

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.850
Foods that are rich in
tryptophan tend to be things

01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:43.090
like white meat, turkey,
also complex carbohydrates.

01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:46.750
So if you like you can start experimenting

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.670
depending on what foods you eat.

01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:53.110
You can start experimenting
with carbohydrate rich meals

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:57.900
for accessing sleep and
more depth of sleep.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.700
This is actually
something I personally do.

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.010
I tend to eat pretty low
carbs during the day.

01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:03.950
I actually fast for until about noon.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.560
Not because I have to work to do that,

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.220
but because I'd rather just drink caffeine

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.860
and water during that time.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.300
And then sometime around noon

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.360
I can't take it anymore and I'm hungry.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.750
And I eat and I try and eat low carb-ish

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:16.540
unless I've worked out extremely hard

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:19.720
in the previous two
hours, which I rarely do,

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.480
although I do it sometimes.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.440
And that meal is then
designed to prolong my period

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.160
of wakefulness into the late afternoon.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.210
And then sometime around dinner time

01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:31.860
which for me is around 6:37 PM, 8:00 PM.

01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:34.100
Sometimes as late as 9:00
PM, I tend to eat things

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.233
like white meat, fish, pastas,
rice, that kind of thing.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.040
My favorite food of all

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.320
for accessing tryptophan
is actually a starch.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.611
It's actually a vegetable.

01:26:44.611 --> 01:26:47.690
And it's the croissant, which
is my favorite vegetable.

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.480
I don't eat those all
the time, but I love them

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.160
and they seem to increase
dopamine as well.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.410
I've never actually done
the mass spectrometry

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.820
on a croissant, but they
definitely increase tryptophan

01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.723
and relaxation for me.

01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:05.570
In all seriousness, low
carbohydrate/fasted/ketogenic diets

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.550
tend to lend themselves toward wakefulness

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:11.930
by way of increasing epinephrin,
norepinephrine, adrenaline

01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:13.630
dopamine, and things of that sort.

01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:16.610
Carbohydrate rich meals.

01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:19.050
And I suppose we talked about
meals as opposed to diet

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:23.300
tend to lend themselves more
toward tryptophan, serotonin

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.313
and more lethargic states.

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.700
There is very limited
evidence that I am aware of

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.360
that carbohydrates should
be eaten at one time a day

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.890
as it relates to metabolism, et cetera.

01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:39.170
I'm sure that will open up
a certain amount of debate.

01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:40.240
If you work out very hard

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.000
and you deplete glycogen,
then this all changes.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.330
So some people are working out very hard

01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:46.720
in depleting glycogen
and other people are not.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.850
That gets way outside the context

01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:51.960
of this particular podcast,
but yes indeed different foods

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.017
can bias different neuromodulators

01:27:54.017 --> 01:27:57.090
and thereby can modulate awaking

01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:59.823
or our feelings of
lethargy and sleepiness.

01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:06.240
There are a couple effects
of food that are independent

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.860
or I should say a couple
of facts of eating,

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.240
'cause the food won't
do it when it's sitting

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.580
across the table, but of
eating that are powerful

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.730
for modulating circadian,
rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.

01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:18.040
And that's because every time we eat

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.630
we get eating induced thermogenesis

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:21.980
regardless of what we eat.

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.260
Now that eating induced thermogenesis

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.580
and increase in metabolism,

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.430
which is an increase
in temperature really,

01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:33.430
is probably greatest for amino
acid rich foods like meats,

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.280
but also other types of foods.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.560
It's a minimal increase
in body temperature

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.840
compared to say cold exposure or exercise.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.990
Now, whether or not it's
a quarter of a degree

01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:46.100
or half a degree or a degree,

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.030
it really depends on the individual.

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:50.410
And of course there are
blood sugar effects.

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:53.260
There are things like whether or not

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.490
you are type one or type two diabetic,

01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:56.970
whether or not you're insulin resistant,

01:28:56.970 --> 01:28:59.860
whether or not like there's a kid who

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.170
interns on the podcast
here, who's 17 years old

01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:05.770
and I'm convinced that he can eat anything

01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:08.330
and he just seems to like burn it up

01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:09.550
and he's growing it every time.

01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:11.380
Actually the other day, he
walked into the other room

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.120
and two days later, he
walked out of the same room.

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.360
He came out in between of course,

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.390
but and I was like, you're grow?

01:29:18.248 --> 01:29:20.050
And he was like, you know,
but he's at that stage where

01:29:20.050 --> 01:29:21.890
he's just growing.

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:23.750
Food is going to affect a
teenager very differently

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:26.060
than it's going to affect
a full-grown person.

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:31.060
So, in general, starchy
carbohydrates, white meat,

01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:33.940
such as turkey, some fish
increased tryptophan,

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.000
therefore serotonin, therefore

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.373
more lethargic states more calm.

01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:42.690
Meat, nuts and there are
probably some plant-based foods

01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:44.610
that I'm not aware of and I apologize,

01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:48.100
I should read up on this that
also are high in tyrosine

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.560
that can increase things like dopamine,

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.870
norepinephrine, epinephrin alertness.

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:56.440
So you can vary these however you like.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.930
Most people I think are eating
a variety of these things

01:29:58.930 --> 01:30:00.380
in a given meals.

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.620
And there are other
parameters of nutrition

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.820
that are important too.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.970
Volume of food for the reasons
that I mentioned before,

01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:09.280
the volume of food in the
gut, less food in the gut

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.910
whether or not it's empty
or a small amount of food

01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:14.200
which tend to correlate with wakefulness.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:18.160
Large volumes of food of any
kind will tend to correlate

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.050
and drive the calming response

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:23.130
and that's by way of this
nerve pathway called the vegas.

01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:25.860
We actually have sensory fibers
in the gut that communicate

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.810
to a little protrusion of neurons

01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:30.570
that sit right next to the
juggler called the nodose ganglia

01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:34.210
N-O-D-O-S-E unlike Costello,

01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:36.691
it's no dose right now he's all dose.

01:30:36.691 --> 01:30:39.890
Nodose actually means
having many protrusions

01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:42.410
and it's like kind of a
lumpy collection of neurons.

01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:43.730
A ganglia is just a collection of neurons.

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:47.210
And then it goes into the
brain stem and then forward

01:30:47.210 --> 01:30:49.310
in the brain to the areas of
the brain they're involved

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:52.633
in production of various neuromodulators.

01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:57.210
So what we eat and the volume of food

01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:59.260
are both signaling to the brain.

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.200
It's not just one or the other.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.270
And then there's also this
eating induced thermogenesis.

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.200
And now, you know, from the
discussion about temperature

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.070
that if you're eating early in the day

01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.070
you're tending to shift
your rhythm earlier.

01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:13.460
So that you'll want to wake
up earlier the next day

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.340
if you're eating very late in the day,

01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.620
even if you can fall asleep after that,

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:19.530
there's a tendency for
you to want to sleep later

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:20.730
the next day.

01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:23.700
Now this of course is all
going to be constrained by

01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.740
when your kids need to eat,

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:25.880
and when your spouse needs to eat,

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:26.790
and when your friends need to eat,

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:28.890
or if you live alone or what
other things you're doing,

01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:31.380
if you're like me and you
kind of don't eat until noon

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.650
then eat sometime around noon.

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:33.930
And then I'm terrible about meals.

01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:35.240
I just start eating the ingredients

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.200
while I'm supposed to be cooking

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.640
and then eventually they're all gone

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.163
and I guess that's a meal.

01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:41.410
It varies.

01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:43.190
Some people are neurotically attached

01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:45.310
to a particular meal schedule.

01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:46.143
Some people are not.

01:31:46.143 --> 01:31:49.260
I take my light exposure
schedule far more seriously

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.900
than I take my meal schedule.

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.120
Although in general, try
and eat healthy foods

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.020
for the most part croissants included.

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.937
I was asked several times whether or not

01:31:58.937 --> 01:32:00.740
men and women or males and females

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.140
differ in terms of these
neurotransmitter phenotypes

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.873
and the rhythms of sleep and temperature,

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.400
or we could probably devote a whole month

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.110
and we probably will
devote an entire month

01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:13.160
to what are called sex differences

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.990
because those tend to be related to things

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:18.060
we absolutely know like
XX, or XY chromosomes

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:21.080
or XYY in some cases
are double X chromosomes

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.980
as opposed to gender, sex
and karyotype as we call it

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.083
genetic makeup is crystal clear.

01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:32.110
There are things that
correlate with one or the other

01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:33.420
but it's complicated

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.090
and it's not something
that's been explored in

01:32:36.090 --> 01:32:38.220
what I think is enough detail.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:42.240
Actually recently, I guess
it was about five years ago,

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.925
the national institutes of
health made it a mandate

01:32:44.925 --> 01:32:48.820
that all studies use sex
as a biological variable,

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.410
and actually explore both sexes of mice,

01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:53.530
both sexes of humans when
doing any kind of study

01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:56.370
because there was a bias
towards only using male animals

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.720
or male subjects prior to that time.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.260
So a lot of data now coming out

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.650
revealing important sex differences

01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:05.190
that I think are going
to have powerful impact

01:33:05.190 --> 01:33:06.810
on health practices, et cetera.

01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:07.740
Response to drugs,

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.800
response to just different
sleep schedules, et cetera.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:13.250
Perhaps the most salient and obvious one

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:18.250
is that during pregnancy
females experience a whole range

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:21.060
of endocrine and neuro effects

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.920
and we definitely will
devote a month to pregnancy

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.653
and childbirth and child rearing.

01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:29.090
And for that, I'd really like
to bring in some experts.

01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:31.180
I've got terrific colleagues
at Stanford and elsewhere

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.140
that work on these things,

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.580
so that we can go into
those in more depth.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.700
So I'm not blowing off those questions.

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.780
I'm just, I'm kind of
pushing them down the road

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:42.370
a little bit where I can give
you a more thorough answer.

01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:45.260
So as we finish up, I
just want to offer you

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:48.080
the opportunity to do an experiment.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.830
We've talked about a lot of variables

01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:51.970
that can impact sleep and wakefulness.

01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:53.830
And in keeping with the
theme of the podcast

01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:57.330
we are going to continue to
talk about sleep and wakefulness

01:33:57.330 --> 01:34:00.130
and tools for those, and the
science behind those tools

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:01.610
as we go forward.

01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:05.170
But there are really just
four simple parameters

01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:07.460
that you have control over,

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:11.730
that you can immediately start to record

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:14.080
and take note of just
to see how you're doing

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.350
with these things.

01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:18.570
With no judgment or perhaps no change

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:20.150
to what you're actually doing.

01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:24.440
It might be interesting, just
a suggestion to write down

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.010
for each day when you went
outside to get sunlight

01:34:29.010 --> 01:34:31.030
and when you did that, relative to waking.

01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.863
So you would write down,

01:34:31.863 --> 01:34:33.840
like the way I do this
in my calendar is I'll

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.190
write down that I don't
get exact about it.

01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:40.570
I might say, I woke up at 6:15 and then I,

01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:45.296
as I'll put a W 6:15,
and then SL for sunlight

01:34:45.296 --> 01:34:46.770
and you'll sometimes
get outside right away.

01:34:46.770 --> 01:34:47.957
Other times I'm less good at that.

01:34:47.957 --> 01:34:51.050
And I'll go out around, let's say seven

01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:55.030
and for how long, I don't maybe
like 10, 15 minutes or so.

01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:56.720
And then I'll put a little check

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.910
at the times that I
eat my so-called meals.

01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:01.700
Although, as I mentioned,
sometimes my meals are

01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.690
a bunch of small checks
that just kind of extend

01:35:03.690 --> 01:35:05.230
through the late hours of the day.

01:35:05.230 --> 01:35:09.870
Yours might be more
confined to certain times.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:14.190
And then you might just take
note of when you exercised,

01:35:14.190 --> 01:35:16.340
just put down an E for when you exercise.

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:19.105
Weight training or aerobic exercise.

01:35:19.105 --> 01:35:23.110
And you might note when you
might've felt chilled or cold

01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:25.810
if you do, or you might've
felt particularly hot,

01:35:25.810 --> 01:35:26.960
or if you woke up in the middle of night,

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.010
when you felt particularly hot.

01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:29.720
And then the last thing
you might want to do

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.030
is just write down

01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:33.720
if and when you did a non
sleep deep rest protocol,

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.740
an STR protocol, that could be meditation,

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:38.570
that could be yoga nidra,
that could be hypnosis.

01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:42.758
Anything that you're using to deliberately

01:35:42.758 --> 01:35:45.980
teach your nervous system,
how to go from more alertness

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.080
to more calmness in the waking state,

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.410
even if it's waking up in
the middle of the night

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:52.140
and doing an SDR protocol
or in the afternoon,

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.650
or first thing in the
morning to recover some sleep

01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:57.450
and ability to perform
DPOs that you might've lost

01:35:57.450 --> 01:35:59.550
from a minimal or poor night's sleep.

01:35:59.550 --> 01:36:01.660
So you're going to rite
down when you woke up,

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.270
when you viewed sunlight,
that might be in the morning

01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:06.100
and the evening, or just
the morning, hopefully

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.960
it's the morning and the
evening, when you exercised,

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.630
when you eat your meals and using a simple

01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:16.300
record keeping scheme like W
for waking, SL for sunlight

01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:18.140
maybe you come up with a
system where it's a check

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.955
or an X or something for exercise.

01:36:19.955 --> 01:36:22.930
This is not designed to make
you neurotically attached

01:36:22.930 --> 01:36:27.930
to tracking all your behaviors
and everything you do.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.070
I for instance, don't track what I eat.

01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:32.470
In particular, I kind of
know what works for me

01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:35.690
and I'd just try and
stay within that range.

01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.120
But by doing this you can start to reveal

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.870
some really interesting patterns.

01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:43.270
Patterns that no answer that
I could provide you about

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:48.170
any existing tool or
protocol could counter.

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:51.510
It's really about taking
the patterns of behaviors,

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:53.670
of waking, and light viewing, and eating,

01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:58.160
and exercise and superimposing that on

01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:58.993
what you're learning

01:36:58.993 --> 01:37:01.080
in this podcast and elsewhere of course

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.910
and what you already know
and trying to see where

01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:07.050
certain problem or problems or
pain points might be arising.

01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:08.487
Maybe you're eating really late in the day

01:37:08.487 --> 01:37:09.784
and you're waking up

01:37:09.784 --> 01:37:10.617
in the middle of the night, really warm.

01:37:10.617 --> 01:37:13.240
Well, now you would say,
"Well, that could be due to

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.440
kind of an increase in temperature
that is extending my day

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.250
or maybe you start to find
that using cold exposure

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.980
early in the day is great for you,

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.020
but using it late, if
it's too late in the day,

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:25.960
that's not great.

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.120
Or if you're into the sauna or it's even

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.900
like some people, including
myself, if I take a hot shower

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.450
or sit in a hot tub or
a sauna late at night,

01:37:34.450 --> 01:37:37.720
well then I get a compensatory
decrease in body temperature

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.320
and I sleep great provided
I hydrate well enough,

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.370
'cause that can be kind of
a dehydrating thing to sit

01:37:42.370 --> 01:37:44.320
in hot, hot conditions.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.690
But if I do the sauna early in the day,

01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:49.780
unless I exercise immediately afterward

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:52.410
then I tend to get the temperature
drop, which makes sense

01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:55.340
because when you get in the
sauna, you're get vasodilation.

01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:56.800
You throw off a lot of heat and then you

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.720
generally get a compensatory
drop in temperature.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.550
If you do that early in
the day, that's right

01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:02.320
about the time that temperature

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.990
is trying to entrain the
circadian clocks of your body.

01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:06.380
That's what happens to me.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.090
Other people, it might
be slightly different

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:12.470
and some people have more
resilient systems than others.

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:15.810
So I just encourage you to
start becoming scientists

01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:19.350
of your own physiology of
your own brain and body

01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:21.040
and seeing how the
various tools that you may

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.420
or may not be using are
effecting your patterns of sleep,

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.760
your patterns of
attention and wakefulness.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:30.410
It's vitally important
that if you do this,

01:38:30.410 --> 01:38:32.880
that you know that it's
not about trying to get

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.810
onto an extremely rigid schedule,

01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:38.360
it's really about trying
to identify variables

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.200
that are most powerful
for you, and that push you

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.620
in the direction that you want to go.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.750
And changing the variables
that are pushing your body

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:47.930
and your mind in the directions
that you don't want to go.

01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:50.620
Self experimentation is
something that should be done

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:54.050
slowly, carefully, you don't
want to be reckless about this.

01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:57.490
And this is where I would
say manipulating one

01:38:57.490 --> 01:38:59.900
or two variables at a time
is really going to be best

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.670
as opposed to changing of
a dozen things all at once

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:05.803
to really identify what it is
that's most powerful for you.

01:39:06.694 --> 01:39:09.548
As always, thank you so
much for your questions.

01:39:09.548 --> 01:39:12.020
We are going to continue
to answer questions.

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.077
I certainly didn't get to all of them

01:39:13.077 --> 01:39:15.470
but we tried to get to
most all of the ones

01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:16.903
that were frequently asked.

01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:20.650
Episode four of the podcast,
I'm going to get into,

01:39:20.650 --> 01:39:24.840
shift work, jet lag and
age dependent changes

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.460
in sleeping and wakefulness and cognition.

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.530
So for those of you with kids,

01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:32.090
for those of you that are kids

01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:36.470
for those of you with older
relatives or who might be older

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:39.410
meaning probably when
you start to get into

01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:42.250
late '60, '70 and '80 is
when there's some marked

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:44.740
biological shifts in
temperature regulation

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.340
and things that relate to sleep.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.270
And for those of you that travel,

01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:50.760
we're going to talk about jet lag.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.400
The shift work discussion
might seem only relevant

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:56.510
to those that work nights, but
actually that's not the case.

01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:58.640
Most people because of the
way they're interacting

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:03.080
with devices are actually
in a form of shift work now,

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.327
where the days are
certainly not nine to five,

01:40:05.327 --> 01:40:06.930
the so-called banker's hours,

01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:08.740
and then the lights are out at nine

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.590
and they're asleep until 5:00 AM.

01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:12.860
Some people have that
schedule, most people do not.

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:17.680
So episode four, we will go
deeply into shift work, jet lag

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.760
age dependent changes in
sleep alertness and cognition

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.890
and I will touch back on
a few of your questions

01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:23.723
but don't think that

01:40:23.723 --> 01:40:25.770
if your question wasn't answered
during these office hours

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:28.883
that we won't get to it, I
absolutely will at some point.

01:40:30.199 --> 01:40:32.590
In addition to that, several of you

01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:35.560
have graciously asked how you
can help support the podcast.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.307
And we very much appreciate that.

01:40:37.307 --> 01:40:41.860

And in general, recommending the podcast

01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:06.120
to people that you know and
that you think would benefit

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:08.330
from the information would be terrific.

01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:12.050
As always I will be continuing
to post on Instagram.

01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:15.350
You can expect another podcast
episode out next Monday

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:17.860
about the topics that we've
been discussing this month

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.070
and above all,
[upbeat music]

01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:21.020
thank you for your interest in science.
