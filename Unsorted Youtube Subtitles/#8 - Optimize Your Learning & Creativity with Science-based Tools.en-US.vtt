00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.720
where we discuss science,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.823
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.910
- My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.950
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.020
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.160
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.440
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.490
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.220
to bring you zero cost to
consumer information about science

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.300
and science related tools.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.490
And keeping with that theme,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.430
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.990
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.510
InsideTracker analyzes
data from your blood

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.200
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.650
and health and health needs.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.200
I've been getting my blood
tested for many years now.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.880
Because, it just turns out that many

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.240
of the things that are
important to our health

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.400
and wellbeing can only be detected

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.760
in a blood test or a DNA test.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.940
InsideTracker makes that really easy.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.770
They can come to your
house to take those samples

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.890
if you like, or you can go
to a nearby clinic as well.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.170
The major problem with most blood tests

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.500
and DNA tests is that it's
very hard to make sense

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.333
of the information you get.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.300
You get a lot of numbers
related to metabolic factors,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.210
endocrine factors, et cetera.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.270
InsideTracker makes it very easy,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.710
to decipher what those levels,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.600
in your blood and DNA mean,
and what to do about them.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770
They have a very easy to use
dashboard that if you go to it,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.400
it can inform about
lifestyle choices such as,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.910
adding or subtracting certain forms

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.210
of exercise or nutrition,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.250
other things related to supplementation.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.180
It's a really powerful
and easy to use program.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.360
If you wanna try InsideTracker,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.560
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.000
and put Huberman at checkout

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
to get 25% off any of their programs.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.430
That's insidetracker.com/huberman,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.963
and put Huberman at checkout.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.930
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.620
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.330
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.047
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012.

00:01:59.047 --> 00:02:01.980
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.560
I started using Athletic Greens

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.740
and I still use Athletic Greens,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.510
because I find it very complicated

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.550
and almost dizzying to
figure out which vitamins

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.660
and minerals I need to take

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.590
in order to just cover
my nutritional basis.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.890
Taking Athletic Greens
makes that very easy.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.260
It also tastes very good.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.490
I mix mine with water,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.940
a little bit of lemon
juice, and I really like it.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.920
So I drink it once or twice a day.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.080
The probiotics that are

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530
in Athletic Greens are
also important to me.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.380
Because there are a lot

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.110
of data now showing
that the gut microbiome,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.140
which is supported by probiotics,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.640
is important for things
like the gut brain access,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.470
mood, endocrine factors,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.670
metabolism, many, many
biological functions.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.000
And so by taking Athletic
Greens, I get the vitamins,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.020
the minerals and the
probiotics all in one.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.410
Easy to consume, great tasting drink.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.360
If you wanna try Athletic
Greens you can go

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.160
to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.410
And if you do that you'll
also get, a one year supply

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.330
of liquid vitamin D three K two.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.090
There are a lot of data now as well,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.030
showing that vitamin D three is important

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.520
for immune function, for
mood, endocrine factors,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.720
as well as other systems
in the brain and body.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.050
That's athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.040
And I should also mention

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.290
if you do that you won't just get

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.560
the vitamin D three K two year supply,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770
you'll also get five free travel packs

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.720
of Athletic Greens.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.610
Mixing up powders

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.540
when one is on the road,
either in the car or in a hotel

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.630
or on the plane, et
cetera, can be kinda messy.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.210
These little travel packs
make it really clean and easy.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.310
So once again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.680
you'll get a special offer,
of your Athletic Greens

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.950
but you'll also get the year supply

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.500
of vitamin D3 K2, and the
five free travel packs.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.900
The third sponsor of
today's podcast is Madefor.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.340
Madefor is a behavioral science company

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.860
that makes attaining positive changes

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.610
and growth mindset easy,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.100
through a simple set of
steps, and a monthly program.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.040
The company was founded
by former Navy SEAL

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.660
Patrick Dossett and Toms
founder, Blake Mycoskie.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.760
I'm the head of their
scientific advisory board.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.630
And the other members
of the advisory board,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.310
include people like the director
of the chronobiology unit

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.260
the National Institute of Mental Health,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.920
members of Harvard Medical School,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.720
and many other people who are
serious about taking science

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.530
and developing protocols,

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.060
that can be applied
towards positive habits,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.620
and growth mindset.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.290
If you wanna check out Madefor,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.420
you can go to getmadefor.com.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.390
And if you purchase any of their products

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.210
and put Huberman at checkout,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.060
you'll get 20% off their program.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.170
In addition to that, we
do a monthly Zoom call,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.970
where the members of Madefor get on it.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.750
And Patrick and myself,
sometimes Blake as well,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.550
discuss the Madefor program
and the personal goals

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.450
and things that people
are trying to achieve

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.300
with the program.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.360
So it's a dialogue back and
forth on Zoom call once a month.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.300
Once again, that's getmadefor.com,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.710
put in Huberman at checkout,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.010
and you'll be able to
get the 20% off as well

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.980
as access to the monthly
Zoom calls with us.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.540
Let's talk about neuroplasticity.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.350
More specifically, let's talk about how,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.870
we can optimize our brains.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.580
Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.300
of our nervous system that allows it

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.300
to change itself, even in ways
that we consciously decide.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.100
That's an incredible property.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.900
Our liver can't decide
to just change itself.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.730
Our spleen can't decide
to just change itself,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.030
through conscious thought,

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:22.280
or through feedback from another person.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.220
The cells in those tissues
can make changes sure,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.910
but it's our nervous system,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.400
that harbors this incredible ability

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.170
to direct its own changes,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.170
in ways that we believe, or
we're told will serve us better.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.640
Now, today's a really
special episode because,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.850
while we are going to talk about science

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.623
and as always we will
delve into mechanism.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.300
Today's episode is really geared

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.750
toward answering your
most common questions

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.470
about how to leverage neuroplasticity.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.920
The previous episodes were about focus,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.910
and how to achieve focus
for sake of plasticity.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.890
As well as the last episode which is,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.723
what are some

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:04.240
of the portals into plasticity
that relate to movement,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.600
how behavior can activate plasticity,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.100
as well as how to activate
plasticity for behavior itself.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.960
How to get better at
learning certain movements.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.190
Today's podcast is really directed

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.980
toward answering your
most common questions,

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.440
and the bigger theme,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.270
of how does one go about
optimizing their brain

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.550
or even think about, optimizing the brain?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.140
What is this thing that we're calling

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.890
optimizing the brain?

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.610
In doing so I'm also
gonna share some of my,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.650
typical routines and tools.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.593
I don't share these because I think

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.900
that they are the only ones
that are available out there.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.010
Certainly they're not.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.843
Nor do I share them

00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:39.360
because I think that
everyone should do them just

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.040
'cause I do them, certainly not.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.180
I share them because many of you,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.740
have asked for very concrete
examples of what I do and when,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.050
and so I'll share those with you

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.010
and you can decide whether
or not those protocols are

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.550
for you or not.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.810
Everybody's different, but
there are some common features,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.020
of how we are all put together,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.250
at the level of the
nervous system and body,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.740
that direct us

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.430
toward particular practices,
particular routines

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.010
that can be especially
powerful, for neuroplasticity.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.190
So I wanna open up the discussion today,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.690
by emphasizing something,
that's fundamentally important.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.350
Which is that plasticity, is not the goal.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.740
Plasticity is never the goal.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.380
Plasticity is simply a state,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.670
or a capacity, for our
nervous system to change.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.340
And so, nothing makes me more frustrated,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.620
perhaps then when I hear,
oh, you know, this pill,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.360
this potion, this practice,
it gives you plasticity.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.560
Plasticity is just change.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.780
The real question is what
are you trying to change?

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.730
And specifically what end goal
are you trying to achieve?

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.530
Specific end goals might
be extremely specific.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.650
Like, you want to learn how
to speak a particular language

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.880
or you want to learn a new motor skill

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.100
or you want to get very good at calculus,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.190
or you'd like to forget
the bad emotions related

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.540
to a particular human being or experience,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.760
or it can be more general.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.310
Like you'd like to be more creative.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.370
And we'll actually talk
about creativity today.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.500
Or you would like to achieve more focus

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.290
or you'd like to be less stressed.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.770
So it's very important, that
you understand that plasticity,

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.720
and achieving plasticity
is the first step,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.400
in what we call optimizing your brain.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.600
You don't want your brain
to be plastic all the time.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.940
In fact, one of the major questions,

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.360
one of the major unsolved
mysteries of neuroscience

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.320
is how each and every one
of us wakes up every day,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.600
and knows who we are.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.020
Why should that be?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.760
Well, the brain is plastic.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.090
It has a capacity to change
throughout the lifespan

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.460
but it's not so plastic, that every night

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.720
when we go to sleep, or in our waking

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.870
that the connections get
reconfigured so much so

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.823
that we forget who we are, or
how to walk, or how to eat.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.220
It's a good thing that we don't have,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.190
such robust plasticity
or ongoing plasticity,

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.270
that we have to restructure
ourselves each day.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.500
It's part of what gives
our life continuity.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.340
So remember, plasticity is
not and is never the goal.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.560
The goal is to figure out
how to access plasticity,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.870
and then to direct that
plasticity, toward particular goals

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.540
or changes that you would like to achieve.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.040
And I should just mention,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.910
there's no rule that in life you have

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.570
to leverage this incredible
thing called neuro-plasticity.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.160
No one said you had to do that.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.420
This podcast in this episode
is particularly for people,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.070
who are either happy or
unhappy with where they're at

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.060
with a particular aspect of their life.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.840
And they wanna shift it,
in some positive way.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.990
And many of you listening might say,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.103
well wouldn't everyone wanna do that?

00:09:42.103 --> 00:09:43.950
Well actually, there are a certain number

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.470
of people that are pretty
good where they're at

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.160
and they don't wanna
change and that's terrific.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.000
And I tip my hat to them and
I think that's wonderful.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.040
If ever they decide

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.320
that they wanna leverage
these plasticity mechanisms,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.123
they can, at any stage
throughout the lifespan.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.790
Let's start by talking
about the different systems

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.560
within the nervous system,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.870
that are available for plasticity.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.010
And in doing so, I'll
frame them in the context

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.580
of what I do on a daily basis,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.343
on a weekly basis, and on a yearly basis.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.700
First of all, there are
several forms of plasticity.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.230
They have names like
long-term potentiation,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.290
long-term depression,
which has nothing to do

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.800
with emotional depression, by the way.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.970
And things like
spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.190
Those names are used to
describe cellular phenomenon.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.360
The actual ways that the
synapses, the connections

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.110
between neurons change.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.070
I'll mention those things

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.782
and I'll give a little more [indistinct]

00:10:38.782 --> 00:10:41.060
to what they are as I mentioned them.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.530
But, that's probably not
the best way to think

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.610
about plasticity in terms
of optimizing your brain.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.810
The best way to think about
it is in terms of short term,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.350
medium term, and long-term plasticity.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.830
Short-term plasticity, is any kind

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.450
of shift that you want to achieve,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.510
in the moment or in the day,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.330
but that you don't necessarily
wanna hold on to forever.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.310
You might say, well, what
kinds of things are those?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.400
Well, for instance, short-term
plasticity might be,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.900
you wake up earlier than you
would like to catch a flight.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.470
You're not feeling particularly alert,

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.950
and you want to use a protocol,

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.690
or you decide to use a
protocol which could be coffee

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.390
or it could be a certain form of breathing

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.670
or it could be some other tool,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.290
to become more alert at a time of day

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.090
when normally you aren't that alert.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.630
But, your expectation is
that when you return home,

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.350
you will discard with that,

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.310
the need to do that at 5:30 AM

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.040
because you'll be asleep at 5:30 AM.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.320
So there's short-term plasticity,
behavioral plasticity.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.210
Then there's medium-term plasticity

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.230
which are changes, that
you might wanna make.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:47.060
I call this with respect,
and a little bit of humor,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.300
or at least my kinda humor.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.300
I call this the undergraduate,
pre-med phenomenon.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.870
For those of you that
have worked with pre-meds.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.010
And I have tremendous respect

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.300
for medical students and pre-meds,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.190
there is a kind of a stereotype

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.630
which I don't necessarily agree with,

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.460
but the stereotype is that they wanna know

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.100
what they need to know
for sake of the exam,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.120
but they don't really wanna know.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.330
They just want the A.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.730
And I don't think that's always true.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.060
I've worked with a number

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.460
of different pre-meds over the years

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.400
and there are many of
them that are absolutely,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.930
passionate about the knowledge itself.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.600
And they also wanted the A.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.630
But the pre-med phenomenon
as it's discussed

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.340
among professors and
TAs, is that, you know,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.320
you've got these students,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.740
they just wanna know
what they need to know

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.090
so they can get the A, right?

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.520
It's medium-term plasticity.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.930
They don't actually want it to be embedded

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.490
in their memory too long,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.280
or else they would actually
care about the information.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.430
So that's medium term information.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.170
And sometimes that's useful for instance

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.690
if you go on vacation to Costa Rica,

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.710
and you don't know your
way around Costa Rica.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.040
You wanna learn the different
town and the routes there.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.070
But you don't have any
intention of going back.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:50.950
It's just medium term.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.220
You wanna just program it in
for sake of your time there

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.830
and then you wanna discard it.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.663
Most of the time

00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:57.770
when we think about or talk
about optimizing the brain,

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.170
we're talking about long-term plasticity.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.890
We're talking about the kinds of changes

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.723
that people wanna make

00:13:02.723 --> 00:13:06.650
so that their brain
reflexively works differently.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.930
This is what a child does

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.770
when it goes from not knowing how to walk

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.780
to knowing how to walk.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.760
It doesn't have to think

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.090
about it after it learns how to walk.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.403
It becomes reflexive.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.540
Long-term plasticity, is
almost always the big goal.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.310
It's I wanna know how
to speak that language.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.090
I wanna be able to do that skill.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.760
I wanna be able to feel this way,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.960
without having to put much work into it.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.793
And there are tools

00:13:27.793 --> 00:13:29.640
and protocols that one
can do to achieve that.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.130
And we are going to talk about those.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.060
We've talked about a few of
them in previous episodes

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.433
but I will revisit those protocols today.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.460
I'm gonna frame all this

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.630
in the context of the daily
life, the weekly life,

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.700
and the yearly life.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.980
And that's because,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.203
neuroplasticity and optimizing your brain,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.500
rides on a deeper foundation,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.810
of this thing that governs plasticity.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.120
In fact, governs all our
life, called autonomic arousal

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.720
which is that we're asleep
for part of the 24 hour cycle

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.400
and we are awake almost always.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.740
If we push ourselves and
stay awake, we're okay.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.210
We can do that for a night or two,

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.440
but almost always we are
asleep for a portion of it

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.290
and we are awake for a portion of it.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.840
I've said it before but I'll say it again.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.080
The trigger for plasticity
in learning occurs

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.820
during high focus, high alertness states,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.630
not while you're asleep.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.650
And the focus and alertness are both key

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.683
because of the neurochemicals
associated with those states.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.470
But, the actual rewiring
and the reconfiguration

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.670
of the brain connections happens
during non sleep deep rest,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.760
which we'll talk more about as always.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.910
And, deep sleep.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.170
So you trigger the change and
in sleep you get the change.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.270
So, some of the things
that we'll talk about today

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.940
about optimizing the brain,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.970
are centered around not sleep,

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.640
but around the autonomic arousal system.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.320
We have this system of
neurons in our brain and body

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.900
that's just incredible, that
wake us up and make us alert.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.370
And when we're not accessing that system,

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.230
well, we cannot access plasticity.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.250
We can not optimize our brain.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.210
Likewise, if we cannot sleep
well, and we can't rest well,

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.820
we will not access plasticity
and rewire our brain

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.700
because that's when the
actual configuration

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.570
between the connections occurs.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.240
So to set this in context,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.990
I wake up each day, and
I'll be totally honest.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.150
I usually don't feel like
bouncing right out of bed.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.880
I usually don't feel completely rested.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.080
And that's not because I
don't get enough sleep.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.120
It's probably because I'm not terrific

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.350
about timing my sleep so well.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.890
Now this month isn't about sleep,

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.890
that was the previous month

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.023
but I really wanna emphasize a few points.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.040
I wake up, generally more tired,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.060
and groggy than I would like,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.380
because I tend to go to sleep too late.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.887
It's just some thing that I do.

00:15:49.887 --> 00:15:52.960
And I tend to get up early
either because I set an alarm,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.330
because I have things to do,

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.170
or because I naturally wake up early

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.790
because the light coming in and so forth.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.960
Well, what that tells me is

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.140
that I'm probably somebody
whose natural circadian rhythm.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.440
You may have heard of chronotypes.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.060
These are genetically programmed things.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.670
But chronotype, is shorter than 24 hours.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.120
It means that the cycle of waking

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.820
and alertness for me is
probably shorter than 24 hours.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.410
Which means that getting some light

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.240
in the late afternoon will help me shift,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.900
and make my cycle a little bit longer.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.020
It will phase delay me

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.050
if that doesn't make any
sense, see a previous episode.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.580
But what it really means
is getting some light

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.850
in the afternoon, will allow me

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.840
to stay up a little bit later.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.780
But what it means is that,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.780
I'm not really matching
my hard-wired needs

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.170
of going to bed probably at 8:30 or 9:00

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.030
and waking up at 4:00 AM.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.230
I tend to go to sleep around 10:30, 11:00,

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.840
lately around 11:30 or 12:00

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.707
and then I wake up at 6:00.

00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:48.790
And so of course, I'm gonna feel groggy.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.950
So neuroplasticity will allow
me, to optimize my wakefulness

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.110
but I have to do something
in order to access that.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.130
And some of you may
already be anticipating

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.430
what I'm about to say, which is,

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.720
oh, no he's gonna tell us
to get sunlight in our eyes

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.440
in the first 30 minutes of the day.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.700
I am gonna tell you to do that,

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.470
but I'm gonna also tell you two things

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.810
that I've have not discussed before,

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.240
which relate to the plasticity,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.927
between the melanopsin cells.

00:17:13.927 --> 00:17:15.880
These sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.210
in our eye and the circadian clock.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.950
I've never said this
before in this podcast,

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.760
but it turns out that the connections

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.900
between these melanopsin
cells and the circadian clock,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.650
are plastic throughout the lifespan.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.300
There's a massive configuration
of the connections there.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.080
And a cell type called the astrocytes

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.650
which are a glial cell,

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.130
are actively removing and
reinforcing connections

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.480
between the eye and that clock, every day.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.330
Now this is incredible
because other aspects

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
of your brain that for instance,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.960
represent you knowing who you are,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.010
when you wake up in the morning,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.450
or what your name is, assuming
that you're old enough

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.160
that you've already learned your name.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.690
When the first things kids learn

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.533
and something we rarely ever forget.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.900
Those connections, are changing all

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.510
the time every 24 hour cycle.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.270
So there's an opportunity
for short-term plasticity.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.040
So that's why I view sunlight
first thing in the day,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.370
it helps me wake up.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.620
The other thing that I do
is that there's a circuit,

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.560
that exists between the circadian clock

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.120
and our adrenals that I've talked

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.750
about before that triggers the release

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.640
of cortisol first thing in
the morning, that wakes us up.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.450
Especially when we view light.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:21.760
So if you're groggy in the morning

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.840
that's why viewing light is helpful.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.740
But, the interesting thing is

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.820
if you start viewing light
frequently in the morning,

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.010
then those connections
between the melanopsin cells

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.290
and the circadian clock, become primed

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.850
or potentiated we would say,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.800
they become stronger for
the anticipation of light.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.030
And you naturally start waking up earlier,

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.490
feeling more alert.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.250
So, what this says is

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.810
and what I do is I get that
regular light because I know

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.810
that some mornings,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.370
I'm just not gonna feel very alert,

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.950
I'll feel, especially tired.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.720
And I might not be able to access sunlight

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.500
because it's really
overcast or I'm traveling,

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.360
or some other feature.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.630
But the system is plastic

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.950
so it shifted in the right direction.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.420
Now it will shift back,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.810
because it's short-term plasticity

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:03.910
after about two, three days.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.743
So you wanna try

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:07.090
and get the sunlight
exposure on a regular basis.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.100
The other thing that I do is
I delay my intake of caffeine,

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.020
for the first two hours that I'm awake.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.860
Now, this can be very painful for people.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.400
But, earlier we talked
about, the adenosine system

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.720
and how the accumulation of
adenosine makes us sleepy.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.990
And caffeine suppresses adenosine

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.570
and it makes us feel alert.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.610
But we know,

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.650
that if you ingest caffeine,
immediately on waking,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.770
the signal to the adrenals,
to release cortisol,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.090
which is a healthy release of cortisol,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.806
and the suppression of adenosine

00:19:39.806 --> 00:19:43.183
that happens as we come out of sleep,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.230
and in deep sleep the
suppression of adenosine,

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.680
if you ingest caffeine too
early, there's a mechanism

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.090
by which the adenosine competes
for the receptors et cetera,

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.800
so that you have a mid-morning crash.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.560
Because if caffeine, the way it works is

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.390
if caffeine is occupying
the adenosine receptor,

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.720
then the natural endogenous mechanisms,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.780
for suppressing adenosine,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.860
are not actually gonna have their action.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.620
So the brain to adrenal axis,
is subject to plasticity also.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.330
And so by delaying caffeine

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.610
until about two hours after waking,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.370
I'm able to capture, and
reinforce, to potentiate,

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.150
the neural circuit that exists
between the circadian clock

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.300
and the cortisol released in the adrenals,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.830
as well as, leave those
adenosine receptors,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.000
unoccupied so that I can
then use the caffeine

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.640
to get a natural lift,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.330
in alertness and focus
two hours later as opposed

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.420
to using it, just to wake
myself up out of sleepiness.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.900
So while I'm sure there are
some eye-rolls out there

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.500
and some yawns, about,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.610
oh no, it's the sunlight
in the morning thing again.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.860
It's a powerful tool, for
readjusting these circuits.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.390
So the short-term plasticity.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.223
And the reason

00:20:53.223 --> 00:20:55.140
for delaying caffeine
for the first two hours

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.800
of the day even if it's painful
to do for the first couple

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.420
of days is that then you
naturally start to wake up,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.940
more readily in the morning
without caffeine because,

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.880
the adenosine is suppressed

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.430
and you don't have these competing.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.730
It's called a competing antagonist,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.090
for the adenosine receptor.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.520
So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.700
Lately because I wake up very
early I do use a bright light,

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.570
to stimulate alertness.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.340
It's not actually
designed for that purpose.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.770
It's just a light board
that has been about 900 lux.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.220
And then I delay caffeine.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.413
Some of you have asked,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.600
and again I'm not saying
anyone has to do this.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.020
You know, what exactly do you drink?

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.990
I'm a big believer in black coffee.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.530
I just happen to like black coffee.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.850
People have asked me about,

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.170
and I don't wanna name brand names here

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.500
about this type of coffee or,

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.680
that type of coffee you
mixed with these other,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.130
kinds of things.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.990
Will that increase focus?

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.220
You know, I'm gonna talk today a lot about

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.290
the use of diet and
fasting and timing of foods

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.610
and certain kinds of foods.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.600
But to be honest, black
coffee is just a simple choice

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.930
that's always worked for me.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.240
I also make sure I hydrate
first thing in the morning.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.130
There is plenty of data now
showing that even a slight,

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.510
increase in dehydration,

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.370
meaning just when you're lacking water,

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.300
can make people have headaches.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.780
It can provide some additional photophobia

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.860
for those of you that are migraine prone.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.440
Bright light can trigger migraines.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.680
That's no surprise to those of you

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.860
that get headaches and migraines.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.440
But dehydration, can compound,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.350
the vulnerability to
migraine and headache.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.960
So I drink water, I drink
black coffee, or I drink mate

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.450
which is just because I
have Argentine lineage

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.140
which is just a high
caffeine drink first thing

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:34.973
in the morning,

00:22:34.973 --> 00:22:37.313
but I delay it until two
hours after I wake up.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.190
And that's because, I want the circuits

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.750
between my eye and my circadian
clock and my adrenals,

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.880
to be functioning in a particular way,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.240
so that then later the
caffeine is an addition.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.010
It adds more alertness.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.310
Now this is a discussion about
how to optimize your brain.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.580
Many people who wake up quickly,

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.150
and just naturally feel
like bouncing out of bed.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.950
I envy these people.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.400
They will do just fine,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.680
by going into a learning
bout or taking care of,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.170
whatever it is that they
need to take care of.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.430
Sometimes that's kind
of more mundane tasks

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.040
like email and whatnot.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.630
Here's a more or less a rule

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.350
about how the brain
functions, vis-a-vis, focus,

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.910
learning and creativity.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.620
And I'm gonna discuss this
much more in future episodes.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.300
Generally states of high alertness,

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.110
when we're very very alert,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.410
are great for strategy implementation.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.810
When we already know how to do something.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.130
And it's just simply a matter

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:41.263
of plugging the correct
elements into the correct boxes.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.950
I've talked before about
duration, path and outcome,

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.980
as the three things

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.130
that the deliberate
conscious brain is trying

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.080
to figure out in order
to perform certain tasks,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.930
even cognitive tasks.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.140
This is the sort of thing
that we are very good at

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.760
when we're well rested, and we're focused.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.290
In our autonomic arousal

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.460
or our alertness rather
is at a high level.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.880
If you are somebody who is
hitting that alertness phase

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.620
of your day, very early,
right after you wake up,

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.260
that's a great time to move
right into things that,

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.790
at least the research says,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.700
you already know, have the strategy

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.140
and you just wanna implement the strategy.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.130
This is where I fundamentally depart

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.450
from the idea that, oh, you
know, you have to do the hardest

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.960
or most critical tasks throughout the day.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.300
Sometimes the hardest
and most critical tasks,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.520
are tasks that require creativity.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.040
And as we'll soon talk about creativity,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.070
and tasks related to it,

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.300
oftentimes come to us best

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.250
or the brain is best at achieving those,

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.420
when we're in states of calm
or even slightly drowsy.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.790
Which is something that's interesting

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.100
in what we'll get into.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.500
But for me, for instance,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.230
I get up, I'm not terribly
alert, first thing.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.167
And so I try and just get my brain

00:24:53.167 --> 00:24:54.950
and my thoughts organized.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.000
It's not a time for me to be responding

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.040
in a very linear fashion to emails

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.050
or carrying out calculations.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.287
That comes about two hours later.

00:25:02.287 --> 00:25:04.770
And I think many people
out there will relate,

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.670
mid-morning is when many people
tend to achieve their peak

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.480
in alertness and focus.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.770
Now, many times I get the question and

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.760
this what I'm about to
say is directly related

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.840
to the hundreds of
questions I got about this.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.120
Should I use, background
music in order to learn?

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.360
Should I have, you know,
construction next door?

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.860
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.290
Is it better to be in
complete silence, et cetera?

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.230
Now this will vary.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.510
Some people can tolerate their own noise

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.030
within their head much better than others.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.600
Other people find that
having some background noise,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.083
helps cancel that out.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.320
But there's a simple rule

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.740
of thumb that one can use,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.850
because at least my experience

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.620
is that sometimes background
music, background noise

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.130
is very helpful for allowing me to focus.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.740
And other times, it's very distracting.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.860
So what actually governs that?

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.260
Well, we have to ask ourselves,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.550
what is at the source,
of the lack of focus?

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.440
If our lack of focus is
because our autonomic arousal

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.580
or our alertness is very, very high.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.830
We had a little too much coffee,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.410
or if there is such a thing,
slept a little too long

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.660
or we're really stressed
or really activated,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.280
and we can't seem to focus.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.060
In that case,

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.950
eliminating background noise,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.190
and really just trying to get silence,

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.060
so that we can quiet some
of that autonomic arousal,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.150
is going to be best

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.470
for learning and for implementation

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.360
of things we already know how to do.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.950
For any kind of focus linear task.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.523
Which, basically learning
is a focus linear task

00:26:36.523 --> 00:26:38.160
is that you're just not necessarily,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.520
performing well all the time.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.200
Last time we talked about making errors.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.670
So as a rule of thumb,
if you're too keyed up,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.490
then silence and quiet
is going to be helpful.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.253
In fact, if you're very keyed up,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.830
a particular circuit,

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.750
related to the basal ganglia,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.760
starts getting triggered more easily.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.700
And this circuit, I'm
gonna talk about in depth.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.430
But, it's called the go, no-go circuit.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.830
We have circuits that
connect our forebrain,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.270
to our structure in our brain
called the basal ganglia

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.320
which is actually a
collection of structures.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.920
And the forebrain, which is involved

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.330
in rational thought and thinking
and planning and action,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.120
is always trying to plan what should I do,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.357
and then implement that action.

00:27:16.357 --> 00:27:18.910
And the basal ganglia
are intimately involved

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:19.743
in that discussion.

00:27:19.743 --> 00:27:22.270
There's a reciprocal
loop of communication,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.440
between basil ganglia and cortex.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.340
The basal ganglia has one set

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.220
of connections to the cortex,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.330
and the cortex back to the basal ganglia

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.860
that facilitates go.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.240
It facilitates action.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.783
And the molecule, the
neuromodulator dopamine,

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.870
triggers the activation of go.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.360
It tends to make us
want to do more things.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.450
It tends to make us bias toward action.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.360
By the way that dopamine binds

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.060
to something called the D1 receptors.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.160
Just a particular type
of dopamine receptor.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.440
For those of you that wanna know.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.260
The no-go pathway,

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.640
the pathway in the basal ganglia,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.053
and cortex that suppresses action,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.060
involves dopamine binding

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.890
to this other receptor
called the D2 receptor.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.320
Now D1, D2 receptors,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.620
you can't just consciously decide,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.570
oh, I only want my D1
receptors and my D2 receptors

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.560
to be active.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.450
You have to think about,

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.930
which sorts of states of mind and body,

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.943
facilitate go, and which
ones facilitate no-go.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.590
Now this is critically important,

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.520
because doing focused work,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.010
accessing plasticity, and learning,

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.750
involve doing certain
things and not doing others.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.740
So here's how it works.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.223
And here's how I apply
it on a daily basis.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.290
Because I tend to be most alert,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.560
first thing, mid-morning or so.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.760
And then I generally will
have my caffeine mid-morning.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.580
My peak of alertness, in
the early part of the day,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.660
is occurring for me sometime
between 9:30 and 11:00 AM.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.493
That's just me.

00:28:56.493 --> 00:28:57.410
Other people might experience

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.210
that immediately after rolling out of bed.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.490
They might be wide awake and ready to go.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.840
Which case they should be cautious

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.239
about throwing caffeine in the mix

00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:07.000
and it's gonna make them very, very alert.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.200
There are three sort of levels,

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.780
of autonomic arousal of alertness,

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.780
that bias us more toward
go, no-go, or both.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.180
And this relates, to a question

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.000
that I've gotten now
hundreds of times from you,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.450
in the comment section for this podcast,

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.950
which is, is it better for me to listen

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.860
to music in the background
while I work and learn,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.290
or should I have complete silence?

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:37.310
And the answer is it depends.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.180
But it doesn't depend
randomly on who you are,

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.320
or even necessarily time of day,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.200
it depends, on your overall
level of autonomic arousal.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.980
And it depends because,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.090
autonomic arousal level of alertness,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.030
biases the extent to which,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.750
we are more prone to gos to action,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.340
or to no-gos, to suppress action.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.920
And dopamine is this molecule
that's swimming around

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.170
and is going to buy us one
or the other responses.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.003
So here's how it works.

00:30:06.003 --> 00:30:07.810
Let's say, I'm very alert.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.460
Maybe I got a particularly
good night's sleep

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.510
the night before,

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.330
I had a little too much coffee,

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.760
and I'm gonna sit down to some work.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.250
The thing to know,

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.440
and what I always tell myself
is when I'm very alert,

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.870
I am very prone to go, to action,

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.870
but I'm also prone to, not no-go, right?

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.490
I'm not gonna be very good
at suppressing action.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.640
So those are two different things.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.970
Being biased toward
action and being biased,

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.560
toward suppressing action are
two different things, okay?

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.480
So those are push pull.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.980
Toward action, suppress action.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.660
So, when you're very alert,

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.370
the tendency is for
everything to be a stimulus.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:47.440
This is why when people say,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.040
well, should I just take a drug
that will increase my level

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.230
of epinephrine and alertness?

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.230
Will that help me learn better?

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.750
No, because it will make you do things,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.660
but it will also make you less good

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.760
at suppressing actions
that you need to suppress.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.160
So if I'm very alert,
particularly alert for me

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.390
and I recognize what
that state is, of course

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.430
'cause everyone will be different.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.980
I know what it is for me.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.670
Then I want silence for learning.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.010
I want it shut down my
internet, which I do.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.950
I sometimes use a program,

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.633
that I believe is a free
program called Freedom,

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.510
where it actually locks you out

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.390
of the internet for a particular time.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.580
They're not a sponsor of the podcast.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.610
I just happen to use it.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.370
There's another version
of Freedom where you go

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.480
to the wireless thing and you turn it off.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.790
You disconnect from the wireless.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:32.623
That's the other one.

00:31:32.623 --> 00:31:36.180
Although, many people have a
hard time not reactivating it.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.055
So I'm trying to shut down

00:31:38.055 --> 00:31:41.420
the go pathway towards distraction.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.070
And the other thing that I'll do,

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.210
is I'll generally turn off my phone,

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.650
put the phone outside in the car

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.490
or in really extreme cases
I'll throw it up on the roof

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.600
which is hard for me to retrieve,
so that I can't get to it.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.150
So if I'm very alert, I'm aware

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.010
that I will have a bias toward action.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.670
It will be hard for me
to suppress non-action,

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.320
but that it's very nonspecific.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.960
Because, the next kind of
level down of alertness,

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.210
or autonomic arousal is
clear, calm and focused

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.263
where we have that kind
of sweet spot between,

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.670
our willingness to pursue action.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.150
We're in a mode of go, and
it's not always physical action

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.020
but it can be pursuing
hard bouts of learning.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.420
But that our ability to
suppress is also very good.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.940
And this is because, and I don't wanna get

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.160
into too many details,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.310
because of the way that dopamine competes

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.810
for these dopamine one receptors

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.810
in the go pathway and
dopamine two receptors

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.053
in the no-go pathway.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.120
They're always in this kind of push pull.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.540
And so there is a sweet spot.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.540
And that sweet spot isn't flow,

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.830
where it is in some sort

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.220
of state where all of a sudden
things come naturally to us.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.320
The state that we're trying
to achieve that's optimal

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.910
for learning is one in which,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.220
we have the energy and focus to pursue,

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.370
but we also have the energy
and focus to suppress action.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.070
So the basal ganglia are kinda working

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.160
in a perfect kind of sing songly manner,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.890
through this parallel pathway.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.460
Now, as we get tired or as we
round out an ultradian cycle

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.733
of about 90 minutes,

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.640
what happens is our fatigue even

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.840
if it's not a physical fatigue

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.480
that makes us wanna go to sleep,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.640
but our mental fatigue
starts to accumulate

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.370
because these pathways of
go, no-go are actually,

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.130
very metabolically consuming.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.840
So what I recognize is that
as they start to falter,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.570
I have a harder time engaging and going

00:33:28.681 --> 00:33:30.330
or going toward the goal rather.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:33.930
I also know that my reflex,

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.190
toward actions that are unrelated

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.110
to the learning are also
gonna start increasing

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:42.880
because I'm not gonna be
able to suppress action

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.420
and activate the no-go pathways.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.960
So if this all sounds like a mouthful,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.470
let's make it very simple for you.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.220
When you are very alert,

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.770
the best situation for learning
is going to be silence.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.200
It's going to be complete quiet.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.110
If you are low arousal,

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.250
and you're tired and
you're kind of sleepy,

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.090
a lot of people find that
having some background chatter

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.280
and some background noise,
can help elevate their level

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.300
of autonomic arousal.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.350
And that's because our auditory system

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.490
and our visual system, are
linked and are part of really

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.180
what's called the salience network.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.013
Which is that we're always,

00:34:14.013 --> 00:34:15.920
scanning our environment for things.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.260
And when we have a lot of things
in our environment to scan,

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.740
generally our level of alertness goes up.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.770
This is why environments
that are very stark

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.930
or have very little or
very few objects in them,

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.750
tend to make us feel kind of calm,

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.970
because our salient
network kinda shuts off.

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.130
A lot of people don't like that.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.430
They'll go to a meditation retreat,

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.920
or they'll go into an environment

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.260
where there's very little
clutter especially city people.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.120
And all of a sudden,

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.350
they start feeling really, really anxious.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.170
And that's because their internal level

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.790
of autonomic arousal is really high

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.580
and it's not being
occupied by all this stuff

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.630
to pay attention to.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.030
And so their salience network
starts to turn inward.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.110
They move from exteroception
to interoception.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.760
They're not looking outside themselves,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.860
they're looking inside themselves

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.810
and there's a lot of noise in there.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.960
So, as a rule of thumb,
if you tend to be kind of

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.580
on the high level of
alertness and kind of anxiety,

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.760
and I'm not talking about
clinical levels of anxiety

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.410
but you tend to, be pretty high energy,

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:14.600
well then, you are definitely
going to benefit more

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.590
in a learning bout,

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.907
from learning to go as well
as activate the no-go pathway.

00:35:19.907 --> 00:35:21.750
And that requires a lot of energy.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.350
And when you have a lot of
distractions in your environment,

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.640
there's a high probability
that you're gonna be distracted

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.060
from the learning.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.390
Now, some people are
just naturally more calm.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.610
They're like my bulldog
Costello, who's exceedingly calm.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:34.610
They're pretty mellow.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.500
They're kind of clear, calm
and focused all of the time.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.050
And those people, actually
are gonna be less flappable.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.010
They're not gonna be yanked
around by background noise

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.680
or they're not gonna be around, you know,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.960
bothered from their learning
or from their studying

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.030
by a clanging of a pot from
somebody in the kitchen.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.610
So, each one of us
generally tends to ride up

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.550
and down this autonomic
ladder, so to speak,

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.550
at different times a day.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.960
For most people, three hours after waking.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.470
Those three hours, not
three hours on the mark

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:06.810
but for that three hour
bin tends to be the period

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.550
in which they're most
alert throughout the day.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.790
Except I'll tell you later

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.090
about a unique time right before sleep

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.410
in which you're also very,
very alert, naturally.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.690
So, that morning three
hours is quite vital.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.700
Now, many of you might ask about exercise

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.260
and when to exercise.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.440
I think I may have mentioned this

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.870
on a previous podcast episode.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.630
But, the research shows that

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.610
at least for performance,
afternoon exercise might be better

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.190
in terms of avoiding injury, et cetera.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.343
But in terms of rising body temperatures,

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.210
and matching body temperature

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.640
to have mental alertness, et cetera.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.030
It's pretty clear, that
exercising early in the day,

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.830
not only biases us
towards waking up earlier,

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.260
but that it also triggers
the release of things

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.240
like epinephrine and
other neuromodulators,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.670
that lend itself,

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.500
to a situation where we
have heightened levels

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.680
of arousal and mental acuity

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.173
in the late morning and
even into the afternoon.

00:37:00.173 --> 00:37:01.860
Now, this can be very good

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.740
because if you wanna restrict
most of your focus learning

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.910
to the early part of the day,

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.990
exercising early in the day
does set a neurochemical context

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.730
or mill you for go.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.680
It tends to trigger
activation of the go pathway.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.440
And so for those of you like myself

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.320
who have a hard time kind
of engaging and getting

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.810
into action early in the day,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.500
early morning exercise
within an hour of waking,

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.490
and certainly no later than
three hours after waking,

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.060
will give you quote unquote more energy

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:28.910
throughout the day.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.270
It will make you feel
more biased for action.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.870
You won't feel as lethargic.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.820
So, in can kind of reviewing

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.550
what I've set up until now I
do the morning light thing,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.570
I delay my caffeine
two hours after waking,

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.610
and then I generally try and get exercise

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.560
in the first hour or ideally

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.450
within the first three hours of waking up.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.020
And then I'll move into
a focused learning bout.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.450
Now, some of you wrote to me
and said, if I exercise early

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.410
in the day, then I feel
a crash afterwards.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.450
If that exercise is very, very intense.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.100
So you're depleting all your glycogen.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.090
So you're doing heavy
deadlifts, et cetera.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.740
Chances are after you eat, you
will start to feel a crash.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.840
So this relates to timing of nutrition.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.230
And in just as a general rule of thumb,

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.570
fasted states, and low
carbohydrate states,

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.080
I'm not talking about a keto diet around

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.350
the clock or all week

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.640
but fasted states,

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.350
and low carbohydrate states
lend themselves to alertness.

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:25.760
And that's because carbohydrates
are rich in tryptophan,

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.910
and they tend to lend
themselves to sleepiness.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.740
Of course, ingesting large
amounts of any kind of food,

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.300
any substance that fills
your gut will divert blood

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.133
to your gut.

00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:37.950
So if you eat a lot of food regardless

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.810
of whether or not it's a
lot of carbohydrate or not,

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.300
you're going to generally
feel more sleepy.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.590
Now, many people, including
everyone use food,

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.600
to modulate their levels
of autonomic arousal.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.260
And typically eating shifts us
more towards a state of calm.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.930
And fasting shifts us more
toward a state of alertness.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.010
And these are hard-wired
circuits that relate

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.210
to the need and desire to find
food which requires action,

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.520
or the so-called rest and digest system

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.610
which diverts our resources

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.010
and our energy towards digestion.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.360
It makes us feel calm.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.880
So I personally rely on water, mate,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.910
and black coffee first thing in the day,

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:19.210
in order to exercise and get
into the first round of work.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:20.760
If I find that I'm too alert,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.800
and then I generally will tend to eat

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.120
and kind of bring down
my level of alertness,

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.490
and will continue working.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.740
Now this is in district thing.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.320
And since people asked me what I do,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.260
and I'm not dictating that people follow

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.380
it exactly of course or even generally,

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.610
but I'll just tell you what I do.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.940
It is possible if you're
drinking black coffee,

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.270
or mate and you're
ingesting a lot of water,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.380
that you're going to
dehydrate yourself somewhat,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.600
because of excretion of sodium.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.010
Provided you don't have hypertension,

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.670
salt is a really good thing.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.540
A lot of people think that they are low

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.850
on blood sugar because they're
shaky and they can't think

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.660
or they have a headache when
actually they're low in sodium.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.170
And especially if you're
drinking a lot of caffeine.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.680
So I'm a big believer in salt.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.621
So I drink salt water first thing

00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:03.960
in the morning because
I drink black coffee.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.960
And that keeps my levels
of alertness really good.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.260
I always thought that I
had messed up blood sugar.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.350
I had shaky hands and I
didn't know what was going on.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.560
I'd drink a little bit of
coffee and feel too amped up.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.090
And turns out that it was a sodium issue.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.220
And if I just drank water
with a little bit of sea salt

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.150
and or even just a typical table salt,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.910
then I'd fell rock solid
in terms of my blood sugar.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.710
Now, again, I'm not a
physician, I'm a professor

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.640
so I don't prescribe anything,
but I profess lots of things.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.640
So I don't want people who have diabetes

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.880
or blood sugar issues to go off the rails.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.120
You're responsible for
your health, not me.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.370
But it's an interesting
parameter to think about

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.850
and experiment with, you know,

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.370
provided that your doctor says it's okay,

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.480
because I think a lot of people,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.700
probably ingest too much sodium

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.060
but a lot of people might be
sodium deficient in particular

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.290
the people that are fasting.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.963
I typically eat my first
meal right around mid day,

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.760
whether or not I've exercised or not.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.950
And the food content there

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.980
is actually quite important to me.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.610
I don't know why this is.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.100
I don't have a scientific
mechanism for this

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.090
but if I eat hot food for
lunch, I get sleepy after lunch.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.440
So I generally don't
eat hot food for lunch.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.260
I might have a little bit of
soup or something like that.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.870
But in general, I rely on
a low carbohydrate meal.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.100
I'll eat meat or salad
or some variation of that

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.583
and nuts and fats and things like that

00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:23.000
because of the [indistinct]
content for focus,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.490
because the protein is good in my belief.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.510
And because I believe

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.670
in eating fruits and vegetables.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.503
I do that too.

00:41:28.503 --> 00:41:30.880
If I've exercised very
hard early in the day,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.710
I do ingest starches like oatmeal or rice

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.860
and fruit and things like that.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.080
Now, why am I telling you all this?

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.970
Because, 100s if not 1000 people ask me,

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.040
is fasting good for focus?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.940
And indeed fasting will
increase alertness,

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.690
but if you're so hungry
or preoccupied with food

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.040
that you can't focus well,

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.430
then it's not gonna be good for learning.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.110
It's only going to be good for agitation.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.070
Now, I'm just gonna mark continue to march

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.490
through my day.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.300
And this is, of course what I experienced.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.780
Some people are quite different.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.550
But, what I find is
around 2:00 or 3:00 PM,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.850
I start getting a little groggy.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.590
A little bit sleepy.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:12.100
I will tend to shift my work
from work that requires a lot

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.900
of duration path, outcome,
really careful analysis

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.530
and activation of the no-go pathway.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.780
Meaning I'm trying to
suppress the impulse to look

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.960
at my phone or answer
email, or do other things.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.830
This is why I haven't
emailed you back until 3:00

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.910
in the afternoon.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:25.950
By the way, or responded

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.400
to your text messages,
whoever you are out there.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.560
Around early afternoon,

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.540
I find I can do kind of
typical more mundane tasks.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.540
Because, those tasks
require less cognitive load.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.650
And they can be done more or
less, in and out of sequence.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.040
I can answer a couple email here,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.560
maybe answer that email there.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.040
I don't have to do it
in pure linear fashion.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.450
Any kind of linear work

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.880
or learning work is gonna
take a lot of focus.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.480
And then typically around 4:00 PM or so,

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.960
I do two things.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.870
Sometimes a little earlier.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.300
Sometimes a little later
but I do two things.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.490
One, is I make sure I hydrate.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.550
Because if you're exercising
and you're eating,

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.750
you need to digest that food, et cetera.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:10.640
I make sure I hydrate.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.730
So I drink water.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.250
I try and refrain from drinking
coffee in the afternoon.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.460
This is a new thing for me.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.840
I sometimes do it, but I
try and refrain from that.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.890
And then I always do,

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.940
a non sleep deep rest protocol
sometime in the afternoon.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.920
This is sometimes a 10 minute
yoga nidra type protocol,

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.770
or a 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.770
These are protocols I
have no relationship to,

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.620
no business relationship to whatsoever.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.570
I've been doing them for years now.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.630
They involve listening to a script.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.010
We'll provide the links again

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.580
although we've provided them before.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.000
Or I'll do a hypnosis protocol,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
from Reveri Health

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.170
which is my colleague
David Spiegel's website

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.490
that has these free hypnosis apps

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.970
or scripts that you can listen to.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.580
And those take me into a
state of really deep rest.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.570
Sometimes so much so that I fall asleep.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.650
And I always set an alarm

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.520
so that I don't sleep for
longer than 90 minutes.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.620
But typically this goes
for about 30 minutes.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.470
And I do that because for me

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.790
by about 4:30 in the afternoon,

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.310
I'm capable of doing basically nothing.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.770
I am just a complete Costello.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.870
I can't think, I can't do,

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.340
I can't respond to email.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.490
I've just completely troughed
my ability to function.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.920
I personally find it a mistake,

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.990
to that point,

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.240
down a double espresso,
and charge really hard.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.350
It just doesn't work for me.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.420
I end up really disrupting
my sleep schedule.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.130
I end up disrupting a
lot of different things.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.440
So for me, I do the non
sleep deep rest protocol.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.230
It really helps me later
when I need to fall asleep.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.380
It helps with all sorts of
things, as I mentioned before.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.630
But I usually emerge
from that a little groggy

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.970
or feeling like I have another
whole day, second wind.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:51.800
Like I could just work.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.420
And then I'll do a
second bout of learning.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.810
I'll do some sort of work

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.390
that either involves linear
analysis of something.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.713
So maybe numerical work or
I'm trying to learn something.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.830
I generally try and really use those bouts

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:10.880
of 90 minute focus energy
after the non sleep deep rest.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.520
And as I mentioned in previous episodes,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.030
there's a lot of evidence,

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.510
that these non sleep deep
rest protocols can enhance

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.170
and accelerate plasticity.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.870
The most I think recent

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:24.700
and striking one is the study
that we referenced last time

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.800
in the caption notes.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.710
It was the cell press article,

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:29.840
Cell Reports, great journal.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.763
Was showing that these 20 minute,

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.010
kinda shallow naps and
non sleep deep rests,

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.570
can facilitate sensory motor learning.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:38.950
So then I'll go into another learning bout

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.330
that's caffeine free.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.330
This learning bout is very
different than the morning one.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.120
This is a work bout or learning bout

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.450
that's more in the clear
common focus regime

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.220
because I've come out of
this non sleep deep rest.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.520
I'm not ingesting caffeine
because I wanna make sure

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.010
that I can sleep later
that night really well.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:59.100
And, this tends to be more
when I do creative type work.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.240
Now, creativity is a topic
that we're gonna spend

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.240
the entire month on coming up soon.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.210
But creativity is a very
interesting state of mind in which,

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.970
we're taking existing elements.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.240
Things that we already know,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.990
and rearranging them
in ways that are novel.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.290
And I'd say, well, duh,
that's what creativity is.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.350
But creativity has two parts.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.600
It has a creative discovery
mode where you're kind

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.760
of shuffling things around

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.990
in a very relaxed way
and kind of being playful

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.640
or exploring different configurations.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.930
And then creativity also has,

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.890
an absolutely linear implementation mode.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:37.820
In which you take

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.210
the idea or the design you've come up with

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.650
and you create something
very robust and concrete.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.510
And so creativity is
really a two part thing.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.070
And the first part

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.900
of actively exploring
different configuration,

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.590
sometimes in a playful way,

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.240
sometimes in a way that's almost random

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.360
and just kind of exploring.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.370
That state is definitely facilitated

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.240
by being relaxed and almost sleepy.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.260
That is not a state

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.720
that I personally can access
very well early in the day.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.600
I've tried to access
it coming out of sleep

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.540
because one would say,

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.920
well you're still sleepy early in the day

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.753
and just doesn't work.

00:47:14.753 --> 00:47:15.800
Most of what I write down.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.080
Most of what I do is complete garbage.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.870
And so what I found is there's
this block in the afternoon

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:24.580
of about 90 minutes where, I
can do creative type writing

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.033
or creative type imagination of,

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.770
scientific ideas or
experiments we might wanna do.

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:32.600
Science might not seem
like a creative endeavor

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.880
to many of you, but it is.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.530
Has a lot of imagining what if this,

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:37.700
or we could combine that

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.960
and thinking of novel concepts
or ways of arranging things.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.410
So when you find yourself in

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.510
that kinda clear common focused mode,

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:47.490
creative works tend to
come about very well

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.020
in those regimes.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.720
Now I know there are a lot
of people out there rely

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.123
on substances to access creative states.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.430
I'm not a marijuana user.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.030
It's just not the drug for
me, for a variety of reasons.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.490
I'm not a drinker.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.050
It's not the substance for
me for a variety of reasons.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.220
You know, I'm not a cop I'm not out here

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.190
to tell people what they
should do or shouldn't do.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.780
The problem with using
substances to access creativity,

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.900
is that generally the
substances that relax people,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.960
will allow them to get

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.820
into that creative brainstorming mode,

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.843
but not so good at the
linear implementation mode.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.440
You know, the other day I was remarking

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.920
with a friend that there are
some ads, some advertisements

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.900
that I've seen over the years,
that are just incredible.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.820
I'll just tell you what they are.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.930
So there's not cryptic or anything.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:38.989
I'm revealing my tastes here.

00:48:38.989 --> 00:48:42.350
There's a particular perfume
ad that Spike Jones made

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.100
that is just amazing.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.823
I'll put a link to it
cause it's just so cool.

00:48:49.412 --> 00:48:50.245
I don't want to give away the end

00:48:50.245 --> 00:48:52.163
but it has a feature of it that
is particularly interesting

00:48:52.163 --> 00:48:54.931
to me as a neuroscientist.

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.360
And it's just so cool.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.770
'Cause I grew up in the
skateboarding thing,

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.800
I knew a little bit about
Spike's movies and skateboarding

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.280
and he's of course made
a lot of very impressive,

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.230
popular movies as well,
full length features.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.900
I don't know him personally,
so this isn't a plug.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.390
Not that he needs my
endorsement for anything at all.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.800
But the amazing thing
about this advertisement

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.330
is it's a collection of things

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.920
that you would never really
think would be combined,

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.460
and it involves different speeds

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.630
of motion and all sorts of effects.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:24.920
I mean, it's like a real classic

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.000
like Spike Jones kind delivery.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.270
But, what's incredible is when you think

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.890
about not just the fact that
someone had to imagine that

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:37.100
but to actually implement the
steps in order to create that,

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.830
when you see this you'll
realize that was a ton of work.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:41.550
You can't just put that together randomly.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.440
And so a lot of people, not Spike clearly,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.440
but a lot of people who have
an incredible mind for ideas

00:49:50.619 --> 00:49:53.480
and novel arrangements of things,

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.060
they are great at accessing
that state but not so good

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.053
at accessing the implementation state.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.940
It's also true that a lot of people

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.430
and some who tend to fall on
what we would call the kind of

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.790
like more Asperger's or
autism end of the spectrum,

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.180
are very good at linear implementation.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.240
Now I'm not talking about all
forms of autism of course.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.270
I'm sensitive to the fact

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.300
that there are many forms on the spectrum.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.770
But, some people are very
good at linear implementation.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:22.220
And that's, a separate
state from a creative state.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.630
So, that afternoon block is when I try

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:28.020
and access the freer
kind of looser mindset

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.030
that's associated with the
fatigue that comes later

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.043
in the afternoon.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.930
And, for some of you that state

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.340
that favors creativity
and creative learning,

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.080
might be better in the morning.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:39.913
I don't know.

00:50:39.913 --> 00:50:40.746
You're gonna have to decide.

00:50:40.746 --> 00:50:42.750
For some of you you're
gonna be late shifted.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:44.380
Some of you are gonna be morning shifted.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.780
But where we have alertness,

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.900
generally we are good at
linear implementation,

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.190
we're good at activating the no-go pathway

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.280
and suppressing action,

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.688
and we are good at
pursuing particular goals

00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:56.860
and strategy implementation.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.010
And where we tend to be more relaxed,

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.120
and we tend to be almost
in a kind of sleepy mode.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.953
So for me, coming out

00:51:01.953 --> 00:51:04.850
of one of these non sleep,
deep rest modes or sleep,

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.740
that's when we tend to be
better at novel configurations

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.180
of existing elements, which is creativity.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:15.290
And this brings about a question
that I get, all the time.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.260
Which is, what about psychedelics?

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.530
So, I am going to talk, to
some experts on psychedelics.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.530
I hope to bring some of them in.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.170
Actually speaking on people coming in

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.493
or creatures coming.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.230
A creature that's definitely
not on psychedelics

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.260
who doesn't need any is
Costello and he just arrived.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.790
He seems to be in a sleepy
state most, all the time.

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.780
Hey buddy, how you doing?

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.680
You come in, yep.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.260
He's working on his 15th sleep
deep rest episode of the day

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.350
which is generally followed

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.620
by a 10 to 12 hour deep rest episode,

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.390
almost exclusively comprised of REM.

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:52.970
And I know this 'cause his eyes are open

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:54.790
'cause they're so droopy, he
can't close them all the way

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.430
and his eyes are going like this.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:58.160
And he's going down for the count.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.610
So, yeah, nice and big yawn.

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:04.550
Okay so, psychedelics.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.290
First of all, I wanna be very clear.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.680
I am neither a proponent,
nor am I somebody

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.230
who rejects the potential
role of psychedelics.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.940
I do however, think that psychedelics,

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.180
can be particularly hazardous,

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.290
for people who have preexisting
psychological issues,

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.360
and are not working
with a board certified,

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.160
psychiatrist or physician,

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.720
as well as for essentially all kids.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.070
I think that the young brain is basically

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.793
in its own psychedelic
state and just naturally.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.560
And all kidding aside,

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.940
I think that the young brain

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.970
is so subject to neuroplasticity,

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.910
that drugs, which like psychedelics
which are very powerful,

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:48.290
can be detrimental to
the developing brain.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.340
That's just my stance.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.890
If anyone disagrees with me,
I'd be happy to chat with you

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.510
about it in a polite and discourse.

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.540
I'll be happy to listen as well

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.683
as tell you more why I believe
that based on the data.

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.800
I'm mentioning psychedelics
because many of you asked.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.970
Here's the deal with psychedelics.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:07.850
At least here's how they work.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:12.450
In a nutshell, psychedelics were thought

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:16.600
to unleash sensory processing
and to make it less filtered.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.330
We have a lot of different
inputs from our eyes,

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.220
from our ears, from our nose,
from our taste, et cetera

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.180
that you're coming in
all the time in parallel.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.670
And we have mechanisms that
suppress some of and allow us

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.320
to only focus on things
that are happening.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.370
Visually, generally we don't
have synesthesia unless some

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:32.080
of us happen to have synesthesia.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.630
We don't blend what we see
with what we hear in a way,

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:37.320
that is confusing to us.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.100
We know what's making sounds and we know

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.690
what is a visual stimulus.

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.250
On psychedelics, people report
being able to smell colors

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.850
or to, you know, hear trees, et cetera.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:51.920
And that's because there's
a lot of sensory blending.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.490
Over that's led to the misconception,

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:58.120
that sensory blending itself,
is a creative process.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.620
There's nothing creative
about sensory blending.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.620
You know there's, the essence
of a creative process,

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.000
is that some novel
configuration of elements,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.070
whether or not it's notes on a piano,

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:12.440
or whether or not it's words on a page,

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.610
whether or not it's numbers

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.070
or whether or not it's movement.

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:20.070
That some way in which those
are configured in some new way,

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:24.180
that the algorithm, the way in which,

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.310
they are configured makes
sense to the observer.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:28.550
And this is a key thing.

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.383
It seems to me

00:54:29.383 --> 00:54:31.820
that when people report their
psychedelic experiences,

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.870
it makes a lot more sense

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.910
to the person who experiences
it, than to the observer.

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:40.910
And so, creative works by
definition are new ways

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.670
of configuring things that lend themselves

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.970
to a bigger or greater or
deeper or novel understanding

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.870
on the part of the observer.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.920
And just sensory blending is
not gonna accomplish that.

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.990
Now it is true and there's a great review

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:56.930
in the journal cell, excellent journal

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:58.360
about how psychedelics work.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.970
And it turns out, they don't just work,

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.880
by allowing for more sensory blending.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.830
They do, because of the way

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.450
that they activate certain
serotonin receptors et cetera.

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.680
They do lend themselves to
more lateral connectivity

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.950
between different brain areas,
more novel associations.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.880
So in principle,

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.810
in principle, I should say
not necessarily in practice,

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:22.300
but in principle, they
do allow different areas

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.133
of the brain.

00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:23.966
Maybe even the two sides

00:55:23.966 --> 00:55:25.870
of the brain to communicate more broadly

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:27.690
than they would normally.

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:31.890
So that has certain elements
that speak to creativity.

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:33.980
But, it can't simply be the case

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:37.530
that psychedelics are
the portal to creativity.

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.790
Because creativity, as I mentioned before,

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.840
involves not just novel
associations and a breaking of kind

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.430
of space-time rules, it also
involves reconfiguring things,

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:52.120
such that the new space-time
rule that one comes up with,

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.410
is interesting, stimulating

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:58.130
and kind of in many cases,
delightful to the observer.

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:01.450
And that's why, many
claims that, you know,

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:06.290
psychedelics open plasticity
or they increase creativity.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.700
That's not sufficient for me personally.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.760
I'm curious about,

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.080
does it not just open the
creative thinking process,

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.680
this novel configuration process?

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.190
But does it also,

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:19.070
lend itself to the
implementation of creative works?

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:21.270
And the answer is, no.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.850
In most cases it has nothing to do

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.640
with creative implementation.

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.240
Now, I think that, there may come a time

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.550
and certainly there are clinical trials

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:31.620
that are happening now,

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.960
where psychedelics are leveraged

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.960
toward particular clinical goals.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.390
And I wanna tip my hat

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:38.980
to the work at Johns Hopkins
that's happening now,

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.423
which really lends itself,

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:43.497
to the idea that early preliminary data

00:56:43.497 --> 00:56:44.570
and some of the papers

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:46.530
that are coming out
they're really fantastic.

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:50.540
Showing that there may
be some excellent roles

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.210
for certain psychedelics in
certain clinical context.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:56.850
These are clinical studies done
with a psychiatrist present,

00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:58.440
that is authorized to do that.

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:01.040
That can help people through
depression, trauma, et cetera.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.910
And we're gonna spend a lot

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.320
of time talking about
that, including with some

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.410
of those folks running those studies.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:07.920
So we can look forward to that.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.050
So all of this is to say that,

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:13.430
no I don't take psychedelics
to access creative states.

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:17.600
That's not where I think the
major role, the important role

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.770
of psychedelics might show up
if it's going to for humanity.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.510
I think that it may have
these important roles

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:24.810
in the clinical context.

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.420
Provided it's done legally and safely.

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.955
I think that,

00:57:28.955 --> 00:57:33.220
the creative process being a
two-stage process means that,

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.940
I am personally best served

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:39.480
by having this period of
non-linear exploration of concepts.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.690
Whatever it is I happen to be
working on in the afternoon.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:45.000
But then I'll actually shelve that work.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.170
I'll just set it aside and then
I'll revisit it the next day

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:49.490
or even the next day,

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:53.560
to see whether or not that
the work itself is ready

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.590
for deliberate linear implementation

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:56.670
which I would wanna do during one

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.530
of these highly focused states.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:01.660
So, the long and short way
of saying this is that,

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.660
when we're very alert, do
linear type of operations.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.390
When we tend to be more
sleepy and more relaxed,

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:11.160
that's when creative works
can first be conceived,

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.460
but their implementation requires
high levels of alertness.

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.350
Now, that gets us more

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.350
to the kind of late afternoon evening.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.410
Now I am, as I mentioned before,

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:26.120
I'm a proponent of getting
sunlight in the evening as well.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.460
This is a critical thing that
I have not mentioned before.

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.180
Here's how it works.

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.560
Many people now have heard
me say getting light early

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.930
in the day is important.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.720
But that will advance one's clock.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.560
It'll make you wanna get
up earlier the next day.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.050
By getting light in the evening

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:44.640
it accomplishes two things for me.

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.430
First of all, it makes sure
that I don't get up too early

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.450
that I'm not waking up at
3:00 or 4:00 in the morning

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:52.160
because it's going to shift my clock.

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.900
It's going to delay it a little bit.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.910
And so this is really important.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:59.830
If you want to keep your
schedule on a normal routine,

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:02.350
on a regular 24 hour cycle

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:03.870
and not have your circadian rhythms

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:05.980
of sleep and wakefulness
drifting all over the place

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.300
and you want some predictability

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.800
to how your mind is going to work

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.070
in order to optimize
learning and performance.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:13.330
Well, then you need to get
morning light any evening light.

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.170
The morning light is
going to advance my clock.

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:16.910
Make my system wanna get up earlier.

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:18.450
And the evening light is going

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:20.680
to delay my clock a little
bit so that on average

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.120
it kind of bookends my
circadian mechanisms.

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.300
And I'll basically wanna go to sleep

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.980
at more or less the same
time each night and wake up,

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.230
more or less at the
same time each morning.

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:31.440
That's how it works.

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.040
And that's a hard wired mechanism.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.540
That's not some subjective
thing that I tell myself.

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.750
That's a hardwired mechanism.

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.140
So, that gets us to the evening.

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.080
And generally in the
evening I'll get that light

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.070
by going outside

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:45.010
or sometimes I'll do it

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:47.140
by turning up artificial lights brightly,

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:49.020
and then I'll start to
dim them for the evening

00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.580
'cause as I've mentioned many times before

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.190
and I'm not gonna belabor the point.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.410
You wanna minimize your light exposure,

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.330
especially overhead bright light exposure,

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.610
regardless of whether or
not it's blue light or not.

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:01.140
In the evening from about
10:00 PM to 4:00 AM.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.380
Some of you asked,

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.600
wait I thought it was 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.870
Well, it is, but 10:00 PM
to 4:00 AM is even better.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:12.000
It's just that when I originally
said 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.280
people were like that it's impossible

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.630
for most people to adhere to.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:16.640
So for me, it screens off,

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.070
it's dim lights, and that's
what favors falling asleep

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:23.220
in a good night's sleep for me.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.690
Since we were talking about food earlier,

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.220
I'll just revisit a little
bit of what I said before.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.820
My evening meal tends to be
more carbohydrate rich more.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.030
If I have proteins,
there'll be like eggs, fish

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.630
or chicken or something of
that sort or no protein.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.790
And I eat high carbohydrates.

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.155
So I'm not one of these people that's keto

01:00:40.155 --> 01:00:43.170
or high meat only, or anything like that.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.080
Remember, fasting and low carbohydrate,

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.560
states facilitate alertness.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.480
Carbohydrate rich foods,
facilitate calmness and sleepiness.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.520
They'd stimulate the release

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.180
of tryptophan and the transition to sleep.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.590
So that's why I do them late in the day.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:59.340
Also, if you've exercised
early in the day,

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.110
especially if it's weight bearing exercise

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.710
or everything's weight bearing exercises.

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:04.965
I suppose unless you're an astronaut.

01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:05.798
And you're in space.

01:01:05.798 --> 01:01:08.450
But if you're early in the
day, exercising with weights

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.382
or you're doing a long run,

01:01:10.382 --> 01:01:12.800
sooner or later, you need
to replenish glycogen.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.940
And, I realized

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.730
that the ketonisters
out there are gonna say,

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:18.420
well, you know,
gluconeogenesis will allow you

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.250
to replenish glycogen, et cetera.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:24.180
I'm just gonna call out the lie right now,

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.410
because I feel like doing it.

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.870
And 'cause I think it
just hasn't been stated.

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:31.620
Which is that, not everybody, but a lot

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.060
of the people that are proponents

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:36.840
of high meat keto diets, fine.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.360
That's fine if that's what they wanna do.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.010
And as you recall, I do
relatively ketogenic diet

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:46.120
during the day, for alertness or fasting.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.320
But a lot of those people,

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.370
can replenish glycogen really well

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.450
without ingesting carbohydrates,
so-called gluconeogenesis

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:55.610
and enhance protein synthesis.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:57.583
Because they are hormone enhanced.

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:00.870
I've been around a while.

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:01.990
I know what this looks like.

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:03.390
They're either thyroid enhanced

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:06.170
or hormone enhanced and I
don't pass any judgment.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:08.690
But when you look at
people who look amazing

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.570
on keto and are able to have a lot

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:13.680
of energy and replenish
their glycogen on keto,

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.460
they are in many cases, not all,

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.360
but in many cases
they're hormone enhanced.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.430
They're taking exogenous hormones,

01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:25.350
that allow them to synthesize,

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.390
and repair muscle in ways that people

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.560
who aren't taking those
exogenous hormones can't.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.500
This is not just true
of the men by the way.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.800
This is also true of the women.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.850
And this is a whole discussion

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.090
into itself probably not directly related

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.710
to this month of the podcast.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.930
So, I don't mind that people do this,

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.110
but one problem

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:45.090
is when people are following
ketogenic diets all the way

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:46.380
through to sleep and they have trouble

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.810
with sleep or they're doing long bouts

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:49.833
of fasting and they're having
trouble falling asleep.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:50.830
That makes sense.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.930
It's because their
autonomic arousal is tilted

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.890
towards epinephrine release,

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:57.230
norepinephrine release,
and dopamine release.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:58.250
So they have a lot of energy

01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.650
but they have a hard time calming down

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.460
and getting into deep sleep.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.230
I tend to achieve that
state using carbohydrates

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:06.390
and it also replenishes glycogen.

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:09.000
So again, you know, I'm not
trying to draw any fire,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.560
but if I do, I'd be happy
to have a conversation,

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.000
about all that.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.053
Again, no judgment, but I think

01:03:15.053 --> 01:03:17.720
that most people out there are not aware

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.440
of some of the other variables.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.790
Remember, good science is
about isolating variables.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:24.680
And so oftentimes what we're
seeing in social media,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.050
is we're getting
presented single variables

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:28.600
and we're not seeing the full context

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.160
of the other variables
that are being manipulated.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.710
So, I eat pasta and rice

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.380
and vegetables and things
like that in the evening.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.170
Also, I just find, maybe I'm becoming one

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:40.000
of the last people that does that.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:40.833
Although I hope not.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:42.930
I hope there are others out there like me.

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:46.130
From all the literature speaks to the fact

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:48.060
that carbohydrates not only do that,

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.100
but they also help maintain,

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.090
healthy thyroid function, et cetera.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:52.170
So that's my bias.

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.003
That's what I do.

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:55.790
I do avoid caffeine and
whatnot in the evening.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.720
I do take supplements and I'll be happy

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.350
at some point to put out the complete list

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.980
of supplements that I take out there.

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.200
But in general, these are
the core things that I do.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.769
And they relate to a lot of the questions

01:04:06.769 --> 01:04:09.230
that you've been asking over time.

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:12.020
The next piece of scientific
data that I'm gonna describe

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.560
is a very important
piece of scientific data,

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.820
for sake of understanding
how to optimize your brain

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:17.940
and access sleep.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.270
It also can help avoid
a lot of anxiety issues.

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:26.290
And these relate to data from
Charles Czeisler, doctor.

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:29.370
He's an MD Charles Czeisler's
lab at Harvard Medical School.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.460
He's run a sleep lab out
of Harvard Medical School.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.150
For a long time now it
has very impressive work.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:37.890
And what he's shown is
that the peak output,

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:40.540
of the circadian clock for wakefulness,

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.650
in other words the peak
of our wakefulness,

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.960
and the suppression of the sleep signal,

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.150
actually happens very late in the day.

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:52.400
So we have this trough of activity

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.500
and body temperatures
lowest right before waking.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.770
Then as we wake up our
body temperature goes up

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:58.650
and into the afternoon

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:01.560
it continues to go up
and then it tends to fall

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.990
in the evening and towards bedtime.

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:08.790
But there's a brief blip,
of release of peptides

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:13.070
and other substances from the
sleep centers in the brain,

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:14.610
and the suprachiasmatic nucleus

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.570
that the sleep center
is this preoptic area,

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:19.130
that if you wanna look that up.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.560
This preoptic area not far
from the circadian clock

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.120
that signals the peak of alertness

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.000
and wakefulness about
an hour, before bedtime.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.380
And he say, whoa, that's really weird.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.910
But a lot of people get into bed.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:32.720
They're ready to go to sleep
and they're wide awake.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.300
And they think this is an unnatural thing

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.300
or there's something wrong with them.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.820
And actually it's not.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.370
This it's believed,

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.940
I don't know, again, I wasn't
consulted at the design phase.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.350
But it's believed, is a
signal that is helpful

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.370
to human beings to start
gathering up resources

01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:51.760
and securing themselves

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.730
for a night's sleep
during which we, you know,

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:55.910
historically were very
vulnerable to attack

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.930
from other humans and
from animals and so forth.

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:02.180
And so that desire to run
around and clean the kitchen

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.180
or organize things, or
just a general feeling

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.910
of internal anxiety, late in the evening,

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:09.990
that's a natural blip
that naturally passes

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:12.400
after about 45 to 60 minutes.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.290
Now that's often the time
when people start stressing

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:17.160
about the fact that they have
something to do the next day

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.487
and they worry about
not being able to sleep

01:06:18.487 --> 01:06:20.850
and it can cascade into
a whole set of things.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:24.740
So another thing that I do
throughout my day is I know

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.280
that early day I'm gonna be alert,

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.920
afternoon I'm gonna be kinda sleepy.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.160
And then as the evening comes around,

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.540
in addition to doing all
the other things I'm doing,

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:37.290
I anticipate, a peak in
alertness in activity.

01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:38.880
And I don't worry about it.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.120
I use that perhaps to get
organized for the next day

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.030
but basically, I just go through,

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.290
if I'm gonna do anything, it's
gonna be very mundane task

01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:48.580
like cleaning or things that
require almost zero effort.

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.730
And that probably speaks to
my cleaning abilities too.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:52.960
But, the fact

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.730
of the matter is we don't
just go drift off into sleep.

01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:58.720
There's this blip of
alertness right before sleep

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.390
that I hope just cognitively knowing

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:02.420
about will be helpful to people.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.030
And that raises, yet another theme

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.330
that I think is going
to be very important.

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:11.580
Which is, physiological mechanisms.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.790
Like these changes in alertness.

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:15.480
Or using breathing tools.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.310
Something we'll talk
about in future episodes

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:20.500
to shift our levels of autonomic arousal.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.280
Those are concrete, biological phenomenon.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.570
So is fasting.

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:27.050
Fasting will increase alertness that way.

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.320
So is caffeine.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.550
Not everybody's susceptible

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.300
to caffeine to the same degree of others

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.400
But, it's a physiological mechanisms.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.250
We know the receptors.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.800
We know the ligands as they're called

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.210
which bind to the receptors.

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:38.410
We know the mechanisms.

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.950
They involve cortisol and epinephrine.

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:42.180
Those are the sorts of things

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.430
that I personally try and leverage,

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:47.360
toward my learning and
optimization of my brain,

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.870
and my activity.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:51.610
Doing physical activity early
in the day for instance,

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.670
tends to give us a longer duration,

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:54.520
wake up signal,

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.200
intends to accelerate
waking up early in the day.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.370
That's why working out late
in the day can sometimes

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:01.790
cause people to have
trouble falling asleep.

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.000
It will also phase delay.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.500
You make it so that you wanna
wake up later the next day.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.550
It's not just 'cause you're tired.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.730
It's 'cause you shifted your clock

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:09.230
with activity and temperature.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:14.250
Many people ask me about
subjective tools for plasticity.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:16.530
What about visualization?

01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:19.750
Can we just imagine doing
a particular activity,

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:23.530
will that help us get
better at that activity?

01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:24.440
There's some evidence

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.983
that visualization can do that, it's true.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.270
But here's the important distinction.

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.410
And here's why I personally,

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:33.940
don't do much, deliberate visualization.

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:37.860
First of all, I get my best ability,

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.160
or achieve my best ability
to visualize things when I'm

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.570
in kind of a sleepy state.

01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:42.403
I don't know why

01:08:42.403 --> 01:08:44.910
but that's when I'm
able to, direct my brain

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:47.550
towards internal visualization
with my eyes closed.

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:49.090
And generally I fall asleep

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:50.090
and I can't remember anything

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:51.720
that I was thinking about before.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.880
Some people, and these are work
that was done many years ago

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.910
by Roger Shephard and by others.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:58.530
Roger was at Stanford but

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:00.720
and other labs have done
this too, of course,

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.700
of rotating objects
physically in their mind,

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.220
as a way of improving
or looking at the speed

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.763
of spatial calculations and so forth.

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:14.030
Some people are very
good at visualization.

01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:16.030
They can close their eyes
and they can just see objects

01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:17.950
and rotate them deliberately, et cetera.

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:21.540
A lot of people like me,
when we start doing that,

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.490
our mind drifts too easily.

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.970
But I like to think I'm a
reasonably focused person

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:28.630
in the waking state.

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:31.660
So, visualization it's interesting

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.180
'cause I think people are
very attracted to the idea,

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.013
that they can just think

01:09:35.013 --> 01:09:37.110
about something and then
get better at it that way.

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:41.100
And it's probably true,
if you can be very linear

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.680
in the way that you visualize things.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.513
So I wanna repeat that.

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:47.070
I think visualization
does have certain power.

01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:49.120
If you can remain very linear

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.470
and deliberate and focused,
in the visualization.

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.230
But many people like
myself who are challenged,

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:59.360
with maintaining that linear
focus with eyes closed,

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.110
and in visualization,

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:03.490
they don't get much out of visualization.

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:06.560
And I think the data on
performance really supports that.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.030
Now there are examples where for instance,

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:10.530
people will injure one limb

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:13.790
and then they will
exercise the intact limb,

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:15.630
or the non-injured limb rather.

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:17.770
And they will visualize the opposite limb.

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:19.660
Sometimes there's even
the use of mirror boxes.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.030
So that let's say my left limb is injured.

01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:25.150
I'm maintaining activity
with my right limb

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:26.240
but I'm using a mirror box

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.530
so it looks like my left
limb is working well.

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.800
Yes, there's some top-down

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.710
or feedback mechanisms,
that support the idea that

01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:37.010
the injured limb can rehabilitate
more quickly, et cetera.

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:39.883
But, those are fairly elaborate schemes.

01:10:40.797 --> 01:10:42.550
I don't want a mirror
boxes around my house.

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:45.920
I think these are
specialized circumstances.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.940
They're a little bit like
the examples that we see

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.300
in the news where, oh,
so-and-so has a stroke

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.593
and then spontaneously
speaks a new language.

01:10:55.134 --> 01:10:57.540
I don't know what the answer to that is.

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.230
It shows that the brain
has associative networks

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:03.010
that are typically suppressed
and those can be unleashed.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.260
But you certainly don't wanna go out

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.860
and give yourself a
stroke deliberately to try

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.990
and unmask some skill,

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:11.910
because there's no concrete
way to go about that

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.200
in a way that you could really know

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.060
that you were gonna offset

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.410
the detrimental effects of the stroke.

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.350
In fact, I think it'd be a terrible idea.

01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:22.370
So I think what I'm trying
to describe is how a typical,

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:24.360
I don't know if I'm typical or normal.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.080
I mean, I've been told otherwise,
and certainly not normal.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.930
But in terms of the way
that I structure my day,

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:32.690
I think that's normal.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:33.700
That's pretty normal.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.830
I tend to wake up right
around, I don't know,

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:38.050
somewhere between 5:30 and 7:00 AM,

01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:39.530
depending on what I've been
doing the night before.

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:41.800
I tend to go to sleep
somewhere around 10:30, 11:00.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.080
I tend to have one bout

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.930
in the morning where I can
do really focused hard work

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:48.970
and I can really activate the go pathway

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:51.290
while also activating the no-go pathway

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:52.720
so that I can really stay focused.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.170
But I rely on some tools.

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:55.003
I have a period

01:11:55.003 --> 01:11:57.200
in the afternoon where I get
sleepy and kinda out of it

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.550
like I think most people.

01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:02.670
And I tend to come out of that
recognizing the opportunity

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:05.320
of that slightly sleepy
state for creative work

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.950
and for thinking about
things in novel ways.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.750
I get light a couple of times a day.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:11.250
I eat low carb during the day,

01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:13.410
and I don't say high, but you know,

01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:17.700
higher carbs I eat
starches, in the evening.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.210
So in a way I can sleep.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.950
And then, I really anticipate

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:24.730
that late afternoon peak and alertness.

01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:27.310
Excuse me, late night peak and alertness

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.480
that many people confuse for insomnia

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.780
or challenges when actually
they're really quite normal

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.630
in their circadian cycle.

01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:37.930
And then I fall asleep.

01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:39.750
And if all goes well,

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.060
I stay asleep for four or five hours.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.330
Typically it's three or
four and then I wake up.

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:45.940
I think I'm like most people I wake up

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.180
during the middle of the night.

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.540
Now, one thing that I don't
think has been discussed a lot

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.980
but one of my colleagues

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.260
at the Stanford sleep
lab tells me is that,

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.150
every hour and a half
or so, we all wake up.

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:58.330
Some of you even look
around, believe it or not

01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.860
and go right back to sleep.

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.210
And you don't recognize it.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.200
Waking up periodically
during sleep is the norm.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.250
It is not abnormal.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.083
I don't know

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:08.400
why this hasn't been
discussed more prominently.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.100
I tend to wake up and if
there's a bright light coming

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.230
through the blinds, or if
there's some noise upstairs,

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:16.290
if Costello's snoring particularly loud,

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:19.510
I might get up, I might,
go use the restroom.

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:21.970
I might, you know,

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:24.170
pick up a book and read
under low light or something

01:13:24.170 --> 01:13:27.090
and then I generally fall
back asleep and wake up,

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.690
typical time for me again,
5:30 or 7:00 AM in the morning.

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.650
This waking up in the
middle of the night thing

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:33.710
as I mentioned at the beginning

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:37.080
of the podcast episode today,
is not necessarily abnormal.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.320
What it probably reflects,

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.230
is that the real time meaning,
the time that I should go

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:45.270
to sleep is probably
closer to eight o'clock.

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.600
The word midnight was literally
supposed to mean mid night.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.230
We, many meaning all
of us were meant to go

01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:54.130
to sleep and wake up
with the rise, you know,

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.400
with the setting and rising of the sun.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.400
And we know this because
this beautiful study

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.670
from University of Colorado,
where they took people out

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:05.270
into the wilderness to reset
their circadian clocks,

01:14:07.597 --> 01:14:09.553
measured by way of melatonin and cortisol.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.790
They were completely out
of whack from interacting

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:14.430
with screens and staying
up too late, et cetera.

01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:16.820
And they basically had
them view the sunrise

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.780
and view the sunset each
evening and almost all of them

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.160
not all of those
students, but all of them,

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.390
got onto a schedule where
they naturally wanted

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:27.620
to go to sleep at sunset
and wake up around sunrise

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.020
or just before sunrise, even
when they were brought back

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:33.120
into a normal artificial light setting.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.750
So I think that's the natural pattern

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.210
and we've just deviated from
it with artificial lights.

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:40.570
So waking up at 3:00 AM or 4:00
AM doesn't necessarily mean

01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:43.286
that there's something
screwed up about you.

01:14:43.286 --> 01:14:47.370
Or that you have anxiety or
something, although you might.

01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:48.500
What it likely means is

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.300
that you were supposed to
go to bed much earlier.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.770
And because of this asymmetry

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:54.440
in the autonomic nervous
system where it's much easier

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.760
for us to push, and to
delay our sleep time

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.083
than it is to accelerate our wake-up time.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:03.070
In other words, it's easier to stay up

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.350
and hang out at the party even

01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:06.290
if you don't wanna be
there than it is to wake up

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.390
when you're exhausted and your fast sleep.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:12.950
Most people are pushing
through, into the late hours

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:14.030
of the evening and night and going

01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:16.630
to bed much later than they
naturally would want to.

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:19.410
And so I personally don't
want to go to bed at 8:00 PM.

01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:24.220
A lot of good things happen
between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.920
And so, I wanna enjoy those.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.390
And I push through the evening hours.

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:31.210
But as a consequence, I'm
running out of melatonin.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:34.160
My melatonin release is basically subsided

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.240
by about 3:00 or 4:00 AM

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.300
and so it makes sense
that I would wake up.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.230
I don't take melatonin
for reasons discussed

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:41.170
in previous episodes.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:44.230
I do rely on things
like magnesium glycinate

01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:47.178
or magnesium threonate,
things like theanine.

01:15:47.178 --> 01:15:48.900
I'm not saying any of
you need to take those.

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.210
That's just what I happened to take

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:51.740
in order to facilitate my sleep.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.793
And it's been of great benefit to me.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.190
If I wake up in the middle of the night

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:59.060
and I'm anxious for whatever
reason or my mind is looping,

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.360
I have a couple of rules.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.930
One is, I don't trust
anything I think about.

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:05.890
When I wake up in the middle
of the night, any of it.

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:07.300
Unless I've had a magnificent dream

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.350
and I wanna write it down,

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.960
I'll do that every once in a while.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.270
Typically when I go back and read it,

01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:13.183
it's not at all magnificent.

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.230
I can't ever remember coming up

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.330
with anything really fantastic in one

01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:22.040
of my dreams that stuck with
me, or that I implemented.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.100
I don't really trust the
kind of thinking that happens

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.100
in those wee hours of the
circadian cycle for me.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.450
There's just nothing either
for me terribly creative,

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:33.460
or worth linear
implementation at that time.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.530
But, one thing that has been very helpful

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:36.860
is to sometimes do one

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.010
of these non sleep deep rest protocols

01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:41.010
as a way to go back into sleep.

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:43.770
So a hypnosis app or some

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.340
of the scripts by Michael Sealey
that I've mentioned before,

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:50.440
or the Reveri Health, or
a yoga nidra protocol.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.500
Those for me have been very
useful at helping me turn off,

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.410
kinda looping thinking in
the middle of the night

01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:58.370
and fall back asleep.

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:01.190
In reviewing my schedule for you,

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:04.070
just as a context for how
to implement certain types

01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:06.670
of tools for optimizing learning.

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.470
Realize that, it gives the impression

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:10.410
that there's a 90 minute bout of learning

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:13.000
and work in the morning
and then a 90 minute bout

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.720
of creative type work in
the afternoon and that's it.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.450
There are a lot of hours
in between of course,

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.190
and I just wanna be very clear.

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:23.000
Those hours for me are occupied
by pretty not mundane tasks

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.890
but things that are kinda random.

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:29.030
Those are things like email
or attending to Zoom meetings

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.740
or meeting with colleagues and students

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.283
and things of that sort.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.160
I sometimes will read just
for sake of my own enrichment.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.010
I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:40.950
because those are the two 90 minute bouts

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:43.610
where I'm trying to expand on,

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:46.030
the mental capacities that I already have.

01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:47.670
They're to really where
I'm trying to stretch

01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:51.090
and grow what I'm able to do
on a regular basis reflexively.

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:54.030
So I wanna emphasize that the
whole day doesn't just consist

01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:56.120
of those two 90 minute bouts.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.460
That's not the way my schedule works

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.160
and that's not the way
my lifestyle is arranged.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:17:59.993
Which is fortunate

01:17:59.993 --> 01:18:01.690
'cause I enjoy all those
other things as well.

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.470
And so for many of you out there who are

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:06.300
in school or have family
demands or other demands,

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:09.730
the key is to slot in those
brain optimization segments

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:13.320
of about 90 minutes, one or
two, or maybe more per day.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.480
You're trying to slot those

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.500
in wherever you can amidst to your other,

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.900
obligations and things
that you need to do.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.480
But, you wanna do that
in an intelligent way

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.390
that's anchored to your biology.

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:25.840
And then you wanna do a number of things

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.920
which I've talked about today,

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.890
in order to optimize those sessions

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:30.290
to get the most out of them.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.260
So as we round up, I acknowledged

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:37.120
that once again I've covered
a huge range of topics,

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.670
related to how to optimize learning,

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:43.880
and brain change, and
essentially mental performance.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.600
And I've set that in the context,

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.100
of some biological mechanism

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.370
like the basal ganglia,
go, no-go pathways,

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.820
the circadian autonomic system,

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.970
and some of the relationship
between food and fasting

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:59.113
and particular types of food
in alertness or sleepiness.

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:03.900
Linear focus and strategy
implementation is best served

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.510
by high alert states,
although not too alert,

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:07.940
and how creative states,

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.910
at least the first phase of creativity,

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:12.250
which is the creative arrangement,

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:14.240
kind of brainstorming stage

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.390
is supported by states
of kind of relaxation

01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:18.760
or even slightly sleepy.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.190
But the creative
implementation is a very linear

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:22.860
and focused and deliberate process,

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:26.870
much like the highly focused
state, that I described.

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.780
I described how I do these things so just

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.930
to give you a context.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.300
A lot of you asked for, you know,

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.450
what I do in order to
set it within a context.

01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:35.460
But by no means are these rigid times

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:36.690
and ways of doing things.

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.120
But, I think it's fair to say that,

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.670
what I do has a circadian logic.

01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:44.873
It also has grounding
in biological mechanisms

01:19:44.873 --> 01:19:46.740
that are very concrete.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.480
That we know the cells and mechanisms

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.780
and neuro-transmitters.

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.613
And then some

01:19:50.613 --> 01:19:53.480
of them are a little
bit headed out into the,

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:57.520
what we would call, kind
of emerging, or, you know,

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.810
I don't wanna say cutting
edge, but maybe front edge

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:01.380
of what neuroscience is
starting to understand

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.260
about creativity and so forth.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:05.640
Those are areas that are just now,

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.780
coming to some clarity.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.361
And there is certainly is
still a lot more work to do.

01:20:10.361 --> 01:20:12.930
There are a lot of different
ways to arrange one's routine.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:15.840
But hopefully, the tools
and practices I described,

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.840
will be useful to you.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.310
I wanna mention that a lot

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:23.460
of people ask me about
specific tools and practices.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.870
They asked me of Wim Hof
Breathing, about ice baths.

01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:27.040
Have talked a little bit

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.470
about ice baths before I
think in cold exposure.

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:32.260
About binaural beats and
things of those sorts.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:35.480
I think the way to look at any tool,

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.010
to modulate or measure the nervous system,

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:42.010
is ask whether or not it's
going to move you up or down,

01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:43.810
the state of autonomic arousal.

01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:44.990
Whether or not it's gonna
can make you more alert

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:46.230
or more calm.

01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:47.790
More focused or less focused.

01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:49.620
That's kind of the two axes here

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.410
that we need to think about.

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:53.270
Sometimes you wanna be
more alert than you are.

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:56.350
And indeed, things like
cold showers, ice baths,

01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:58.230
super oxygenation, Wim Hof type breathing,

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:00.440
will bring your level of alertness up.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.570
There's some cautionary notes
associated with each of those.

01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:03.403
You need to read

01:21:03.403 --> 01:21:05.530
and understand those
cautionary notes, for yourself.

01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:07.600
Everybody's different and some

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.170
of those carry certain dangers,
under certain conditions.

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:13.163
Others have huge margins for safety.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.230
An ice bath generally wakes you up.

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:20.300
A warmer, hot bath generally
calms you down, right?

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.350
Binaural beats, there aren't a lot

01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:24.370
of data and quality
peer-reviewed journals.

01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:26.160
I did put in the effort
to go search it out.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.000
There are a few.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.820
Binaural beats are
listening to frequencies

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:34.233
of sound that slightly differ
offset for the two ears.

01:21:35.230 --> 01:21:37.130
It has been shown, can shift the brain

01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:38.220
into particular states.

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.510
You'll notice today, I didn't really talk

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:42.760
about alpha or theta or gamma rhythms.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.220
I personally in reviewing the literature,

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.380
I don't think it's fair to say

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.120
that alpha states are great for X

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.680
and theta states are great for Y.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.980
And besides, most of us aren't walking

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.600
around our homes and our workplaces,

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.930
geared up to EEG machines

01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:56.290
or with wires down below our skull.

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:58.800
So we don't know when we're
in those states anyway.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.010
I think the subjective reading of whether

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:05.280
or not one is alert, or calm,

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.990
and whether or not that
alertness or calmness matches

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:10.550
the goal or that thing that
we're trying to achieve

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:12.793
in terms of learning, including sleep,

01:22:14.150 --> 01:22:15.780
is the most valuable,

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.250
internal tool and recognition
that we can all have.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:20.080
In other words, if I want to be very alert

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.230
and I need to be very
alert and I'm exhausted,

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:24.490
there might be tools that
I should use to wake up.

01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:25.323
It might also speak to the fact

01:22:25.323 --> 01:22:26.720
that I might not have slept

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.290
as well as I could have or
should have the night before.

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:31.080
So it's really about a match

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.870
between where we are on
that autonomic arousal scale

01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:36.350
and what we're trying to achieve.

01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:37.980
And indeed, there are gonna be a lot

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.770
of tools including supplements
and other prescription drugs

01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:41.770
and things that can help,

01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:44.740
move us along that autonomic continuum,

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.650
up toward more alertness
or toward more calmness.

01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:50.720
But ultimately it's about
tailoring that alertness

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.070
and calmness to the
specific types of learning

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:56.000
and activities that you are
going to do and perform.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.070
And, it's reciprocal.

01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:59.570
Meaning some of those activities

01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:02.260
like exercise early in the
day will increase your level

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.490
of autonomic arousal and alertness.

01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:07.340
Certain foods, will tend to wake you up.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.400
Certain foods will tend
to make you more sleepy

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.790
and the volume of food

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:12.980
and the timing of food is a factor also.

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.750
So it's a huge parameter space.

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:16.260
It's a huge set of variables,

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:18.180
that impacts whether or
not we're feeling well,

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.970
performing well, learning
great, or not learning great.

01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:24.160
And the key thing is
to become an observer,

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.560
of your own system and what works for you.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.280
And, to recognize that there are two bins

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.190
of tools for optimizing,
learning and brain performance.

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:35.440
One, are tools that are really anchored

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.760
in biological mechanism

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.630
and we are certain of what those are.

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:39.640
I've talked about some of those.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.170
The other, the more subjective tools,

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:45.110
for some of you visualization,
might work terrifically well.

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:47.610
For some of you, one song
might really wake you up

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:49.710
because of the associations
you have with it.

01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:51.390
And for me, I might just, you know,

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:53.330
it might repel me from the room.

01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:56.000
'Cause I don't like it or
it might put me to sleep.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:56.833
But of course,

01:23:56.833 --> 01:23:58.800
volume is kind of a universal.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.370
Loud music tends to wake people up.

01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:03.440
Soft music, doesn't tend to
wake them up quite as much.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.120
So, part of today is really
getting you to think about,

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.650
in a scientific way, in a structured way,

01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:13.590
about the non-negotiable elements

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:15.360
which are that you're
going to have a period

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.660
of every 24 hour cycle when
you tend to be more awake,

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:19.330
and a period when you
tend to be more asleep.

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:20.610
And how to leverage those

01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:23.040
so you're not fighting an
uphill battle to wake up

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.063
when you actually,

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.450
would want to be in and should be sleepy

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:31.940
and not trying to go to
sleep when you are naturally,

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:33.010
going to be most awake.

01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:34.700
So a lot of it is really anchors back

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.630
to those core mechanisms of biology,

01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:38.720
and then you start layering
on the different protocols

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.920
of food and supplementation, et cetera.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.670
And I think it's important
to recognize that some people

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:46.923
are just more go and no-go.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.210
And some people,

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:51.300
are just calmer and have
a harder time getting

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.830
into action in an activity.

01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:54.360
It's just the way that we're wired.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.060
Some of us have autonomic nervous systems

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.370
that are more geared towards
parasympathetic, calm states.

01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:02.550
One of the reasons I love
bulldogs, not just my bulldog,

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:04.500
is that they are very calm animals.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.970
In fact, they make no
spontaneous movements

01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:09.010
unless there's something to respond to.

01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:11.190
And I find that incredibly relaxing.

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.730
Other animals like pit bulls,

01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:14.330
who I also really like and enjoy

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:16.310
and other species, their
tail is always wagging.

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:18.650
And that they're always in a
position to make a movement

01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:20.720
at any any second 'cause they tend to ride

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.010
at pretty high levels
of autonomic arousal.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:24.640
They pop up really quickly.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.500
When you say it's time to go for a walk,

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.020
Costello does it one limb at a time.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.940
And sometimes he just goes back to sleep.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.320
And so, that there are
people like that too.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.020
And so you have to know where you are

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.563
and what particular goals
you're trying to pursue.

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.320
As a final closure to this,

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.300
I wanna emphasize that today as always,

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.060
I've strived to be accurate.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.160
I'm sure if I made mistakes,

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.210
some of you will point
out and I appreciate that.

01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.260
And I'll post a correction,

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:56.253
if we agree that I indeed
misspoke, or misguided something.

01:25:57.150 --> 01:25:59.940
But, by no means was I exhaustive.

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.510
I mean, I might've exhausted some of you

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:03.730
but the information wasn't exhaustive.

01:26:03.730 --> 01:26:05.130
Meaning, there's no way

01:26:05.130 --> 01:26:07.400
that I could cover all the ways in which,

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.060
we optimize or can optimize
learning and performance.

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:14.120
I think we've touched on a
number of them that I hope,

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.150
that you'll find value in

01:26:15.150 --> 01:26:17.333
and that you'll explore in your own lives.

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:19.930
We are continuing with this theme

01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.830
because that's what we
do, for this podcast.

01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:24.060
We stay on one theme for an entire month.

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.320
For the next episode,

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.350
we're going to explore two,

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:30.710
very essential aspects of neuroplasticity.

01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:32.250
That actually relate to learning.

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:37.250
Which are pain, pain management,
and neural regeneration.

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:39.660
And for those of you that,

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:42.730
don't have injuries or don't
suffer from chronic pain,

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:45.500
the discussion is still gonna
be a very important one.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.830
Because it's not just going to be

01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:48.470
about pain that you're
trying to get rid of.

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.550
It's also going to be about how
certain sensory experiences,

01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:55.110
within the pain network,
can become amplified,

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.640
as well as how we can
use top-down modulation.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:01.550
We can use our mind, to
suppress the pain response.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:02.430
We're also gonna talk about some

01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:04.210
of the hardwired mechanisms,

01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:05.350
that are bottom up,

01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:09.210
that exist in our periphery,
in our body to control pain.

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.740
And we're also gonna discuss,

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.320
a number of interesting interactions

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.070
between the pain system
and the learning system.

01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:19.240
So again if you're, not
interested in pain per se,

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.130
it still is going to be
a very valid conversation

01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:25.330
for sake of understanding how
to optimize brain performance.

01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:27.520
And neuro-regeneration goes hand in hand,

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.960
with that discussion.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.660
So I hope you'll join us for that.

01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:34.730
I suppose I'd be remiss
if I didn't mention that,

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:37.590
Costello has been snoring
extremely loudly today.

01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:39.790
He had a good long walk this morning

01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:41.770
which means up the
driveway down the driveway.

01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:42.900
He's an old dog.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.900
So if you've been hearing him

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:45.840
in the background and
it's been distracting,

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.860
now you know why.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.170
It probably relates to, where you were

01:27:49.170 --> 01:27:51.260
on your level of autonomic arousal.

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.093
And I'll leave it

01:27:52.093 --> 01:27:54.880
to you to answer that
question for yourself.

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.150
Many of you continue

01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:59.127
to graciously ask how you
can help support the podcast.

01:27:59.127 --> 01:28:01.420
And we really appreciate the question.

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.130
The best way is to subscribe

01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:05.270
wherever it is you happen
to be listening or watching.

01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:07.350
So for those of you that it's YouTube,

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:09.520
please subscribe to the YouTube channel.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.200
If it's Apple, subscribe
to the podcast on Apple

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.730
or if it's Spotify, subscribe there.

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:15.550
Maybe you've subscribed to all three.

01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:17.360
If you have comments and feedback for us,

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.980
suggestions for future podcast,
episodes or topics to cover,

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:24.430
please, place those in the
comment section on YouTube.

01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:26.060
Apple also provides a section

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.990
where you can give us a rating.

01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:29.620
We would love it if you
give us a five star rating

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:32.100
or whatever it is that
you feel that we deserve.

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:36.160
And in general, if you could
tell people about the podcast,

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.300
we hope that you would tell them

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:38.960
because you think the
information will be of use

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.960
to them of course.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.490
Tell your friends, tell your family,

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:44.980
tell your coworkers, because
as we expand the podcast,

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.540
the support for the podcast
just grows along with it.

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:49.590
So that's a terrific way to support us.

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.410
As always, check out our sponsors

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:53.290
which were mentioned at the beginning.

01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:54.840
And in addition to that,

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.370
we've now set up a Patreon account.

01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:57.950
Some of you asked specifically,

01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:59.430
how you can help support the podcast

01:28:59.430 --> 01:29:01.660
but you weren't
interested, in our sponsors

01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.940
or you were already
engaged with our sponsors.

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:05.660
So, we have a Patreon account.

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.630
You can find it at
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:13.510
Finally, in previous episodes today,

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.520
and in future episodes,
I mentioned supplements.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.640
Supplements are one way,
certainly not the only way,

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.310
but they're one way in
which we can modulate,

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:23.900
our nervous system,

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.860
for sake of better of
sleep, learning, alertness,

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.950
and several other things as well.

01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:30.380
If you're interested in supplements,

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.990
we've partnered with Thorne, T H O R N E,

01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:36.830
because Thorne supplements
have very high stringency

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.920
in terms of, what's in the bottle,

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.520
the amounts of the substances that are

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.210
in each capsule or pill, et cetera.

01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:45.790
And, they have partnered
with other groups such

01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:48.010
as the Mayo Clinic, all
the major sports teams.

01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:50.050
So there's very high rigor
associated with Thorne

01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:52.200
which is why we've decided
to partner with them.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.880
If you'd like to check
out Thorne supplements

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.560
and see the supplements that I take,

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.560
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:02.950
And you'll see a list of some

01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:04.700
of the supplements that I take.

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.200
As well, you'll get 20% off,

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.160
any of the supplements listed there,

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.020
as well as anywhere else
on the Thorne website.

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:16.020
So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:30:16.810 --> 01:30:19.950
for 20% off, any Thorne supplements.

01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:23.950
Last but not least, on
behalf of me and Costello,

01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:26.300
I wanna thank you for your
time and attention today.

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.825
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:32.408
