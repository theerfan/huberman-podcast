00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.020
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.763
for everyday life.

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:08.284
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.180
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.930
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.810
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.000
Today, we are going to
talk about the psychology

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.130
and the biology of desire,
love and attachment.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.630
Today happens to be Valentine's day, 2022.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.030
However, the themes we
are going to discuss

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.800
pertain to desire, love and
attachment on any given day.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.290
And indeed the mechanisms
we are going to discuss

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.130
almost certainly were at
play thousands of years ago,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.500
hundreds of years ago, and no
doubt will still be at play

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.420
in our minds, and in our
bodies, and in our psychologies

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.740
for the decades, centuries and
thousands of years to come.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.030
Indeed today, I want to
focus on core mechanisms

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.330
that lead individuals to
seek out other individuals

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.620
with whom to mate with,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.140
with whom to have children with or not,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.650
with whom to enter short

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.670
or long-term relationships with,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.220
and for perhaps to end those relationships

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.500
or to seek relationships on
the side, so-called infidelity.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.400
I'm certainly not going
to encourage or discourage

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.350
any of these behaviors.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.730
I'm simply going to cover the
peer-reviewed scientific data

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.870
on all these aspects of
desire, love, and attachment.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.300
I'm going to discuss how our
childhood attachment styles,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.780
as they're called, influence
our adult attachment styles.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.010
Yes, you heard that right.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.700
How we attached or did not
attach to primary caregivers

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.340
in our childhood has much
to do with how we attach

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.080
or fail to attach to
romantic partners as adults,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.950
because the same neural circuits,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.440
the neurons and their
connections in the brain and body

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.770
that underlie attachment
between infant and caregiver,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.400
between toddler and
parent or other caregiver,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.210
and during adolescence
and in our teenage years

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.110
are repurposed for adult
romantic attachments.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.270
I know that might be a
little eerie to think about,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.030
but indeed that is true.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.180
Now the fortunate thing is that
regardless of our childhood

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.840
attachment styles and
experiences, the neural circuits

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.350
for desire, love and
attachment are quite plastic.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.270
They are amenable to
change in response to both

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.600
what we think and what we
feel as well as what we do.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.080
However, all three aspects
that we're discussing today,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.090
desire, love and attachment

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.030
are also strongly biologically driven.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.550
We're going to talk about
biological mechanisms

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.110
such as hormones,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.360
biological mechanisms
such as neurochemicals,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.310
things like dopamine,
oxytocin and serotonin,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.910
and neural circuits, brain
areas, and indeed areas

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.930
of the body that interact
with the brain that control

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.180
whether or not we desire somebody or not,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.410
whether or not we lose
or increase our desire

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.010
for somebody over time,
whether or not we fall in love,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.000
what love means, and whether
or not the relationships

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.800
we form continue to include the elements

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.710
of desire and love over time or not.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.150
In order to illustrate just
how powerfully our biology

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.090
can shape our perception
of the attractiveness

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.490
of other people, I want to
share with you the results

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.910
of a couple of studies.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.290
Both studies explore

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.190
how people rate other
people's attractiveness.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.290
And in both studies, the
major variable is that women

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.870
are at different stages
of their menstrual cycle.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.480
Now in the first study, men
are rating the attractiveness

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.410
of women according to
the smell of those women.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.810
Now they're not smelling them directly.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.870
They're smelling clothing
that women wore for a couple

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.900
of days at different phases
of their menstrual cycle.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.310
And what they find is that men
will rate the odors of women

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.400
as most attractive if those women wore

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.800
those shirts, that clothing,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.810
in the pre-ovulatory phase
of their cycle, okay?

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.540
So this is not to say that men
do not find women attractive

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.801
at other stages of their cycle.

00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:53.470
It is to say that men find women's odors

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.540
particularly attractive, if
those odors were worn by women

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.720
that are in the pre-ovulatory phase

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.210
of their menstrual cycle, okay?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.850
Now, there was also a study
that was done where women

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.099
at different stages of
their menstrual cycle

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.970
are rating the odors of men.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.420
And a similar but mirror
symmetric result was found

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.290
such that women who are
in the pre-ovulatory phase

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.530
of their menstrual cycle
will rate men's odors

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.450
as more attractive than at
other stages of their cycle.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.810
So the simple way to put
this is that there seems

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.710
to be something special
about the pre-ovulatory phase

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.520
of a woman's menstrual cycle
that makes men rate them

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.260
as more attractive during
that time and women rate men

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.510
as more attractive during
that particular time as well.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.410
So this is a bidirectional effect.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.660
The way that the second study was done,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.460
where women are rating men was
not just to smell the odors

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.200
of those men on t-shirts, they did that,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.370
but they correlated
that with whether or not

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.690
the shirts were worn by men

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.660
that were particularly
physically symmetrical.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.670
They actually had these
men divided into groups.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.290
It was more of a continuum rather,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.550
rated according to body
symmetry and face symmetry.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.070
And women preferred more symmetrical men

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.810
when they were doing the preference test

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.440
during the pre-ovulatory
phase of their cycle.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.828
So again, the point is
that that pre-ovulatory

00:05:13.828 --> 00:05:16.010
phase of the cycle seems to create

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.410
a bidirectional mutual attractiveness.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.010
Now, also extremely
interesting is that this effect

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.240
does really seem to have
something to do with ovulation.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.440
Because in both studies,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.370
they had women that were taking
oral contraception or not.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.180
And what they found was
if a woman is taking

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.550
oral contraception, it prevented
that peak and perceived

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.430
attractiveness by the men,
meaning men no longer perceived

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.180
a woman to be more attractive

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.310
at a particular phase of their cycle.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.380
And also women taking oral
contraception no longer preferred

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.730
the odors of more symmetrical men

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.190
during the pre-ovulatory
phase of their cycle.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.170
Now, I want to make sure
that it's especially clear

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.430
that it is not the case that
oral contraception reduced

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.520
the perception of a woman as attractive,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.330
that did not happen in these studies.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.530
It reduced the further
increase in a male's perception

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.580
of her as attractive.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.230
And if women took oral contraception,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.120
it prevented them from
preferring more symmetrical men

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.150
based on the odors of those men.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.680
Now I realize there are
a lot of variables here.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.783
We've got odors, we've got symmetry,

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:26.240
we've got menstrual cycle,
pre-ovulatory, non pre-ovulatory.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.210
And we have whether or not people

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.710
are taking contraception or not.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.680
But the basic finding is that
depending on where women are

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.810
in their menstrual cycle,
influences both men's perception

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.450
of them as attractive and
their perception of men

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.390
as attractive and oral contraception
eliminates that effect.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.350
So I share with you those
data to illustrate that

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.500
we often think that somebody
is attractive or not based on,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.390
I don't know, how they look,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.530
their skin, their hair, et cetera,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.400
but it also illustrates that
their odor is a powerful cue

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.810
for some people more than others.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.030
Some of us tend to be more
factory driven than others.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.760
Although if you watched the
"Huberman Lab Podcast" episode

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.750
that I did with Professor David Buss

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.550
from the University of Texas, Austin,

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.380
who's a luminary in the field
of evolutionary psychology

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.010
and has studied mate choice

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.440
and mate selection bias over decades,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.950
he's really one of the
founders of that field,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.220
he emphasized findings
that odor for many people

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.290
is a maker or a deal breaker.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.560
Meaning, there are some people
that even if somebody has

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.170
all the characteristics that
they're looking for in terms

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.560
of kindness, and
attractiveness, and values,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.080
and other features that
would and should be

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.490
of very high priority in selecting a mate,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.330
that if someone does not like
the way that person smells,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.842
their innate body odor
independent of colognes,

00:07:45.842 --> 00:07:48.500
and perfumes, and soaps, et cetera,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.510
that that's often a complete
and total deal breaker.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.250
I'm sure there are some of
you that can relate to that.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.760
And there's some of you
perhaps for which that is

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.900
not the case, and you can't
even imagine that being

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.095
such a powerful variable.

00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:03.460
And yet the data suggested
indeed it is a powerful variable

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.880
for many people out there.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.350
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.130
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.430
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.027
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:17.800
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.870
In keeping with that theme,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.580
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.510
Our first sponsor is Thesis.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.840
Thesis makes custom nootropics.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.990
Now nootropics is not a word
that I'm usually a fan of,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.420
because nootropic means smart drug.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.582
And there are a lot of different aspects

00:08:32.582 --> 00:08:35.040
to being smart or to intelligence.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.440
There's the ability to focus.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.510
There's the ability to task switch.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.720
There's the ability to be creative.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.980
And each of those different
forms of intelligence

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.940
or expressions of intelligence involves

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.220
different brain circuits,
different neurochemicals,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.370
and indeed different hormones in the body.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.380
So I think it's rather naive to think that

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.850
there could be one
smart drug or nootropic.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.969
Thesis understands this.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:59.240
And so they've developed custom
nootropics that are tailored

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.210
to the specific goals that you might have

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.290
in terms of cognitive
work, or physical exercise,

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.060
or skill learning of any kind.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.460
And they tailor them to the individual.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.860
They only use the highest
quality ingredients,

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.050
many of which I've talked
about here on the podcast.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.300
Things like alpha GPC,
which I personally use,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.754
things like phosphatidylserine,

00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:19.010
which I also use on occasion.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.160
However, they've taken
different combinations

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.700
of those ingredients and
put them into different

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.360
formulations designed for
particular goals or endpoints.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.680
For instance, I have Thesis nootropics

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.930
that are for motivation,
others that are for clarity,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.070
for mental clarity, others
that I take pre-workout,

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.410
others that I take post-workout,
and so on and so forth.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.320
Now, in addition to that
Thesis understands that

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.210
not every ingredient is
terrific for everybody.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.710
In fact, one particular
substance that I've talked about

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.250
on the podcast, Ginkgo
biloba is very useful

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.170
for a lot of people.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.610
However, I don't tolerate it well.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.710
I get vicious headaches
from Ginkgo biloba.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.270
So none of the formulations
that they've made

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.550
for me include Ginkgo biloba.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.080
So again, these are custom
nootropics that are tailored

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.530
for your particular goals,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.510
and where the ingredients really match

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.670
your particular needs,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.420
and don't include things that
aren't going to work for you,

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.630
or that create things like headaches.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.040
So the personalization
and the targeted effects

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.230
of the nootropics is really
where or the power comes from.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.070
I've been using Thesis nootropics

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.450
for close to six months now.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.770
And I can confidently
say that their nootropics

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.750
have been a total game changer for me.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.160
My go-to formula is
the motivation formula.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.990
If I'm going to be
training, or working out,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.120
or I need extra energy,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.250
and I use the clarity formula nowadays

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.370
for any kind of writing or creative work.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.890
Those are the two that I've
mainly been taking lately.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.176
If you want to try your own personalized

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:41.990
nootropic starter kit, you can go online

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.680
to takethesis.com/huberman.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.960
You'll take a three minute
quiz and Thesis will send you

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.550
four different formulas to
try in your first month.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.800
You'll have the ability to
try those different blends

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.950
across that month,
discover which nootropics

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.390
work best for you, your unique
brain chemistry in genetics.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.170
You can have a consult with them,

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.140
and then they will give you
the best nootropics for you.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.630
Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.890
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.490
Now called AG1.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.890
I've been taking AG1 since 2012.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.170
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.610
The reason I started taking AG1

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.680
and the reason I still take
AG1 once or twice a day

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.100
is that it covers all of my
vitamin mineral probiotic needs.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.070
Probiotics are essential because
they support what's called

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.620
a healthy gut microbiome.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.920
The gut microbiome is
vital for things like

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.550
metabolism, hormone function,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.000
and also we now know our brain function,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.040
things like focus and memory
and our general immune system.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.170
With AG1, I get the probiotics I need,

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.790
I get the vitamins and
minerals that I need

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.220
to cover any nutritional gaps,
if I'm not eating optimally.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.950
And even if I am eating
optimally, AG1 can further support

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.680
metabolism, hormone function, et cetera.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.570
In fact, whenever people ask me,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.520
what's the one supplement
that I should take

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.990
if I can only take one supplement?

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.256
I always say AG1.

00:11:59.256 --> 00:12:01.320
I take mine early in the day.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.410
I mix it with water and
some lemon or lime juice.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.260
I love the way it tastes.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.910
And I'll take it again later in the day,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.870
typically in the late afternoon.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.300
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.880
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.490
and claim a special offer.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.320
They're giving you five free travel packs

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.170
that make it really easy to mix up AG1

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.430
while you're on the road, in the car,

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.890
on the plane, et cetera, and a
year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.710
There's a ton of data now
supporting the fact that

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.910
vitamin D3 is critical and that
most of us don't get enough

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.680
vitamin D3 even if we're
getting ample sunlight.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.510
Vitamin D three is
important from metabolism,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.810
hormone function, brain function,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.220
and many other aspects of our biology.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.290
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.420
you can get a special offer
of the Athletic Greens,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.370
five free travel packs and the
year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.660
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.927
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:12:51.927 --> 00:12:55.220
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.790
to help you better understand your body

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.930
and help you reach your health goals.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.090
I've long been a believer

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.840
in getting regular blood work done.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.240
For the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.560
that influence your immediate
and long-term health

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.650
can only be discovered
from a quality blood test.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.560
And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.700
you can also get information
for instance about

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.040
how your biological age compares
to your chronological age,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.820
which of course is a vital measurement.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.810
Now, one of the major issues
with blood tests and DNA tests

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.400
out there is that people
get the information back

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.750
that lipid marker of one
type, it might be high or low,

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.510
or that a hormone of another
type might be high or low,

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.532
but they don't give
you any for information

00:13:34.532 --> 00:13:36.700
about what to do with that information.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.760
Inside Tracker makes that
all very easy to navigate.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.300
Once you get your results back,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.310
you can click on any of those results.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.740
And Inside Tracker will
immediately show you things

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.010
that you can do, for
instance, with your nutrition,

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.470
or supplementation, or lifestyle factors

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.540
to help you bring those
numbers into the ranges

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.380
that are appropriate for you.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.510
So it's immensely
powerful, not just in terms

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.270
of the measurements, but also
it provides some directives

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.670
that can help bring those
measurements into the ranges

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.220
that are best for your
immediate and long-term health.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.650
If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.200

Inside Tracker's plans.

Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.450
Let's talk about desire,
love, and attachment.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.081
And of course, these are topics

00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:18.790
that grab tremendous interest.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.800
So it's worth us defining
our terms a little bit

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.860
before going any further.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.930
Of course, we can have many
different kinds of loves.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.990
There's romantic love,
there's love of family,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.640
so-called familial love,
there's love of pets.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.270
We can even love objects,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.310
where we can feel as if we love objects.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.710
We can love certain activities.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.260
We can have friends that we
love and so on and so forth.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.830
The word love is used to encompass

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.450
a lot of different types of relationships.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.900
Today, we are mainly going to
be focused on romantic love

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.210
and the neural mechanisms
of romantic love.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.780
I want to acknowledge here at the outset

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.130
that most of the studies of romantic love

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.860
have focused on monogamous
heterosexual love.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.300
And also when we talk about
studies focused on desire,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.290
and attractiveness, and
attachment, that's also the case.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.270
And that simply reflects the
general bias of the literature

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.660
over the last 50 to 100 years.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.210
It does, of course, not
rule out that similar

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.430
or different mechanisms could be at play

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.570
in non-monogamous relationships,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.600
in homosexual relationships,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.930
or in relationships of
any kind or variation.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.420
It's also worth us defining
our terms around desire.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.370
It can mean lust, it can mean the desire

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.950
for long-term partnership.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.520
So we need to define our
terms and throughout I will do

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.350
my best to very carefully
define what I mean by desire,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.683
what I mean by love, and
what I mean by attachment.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.350
The formal study of love,
and desire, and attachment

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.900
goes back to the early 1900s.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.607
One of the classic studies
on this is entitled

00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:53.660
"Love and Desire."

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.570
It was published in
1912 and really focused

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.950
on two opposing themes within romance.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.950
One is love which in that paper
was really meant to include

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.440
attachment and dependence
or interdependence

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.660
between individuals, right?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.360
And the other end of the
spectrum being desire,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.230
or the sexual desire for another.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.580
And romance was meant to
encapsulate both those things,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.330
love and desire.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.430
And for much of the 1900s,
it was thought that love

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.290
and desire were on opposing
ends or in a push pull.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:35.290
And it was the dynamic push and
pull between love and desire

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.010
that one could define romance.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.360
And that actually led to
much of what's out there

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.230
in the psychological literature.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.100
Today, we are going to explore
some neurobiological studies,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.270
some studies of the endocrine system,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.470
meaning the hormone system

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.370
that actually support that general model.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.908
And I'll point you toward what
I think is a very useful book

00:16:54.908 --> 00:16:59.510
in thinking about how relationships
can both form and last

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.230
over long periods of time
and how those relationships

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.930
can include both desire
and interdependence.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.580
I'll also talk about some
studies that have really focused

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.170
on why relationships
succeed and why they fail,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.320
and how that relates to whether
or not there is sufficient

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.450
amounts of attachment and desire.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.780
So today we're going to
talk about the science

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.740
and indeed you'll also get some tools.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.400
Those tools should be useful
to you, whether or not

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.190
you happen to be in a relationship or not,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.350
whether or not you're seeking
a relationship or not.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.970
I'd like to begin with an anecdote.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.350
And this is not an anecdote

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.345
about my relationship history,

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:38.120
it's an anecdote about
my scientific history.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.500
When I started graduate school,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.980
the chairman of the department
I was in at the time

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.980
said to me, "Most PhDs last
longer than most marriages."

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.660
And indeed he was right.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.480
And also most marriages in
this country end in divorce.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.720
I think it's about 50% with a
slight skew toward more ending

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.430
in divorce than persist
until death do them part.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.770
But nonetheless, it's about half,

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.830
and most marriages end before
the eight-year period is up.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.700
Most PhDs take anywhere
from four to nine years.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.880
So there was a bit of a
smearing of averages there,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.180
but the point he was trying to make

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.220
really landed home for me.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.300
It did not scare me out of relationships

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.080
nor did it scare me out
of a PhD, obviously.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.010
What it did illustrate
was that there's something

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.700
about our attachment machinery

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.700
that can be very, very compelling,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.970
such that people take on
tremendous levels of commitment.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.340
I have to imagine that
most people enter marriages

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.612
assuming that they're going
to stay in those marriages.

00:18:37.612 --> 00:18:40.320
I don't think most people
enter marriages thinking

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.510
they're going to get divorced.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:46.160
But that if 50% of those
commitments end in divorce,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.900
there must also be mechanisms

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.740
by which our attachments can break.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.860
And today we're going to
talk about both the forming

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.360
of attachments and the
breaking of attachments,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.680
what can prevent those
breaks in attachments,

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.040
and indeed what can
lead to re-attachments.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.940
There are biological
mechanisms to desire, love

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.770
and attachment, that's abundantly clear.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.580
Now there's a robust and
very large literature

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.890
in animal models.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.380
What I mean by that are field
studies and laboratory studies

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.080
in primates of different kinds,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.280
such as macaque monkeys or bonobos.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.970
People have looked at
these sorts of things,

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.800
believe it or not, in
ducks, in laboratory mice,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.510
in different types of birds, et cetera.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.040
And if you look at that literature,
you can essentially find

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.180
biological examples in the
animal kingdom for just about

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.860
any behavior that you can
easily map to human behavior.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.800
So for instance, there's
a species of animal called

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.830
the prairie vole.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.350
In one portion of the United States,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.430
this prairie vole species is monogamous.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.610
They only mate with
one other prairie vole,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.570
only raise the young with
one other prairie vole

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.510
for their entire life.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.157
And in another region
of the United States,

00:19:58.157 --> 00:20:01.120
the same species of animal, prairie vole,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.090
will mate with many individuals,
they're non-monogamous.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.420
And the major difference,
at least as far as we know

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.430
between the prairie voles in one location

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.960
and another location is
the levels of a molecule

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.940
called vasopressin in the brain and body.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.010
Vasopressin is present in humans.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.410
It has numerous biological roles.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.600
It's responsible, for
instance, for controlling

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.440
the amount of urine that you excrete,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.140
the amount of water that you retain,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.383
and for sexual desire,
as well as mate seeking.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.730
Levels of vasopressin in prairie voles

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.460
are strongly determinant of
whether or not a prairie vole

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.340
is going to be a monogamous
or non-monogamous.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.250
Why do I raise this?

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.560
Well, I raise this because the
literature on prairie voles

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.030
is quite beautiful and has
been discussed quite a lot

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:47.863
in the popular press.

00:20:47.863 --> 00:20:51.010
You can look it up with an
easily, just Web Edge search.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.550
You'll find lots of
information about this,

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.040
lots of news articles about this,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.120
and lots of interpretations
as to how vasopressin might

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.650
be involved in similar or
different mechanisms in humans.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.956
Now, I don't have a problem

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:04.330
with mapping animal studies to humans.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.590
I think there's certainly
a place for that.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.390
But if we just lean back
and look at the giant mass

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.707
of studies in animals and
their mating behavior,

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.480
and their mate selection behavior,

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.870
you can essentially find
examples of anything.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.050
You can find examples of polygamy,

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.450
you can find examples of
cheating, of infidelity,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.230
you can find examples of all
sorts of different behaviors

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.310
that in your own mind, you
can map to human behavior.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.600
But it's really hard to make
the leap from animal models

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.570
to humans in any kind of direct way.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.900
And so thankfully there's
been tremendous work done

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.280
in the last mainly 20 years or so,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.500
looking at human mate selection,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.470
human desire, human love
and human attachment.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.470
So we're mainly going to
focus on those studies today,

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.220
and where appropriate, we
will map those findings back

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.240
to the findings in animals to
see if there's some universal

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.800
truths or some universal principles

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.310
about how the neural circuits

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.030
and biological mechanisms work.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.340
But by and large, we're going
to focus on human studies today.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.690
So unless I say otherwise,
the data that I'm referring

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.210
to today are entirely from human beings.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.240
So let's talk about attachment
and attachment styles.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.900
And this will offer you the opportunity

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.323
to answer some important
questions for yourself,

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.950
such as what is my, meaning,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.483
your attachment style in relationship?

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.380
One of the most robust findings
in the field of psychology

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.720
is this notion of attachment styles.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.660
And this was something that was discovered

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.920
through a beautiful set
of studies that were done

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.780
by Mary Ainsworth in the 1980s,

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.280
in which she developed
a laboratory condition

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.930
called the strange situation task.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.560
Now, the strange situation
task has been studied

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.150
over and over again in different cultures,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.400
in different locations
throughout the world.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.620
And in preparing for this episode,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.440
I actually spoke to three
different psychologists.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.750
I spoke to a psychoanalyst,

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.600
I spoke to a cognitive
behavioral psychologist,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.390
and I actually spoke to a
psychiatrist, excuse me,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.160
not a psychologist, but a
psychiatrist with a medical degree

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.000
and asked, is the strange situation task

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.910
and the various attachment
styles that emerge

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.290
from that task, are those
still considered valid?

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.630
And indeed all three of
them said if ever there was

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:15.120
a literature in psychology
that is absolutely tamped down

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.120
and has a firm basis in both
data and real world principles

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.000
and real world examples,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.550
it's this notion of attachment styles.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.600
So what is the strange situation task?

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.190
The strange situation
task involves a parent,

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.780
typically a mother in the
studies that were done,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.930
but a parent or other
caregiver bringing their child,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.560
their actual child into a laboratory.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.190
And there's a room with a
stranger and the mother enters

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.070
the room with the child and
there are some toys in the room.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.440
And typically the mother
and the stranger will talk.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.280
Obviously the stranger is
part of the experiment,

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.650
is not just some random
person off the street.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.180
And the child is allowed
to move about the room.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.190
They can observe the mother interacting

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.404
with the other person or not,

00:24:01.404 --> 00:24:03.510
they can play with toys or not,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.820
but then at some point the mother leaves.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.550
And then at some point later
designated by the experimenter,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.540
the mother comes back.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.540
And what is measured in these
studies is both how the child,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.073
the toddler reacts to the mother leaving,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.050
and how the child reacts
to the mother returning

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.970
at the end of the experiment.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.720
And oftentimes this will have
two or three different phases

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.900
where the mother will bring
the child in then leave,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.490
then come back in and leave.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:39.290
There are also studies in
which the behavior of the child

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.120
with the stranger is also examined.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.580
So there are a lot of variations of this,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.580
but the basic findings are
that toddlers, children

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.610
fall into four different
categories of attachment style.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.300
And that these attachment
styles can predict many features

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.030
of adolescent, teen, young
adult, and even adult

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.170
attachment styles, not
in strange situations

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.690
of the sort that I just ascribed,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.623
but in romantic attachments.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.610
I should mention also that
attachment style is plastic,

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.280
meaning it can change across the lifespan.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.740
So as I describe the results,
I describe the different

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.603
attachment styles that are out there,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.320
and if any of those resonate
with you or bring to mind

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.380
certain people in your life,
please do not assume that

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.260
those attachment styles
are rigid and fixed

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.280
for the entire lifespan.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.270
There are also terrific
data that indicate that

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.410
through specific processes,
both psychological

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.530
and some biological adjustments

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.030
that people can change
their attachment style,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.620
and that indeed people who have
different attachment styles

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.920
can change the attachment
styles of others.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.890
But just to make very
clear what the results

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.610
of the study were, I want to
review what the four different

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.840
attachment styles are,
and typically people fall

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.010
into one group or another but not several.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.590
So the four patterns of
attachment that were revealed

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.500
by these studies, again,
were revealed by examining

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.770
the behavior of the child in
response to the mother leaving

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.830
and the mother returning,
and the child's response

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.720
to the stranger that is
in the room with them.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.120
The first style is the so-called
secure attachment style.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.610
In the nomenclature of this kind of study,

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.130
these are the so-called B babies,

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.690
as in the letter B, bulldog, B.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.010
Not for bulldogs, but just
to designate this category.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.830
The secure attachment style
is one in which the child

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.080
will engage with the stranger,
with the experimenter

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.330
while the parent is present in the room.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.510
But that when the parent,
typically it's a mother,

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.890
but when the parent or
other caregiver leaves,

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.000
the child does get visibly upset.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.470
They might whine, they might cry,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.490
they might even tantrum a bit.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.230
However, when the caregiver,
meaning the mother, or father,

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.500
or other caregiver returns,
the child visibly expresses

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.030
happiness that the caregiver
has returned, okay?

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.730
So that's the hallmark of
the secure attachment style.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.243
And again, this is all pre-verbal.

00:27:09.243 --> 00:27:11.730
This is happening long
before the child can express

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.993
how they feel with words.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.780
And the interpretation of
this is that the secure child

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.870
feels confident that the
caregiver is available

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.360
and will be responsive to their needs

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.680
and their communications.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.160
So that when the child
whines and, or is distressed,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.900
the parent doesn't come
right back into the room.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.830
But at some point they do
and they seem to have a sense

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.570
of trust that if the
parent or caregiver leaves

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.280
that the parent will come back,

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.840
and that they're happy that they do.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.860
These children are also
very good at exploring

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.330
novel environments after
the parent is gone,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.590
and while the parent is there.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.590
And almost always, when
the parent is there,

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.841
they will explore more broadly,

00:27:50.841 --> 00:27:54.080
literally in space,
they'll venture out further

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.840
than they will when the parent is gone.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.570
They also tend to engage
with the caregiver in a way

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.880
that's not immediately
and completely trusting,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.610
but that over time
seems to evolve from one

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.370
in which they're kind of
suspicious of this person

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.890
to one in which they're at
least somewhat trusting, okay?

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.980
So these were the general contours

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.820
of the secure attachment style.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.600
And fortunately, nowadays
there are physiological studies

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.680
measuring things like
heart rate and breathing

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.440
and other measures that
correlate with the subjective

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.080
assessment of what these
children are feeling.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.180
Okay, so first category
is secure attached.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.810
The second category is a
so-called anxious-avoidant

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.323
or insecurely attached, which
are the category A babies.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.110
The children with
anxious-avoidant insecure

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.190
attachment patterns
generally tend to avoid

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.590
or ignore the caregiver, all right?

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:47.680
Meaning the parent, and
show very little emotion

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.260
when the parent leaves or returns.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.990
So this is the reason
they call them avoidant

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.420
or anxious-avoidant and kind of insecure.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.390
There isn't this happiness or
joy that the parent is back.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.310
They don't seem to express that.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.570
They do not exhibit
distress on separation.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:09.090
And they generally tend to
have some tendency to approach

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.480
the caregiver when they return,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.310
but there doesn't seem to be
a general expression of joy.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.960
And again, physiological
measures support that as well.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.730
Things like changes in heart
rate tend to be less dramatic

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.250
in the anxious-avoidant
insecure attachment style

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.685
than in the secure attachment style.

00:29:25.685 --> 00:29:27.743
Okay, so that's the second one.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.700
The third category is the so-called

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.430
anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure
category.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.750
Okay, I didn't name these categories.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.860
So you have to blame others
in this one instance.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.880
For everything else blame
me, but in this instance,

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.147
you have to blame the psychologists

00:29:43.147 --> 00:29:44.910
that named this category.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.700
The anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure
category

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.040
also called the C babies,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.050
for the letter C just as a categorization.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.810
The anxious-ambivalent,
resistant-insecure toddlers, really,

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.970
show distress even before
separation from their mother

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.190
or other caregiver.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.450
And they tend to be very
clingy and difficult to comfort

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.080
when the caregiver returns, okay?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.210
So they're distressed even
before the mother leaves the room

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.430
and they tend to be very clingy
and really hard to calm down

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.630
when the mother returns.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.590
They tend to show either
what seems to be resentment

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.480
in response to the parent's absence.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.950
We don't really know what they're feeling.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.970
Or some helpless passivity.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.270
And there's actually subcategorizations

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.180
that the psychologists have
come up with, C one subtypes

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.013
and C two subtypes.

00:30:32.013 --> 00:30:33.590
We don't have to get bogged down in that.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.000
But just know that there
isn't one absolute measure

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.220
that says, oh, well, this person

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.660
is anxious-ambivalent, resistant-insecure.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.530
They could be somewhat
passive, or they could be,

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.770
seem somewhat angry at the caregiver.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.770
But the basic idea is that
before and after the separation,

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.280
they are clingy and difficult to comfort.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.970
They just can't seem to
calm themselves down,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.560
and physiological measures
of heart rate and hormone

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.840
measurements such as cortisol
also support that statement.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.700
And the third category of
attachment style is the so-called

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.160
disorganized or disoriented
or D for the letter D babies.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.750
This is a categorization
that was added later

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.620
to this strange situation task.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.410
That is a real hallmark of
developmental psychology studies.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.320
It was developed by Mary
Ainsworth, graduate student,

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.110
Mary Maine, who I actually had
the great fortune of taking

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.970
a course from and learning
from when I was a graduate

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.690
student at Berkeley many years ago.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.820
And this fourth categorization
was controversial

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.750
for a while, but now
is generally accepted.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:40.170
The key feature of the
disorganized, disoriented category

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.480
is that the toddlers tend to be tense

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.610
and they tend to encompass a
lot of odd physical postures.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.970
They tend to hunch their shoulders.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.720
They'll put their hands behind their neck.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.240
They'll cock their head to the side.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.150
For those of you listening,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.750
I'm doing this on the video version.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.020
It's not where you don't
have to go see that.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.480
But for those of you that
are watching this on video,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.340
they tend to constrain
their body size a bit

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.110
and going to odd postures
that they normally wouldn't

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.363
do anywhere else.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.530
So this is why it's
called the disorganized

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.060
or disoriented category.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.190
It seems like these children
just don't really know

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.130
how to react to a separation.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.380
And they just start to manifest
behaviors and emotional

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.710
tones that aren't observed
in other situations.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.830
Okay, so we've got our four categories.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.550
I'll try and use the
shortest possible names

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.383
for each category.

00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:32.670
We've got category one,
which is securely attached.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.760
We've got category two,
which is insecurely attached,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.170
also sometimes called anxious-avoidant.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.560
Then we've got category three,

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.750
which is the resistant-insecure category,

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.090
which is anxious-ambivalent.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.870
And then there's this fourth category,

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.450
the disorganized, disoriented category

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.950
where they're so-called D babies.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.730
Now, what's interesting about
this from the perspective

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:59.730
of desire, love and attachment
is that the categorizations

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.520
of children into one of these
four different categories

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.310
as toddlers is strongly predictive
of their attachment style

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.310
in romantic partnerships later in life.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.930
Which is to me both amazing and surprising

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.100
and not surprising all at the same time.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.920
Amazing because it means
that, first of all,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.720
we are relatively
hardwired for attachment.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.680
I think that that's
incredible and beautiful,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.700
that we have designated
neurons, nerve cells

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.650
and hormonal systems
that are there to ensure

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:37.090
that we have some response
to a caregiver being there,

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.210
or not being there, or
returning, or leaving,

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.860
but also that the same neural
circuitries, the same hormonal

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.440
responses are at least
in some way repurposed

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.300
for entirely different types
of attachments later in life.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.290
So when we hear the psychologist
talk about how we formed

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.800
a template early in life
based on experiences

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.550
that were even pre-verbal
before we had language,

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.330
and those templates are
superimposed on our relationships,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.120
or we should say, our later
relationships are superimposed

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.690
on those templates, there
really is a basis for that.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:14.070
We now have neuroimaging studies
to support, for instance,

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.920
the work of Allan Schore
from UCLA, showing that

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.870
when a mother and child
interact, either through very

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.080
soothing interactions,
like bottle feeding,

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.930
or breastfeeding, or
singing to one's baby,

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.320
or putting them to sleep,
that the brain of the child

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.610
and the brain of the mother

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.680
are entering a coordinated
state of relaxation.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.960
And it's not one
direction, mother to child,

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.303
the child is also calming the mother.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.380
Typically these studies were
done with mothers again,

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.150
sometimes with fathers,
but typically with mothers.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.020
And in addition to that, when
the mother or other caregiver

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.930
acts very excited and raises their voice,

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:54.820
or puts a lilt in their
voice, or widens their eyes,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.116
that the child will do the same.

00:34:56.116 --> 00:34:59.110
And again, there's a
bidirectional interaction

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.150
in that case of excitement.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.960
And there's the release of
neurochemicals like dopamine

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.640
into the bloodstream, whereas
in the relaxation scenario

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.560
and the soothing scenario,
there's we know the release

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.850
of things like serotonin and oxytocin.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.850
So the neural systems for
attachment and the neural systems

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.460
for what we call autonomic
arousal for being alert and calm

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.740
don't act in a vacuum.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.420
They are tethered to other
people in our environment.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.930
And of course we know this, right?

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.170
We sometimes hear the statement,

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.780
no one can make you feel anything.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.000
I've always had a little bit of a problem

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
with that statement.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.890
I don't think I'm contradicting
anyone in particular,

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.430
but you hear that a lot, no
one can make you feel anything.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.620
Indeed they can, right?

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.270
A physical injury can
make you feel something.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.490
If somebody says something
that you very much like,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.387
it can make you feel something.

00:35:46.387 --> 00:35:49.330
And if somebody says something
that you very much dislike,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.610
it will make you feel something.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.970
So the idea that no one
can make us feel anything

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.090
isn't actually true.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.400
Our nervous system is tethered

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.959
to the nervous systems of others.

00:35:57.959 --> 00:36:01.560
And that is true from the very
earliest stages of our lives.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.340
And in this case, we're
talking about how our templates

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.110
for attachment in romantic
relationships, how we find them,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.400
how we maintain them, and
indeed how we break them

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.330
and reform them is based on a
template that was established

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.610
through an entirely
different set of priorities,

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.390
which was how we feel safe and
secure in novel environments,

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.260
depending on whether or
not our primary caregiver

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.270
is there or not.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.930
Neuroimaging supports that.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.460
When I say neuroimaging, I
mean, brain scan support that,

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.140
measures of hormones in the
body and brain support that,

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.060
measures of neurochemicals support that.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.290
There's simply no way around this truth,

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:38.390
that we have a set of roadmaps
in our mind that are reused

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.210
for entirely different
purposes later in life.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.770
That is vitally important to understand.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.760
Because if one is successful in forming

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.760
romantic attachments, maintaining
them, et cetera, or not,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.880
does in fact reflect the earlier templates

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.130
that you've created.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.540
But as I've mentioned
before, the good news is

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.660
that these templates can shift over time.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.210
And one of the more powerful
ways to shift those templates

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.990
over time is purely by the
knowledge that they exist,

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.920
and the understanding that
those templates are malleable.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.640
They can change through the
process of neuroplasticity.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.590
Again, neuroplasticity is just a rewiring

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.030
of nerve connection.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.760
That is very much present in childhood,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.950
but also very much present in adulthood.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.210
So if you're somebody who
you think falls into category

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.890
one, two, three, or four,
or you know somebody,

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.960
or involved with somebody
who falls into category

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.283
one, two, three, and four,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.150
the mere knowledge of
that can be very useful.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.160
But you might ask, well, what
do I do with that knowledge?

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.410
Well, fortunately, both
psychologists and biologists

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.830
have started to leverage that
knowledge toward establishing

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.320
better, more secure bonds in
adult romantic relationships.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.270
And there's a book that has
really tapped into this.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.030
I think it's the first book
that has really addressed

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.910
this head on.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.483
And that book comes from
two Columbia professors.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:03.750
And title of the book is
"Attached: The New Science of Adult

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:07.090
Attachment and How It Can
Help You Find and Keep Love."

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:11.220
The authors of this book are
Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.070
Again, both of them are skilled
academics and researchers

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.700
who have really taken the
literature that I described

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.080
on the strange situation task

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.120
and mapped it to adult attachment styles.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.920
And also they've mapped out
ways that they've observed

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.280
in their clinical practice.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.520
And that is laboratory
supported for, for instance,

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.580
people that have an anxious-ambivalent

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.850
or what we were calling
insecure attachment style,

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.470
or for people that fall

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.830
into the disorganized or
disoriented attachment style,

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:43.300
how they can modify that
attachment style in or out

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.700
of relationships in order
to establish what I think

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.910
everybody wants, which
is secure attachment.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.130
Why does everybody want that?

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.930
Well, secure attachment
allows people to be both

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.190
in relationship, or if they
choose to be on their own,

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.770
or to be in relationship
but physically separated

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.770
from somebody else, or
even emotionally separated

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.565
from somebody else and maintain

00:39:02.565 --> 00:39:05.550
what we call a stable
autonomic equilibrium,

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.320
the ability to remain calm, clearheaded.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.010
You might not like what's happening,

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.700
but you're able to navigate
that with some sense of clarity

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.770
and not excessive discomfort.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.280
So, is there a goal in all of this stuff

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.330
about love, desire, and attachment?

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.610
Indeed, there is.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:24.500
The secure attachment
style is the one that leads

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.140
to the most stable and predictable
long-term relationships.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.730
Put differently, babies,
toddlers, adolescents, teens,

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.350
and young adults that have
a secure attachment style

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.520
are more likely to find and
form long-term relationships

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.820
than are people in the other categories.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.560
But people in other categories
can learn and eventually

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.690
migrate into the secure attachment style.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.960
And I think that book "Attached..."

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.580
I have no affiliation to the
authors or the book itself,

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.617
I should just mention that.

00:39:53.617 --> 00:39:55.820
"Attached: The New Science
of Adult Attachment

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.530
and How It Can Help You
Find and Keep Love,"

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.770
really it sounds very pop psychology, yes,

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.040
but it is really grounded

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.880
in the research psychology literature.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.950
And there's also some
interesting biology there.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.810
Another point to make
about attachment styles

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.350
is that it is possible.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.940
And some of you may be
familiar with circumstances

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.120
whereby people who are securely attached,

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.930
either because they grew
up in an environment

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.110
where secure attachment was cultivated,

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.610
or because they developed
that on their own,

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.010
can also migrate out of the
securely attached category

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.700
into insecurely attached,
or into avoidant types

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.330
of attachment styles as
teens, or as young adults,

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:40.760
or as adults at any age
or any stage of life,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.800
by virtue of being with
somebody who has a different,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.310
perhaps less adaptive
attachment style, right?

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.440
What this means is that
if you have or you develop

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.760
a secure attachment style,
it's vitally important

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.690
to protect that attachment
style because it is possible

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.776
to become anxiously attached,

00:40:57.776 --> 00:41:01.210
even if you grew up in a
stable attachment framework.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.700
And again, this can happen at any stage.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.510
So if you're interested
in attachment styles

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.700
and how they influence
adult romantic attachments,

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.050
and certainly if you are a
parent, I would encourage you

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.890
to check out the book, "Attached."

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.460
Again, it's quite good and I
think that it offers a number

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.087
of actionable tools to both form

00:41:20.087 --> 00:41:22.500
and hold onto secure attachment styles.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.820
So I mentioned that the neural
circuits for child-parent

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.490
or child-caregiver
attachment are repurposed

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.460
for romantic attachment later in life.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.830
But what are these neural circuits?

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:35.770
What do they do?

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:39.150
I mean, it's so attractive, if you will,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.700
to think about a brain
area that controls love,

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.780
or a brain area that controls desire,

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.390
or a brain area that controls attachment,

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.250
but it simply doesn't work that way.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.520
As I've talked about
before on this podcast

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.800
and I will say again and
again because it will persist

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.900
to be true long after I'm gone,

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.910
is that no one brain area
can give rise to anything

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.070
as complex as desire,
or love, or attachment.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.640
Instead, there are
multiple brain areas that

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.060
through their coordinated action create

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.970
a song that we call desire,
or a song that we call love,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.260
or a song that we call attachment.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.820
Not a literal song,
although there are songs

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.380
about desire, love, and
attachment, of course, many songs,

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.150
some good, some not so good.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.750
But rather different brain
areas being active in different

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.270
sequences and with different
intensities can make us feel

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.560
as if we are in the mode
that we call desire,

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.600
or in the mode of love, or
in the mode of attachment.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.410
But beneath all of that is this element

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.920
of autonomic arousal.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.450
And I want to focus on autonomic arousal

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.500
just for a bit longer,

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.270
because it really is one
of the three core elements

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:48.670
by which we form and
maintain loving attachments,

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.413
and by which we break loving attachments.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.010
The autonomic nervous system

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.100
as the name suggests is automatic.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.080
In fact, that's what autonomic means.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.860
Now it's actually the
case that we can control

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.190
our autonomic nervous system
to some degree or another.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.800
But the autonomic nervous
system controls things like

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.470
digestion, our breathing,
whether or not we're conscious

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.910
of that breathing or not.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:15.970
It controls things like how
alert we are or sleepy we are.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.120
And the autonomic nervous system,

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.960
as I just briefly described earlier,

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.730
is really something that we
come into the world with.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.470
It's hardwired, all
the elements are there.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.460
But through interactions with our parent,

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:32.780
either soothing interactions,
or fun, playful interactions,

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.520
or dare I say, scary interactions,

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.740
our autonomic nervous
system gets tuned up.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.687
Meaning, we each develop a
tendency to either be more alert

00:43:42.687 --> 00:43:47.070
and anxious, or more calm, or
a balance of alert and calm.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.060
Now, of course, this
changes across each day

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.770
and depending how tired
we are late in the day.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:51.680
If we've been awake for a while,

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.360
we tend to get sleepy early in the day.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.200
If we're very rested,

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.290
we tend to wake up and feel very alert.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.960
So the way to think about
the autonomic nervous system

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.520
is it's kind of a seesaw.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.170
We go back and forth
between being very alert,

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.800
we can be alert and calm, or
we can be very, very alert,

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.260
we can be in a state of panic,

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.250
we can be fast asleep so
we can be extremely calm,

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:14.250
or we can just be sleepy, semi
calm but still also alert.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.030
So think about it like a seesaw.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.970
And that seesaw has a hinge,

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:23.270
and that hinge defines how
tight or loose that seesaw is,

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.140
how readily it can tilt back and forth.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:30.160
Our autonomic tone is
how tight that hinge is.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.180
And there are biological
mechanisms to explain this,

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.800
but here I just want to
stay with the analogy

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.063
of the seesaw for now.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.720
The interactions between child
and caregiver early in life

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.290
take the child and the caregiver

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:47.060
from one end of the seesaw to the other.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.170
From being very alert in a
state of play, for instance,

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.490
to being nursed and being very
soothed until we go to sleep.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.980
And of course, we each have a seesaw,

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.117
the parent and the child has a seesaw,

00:44:57.117 --> 00:44:58.200
and they're interacting.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.106
What do I mean by that?

00:44:59.106 --> 00:45:03.000
Well, there are beautiful
studies, and beautiful

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.280
not in the sense that they
focused on a pleasant topic,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.430
but beautiful because they
were done so beautifully well,

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.520
that looked at, for instance,
the response of mothers

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.080
and their physiologies and
the response of children

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.500
and their physiologies
during the bombing of cities

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.560
during World War II.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.540
So an unpleasant situation.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.140
But what was revealed during
the course of these studies

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.750
was that if the mothers were very stressed

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.580
during an onslaught of
bombing of the city,

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.930
the children's physiologies
tended to be stressed also,

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.810
and persisted in being stressed
long after that stressful

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.600
episode was done.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.690
They actually followed that these children

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.400
well out from many decades afterwards.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.850
Conversely, if the parent,
and in this case, again,

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:53.730
it was mothers that were
explored in these studies,

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.810
had turned this whole business of going

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.130
into the bomb shelters into
somewhat of a game, right?

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.627
Taking it seriously, but
essentially telling the children,

00:46:01.627 --> 00:46:02.460
"Okay, it's time to go,"

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.860
but not expressing much
stress or distress,

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.156
the children also didn't
develop much stress,

00:46:07.156 --> 00:46:09.400
or distress, or trauma.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.980
Now there were exceptions
to this, of course,

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.162
but in general, that was the rule

00:46:12.162 --> 00:46:15.620
that the autonomic nervous
systems of children tend to mimic

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.800
the autonomic nervous systems
of the primary caregiver.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.630
And the mechanisms by which
this occurs has been explored.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:25.620
And again I just refer to the
beautiful work of Allan Schore

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.140
at University of California, Los Angeles.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.387
And again, his name is
Schore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.

00:46:32.387 --> 00:46:33.940
I'm looking down briefly at the floor here

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.630
because I'll just reach for the book.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.730
He has a wonderful book called
"Right Brain Psychotherapy."

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.760
It's a little bit technical,

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.210
but if you're interested
in some of the studies,

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.290
this book "Right Brain
Psychotherapy" details how everything

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:50.320
from nursing of children
to playtime behavior,

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.260
to strange situation type
task behavior that we talked

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.310
about before which of
course occurs when children

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.177
get dropped off at
daycare, or nursery school,

00:46:57.177 --> 00:46:59.600
or with babysitters, et cetera.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.080
And indeed all types of
caregiver-child interactions

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.910
tune up that autonomic nervous system,

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:10.220
so that the child ends up with
an autonomic nervous system

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.720
that either tends to lean more
towards alert and anxious,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.580
or can be very alert but calm,

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:18.440
or can be very calm and hard to budge.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.820
Again, it's the tightness of that hinge

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.770
that really underlies
these attachment styles

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.270
that we were talking about earlier,

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:28.030
and not on this episode of
the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:29.620
but on many other previous
previous episodes,

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.730
such as the master stress episode,

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.670
or some of the optimized health episodes.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.970
You can find these if you
want at hubermanlab.com.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.240
A lot of the tools and techniques
that are recommended there

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.890
have to do with readjusting
the autonomic nervous system

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.265
in deliberate ways as an adult.

00:47:45.265 --> 00:47:48.610
Again, I won't go into the specific tools,

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.660
but for instance, the physiological sigh.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.280
This tool that I've talked
about extensively of two inhales

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.890
through the nose, as deeply
as you can on the first one,

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:00.170
sneaking in a little bit
more air on the second one,

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.910
and then a long exhale through the mouth

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.680
is a way of adjusting
that autonomic seesaw.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.340
It tends to make us more calm.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.470
It activates what we call
the parasympathetic arm

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.970
of the autonomic nervous
system, which is just fancy nerd

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:16.290
speak for it's a quick way
to calm yourself down, right?

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:20.680
Things like ice baths, or cold
showers, or cold immersion,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.610
or deliberate
hyperventilation by contrast,

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.280
or ways in which we can
deliberately increase the level

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.967
of our so-called sympathetic
arm of our autonomic nervous

00:48:30.967 --> 00:48:32.870
system to make ourselves more alert.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:33.910
Why would you want to do that?

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.840
Well, you can do that to be more alert,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.280
to be more awake, if you like,

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.500
or as a form of self-induced
stress inoculation

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.770
to be able to tolerate
higher levels of adrenaline

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.353
by making it a practice
that you self-direct.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:51.510
The reason those tools are out
there is because many of us,

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.380
for whatever reason, we
don't have to blame anyone,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.880
but because of our childhood templates,

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.770
because of things that
happened and didn't happen

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.760
in terms of our interactions
with caregivers,

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.370
have autonomic nervous systems
that are tilted to one side

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.400
or the other more than we would like.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:10.320
Or in which the hinge that I'm
talking about in this analogy

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.030
is too loose or that is too tight.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.010
And we're stuck in a mode of anxiousness,

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.180
or stuck in a mode of lack of energy.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.560
That's what those tools are really about.

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:24.560
But at a deeper level, the
autonomic nervous system

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.900
is really the system that
governs how we will react

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.900
in response to a romantic
partner being present or leaving.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.680
And I don't necessarily mean
leaving the relationship

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.790
entirely, although it
could mean that, right?

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.210
We know people, I'm sure you
know people that upon the end

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:43.470
of a relationship that
they wanted very much,

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.990
are absolutely crushed.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.242
And actually in researching
this episode there,

00:49:47.242 --> 00:49:50.220
I discovered there's an
extensive literature finding

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.820
that the feelings that one has
after a breakup are very much

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.360
like a clinical depression in many cases.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.840
But there are individuals
that can look at a breakup

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.330
as a transient event
that they don't interpret

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:07.050
as going to mean so much for
all aspects of their life

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.240
or reshaping their view
of themselves, why?

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.160
Well, we have different
levels of autonomic function.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.800
And depending on where our
seesaw is, if you will,

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.350
some of us become extremely
distraught and can't recalibrate

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:25.390
ourselves, can't adjust ourselves
down from stress to calm,

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:28.740
or can't take ourselves
from exhausted to more alert

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.460
if we need to do that on our own.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.840
And so that's why tools
for doing that exist.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:37.210
But attachment itself is about

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.730
where our autonomic
nervous system resides.

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.810
So if I were to offer a set
of tools around these topics

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.550
of desire, love and attachment,
I would say, first of all,

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.150
you might want to think
about whether or not you fall

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.380
into the secure, insecure,
or other attachment styles.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.380
Second, I think it is vitally
important for all of us,

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.000
but certainly for people
that are in relationships

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.890
or seeking relationships to
be able to at least have some

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:05.850
recognition of where our
autonomic nervous system tends

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:08.940
to reside both in terms of
when we are with somebody

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.430
and when they leave.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.350
When we are apart for
long periods of time,

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.900
can we calm ourselves? Can we self-soothe?

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.990
Or are we very much dependent
on the presence of another

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:19.510
in order to feel soothed?

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.960
Now, I absolutely want to emphasize

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.390
that there is nothing wrong.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.180
In fact, there's everything
right with feeling great

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.580
in the presence of somebody else.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:28.893
That is actually a hallmark

00:51:28.893 --> 00:51:32.100
of strong and quality attachments.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.900
These days, we hear the
term codependent a lot.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.190
This was a, I believe,
the term was first coined

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.260
by Pia Mellody.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:42.980
And it actually does occupy
an important role in the world

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.030
of trauma, trauma healing,
so-called trauma bonding,

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.210
topics of another episode.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:48.920
Actually, did an episode
on fear and trauma.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.670
And we will do one all
about trauma bonding

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:52.940
with an expert at some
point in the future.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.940
But codependence and codependency,
the term can sometimes

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:03.060
be misinterpreted as any
dependence on another isn't good.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:05.970
Interdependence, a
healthy interdependence,

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:07.090
of course is good.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.750
It is the hallmark of healthy
child-parent relations,

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:12.530
sibling relations and romantic relations.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:16.510
But a key element of healthy
interdependence is that,

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:19.210
yes, our autonomic
nervous system is adjusted

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:22.500
by the presence of another, but
that also that we can adjust

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.060
our own autonomic nervous system,

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.410
even in the absence of that person.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:30.170
That if the person goes away
temporarily or permanently,

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.630
that we can still regulate our
own autonomic nervous system,

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.950
both from states of
stress to states of calm,

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:40.350
both from states of exhaustion
to states of more alertness.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:41.660
And of course, we all need sleep

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.850
to go from exhaustion to alertness.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.880
But what I'm referring to here
is the ability to regulate

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.540
when distraught, or
regulate when fatigued,

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.870
or feeling depressed.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:57.030
And that is and is all about
the autonomic nervous system.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:58.720
So as we talk about attachment styles,

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.910
and we talk about infant and toddler

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:01.843
and adult attachment styles,

00:53:01.843 --> 00:53:04.790
what we are really talking
about is a complex set

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.800
of neural circuitries.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.610
And one of those neural
circuitries, which is absolutely

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:11.070
crucial is this autonomic nervous system.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.820
So if the autonomic nervous
system is one key component

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.880
of desire, love and attachment,
what are the other two?

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.640
And what I'm going to tell you
next is largely the pioneering

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.690
work of Helen Fisher, who
is really an anthropologist,

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:29.650
who's become a bit of a
neuroscientist and has collaborated

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.720
with neuroscientists to
establish brain areas

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.330
and neural circuits that are associated

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:37.020
with different aspects of
attachment, love and desire.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.690
I think the first really
high quality study

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.740
of neural circuits
associated with these themes

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:47.510
was a paper published in 2005
in a very fine anatomical

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.470
journal, perhaps the best
neural anatomical journal,

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.240
which is the Journal of
Comparative Neurology.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.240
The Journal of Comparative
Neurology has been around

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.340
for more than 100 years and
is considered the archival

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.790
location for placing really
high quality anatomy.

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:04.610
They have tremendously high standards.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:07.277
And the study that I'm
referring to is entitled,

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:09.500
"Romantic Love: An fMRI,"

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.867
meaning functional
magnetic resonance imaging,

00:54:11.867 --> 00:54:14.900
"Study of a Neural
Mechanism for Mate Choice."

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:19.130
And Dr. Fisher is a author on this paper

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.990
as is Arthur Aron, and Lucy Brown.

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.010
So all very fine researchers.

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:27.580
And this study as well
as several other studies

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.680
using magnetic resonance imaging,

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.760
things like EEG, neuro
anatomical tracing, et cetera,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.690
have identified a large
number of brain areas

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:37.140
that are associated with different aspects

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.254
of desire, love, and attachment.

00:54:38.254 --> 00:54:40.670
And I'll just throw out a few
names of those brain areas

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:41.630
and what they control.

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:43.900
And then I'll tell you how those anchor

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.430
to the other two categories
of neural circuits

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:48.570
essential for desire,
love, and attachment.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:53.380
So not surprisingly the
dopamine system in the brain

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.920
is associated with desire,
love, and attachment,

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.760
and mainly with desire,
although to some extent, love.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.470
Dopamine is a neurochemical sometimes

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:01.669
associated with reward.

00:55:01.669 --> 00:55:05.160
But as some of you have
heard me say before,

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.660
it is mainly a molecule of
motivation, craving and pursuit.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.480
And that motivation, craving
and pursuit that relates

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.950
to dopamine is not unique to
attachment, or love, or sex,

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.070
or mating, et cetera.

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:20.870
It is a universal generic
currency in the brain

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.340
for pursuing something.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.350
Food when you're hungry,
a mate when you want one,

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:29.010
to mate when you want to,
warmth when you're cold,

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.260
et cetera, et cetera, okay?

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.602
So it's not for one specific purpose.

00:55:31.602 --> 00:55:36.010
But the brain areas associated
with dopamine involve,

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.570
for instance, the ventral tegmental area,

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:42.910
the substantia nigra, areas of
that sort, the basal ganglia.

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:44.060
You don't need to know these names,

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.580
just understand that these
are networks of neurons

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.950
that tend to have put the
person, you into a state

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:54.010
of forward action and pursuit
and craving and motivation.

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:57.180
They are not about being
quiescent, relaxed, et cetera.

00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:01.780
The neural circuits for
quiescence and relaxation

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.760
are most associated with
love and attachment,

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.170
not surprisingly, and
they're the neurochemical

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:09.830
serotonin, and to some extent, oxytocin

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:12.310
are the predominant
neurochemicals involved.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:13.538
And those are released from brain areas,

00:56:13.538 --> 00:56:16.510
such as the raphe nucleus
in the back of the brain.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.710
You may have heard that
the majority of serotonin

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:22.110
in your body is made in your
gut, and indeed, that's true,

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.640
but I hate to break it to
you, the serotonin in your gut

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.790
is not responsible for your
feelings of love and attachment,

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.150
at least not to a high degree.

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:32.810
That's mainly going to be
the reflection of neurons

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.160
in your brain that make serotonin.

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.700
And there are other areas of
the brain that make serotonin

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.990
as well and oxytocin as well,

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:43.220
but they tend to be associated
with the warmth and calm,

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.580
and the soothing that we feel
in the presence of another.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.950
And again, these are not
strictly divided circuits.

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:52.087
We can have dopamine and
serotonin present in our brain

00:56:52.087 --> 00:56:56.050
and body at the same time to
equal or different degrees.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.070
And we return in a little bit
to what happens when levels

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.590
of dopamine are very high and
levels of serotonin are low

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:02.842
and vice versa and so on,

00:57:02.842 --> 00:57:07.842
including in states of
neurochemically modified states,

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.690
as it were in, when we talk
about things like MDMA,

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.480
so-called ecstasy.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.950
But in the meantime,
I want to just discuss

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:20.530
the two neural circuits that use dopamine,

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.780
that use serotonin and oxytocin,

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.130
and that collaborate with
the autonomic nervous system

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:29.350
to drive what we call
desire, love and attachment.

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:33.770
And the three circuits are
autonomic nervous system,

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:34.947
we talked about that one.

00:57:34.947 --> 00:57:37.920
Then there's the nervous system components

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.400
or the neural circuits for
empathy, for being able to see

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.740
and respond to indeed
match the emotional tone

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.500
or the autonomic tone of another.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.230
And then there's the third category,

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:52.350
and this might surprise some of you,

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.800
it certainly surprised me,

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.890
but the data point to the fact
that the third neural circuit

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:59.860
that's very important
for establishing bonds

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.780
is one associated with positive delusions.

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.092
So given that the neural
circuits for empathy

00:58:04.092 --> 00:58:07.480
are absolutely crucial for falling in love

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.330
and maintaining stable attachments,

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:11.407
I'd like to talk about
those neural circuits

00:58:11.407 --> 00:58:13.290
and what they are.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.610
Now, often when we hear empathy, we think,

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:19.750
oh, empathy is really about
listening to and really

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.630
understanding what
somebody else is feeling.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.970
Maybe even feeling what they're feeling.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:27.130
And indeed that's the case,
but what do we mean by that?

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:29.850
Right? What is it to
feel what another feels?

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:33.180
Well, what it means is that their seesaw

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.040
is driving your seesaw,

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.720
or your seesaw is somehow
driving their seesaw.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.650
That there's a match in terms
of the tilt of those seesaws.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.650
Now it doesn't have to
be an exact match, right?

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:45.695
If someone that you really he care about

00:58:45.695 --> 00:58:50.340
is very, very stressed, you
could also become very stressed.

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.930
That's a form of empathic matching,

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.740
and there are indeed
neural circuits for that.

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.210
I'll describe what those neural
circuits are in a moment.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.470
But sometimes the best role
for us to take is actually one

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.860
in which we are calm when
the person that we care about

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.260
or that we are romantically involved

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.080
with is very, very anxious.

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.260
And in a few minutes, I'll
talk about how matching

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.080
of emotional tone can be good or bad

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.880
for the stability of a relationship,

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.930
and complementarity of autonomic matching

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.370
can be good or bad.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:25.350
In other words, sometimes it's
beneficial for a relationship

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:27.960
to go into the same state as the other.

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.810
And sometimes it's more
beneficial for us to not go

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.700
into the same state as the other.

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:37.470
But the important feature here
is that when we talk about

00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:40.330
emotional matching or empathy
or going into the same state

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.680
or not going into the same
state, what we are really talking

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.500
about is whether or not
the autonomic seesaw

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.410
of one individual is
driving the autonomic seesaw

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.210
of the other individual.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:56.520
And this is a vital principle
for how we fall in love

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.560
and form attachments.

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.440
And it's actually part of the desire

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.187
and mating process itself.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:07.690
I would go so far as to say
that one of the prerequisites

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.890
to the propagation and
expansion of our species

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:15.480
is this notion of autonomic regulation.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.760
And to some extent, matching
of autonomic nervous systems.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.930
Let me explain what I mean.

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:24.700
Last I checked, the only way
that new humans can be created

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:29.700
is by way of sperm meeting
egg, either in body or in dish,

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.980
but sperm meets egg and then
typically nine months later,

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.113
we have a human baby.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:40.540
The process of bringing
sperm to egg, right?

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.100
Mating behavior, sex behavior in humans

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.690
is one of autonomic regulation.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:51.690
And what I mean by that is
the process of finding a mate,

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.150
and in this case, I mean,
actually someone to mate with,

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:59.080
typically, well,
scenarios vary, typically,

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.120
is one of elevated autonomic arousal,

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.920
meaning increased activation

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.090
of the so-called
sympathetic nervous system.

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:09.170
This is related to dopamine release

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:11.360
and it's related to epinephrine release.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.030
There has to be a pursuit
or at least there has to be

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.360
a mobilization to arrive
in the same location

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.380
whereby one can mate, right?

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.523
That almost always is the case.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.860
However, the sexual arousal itself

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.830
in both males and females

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:36.830
is actually driven primarily
by the parasympathetic arm

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.010
of the autonomic nervous system.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:44.010
So while pursuit is one of
alertness and sympathetic drive,

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.100
as we say, again, sympathy is not really

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.450
what's at play here,

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.020
the word simple means together,

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.530
and the activation of the
autonomic nervous system

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:53.820
toward more alert state

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.343
is because of a
sympathetic nervous system,

01:01:55.343 --> 01:01:58.550
meaning the co-activation
together of many neurons

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.360
in the brain and spinal cord.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.147
But then the actual
physiological arousal state

01:02:04.147 --> 01:02:07.082
that we call sexual
arousal is predominantly

01:02:07.082 --> 01:02:10.010
parasympathetically driven, okay?

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:11.430
To be quite direct about this,

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.360
if the sympathetic nervous
system activation is too high,

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.700
the sexual arousal response
cannot happen in either males

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.160
or in females, it's inhibited.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.030
However, the orgasm and
ejaculation response,

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:28.340
which if you think about
it is required for sperm

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:33.193
to meet egg is sympathetic driven.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.410
And then after orgasm and ejaculation,

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:40.090
the parasympathetic nervousness
system kicks back in,

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.370
and there's a calming and relaxation.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:47.370
So the arc of mating involves
sympathetic arousal, okay?

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.270
Not sympathy, but alertness
and arousal for pursuit,

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:55.230
then a tilt of the seesaw
at least to some degree

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:58.050
for arousal of the sort
that we typically hear

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.130
of sexual arousal.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:04.650
Then at the point of orgasm
and ejaculation is back

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.230
to a sympathetic response.

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.700
And how can I say that?
How do I know that?

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.080
The sympathetic nervous
system meaning neurons

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.540
within the sympathetic arm of
the autonomic nervous system

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.483
are what drive ejaculation and orgasm.

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:20.840
And then afterward there's a return

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.050
to increased parasympathetic activation.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.640
And we don't know for
sure why that happens,

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.770
but it's thought that in
species that pair bond,

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.320
humans generally pair bond, not always,

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.950
there the return to more
parasympathetic activation

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.870
after orgasm and ejaculation
is thought to increase

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:43.150
the exchange of pheromonal
orders, odors, excuse me,

01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:45.660
and to increase pillow
talk and pair bonding

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.892
of different kinds, okay?

01:03:46.892 --> 01:03:51.892
So that's the seesaw going back
and forth is actually built

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.140
into the process by which our
entire species propagates.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:02.140
So in some ways, every human
is required to navigate

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.320
that process if they want
their offspring to persist.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.820
And of course, nowadays
there are technologies like

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:12.620
in vitro fertilization,
intrauterine insemination,

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.170
there are a variety of ways
that technology has allowed

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:17.900
people to circumvent the
actual physical mating process

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.180
in the way that I described.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.810
But by and large, that's
the way it it's done.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:23.940
And certainly that's the
way it was done historically

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.730
for if not tens of thousands

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.790
or hundreds of thousands of years.

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.950
That process is also what happens

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.790
in all mammalian species that mate.

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.500
Okay, so I'm overlooking
an entire literature

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.870
of animal studies that classic
studies of this were done

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:42.790
by two individuals, I'll
just briefly mention them

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:45.010
in case you want to
look at the literature.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:47.750
There's a guy at the
Rockefeller University named

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:52.420
Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, who
has done beautiful studies

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.850
identifying the neural circuitry,

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.070
what's called the lordosis response.

01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:59.610
Unlike in humans, the
mating behavior of animals

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.840
is rather stereotyped in
terms of the positions

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.750
that they occupy.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:05.490
And the lordosis response is a U-shaping

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:08.900
or a bending up of the hindquarters
of typically of rodents,

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:10.430
but of other animals as well.

01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:13.670
The the male mounting is
almost always from behind

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:15.570
except in some species of primates.

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:19.550
And that lordosis response
is only going to occur

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:22.360
during particular phases
of the estrous cycle.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.070
The estrous cycle is the
analog to the menstrual cycle,

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.430
but it's not 28 days, it's four
days or some other duration

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.760
in other animals, depending on the animal.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.050
The lordosis response is
strongly regulated by odors,

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:40.170
by contact and is estrogen
and testosterone controlled.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:45.170
And then the male portion of
the mating sequence in animals,

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:47.790
the mounting and thrusting and
ejaculation as they're called

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:50.010
or mounting, thrusting,
intromission and ejaculation.

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:51.780
Those are the four scientific categories

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.800
that have been described,

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.250
that's presence in
rodents and also in dogs

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.460
where it was primarily
studied by Frank Beach,

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:01.710
who was at University
of California, Berkeley

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:02.580
for a long time.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.020
And the entire literature
around the neural circuitry

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.390
for sexual mating behavior
in animals largely stemmed

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.550
from the work of Donald
Pfaff and Frank Beach

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:17.360
and their scientific offspring,
not their actual offspring.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.650
You can look at that
literature, if you like.

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:23.730
There have been human neuroimaging
studies of the process

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:26.380
that I described a few minutes
ago, believe it or not,

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.580
of people in brain scanners,
not necessarily mating

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.603
with other people, but going
through that arc of arousal,

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:39.000
sympathetic activation
during orgasm or ejaculation

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.460
and then the post-ejaculatory
or orgasmic phase

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.710
in both men and women.

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:46.630
And the brain areas associated with those

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.530
have all been mapped out now.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:54.480
The spinal cord areas that
control things like erection,

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.120
vaginal lubrication,
ejaculation and orgasm,

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.680
those have also been mapped out.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.900
And this has all been
explored from the perspective

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.480
of both basic science, just
to get an understanding

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.830
of how our species has sexual
interactions and reproduces,

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.410
but also from the
perspective of, for instance,

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:14.810
trying to repair sexual function
after spinal cord injury,

01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:18.110
which is a prominent
concern for a lot of people,

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:19.780
depending on where they have their injury,

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.870
but in the number of people
that have spinal cord injuries.

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:27.373
So this is both vital
biological and clinical data.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.510
The neural circuits for
everything that I just described

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:35.670
reside in the autonomic nervous
system and are coordinated

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:38.370
with the neural circuits that
are associated with empathy.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:41.440
The neural circuits for
empathy, again, there are many,

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.630
but mainly two structures
that you should know about,

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:44.690
the prefrontal cortex,

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:47.470
which is how we perceive
things outside of us

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:49.920
and make decisions on the
basis of those perceptions,

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.080
how we organize those decisions,

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.530
and an area of the brain
called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:08:00.300
The insula is a really interesting
brain area that allows us

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:03.280
to interocept, to pay attention
to what's going on inside

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.200
our body and to split some of
our attention, to exterocept.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.140
And the mating dance, whether
or not it's the dinner

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:12.388
and date portion of the mating dance,

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:15.060
or the actual physical dance
part of the main dance,

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:20.060
or actual mating and sexual
behavior, kissing or otherwise,

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:25.040
that is a coordinated
activity of two bodies,

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.100
typically it's two.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.320
I realize sometimes it's
more, sometimes it's only one,

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.610
but typically it's two bodies
at least in the framework

01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:33.290
we're using here.

01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:35.310
That coordinated dance is one

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:38.440
in which the autonomic nervous
system of one individual

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:41.750
in general is coordinating with
the autonomic nervous system

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.940
of the other individual.

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:47.430
And the insula is essentially
splitting one's attention

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:52.200
between how we feel
ourselves, how our body feels,

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.510
what we're thinking with the thinking

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:57.340
and the bodily sensations of the other.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:00.380
And that can be communicated,
obviously, through words,

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.330
it can be communicated through sounds,

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:03.576
it can be communicated through touch,

01:09:03.576 --> 01:09:05.860
and it can be communicated
through a number

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:10.340
of more subtle cues like
pupil size or whether or not,

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.390
certainly in cases where
we recognize the person

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.640
and we know their responses,
their autonomic responses

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.473
under different conditions.

01:09:16.473 --> 01:09:18.910
We can assess, is the person comfortable?

01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:20.068
Are they uncomfortable?

01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:23.210
Are they more focused
on me or on themselves?

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.910
This is the coordinated silent dance that

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.630
if we look out in neurobiological terms,

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:32.820
we can really see is all about
the autonomic nervous system,

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:37.160
whether or not it's time to
tip the seesaw to one side

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.650
or the other, depending on
whether or not the other person's

01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:42.450
seesaw is tilted higher
or lower than the other.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.260
Okay, so we have the
autonomic nervous system,

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.720
and then we have this thing
that we're calling empathy,

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.450
which is really about autonomic matching.

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:52.030
And again, the insula
and the prefrontal cortex

01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:55.740
are neural circuits that are
crucial for autonomic matching,

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.480
because they allow us to
say, what's out there,

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.480
and do I want to match to it or not? Okay?

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.440
And then the third
category of neural circuit

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.920
that Helen Fisher and others
have found to be important

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.160
for desire, love and attachment
is the neural circuit

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.320
associated with self-delusion.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.693
What do we mean by that?

01:10:13.693 --> 01:10:18.693
Well, first of all, self-delusion
implies a kind of cynicism

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.670
about love and attachment.

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:24.617
And I think it was George
Bernard Shaw that said,

01:10:24.617 --> 01:10:26.900
"Love is really about overestimating

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.240
the differences between individuals."

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.535
Actually, when I hear
that, and as I say it,

01:10:30.535 --> 01:10:32.870
I really don't like that quote.

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:34.930
I have no bone to pick
with George Bernard Shaw,

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:39.143
but what it suggests and I
think what he meant was that,

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.850
in love and attachment, we
tend to put so much value

01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:46.960
in the other that we forget
that many of the processes

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.150
that are going on in our brain and body

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:51.760
actually could be evoked
by many other people too.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.060
But I think it somewhat
overlooks the enormous power

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.400
of attachment and the ways
in which somebody's smell,

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.860
somebody's voice, somebody's everything,

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.300
or somebody's particular
thing or things can really

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.380
become so vital for our
autonomic nervous system

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.020
to feel soothed and to
feel elated, et cetera.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.680
So I think that while
the quote is accurate,

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.643
in the one sense, I think it does overlook

01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:19.700
the neural circuits for attachment

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.180
and just how deeply wired
those can become for us.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:27.290
So I will balance that quote
with an enormous number

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:30.230
of other quotes that I won't
mention, but that you can find

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:35.230
out there that really point to
how incredible the person is

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.100
that one tends to be attached
to that there's really

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.090
only one or several people
that could ever exist

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:43.640
that could evoke those feelings from us.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.470
And of course you can
read your Neruda poetry,

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.090
and you can find these
things all over the place,

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:51.440
in music, and poetry, and writing.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.040
So for every cynical quote
about these neural circuits

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.990
being generic and could
be activated by anybody,

01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:02.600
I think you'll find an ample
number of opposing quotes

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.930
that these neural circuits
can only be activated

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:07.820
by that special someone,
or that particular person,

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:10.060
or maybe in just a small
set of those people.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.475
So what of delusion?

01:12:11.475 --> 01:12:16.475
Well, the work of Helen Fisher
and others has really pointed

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.240
to the fact that desire,
love and attachment

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.530
are three separate phases

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.420
of what we call romantic relationships.

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:29.150
That typically, not always,
but typically desire tends

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.423
to come first or falls in the early phase.

01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:36.900
That the process of
romantic/sexual interactions,

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.760
it doesn't necessarily
have to be sex itself,

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.140
but certainly something
that involves intimacy

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.180
of some kind, right?

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.940
And generally touch of some kind,

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.280
eventually transitions
into what we call love,

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.070
which eventually transitions
into what we call attachment.

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:56.570
And I should just mention
touch because touch

01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:59.640
is a fundamental aspect
of this whole process.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.340
There's an article, a research
article, I should say,

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.173
the title of it is,

01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:06.640
"Relationship-specific
Encoding of Social Touch

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.100
in Somatosensory and Insular Cortices."

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.110
Cortices being cortex.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:13.980
Cortex's plural, cortices.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:16.130
And again, there's our friend the insula.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.930
So this is a study that
explored what brain areas

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:23.620
and what body areas are
activated by specific forms

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.780
of attachment and social touch.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:29.190
And what they found not
surprisingly is that the areas

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.560
of the brain that are
associated with touch,

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.630
the somatosensory areas,
but more interestingly,

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:38.630
the insular cortex are
strongly activated by touch.

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:42.140
So touch in the amount of
touching, and proximity,

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.570
and skin contact, not
surprisingly activates brain areas

01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:48.450
associated with somatosensory, touch,

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.740
but also the insular cortex, which again,

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:53.700
is this brain area that links the internal

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.557
or feelings about what's
going on inside us

01:13:55.557 --> 01:13:58.910
and at the surface of our
skin with events external.

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:02.030
And they found activation
of a number of brain areas,

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:05.660
the amygdala, orbitofrontal
cortex, and so on and so on.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.470
That's not as essential
as just understanding

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:11.250
that the insular is the place
in which we start to take

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:13.790
our experience of our internal landscape,

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:16.750
attach that to our perceptions
of the external landscape,

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:20.250
and then assign that
a value or assign that

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:21.890
some sort of interpretation.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:26.890
And positive delusion is
predictive of long-term attachment.

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:29.640
What do we mean by positive delusion?

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.870
Positive delusion is the contradiction

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:34.526
of that George Bernard Shaw quote.

01:14:34.526 --> 01:14:38.630
It's the belief that only this person

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:40.209
can make me feel this way.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:44.620
This other person holds the
capacity to make me feel

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.750
this way physically or
emotionally or both.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:52.750
And so, as we move from
desire to love to attachment,

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:56.360
our brain circuitry is literally
getting tuned up such that

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.130
that individual that we
happen to be attached to,

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:01.520
again, here thinking about
monogamous relationships,

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.600
but I guess for non-monogamous
relationship individuals

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.310
is and are the way in which
our autonomic nervous system

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:11.170
can be regulated.

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:14.240
They actually get access
to our control panel.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.091
So it's our autonomic
nervous system empathy

01:15:16.091 --> 01:15:19.570
and this positive delusion.

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:21.142
Now positive delusion is critical.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:25.870
If you look at the stability
of relationships over time,

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:27.850
something that's been extensively studied

01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:31.640
mainly by psychologists, but
now also by neurobiologists,

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.300
what you find is that
there are some key features

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.502
of interactions between
individuals that predict

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.560
that a relationship will last.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.080
And those are many,

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.460
but mainly fall under this
category of positive delusions.

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.980
I'll return to those in what
those exactly look like.

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.900
But there are also just a
handful of things that predict

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.350
that a relationship will fail over time.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.210
This is largely the work of the Gottman's,

01:15:58.210 --> 01:15:59.790
is actually a husband and wife team

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.250
up at the University of
Washington in Seattle.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.240
The Gottman's have, run a laboratory

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.050
in the department of
psychology for a long time.

01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:09.670
They've also done a lot of public facing

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:11.620
work around relationships.

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.630
And they've talked about
the various aspects

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.910
of relationships and
interactions between people

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:20.310
that predict either staying
together or breaking up.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:24.080
So much so that they've
established a method

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.950
by which they can look at video
interactions between couples

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:30.980
and with very high degree
of certainty predict

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.720
whether or not those
couples will stay together

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.020
or break up over time.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.510
And they've identified what they call

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:37.950
the four horsemen of relationships.

01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:40.581
These are things that essentially,

01:16:40.581 --> 01:16:45.180
almost always predict that
a couple will break up.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:49.470
And I think the current
number on this is that Gottman

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:53.110
can predict divorce with 94% accuracy,

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:55.140
which if you think about
is pretty remarkable.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.940
So even though these are
purely psychological studies,

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.530
I'm not aware of any analysis
of underlying physiology,

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:05.320
there are some things that they
can observe between couples

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.020
that can lead them to predict
whether or not a couple

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:11.420
will stay together or
break up with 94% accuracy.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.800
So what are those things?

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.370
Those four behaviors, what
they call the Four Horsemen

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:18.690
of the Apocalypse
[laughs] for relationships

01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:24.791
are one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling,

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.570
and four, contempt, with
contempt being the most powerful

01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:34.100
predictor of breaking up.

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:38.450
Criticism, of course, does
not mean that there's no place

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.920
for criticism in stable relationships.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.370
Of course, there is.

01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:44.670
Has to do with how
frequent and how intensely

01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:46.150
that criticism is voiced.

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:49.400
Defensiveness, of
course, is defensiveness.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:54.280
We know as the lack of
ability to hear another

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.560
or to adopt their stance.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.020
So lack of empathy,

01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.430
I think is one way to
interpret defensiveness.

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:03.260
Stonewalling, which is
actually another form

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.140
of lack of empathy.

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.220
It's a turning off of this neural circuit

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:09.230
that's so critical for
desire, love and attachment.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:13.610
The stonewalling essentially
means the emotional response

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.540
or the request of another
is completely cut off.

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:18.840
So it's, I don't think there's
been brain imaging of this,

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:21.725
but I think, we can reasonably
imagine that it involves

01:18:21.725 --> 01:18:25.960
untethering your insular
response from the other

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.950
and what they're dealing with,

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:29.764
and focusing your insular response,

01:18:29.764 --> 01:18:33.310
[giggles] no pun intended,
on your own internal state

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:36.020
or perhaps the state of
someone else entirely.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.430
I'll talk about infidelity in a moment.

01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:38.600
And then contempt.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.149
And contempt has actually been referred

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.300
to as the sulfuric acid of relationship.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.870
I didn't say that, but
Gottman and colleagues have.

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:48.480
That it is such a powerful predictor

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.810
of divorce and breakups in the future.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:55.350
And contempt, of course, by
definition is the feeling

01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:57.870
that a person or thing
is beneath consideration,

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.850
worthlessness or deserving scorn.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:03.520
And apparently they can
identify this in the videos

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.170
of couples having
discussions and interacting

01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:11.170
by very elaborate eye rolls,
by expressions of anger

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:14.750
in one individual when their
partner is actually expressing

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.990
enthusiasm or excitement about something.

01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:20.040
It's the, oh yeah, you would say that,

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.500
or deep seated resentment
toward the other,

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:28.280
so much so that it's apparent
that one actively dislikes

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.253
the other partner.

01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:33.990
So contempt, disregard for
something that should be taken

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:36.210
into account is the other
way to think about it.

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:39.440
That runs counter to all
of the neural circuits,

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.730
all three of the neural circuits

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:41.750
that we talked about before.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:45.340
It certainly, it is the
antithesis of empathy.

01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:47.550
It is anything but a positive delusion.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:49.550
It's really looking at
the other individual,

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:51.490
either accurately or inaccurately

01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:54.030
as somebody that you despise.

01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:58.390
And then it is an absolute
inversion of the autonomic

01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:00.840
seesaw matching that I
was talking about before.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.610
It's a dissociating of your
seesaw from their seesaw.

01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:05.150
They're very excited about something,

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:06.940
you're unexcited by it.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:09.160
In fact, it's an inversion of their seesaw

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.893
where they're excited, you're down.

01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:14.930
They're down, you are up, okay?

01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:19.640
So it's basically an inversion
of all of the neural circuits

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.740
that Helen Fisher and others
have identified as critical

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.330
for desire, love, and attachment.

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:28.300
And therefore it's not
surprising that it is so strongly

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.510
predictive of breakups,

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:32.130
and in the case of married
couples, of divorce.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:33.541
For those of you that are
interested in the work

01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:37.040
of the Gottman's and similar work,

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.220
they've written several popular books.

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.860
They're fairly easy to find.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.020
We can link to one of
those in the caption.

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.010
But they've also developed

01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:48.500
some quite interesting online resources

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.500
in their so-called Love Lab.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.590
I guess it's fortunate that
they didn't call it the Hate Lab

01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:54.430
or the Breakup Lab,

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:56.940
'cause they focused a lot
on what predicts breakups.

01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.320
But they've also written
extensively and researched

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.550
extensively in peer-reviewed studies

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:08.190
what makes people find
appropriate partners for them,

01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:12.470
and to maintain those
partnerships over time.

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:15.080
So you can go, you can
search for Love Lab,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.100
University of Washington, Gottman,

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.370
or any number of their various books.

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:22.163
I think you'll find some
useful resources there.

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:27.173
I want to shift back to
the work of Helen Fisher.

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:31.150
She's made some very
interesting statements

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:33.330
and some very interesting observations

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:35.840
that at least to my mind map very well

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.470
onto the knowledge of neural
circuitry both in humans

01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:41.630
and in non-human primates
and in other species.

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:44.683
I realize that she's the
only name in the game.

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:49.800
But she's made some observations
that I think are very,

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.620
as we say, parsimonious, meaning
they allow us to organize

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:55.710
a lot of this stuff into
some distinct frameworks.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.472
Now, she's also done some
really beautiful studies

01:21:58.472 --> 01:22:02.320
that involve data from millions
or even tens of millions

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.020
of individuals on dating sites.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:05.340
So I'm going to share
those with you in a moment.

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:10.340
But before I do that, I just
want to paraphrase Dr. Fisher,

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:16.650
who said that sex drive
or desire that the pursuit

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:19.920
of someone to mate with,
meaning to mate, the verb,

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.920
not necessarily to find a mate, may be,

01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:28.010
she didn't say definitively,
but may be a way to forage

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.570
for potential love partners
that the arc of this

01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:34.580
whole business is really the
order that we're describing it,

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:39.410
that it's desire, then
love, and then attachment.

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:43.120
And that oftentimes
people can get confused.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.670
You may know some of these people,

01:22:44.670 --> 01:22:48.400
you may be one of these individuals
who might confuse desire

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.400
for attachment or might
confuse love for attachment,

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:56.780
but that there's a sequence of recruitment

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.640
of these neural circuits
that's established first

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.440
from the pursuit of someone to mate with.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.830
And she's placed us in the
context of more modern dating

01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:11.040
themes where depending on
culture, people might explore

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.990
several, maybe many,
many individuals before,

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:18.770
quote, unquote, settling
down with somebody,

01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:21.100
at least for some period of time.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.480
I think that's an interesting framework

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.480
because it circumvents a lot
of the, frankly, unanswerable

01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:32.330
questions about whether
or not humans were meant

01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:34.220
to be monogamous or whether
or not they weren't.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.110
Those are conversations
that hold cultural context,

01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:39.770
that hold all sorts of context,

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:42.750
that really can't be addressed
in a laboratory setting.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:46.760
But this idea that sex
drive is a way to forage

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.300
for potential love partners
and that love is a litmus test

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.640
for whether or not longer
term or deeper attachments

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.380
can and will form, is one that
at least makes sense to me.

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.446
Later in the episode, we'll
talk about this notion

01:24:00.446 --> 01:24:02.770
of sex drive and desire.

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:06.950
I'll actually talk about some
tools that have very strong

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:10.360
data really to support them
in terms of things that people

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.483
can do or take to increase
libido, both men and women,

01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:17.350
because there's actually
quite good data on that now.

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:20.490
But in the meantime, I want
to talk about some of the work

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.330
that Dr. Fisher has done in terms

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.260
of categorizing people into...

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.160
Again, we have four groups.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.300
These are distinct from the A, B, C, and D

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.220
attachment styles described earlier.

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:33.660
Although as I describe them,

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.400
you might be able to map
them somewhat onto those.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.400
And these four groups are
groups that were defined

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:44.960
through her studies of
people that were, or are,

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.600
I don't know if they were or
if they are still on match.com,

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.640
but a very extensive dataset.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.160
So again, millions if not tens
of millions of individuals.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.670
The number I heard her quote,

01:24:56.670 --> 01:24:59.270
and forgive me if this is not accurate,

01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:02.713
is that in upwards of
40 million individuals,

01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:06.850
in terms of whether or
not their neurochemical

01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:08.810
and hormone systems are tuned

01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:11.023
toward particular types of behaviors.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.330
What do I mean by that?

01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:17.240
Well, both men and
women, males and females

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.300
have both testosterone and estrogen.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:22.030
Typically, again, these
are averages, but typically

01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:24.680
men have more testosterone
than they do estrogen,

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.920
and they have more
testosterone than do women,

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.650
and less estrogen then do women.

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:30.660
Typically women have more estrogen

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:33.223
than they do testosterone,
again, averages.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.270
And they have less testosterone than men,

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:40.900
more estrogen than men,
and so on and so forth.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.950
But both hormone systems are active

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:46.450
in both sets of individuals.

01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:50.310
And of course, all
humans, as far as we know,

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:53.080
manufacture both dopamine and serotonin.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.580
Dopamine, as I mentioned
earlier, has a number of effects

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.413
in the brain and body.

01:25:57.413 --> 01:25:59.440
But one of the primary
effects is that it places us

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.400
into states of motivation and
pursuit for various things.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.660
There is somewhat close
relationship between the dopamine

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:11.800
system and the testosterone
system in the hypothalamus,

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.360
this brain area above
the roof of your mouth.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.610
And the pituitary gland,
which is responsible

01:26:15.610 --> 01:26:20.223
for making hormones that make
the ovaries and or testes,

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.194
secrete testosterone or estrogen.

01:26:23.194 --> 01:26:27.567
So there's a lot of signaling
that occurs such that dopamine

01:26:27.567 --> 01:26:31.660
and testosterone tend to
operate as close cousins

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.400
in a system of pursuit.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.350
And conversely, the serotonin
system tends to on average

01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:41.250
collaborate with the estrogen
system to impart certain

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:43.460
physiological functions and behaviors.

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:48.410
So these aren't hard and fast,
or I guess better stated,

01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:51.450
these aren't strict black
and white categorizations,

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:53.510
but I think those general themes hold

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:56.520
when you look at the
animal and human data.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.520
So Dr. Fisher has taken some
liberties, but I think they are

01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:04.210
what I would call logically,
and scientifically,

01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:06.790
and neurobiologically grounded liberties

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:10.570
in classifying individuals
who are on these dating sites

01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:13.010
according to the types
of things they report

01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:15.500
about themselves and the
type of people they tend

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:19.110
to match with on these dating sites,

01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:21.163
and created these four categories.

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:25.068
The four categories are, she calls one,

01:27:25.068 --> 01:27:27.770
the dopamine category.

01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:30.470
So these are people who
would have high dopamine.

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:34.000
And again, that's just a name.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.810
It doesn't mean they
have low anything else,

01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:39.490
but they are high on the dopamine scale.

01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:43.440
People who rate high on the
dopamine scale tend to be

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.190
what the scientists and psychologists call

01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:47.090
high sensation seeking, novel seeking.

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.840
They like new things,
they like spontaneity,

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.490
they tend to be very adventurous.

01:27:51.490 --> 01:27:52.940
And I think that's largely true.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:55.100
If you look at the conditions

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.500
where dopamine is super physiological,

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.710
it's elevated beyond abnormal levels.

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:06.500
Things like mania or when
people take certain drugs

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.690
of abuse, like cocaine or amphetamine

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:12.550
that really raise dopamine
levels up very, very high.

01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:15.630
For some period of time,
they do tend to increase

01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:18.090
energy motivation and novelty seeking.

01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:20.100
And of course, drugs like
amphetamine and cocaine

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.160
have all sorts of deleterious effects

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.210
that I don't need to go into here,

01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:24.900
but it's worth pointing out.

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.300
But they don't tend to make
people calm and relaxed

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.730
and seek soothing interactions.

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:34.160
Conversely, the group
that Dr. Fisher calls

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:39.160
the serotonin group
tend to be more grounded

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.430
in soothing activities,
quiescent type activities.

01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:45.610
They actually tend to be, on average,

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:47.790
they tend to like rules and follow rules,

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:50.220
they tend to be homebodies,
this sort of thing.

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:53.690
They're really, you can
imagine them this stable types,

01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:55.010
but they really like stability.

01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:57.320
They're not really into
spontaneity as much,

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.350
again, averages.

01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:01.420
And then she created two other categories,

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:04.630
the testosterone category
of high testosterone.

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:07.640
This again, could be males or females.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.810
And then the estrogen category,

01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:12.110
again, could be males or females.

01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:13.917
And she gave these different names

01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:15.730
that I won't go into here.

01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:17.020
You can look up her work online,

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:20.480
but she names like the
director, and the follower,

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.313
and things like that.

01:29:21.313 --> 01:29:23.040
But I don't really want to use
those as much as I want to stick

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.660
to the biological terms.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:28.470
So we have dopamine, serotonin,
testosterone, and estrogen.

01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:32.757
Now that might seem like an
unfair overgeneralization,

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.890
but what's interesting is
not necessarily the name

01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:38.650
or the neurochemical system, right?

01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:41.350
Those could have just been
called category one, two, three

01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:45.320
and four for all that matters here.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.560
What is interesting is seeing
how those different groups

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:53.290
of individuals that she
absolutely can categorize

01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:57.120
based on their self-reported preferences

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.960
about behaviors and certain
kinds of interactions.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.080
How those groups tend
to pair up with people

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.410
in the same or opposite categories.

01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:08.510
So what her studies reveal
is that people that fall

01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:11.100
into the high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking,

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.430
spontaneity category,
the one that she calls

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:17.640
the high dopamine category
tend to pair up with, at least

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.190
in the short term, tend
to pair up with people

01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:23.760
who are also in that
dopaminergic category.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.990
So these would be people
that would spontaneously

01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:30.030
take a trip or explore
something new or new restaurant.

01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:34.490
They tend to be creative
and explorative types.

01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:39.490
So that group on average
tends to date and mate,

01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:42.370
and potentially form long-term

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:44.470
relationships within category.

01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:46.040
Again, averages.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.930
Individuals that she placed
into the serotonin group

01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:52.960
or what she hypothesized would
be a high serotonin group,

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.388
again, they didn't measure serotonin,

01:30:54.388 --> 01:30:59.388
but people that tend to place
value on stability, on rules,

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.840
on certain forms of
traditional organization

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.590
at home and in relationships,

01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:10.580
those people also tended to
pair up with select date,

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.720
we presume mate with and
form stable relationships

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.280
with people in the same category.

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.780
Now, individuals in the
other two categories,

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:21.560
the high testosterone group,

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.520
and again, testosterone wasn't measured,

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.570
but she called it the
high testosterone group,

01:31:25.570 --> 01:31:30.570
but these are people that
tend to be very directive,

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:33.330
they tend to know what they
want and are comfortable telling

01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.570
other people what they want.

01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:40.570
And from them, these are
individuals that in her studies

01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:44.240
and in other studies tend to
be a little bit challenging,

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.230
meaning they not necessarily
challenging to be around,

01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:49.490
but they tend to challenge other people,

01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:52.770
push them in order to
expand their boundaries,

01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:55.890
either for sake of the
relationship or just in general.

01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:57.730
And the people they tend
to push are the people that

01:31:57.730 --> 01:31:59.810
they pair up with, which are the people

01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:02.340
in the estrogen category,
what she called high estrogen.

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:03.840
Again, they didn't measure estrogen,

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.630
but the people in the estrogen
category were the ones

01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:10.900
that described themselves
and their choices in life

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.520
and their preferences as being nurturing.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.070
They actually seem to
like it when someone else

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:19.800
is making the major
decisions, not every decision.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.160
They certainly like to
be heard, of course,

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.470
in terms of their preferences.

01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:27.107
But that those two types, what
she called the testosterone

01:32:27.107 --> 01:32:29.830
and the estrogen type tend to pair up.

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:31.357
So why are these categorizations

01:32:31.357 --> 01:32:33.630
and these averages interesting to me,

01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:36.300
at least interesting
enough to convey to you?

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.940
The reason they're interesting to me is,

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.490
again, not because of their names,

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:43.270
these molecules were not
measured in these individuals,

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:46.530
but that they once again
bring us to the themes

01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:48.170
that we addressed before,

01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:51.550
which are the autonomic nervous
system and whether or not

01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:54.900
it tends to be shifted more
towards alertness in action

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.630
or more towards a stable
equilibrium or more towards calm,

01:32:59.630 --> 01:33:04.530
and whether or not individuals
are selecting for people

01:33:04.530 --> 01:33:07.430
who have autonomic nervous
systems that are more or less

01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:10.780
like theirs before they even meet, right?

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:13.960
So again, going back
to this seesaw analogy,

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.690
it's almost like people
who have the flat seesaw,

01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:19.650
alert but calm, but not extremely alert,

01:33:19.650 --> 01:33:24.650
not extremely overly calm in
situations but in the middle,

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.670
seem to be seeking out
people that are also

01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:31.370
at that autonomic equilibrium.

01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.770
People in the, what she
called the dopamine category,

01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:35.120
which are really can just be described

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.350
as high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking,

01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:39.070
they seem to want to
pair with one another.

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:42.570
So there's a selection for similar,

01:33:42.570 --> 01:33:45.730
in two of the groups, autonomic tone.

01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:50.410
I find that very interesting
because in that decision

01:33:50.410 --> 01:33:53.430
or that preference for
similar autonomic tone,

01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:58.291
it essentially eliminates
a lot of the requirement

01:33:58.291 --> 01:34:01.990
for figuring out how to match

01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:03.344
one's autonomic nervous system to another.

01:34:03.344 --> 01:34:07.610
They simply find someone with
a similar tendency, okay?

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:10.600
Whereas in the other two
groups that she called

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.780
testosterone and estrogen,
the director type

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:16.270
and the nurturing somewhat follower type,

01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:19.020
there's an establishment of balance,

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:24.020
but not in between two who
individuals as a match,

01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:26.950
but rather on the whole
in the relationship.

01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:29.460
One person is driving the novelty seeking

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.000
in the course of decisions and actions,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.850
and the other person is
essentially agreeing to those.

01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:37.290
Now, assuming that those decisions
are good for both people.

01:34:37.290 --> 01:34:39.250
And I emphasize good for both people,

01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:42.020
because one of the themes
that Dr. Fisher underscores,

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.070
and I'd like to underscore here as well,

01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:48.830
is that it need not be the
case that people pair up

01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:51.030
exactly according to these categorizations

01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:53.740
that I've described,
dopamine with dopamine,

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.197
serotonin with serotonin,
testosterone with estrogen,

01:34:56.197 --> 01:34:57.760
and so on.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.960
What is important is that
there be a recognition

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.790
and a respect for the other types,

01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:06.580
or a recognition and a
respect for the fact that

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.200
both are of the same type.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.820
You could actually imagine,
for instance, that two people

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.060
of this high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.560
could have a terrifically
exciting relationship,

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.410
but that it actually
might be a relationship

01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:23.670
in which the financial
stability isn't quite there,

01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:27.050
or in which the basic
stability isn't there.

01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:30.700
You could imagine, for
instance, a situation

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:32.940
in which a relationship between two people

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:37.220
of what she called the
high serotonin preference

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.670
would have a relationship
that was actually dull,

01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:42.720
in which both of them found
themselves bored at some point,

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.480
or in which there wasn't
enough of the dynamic tension

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.040
that sometimes is required
in order to keep this cycle

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.580
of desire, love, and attachment going.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.060
Something that we will
talk about in a moment.

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:59.930
So the point here is not that
one should necessarily pair up

01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:02.940
according to these
arrangements that I described.

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:06.630
The point is that on average,
that's what tends to happen.

01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:10.710
And that through a recognition
that these categorizations

01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:15.320
exist similar to the
recognition that the type

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.970
A, B, C, and D infant and
toddler type attachments exist,

01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:23.690
that we can gain better
self-awareness of who we are

01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:26.830
and how we tend to show up
in romantic attachments,

01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:31.830
and thereby navigate
healthier mate seeking,

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.420
healthier breakups, if
the case dictates it,

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.380
and in some cases healthy
long-term relationships

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:42.470
by understanding that the other
person can either be similar

01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:44.720
or complimentary to us.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.100
One is neither better than the other.

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:50.720
It's simply the case that
in all romantic attachments,

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.580
from the initial inception
of the romantic attachment,

01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:58.120
desire, love, and attachment,

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.060
there is an autonomic coordination.

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.250
And of course there's
coordination of all sorts

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:07.900
of other things like food,
sex, and sleep, and finances,

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:10.660
and where people are going to
live, and many other features,

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.330
but that at the core of
all that is a seeking

01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:19.110
of either autonomic likeness
or autonomic differences.

01:37:19.110 --> 01:37:22.700
And I think that recognition
can be extremely valuable

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:27.110
in thinking about tools to enter
and maintain relationships.

01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:30.430
If one thinks about their
autonomic nervous system,

01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:34.430
not simply as something that
is driven by external people

01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:37.970
and events, but that we can
actually gain some control over

01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:40.440
through techniques of the sort
that I talked about earlier

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.880
and on previous podcasts,

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.170
but also generally, if
we are able to adjust

01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:49.230
our autonomic nervous system
in order to at least appreciate

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:53.160
or get some empathy into what
someone else is experiencing,

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.420
then we gain actual cognitive empathy.

01:37:56.420 --> 01:38:00.130
And this episode isn't
about empathy per se,

01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:01.920
but the theme keeps
coming up again and again.

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.330
And I think it's worth
mentioning that when you talk

01:38:04.330 --> 01:38:07.420
to psychologists, whether
or not they're psychoanalyst

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.010
or from another source of training,

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:12.350
what you find is that they
don't talk about empathy

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:16.670
as a general term, they will
talk about emotional empathy,

01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:18.340
they'll talk about cognitive empathy.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.250
And what I'm talking
about here today is that

01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:24.210
yet a third category that
is very strongly determinant

01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:27.960
of relationship dynamics,
and that's autonomic empathy.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.640
I'm a biologist, I'm not a psychologist.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.350
So I love mechanism.

01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:35.700
And fortunately there are
studies that have been done

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.880
recently using modern techniques

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.630
to look at neural mechanisms
of romantic attachment.

01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:44.810
I mentioned earlier some of
the brain imaging studies

01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:49.760
that have been done on child
and mother literally imaging

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.840
the activity of neurons in
the brain as child is nursing,

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.000
or as a mother is soothing baby,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.450
and as you learned earlier,
baby is soothing mother as well.

01:38:59.450 --> 01:39:00.420
Those are remarkable studies.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.120
You may have seen some
of these pictures online.

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.570
You can see the silhouette
of the infant and mother,

01:39:04.570 --> 01:39:07.370
and their brains and even
some of the brain activation

01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:09.630
patterns, really, really
beautiful studies.

01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:13.930
Similar studies have been
done in romantic couples

01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:17.170
with those couples, either
touching one another,

01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:20.720
touching and kissing,
or in clever, I think,

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.284
control experiments of the
person just touching a pillow,

01:39:23.284 --> 01:39:26.460
[laughs] or something, or kissing a pillow

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.510
in order to try and create
the most reasonable control

01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:31.960
for what are actually pretty

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.436
complicated interpersonal dynamics

01:39:33.436 --> 01:39:35.663
to do in a brain imaging scanner.

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:40.070
But some of the other studies
that have been done recently

01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:41.270
involved so called EEG.

01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:42.960
So these are electrical recordings

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.930
that are done noninvasively,

01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:47.570
putting a bunch of electrodes
on the outside of the scalp.

01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:52.340
EEG is useful in that you
can do it noninvasively,

01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:56.380
you can do it while people
are moving and doing things,

01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:58.850
kissing, touching, et cetera.

01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:03.160
It doesn't allow one to image
or to evaluate neural activity

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.640
very deeply in the brain.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.390
So you can miss out on a lot of things.

01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:08.920
It's like looking at the
wave structure on the ocean

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.320
without actually looking
into the depths of the ocean.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.640
So you can miss certain things,

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.020
but if you see things generally
you trust they're there,

01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.660
but you can't see what you don't see.

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:21.090
Nonetheless, there's some studies

01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:24.660
that I'll just point you
to and that form the segue

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:27.440
for what I'm going to discuss in a moment,

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.440
which is a study published in
Scientific Reports in 2021,

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.280
entitled "Investigating Real Life Emotions

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.960
in Romantic Couples: a Mobile EEG Study."

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.880
So this is, as the title
suggests, having people wear

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.880
these EEG caps of electrodes,
get engage in very passionate,

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.560
emotional kisses, emotional
speech toward one another

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.710
standing at different distances.

01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:54.160
So a lot of cool stuff that
you can do that you really

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.870
couldn't do in a brain scanner,
because in a brain scanner,

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:58.970
people have to be there
usually in a bite bar,

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:00.430
they're actually jaw flicked like this.

01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:02.420
I've been in one of these things.

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.850
There's not a lot of
moving around to be heard,

01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:07.070
at least not using the current technology.

01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:09.510
In any case, what they found was

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:14.230
there is a shift in brain
waves, brain states,

01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.760
things like alpha waves or
just a particular frequency

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.540
of brain waves in the
neocortex, the outer shell

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.190
of the brain just beneath the skull.

01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:26.680
And in people that are kissing
or in people that are engaged

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.190
in romantic speech, or I didn't
actually hear what they said

01:41:31.190 --> 01:41:34.540
to one another, but what
the couple seems exciting,

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:38.160
romantic and arousing to
them, they see more alpha wave

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.330
activity compared to
the control conditions.

01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:42.700
And there was some what
we call lateralization,

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.750
where the left hemisphere was
more active than the right

01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:45.583
and so forth.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:50.430
And these studies are
important because we know that

01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:53.450
the autonomic nervous
systems of individuals tend

01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:58.030
to start to collaborate
and actually synchronize

01:41:58.030 --> 01:42:01.260
at the level of heartbeats,
at the level of breathing

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.600
during romantic interactions
of different kinds.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.290
But these studies are some of the first

01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:06.550
of their kind to start looking

01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:09.920
at neural synchronization
between individuals.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:14.270
Now, the simple version of looking at this

01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:17.210
and the way I would've
thought this would all go was,

01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:19.640
okay, two people start
kissing, they start talking

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.590
about what they find particularly romantic

01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:22.423
and arousing for them.

01:42:22.423 --> 01:42:24.850
And their brain waves will
just match to one another.

01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:28.377
And that's really the basis
of romantic attachment

01:42:28.377 --> 01:42:32.300
and romantic engagement
in that sort of thing.

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:36.330
But it turns out that
the opposite is true.

01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:40.850
So a really nice study published
in a really fine journal,

01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:42.850
Cerebral Cortex is a
journal that I've known

01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:44.840
about for many years, they
published strong anatomy,

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.780
physiology and neuroimaging.

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.703
There's a study that was
published, first author, Kajimura,

01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:54.600
and this paper really points...

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.990
Again, this is 2021.

01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:58.627
And the title of this paper is,

01:42:58.627 --> 01:43:01.110
"Brain Knows Who Is on
the Same Wavelength:

01:43:01.110 --> 01:43:04.050
Resting-State Connectivity
Can Predict Compatibility

01:43:04.050 --> 01:43:06.410
of a Female-Male Relationship."

01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:08.840
Now what this study did
was a little bit different.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.750
They looked at the resting or default mode

01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:12.890
activity of the brain.

01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:15.920
So rather than evoked
activity, as it's called,

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.440
where people are kissing or
are engaged in some activity,

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.170
this was a neuroimaging
study, not EEG, but fMRI,

01:43:24.170 --> 01:43:25.830
functional magnetic resonance imaging,

01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:29.190
which is similar to EEG in principle,

01:43:29.190 --> 01:43:31.410
but allows you to look
deep into the brain.

01:43:31.410 --> 01:43:35.490
And it has a very good
resolution in time and space.

01:43:35.490 --> 01:43:40.000
So fast events can be monitored
and the precise location

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.640
of those events can be monitored
somewhat better than EEG.

01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.780
And there are exceptions to this.

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.380
So for you EEGers out there.

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:50.370
EEG don't come after me with electrodes.

01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:54.200
Just understand that fMRI
gives you a fuller picture

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:55.150
of what's going on.

01:43:55.150 --> 01:43:59.550
And what Kajimura et al
found was that contrary

01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:03.883
to what your reflexive
prediction might be,

01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:10.010
people tend to select people
that have resting brain states

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.990
that different than theirs,

01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:15.240
or sometimes they found
that are actually opposite

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.310
to their own resting brain state.

01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:19.360
And you might say, "Well,
that doesn't make any sense.

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.290
I thought this is all about
autonomic coordination."

01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:25.702
But actually if we go back to
Helen Fisher's categorizations

01:44:25.702 --> 01:44:28.650
of the dopamine types, the
sensation seeking types,

01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:33.210
that is serotonin, the
stable rule following types,

01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:34.530
testosterone and estrogen types,

01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:36.910
remember that the two
categories that she called

01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:38.180
testosterone and estrogen type,

01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.720
the director and the
follower, the nurturer,

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.180
I guess it would be the more accurate way,

01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:43.940
the director and the nurturer,

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.750
those tend to pair up across categories,

01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:48.460
not within category.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:51.460
And so I think what's
really needed for this field

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.700
which to my knowledge hasn't happened yet,

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:58.057
is to really start to
map the neuroanatomical

01:44:58.057 --> 01:45:01.160
and neurophysiological
findings of, in this case,

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:06.160
that resting brain state is
in one form in one individual,

01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:09.290
and they tend to seek out
people whose resting brain state

01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:11.930
is different than theirs, not similar.

01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:15.530
That needs to be mapped
onto the more subjective

01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:19.370
psychological categorizations
that Helen Fisher

01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:22.020
and indeed the Gottman's
and others have created,

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:24.030
that sort of the state of the field now.

01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:26.430
And I mentioned this not to confuse you,

01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:30.060
but to the contrary, to
illustrate that it's not just

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.100
about finding someone just like you,

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.430
and it's not just about finding someone

01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:35.920
who's opposite to you.

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.030
This is actually the reason
that I decided to become

01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:41.620
a biologist at some point
in my life, which is that

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:44.610
we can find verbal sayings,
and stories, and examples

01:45:44.610 --> 01:45:46.373
to support just about anything.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:49.180
This is not a knock on
the field of psychology,

01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:50.870
as you can probably tell
from today's episode.

01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:52.610
I have great respect for in reverence

01:45:52.610 --> 01:45:55.990
for the field of psychology,
especially its collaboration

01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:58.100
with neuroscience and vice versa.

01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:00.750
But in the popular culture,

01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:04.040
we can find examples and
sayings that support essentially

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.400
anything as it relates to a relationship.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.900
For instance, I've heard
and you've probably heard,

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.900
absence makes the heart grow fonder.

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:14.010
And indeed I've experienced
that and I believe it's true.

01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:16.410
But I also have experienced
and I believe to be true

01:46:16.410 --> 01:46:18.830
that out of sight out of mind also exists

01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:21.690
and that there will be a
biological mechanism for that.

01:46:21.690 --> 01:46:24.800
The point here is that
matching of same to same

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.558
or same to different can
both be effective in creating

01:46:27.558 --> 01:46:32.558
the desire, love, attachment process.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.160
It's a matter of, who is looking for same,

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.390
and who is looking for different?

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:40.150
And there, I think Dr. Fisher and the work

01:46:40.150 --> 01:46:42.730
of these neurophysiologist
and brain imagers

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:45.250
really does point in a direction whereby

01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:48.960
there is not one form of attachment

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.280
that is going to be
wholly above [indistinct]

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.120
will predict good outcomes.

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.550
There is not going to be a case
in which opposites attract,

01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.153
and that's always the best rule to follow.

01:46:58.153 --> 01:47:01.320
Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.320
There is also not the
case that people tend

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.340
to pair up with similar.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.140
Sometimes it will be the
case, sometimes it won't.

01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:09.673
Now there are certain statistics

01:47:09.673 --> 01:47:11.360
that support that statement.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.690
For instance, people, on average,

01:47:13.690 --> 01:47:17.320
people pair up with individuals
of similar educational

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.170
background, income, and attractiveness.

01:47:19.170 --> 01:47:22.420
That is true on average, but
it's not always the case.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.150
And again, a knowledge of and
a respect for the different

01:47:26.150 --> 01:47:28.786
categorizations of attachment,
the different categorizations

01:47:28.786 --> 01:47:31.610
of mate seeking described
by Fisher and others,

01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:34.390
and the recognition that
matching of autonomic nervous

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:38.600
systems but also mismatching
of resting state brain networks

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.650
are all at play in driving
what we are calling

01:47:41.650 --> 01:47:43.490
desire, love and attachment.

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:45.660
So in keeping with the
exploration of the fact that

01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:49.320
there's a saying, or a book,
or a song, or an example

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.483
of pretty much any relationship dynamic,

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.500
I want to now talk about an
article that came out a little

01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:00.500
over 10 years ago that talked
about the universality of love

01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:02.850
and the ability to fall in love.

01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:04.160
So this would be very much in line

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.610
with the George Bernard Shaw
quote that I mentioned earlier

01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:09.130
that "Love is really overestimating

01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:10.670
the differences between individuals."

01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:12.160
And again, I should say
that is not something

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.720
that I personally believe,

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.630
although maybe I'm just diluting myself.

01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:18.380
I like to think that the
people that we fall in love

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:21.980
with are really special for us,

01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:25.630
that they could not easily be
replaced with anybody else.

01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:26.980
That's simply my stance.

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:27.870
I'm not basing that

01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:31.610
on any hardcore neurobiological mechanism.

01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:35.240
But nonetheless, an article was published

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.390
in The New York Times in 2015 that related

01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:42.420
to some psychological
studies that were done,

01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.610
as well as some clinical
work, as well as some,

01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:48.180
what I would call pop
psychology or things that fall

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:50.730
outside the domains of academic science.

01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:55.340
And the whole basis of this article was

01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:58.980
36 questions that lead to love.

01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:03.420
And it involved a listing
out indeed of 36 questions,

01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:07.170
divided into set one, set two,
and set three that progressed

01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:11.390
from somewhat ordinary
questions about life experience

01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:13.743
and self-report to more,

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.142
let's call them deep questions
about people's values

01:49:18.142 --> 01:49:20.240
and things that are
emotionally close to them.

01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.990
And I'll just give an
example of a few of these.

01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:24.690
You can find this easily
online by just putting

01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:27.960
into your search engine, 36
questions that lead to love.

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.720
Some of the questions in set
number one, where for instance,

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.043
what would constitute
a perfect day for you?

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.120
For what in your life do
you feel most grateful?

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:38.690
Kind of standard questionnaire stuff.

01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:41.970
In set two, what is your
most treasured memory?

01:49:41.970 --> 01:49:43.420
What is your most terrible memory?

01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:46.020
So these, as you can tell, are
drilling a little bit deeper

01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.270
into one's personal experience
and emotional system.

01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:54.270
And then set three, questions
25 through 36 are things,

01:49:56.550 --> 01:50:00.280
what is a very embarrassing
moment in your life?

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.127
When did you last cry in
front of another person

01:50:03.127 --> 01:50:04.970
and by yourself?

01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:07.110
What is something that's too
serious to be joked about?

01:50:07.110 --> 01:50:11.010
So it's going deeper into
one's emotional system.

01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:13.780
And even questions like, of
all the people in your family,

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.690
whose death would you find
most disturbing and why?

01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:19.200
So pretty, pretty heavy
stuff there at the end.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.760
Now, the reason this article
got so much traction,

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.850
and the reason I'm bringing
it up today is that

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:27.440
there was a statement that
was made in and around

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:32.410
this article that if two
people went on a date

01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:36.520
or simply sat down and asked
each other these questions,

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.520
and each answered these questions
and the other was paying

01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:46.970
attention carefully and at some
level emotionally responding

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.683
or not out responding, but
certainly paying attention

01:50:48.683 --> 01:50:51.180
to the answers of the other person,

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:55.800
that by the end of that
exchange, where one person asks

01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:58.610
36 questions and the other
person answers all 36,

01:50:58.610 --> 01:51:01.920
and then the other person asks
all 36 and the other person

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.660
answers all 36, that they
would fall in love, right?

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:07.970
Which seems like a ridiculous thing.

01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:11.950
And yet it is the case that people who go

01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:16.400
through this exercise report
feeling as if they know

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.600
the other person quite well
and feeling certain levels

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.800
of attachment or even love and
desire for the other person

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.230
that they were, would not
have predicted, excuse me,

01:51:27.230 --> 01:51:29.260
would not have predicted

01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:31.220
had they not gone through that process.

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:32.578
So what's going on in
this exchange of questions

01:51:32.578 --> 01:51:36.670
and answers of a
progressively more emotional

01:51:36.670 --> 01:51:38.580
and deep level?

01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:41.310
Well, what I predict is
going on is that inside

01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:46.130
of that exchange, people are
creating a delusional story

01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:49.600
about the nature of the
exchange being a reflection

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.280
of some deeper attachment.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.010
And so even though people
are just exchanging words,

01:51:54.010 --> 01:51:57.770
they're not physically touching,
they are not, at least not

01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:00.738
at the point where they're
running these kinds

01:52:00.738 --> 01:52:02.563
of questionnaire studies.

01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:05.400
They may touch afterwards for all I know,

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.734
and probably did in some cases,

01:52:06.734 --> 01:52:09.780
but they're not exchanging life experience

01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.350
in an immediate way.

01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:13.190
They're not actually
going off into the world

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:15.060
and doing things together yet.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:17.840
They are simply exchanging narrative.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.760
But we know based on recent
studies and I've covered

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.190
this before on this podcast,
but I'll mention again,

01:52:24.190 --> 01:52:27.260
there was a study
published in Cell Reports,

01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:29.400
a Cell Press journal, excellent journal

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.930
showing that when individuals
listen to the same narrative,

01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:35.147
their heart rates tend to synchronize

01:52:35.147 --> 01:52:37.800
or at least follow a very similar pattern,

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.510
even if they're not in the same room

01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:41.150
listening to a given narrative.

01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:44.210
Whereas in this case, people
are facing one another

01:52:44.210 --> 01:52:46.690
listening to the narratives of each other.

01:52:46.690 --> 01:52:49.960
Certainly they are having
autonomic responses.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:53.150
And it stands to reason that
their autonomic nervous systems

01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:55.250
are synchronizing much
in the same way that

01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:58.410
the Cell Report study found
that people will synchronize

01:52:58.410 --> 01:53:01.740
their autonomic nervous
systems to a shared,

01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:03.850
heard story from another.

01:53:03.850 --> 01:53:06.280
In other words, whether
or not we hear a story,

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:08.520
watch a movie, listen to a song,

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.330
or exchange our own individual stories,

01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:13.600
our autonomic nervous
systems have the potential

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.040
to map onto one another.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:18.860
So I'm not all that
surprised that people find

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.870
that they fall in love, in quotes,

01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:24.240
after answering these
questions to one another,

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:25.880
because essentially
the way these questions

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.980
are laid out is they
establish a narrative.

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:30.930
They establish a very personal narrative

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:32.277
and the other person is
listening very closely.

01:53:32.277 --> 01:53:35.970
And we don't have physiological
or brain imaging studies

01:53:35.970 --> 01:53:38.670
to support what I'm about to say,

01:53:38.670 --> 01:53:42.120
but the reasonable interpretation is that

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:45.470
that's causing some
autonomic synchronization.

01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:48.800
So if you want to try this on
a date or even it's actually

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:51.400
been hypothesized that
this could be useful

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:54.990
for existing couples, even if
they already know the answers

01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:56.050
to some of these questions.

01:53:56.050 --> 01:53:57.780
And that doesn't surprise me either.

01:53:57.780 --> 01:53:59.850
I think the autonomic
coordination is present

01:53:59.850 --> 01:54:02.440
during mating behavior,

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:05.910
it's present during shared
experience of the outside world,

01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:08.810
movies, concerts, watching one's children

01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:10.031
with somebody else, et cetera.

01:54:10.031 --> 01:54:13.450
And it's established by
sharing one's own narrative

01:54:13.450 --> 01:54:15.170
of their own personal experience.

01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:17.430
So I don't want to seem
overly reductionist.

01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:21.530
I'll never propose that all
of our sensation, perception,

01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:25.020
action and experience in life
boils down to us just being

01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:28.060
bags of chemicals and the
action of those chemicals,

01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:29.253
or any aspect of our nervous system.

01:54:29.253 --> 01:54:34.253
And yet in looking across
the psychological literature

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.190
of development of attachment,
in the psychological

01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:40.090
literature of adult and
romantic attachment,

01:54:40.090 --> 01:54:43.410
and what makes and
breaks those attachments,

01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:44.880
it's very clear to me.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.400
And I think courses through
the literature multiple levels,

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.410
that autonomic coordination
is absolutely key

01:54:52.410 --> 01:54:55.660
for the establishment of
desire, love and attachment.

01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:58.580
In fact, I talked earlier
about how our actual conception

01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.870
is born out of autonomic coordination

01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:02.600
of one sort or another.

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:06.500
So again, it doesn't necessarily
mean that autonomic nervous

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:09.460
systems always be synchronized
in the case of the two

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.820
categorizations that Fisher proposed

01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:14.380
of the director/testosterone type

01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:19.380
and the nurturing follower/estrogen type.

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.670
It was actually the coordination
but in opposite directions

01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:27.330
of individuals that fall
into each of those categories

01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:28.643
that led to more stable attachments

01:55:28.643 --> 01:55:31.840
or the seeking out of those
attachments, I should say.

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.610
But nonetheless, it's, at
least to my mind, very clear

01:55:35.610 --> 01:55:39.390
that autonomic coordination
is a hallmark feature

01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:44.250
of desire, a hallmark
feature of what we call love,

01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:47.110
and a hallmark feature of
what we call attachment.

01:55:47.110 --> 01:55:51.060
And that the breaking of
attachments were the failures

01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.950
of desire, the failures of love,

01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:56.740
and the failures of attachment over time

01:55:56.740 --> 01:55:58.660
in line with the work
of Gottman and others.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:02.570
And in even just simply what's
required for mating behavior

01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:05.700
is also reflected in the
autonomic nervous system.

01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.910
But in that case, a failure to coordinate

01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:11.380
the autonomic nervous systems
in some sort of concerted way.

01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:14.240
Any discussion about
desire, love, and attachment

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:15.960
would be incomplete

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:20.420
if we didn't talk about the
dreaded infidelity and cheating.

01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.360
Much has been made of
infidelity and cheating

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.850
and whether or not people
who are higher on dopamine

01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:27.410
and sensation seeking tend
to cheat more or less.

01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:30.723
Frankly, I don't think there's
any solid evidence for that.

01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:33.710
I think there are a lot of
examples that we can draw

01:56:33.710 --> 01:56:36.830
from in our own lives and
in the lives of others

01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:39.590
that would generally support
one or the other model,

01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:43.410
but I'm not aware of any
decent physiological studies

01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:46.290
or psychological studies
that really point to that.

01:56:46.290 --> 01:56:50.060
For instance, I would never
say that the serotonergic

01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:54.800
phenotype as described by
Fisher is less prone to cheat,

01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.630
or that the people who
have an insecure attachment

01:56:58.630 --> 01:57:02.010
are more likely to cheat,
et cetera, for instance.

01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:04.450
I don't think those
correlations have been drawn

01:57:04.450 --> 01:57:05.880
in any kind of meaningful way yet.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:09.330
So I would be cautious
about assigning them

01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:11.400
without that evidence.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.640
However, there are some
interesting studies involving,

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.900
again, neuroimaging and some
subjective measures in humans,

01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.330
meaning asking them questions

01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:23.810
that they're good ways to
tease out lies from truths

01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:28.280
in these sorts of studies and
whether or not people tend

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:33.280
to find their partner or
others more or less attractive

01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:36.480
depending on how people
feel about themselves.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.470
And I think this is a
very interesting aspect

01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:42.403
to desire, love, and attachment
for the following reason.

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.140
You hear a lot out out there that in order

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.950
to form a really strong relationship,

01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:51.842
you have to have a good
relationship with yourself,

01:57:51.842 --> 01:57:54.420
or you have to love yourself.

01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:59.420
Or you often hear for instance
that it's exactly when you're

01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:02.020
not looking for a relationship
that you're going to find one.

01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.430
You hear this stuff, right?

01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:05.800
But none of that is really
grounded in any studies.

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.041
Again, that's like out
of sight out of mind,

01:58:07.041 --> 01:58:09.360
or absence makes the heart grow fonder.

01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.500
There are many life examples
to support those statements.

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.917
And there are many life examples

01:58:14.917 --> 01:58:17.233
to support statements to the opposite.

01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:21.700
There's a particular study that I found.

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:23.950
This was published in
Frontiers in Psychology,

01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:28.020
but it's a experimental study
that involves neuroimaging.

01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:31.780
The title of this study is
"Manipulation of Self-Expansion

01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:35.500
Alters Responses to Attractive
Alternative Partners."

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.190
And I love the design of this study.

01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:40.540
What they did in this
study is they took couples

01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:44.560
and they evaluated members
of that relationship

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.078
for what's called self-expansion.

01:58:46.078 --> 01:58:50.540
Now self-expansion is
a metric that involves

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:53.380
one's perception of self

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.830
as seen through the
relationship to the other.

01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:59.900
And this is something
that was developed by,

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:02.380
the authors are Aron and Aron.

01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.480
So they have the same last name.

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:05.950
So I'm assuming this was
either a sibling team

01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:10.210
or a somehow related team
or a romantic couple team.

01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:15.210
A-R-O-N and A-R-O-N,
Aron and Aron, in 1986,

01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:18.710
proposed this self-expansion
model of close relationships.

01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:20.640
And they proposed "That
people are motivated

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:21.720
to enter relationships..."

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:22.553
I'm reading here.

01:59:22.553 --> 01:59:25.830
"In order to enhance the self
and increase self-efficacy."

01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:28.780
In other words, that one of
the reasons why many people

01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:31.100
enter relationships is
that it makes us feel good

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:32.460
about ourselves and more capable.

01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:34.900
And I would see that as a
healthy interdependence,

01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:36.623
not necessarily codependence.

01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:39.961
This is especially strong at the beginning

01:59:39.961 --> 01:59:41.590
of a relationship, it turns out,

01:59:41.590 --> 01:59:43.690
when people are forming pair bonds,

01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:48.340
and it's the case that pleasure,
arousal and excitement,

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.690
again, all hallmark features

01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:52.490
of autonomic nervous system function,

01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:54.543
pleasure, arousal and excitement,

01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:59.140
give rise to self-expansion,
meaning to self-efficacy.

01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:02.970
So what this self-expansion
model is really about is

02:00:02.970 --> 02:00:06.150
how great other people that we
are close to and romantically

02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:09.470
attached to can potentially make us feel,

02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:12.730
in terms of what they say,
in terms of what they do,

02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:17.730
in terms of the way in which
we believe they feel about us.

02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:20.880
So it doesn't necessarily
have to involve explicit

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:24.070
statements of them telling
us how great we are,

02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:27.100
or them doing great gestures for us,

02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:30.280
but how we actually
feel they feel about us.

02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.780
Turns out to be a very
strong parameter in terms

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:36.250
of how we feel about ourselves
and the relationship overall.

02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:37.707
Now, some of you out there
are probably thinking,

02:00:37.707 --> 02:00:38.860
"Oh yeah, isn't there this thing

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:40.850
of the love languages?" Right?

02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:42.880
I don't have any neuroscience
to support, I think,

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:44.777
the love languages, I'm not
super familiar with this,

02:00:44.777 --> 02:00:48.020
and I didn't list it out,
but that some people are...

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.090
Their autonomic nervous
system, if you will,

02:00:52.090 --> 02:00:56.470
tends to be very responsive
to gifts, or to quality time,

02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:58.230
or to physical touch, or acts of kindness.

02:00:58.230 --> 02:00:59.310
I think I've got a few of these right.

02:00:59.310 --> 02:01:00.280
I probably have a few wrong.

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.670
Anyway, they're easy to find online.

02:01:01.670 --> 02:01:05.420
And people do tend to have
a bias toward two or three

02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:06.760
of these things that are especially

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.880
meaningful for them.

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.380
And when I hear meaningful,
I hear they tend to push

02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:12.970
the autonomic nervous system
and neurochemical systems

02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:15.540
of the brain and body in a
direction that makes us feel good

02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:18.060
as opposed to lousy or neutral.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:22.300
In any event, this study
looked at whether or not

02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:26.410
people have high levels of self-expansion

02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:29.060
through the actions or statements

02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:32.275
of their significant other,
and how that influences

02:01:32.275 --> 02:01:36.250
their perception of people
outside the relationship.

02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:38.980
Meaning how attractive
they perceive people

02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:40.870
outside the relationship to be,

02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:43.280
turns out to be strongly influenced

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.280
by, A, whether or not their
self-expansion is very strongly

02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:53.164
driven by the other person
that they are involved with,

02:01:53.164 --> 02:01:55.470
that they're in the
romantic relationship with,

02:01:55.470 --> 02:01:57.600
and whether or not that's
being expressed to them.

02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:59.391
So here's how the study went.

02:01:59.391 --> 02:02:03.910
First of all, they rated
or categorized individuals

02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:06.180
on the basis of the self-expansion metric.

02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:09.980
Some people have more of
a potential to experience

02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:11.830
self-expansion through others, right?

02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:15.070
Some of us feel great about
ourselves and we're topped off,

02:02:15.070 --> 02:02:17.880
the others don't feel so
great about themselves,

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:20.380
but they can feel much
better in response to praise,

02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:23.840
in particular praise or
self-expansion type behaviors

02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.860
or statements from people
that we really care about.

02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:28.240
And still other people
are a mixture of the two.

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.370
They moderate levels of both.

02:02:30.370 --> 02:02:32.010
So they rated them on this scale.

02:02:32.010 --> 02:02:33.440
And then they had people

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:37.250
experience self-expansion narratives.

02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:39.810
They heard their significant
others say really terrific

02:02:39.810 --> 02:02:42.870
things about them and about the
relationship, in particular,

02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:46.060
that the relationship that
they have was exciting,

02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:47.370
novel and challenging.

02:02:47.370 --> 02:02:49.080
So that was one form of self-expansion.

02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:51.600
And they went into some detail
as to why that was the case

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.977
in their particular relationship.

02:02:52.977 --> 02:02:57.910
Or they heard a narrative
from their significant other

02:02:57.910 --> 02:03:02.210
about strong feelings
of love between the two

02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:04.640
that had been experienced
previously in the relationship.

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:07.670
So in the one case, it
directed more towards them.

02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:08.503
And in the other case,

02:03:08.503 --> 02:03:10.580
it's more about the relationship itself.

02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:14.470
And then they did brain
imaging of one person

02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:17.130
in the relationship while
that person assessed

02:03:17.130 --> 02:03:21.150
the attractiveness of people
outside the relationship.

02:03:21.150 --> 02:03:23.900
And what they found was
that people who were primed

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.900
for this self-expansion had
lower activation of brain areas

02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:32.590
associated with assessing
others' attractiveness

02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:36.650
than did the people who experienced
a lot of self-expansion.

02:03:36.650 --> 02:03:40.010
Now the takeaway from that,
at least the way I read

02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:44.090
the study is if you're with
somebody who really benefits

02:03:44.090 --> 02:03:47.273
from or experiences a
lot of self-expansion,

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:50.540
unless you really want
them to pay attention

02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.710
to the attractiveness of other people,

02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:56.380
it stands to reason
that they would benefit

02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:01.220
from more self-expansion type
gestures or statements, okay?

02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.724
Not so much centered on the relationship.

02:04:02.724 --> 02:04:04.610
We have such a great relationship.

02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:07.070
There's so much love,
it's so great, that too,

02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:09.700
but in the context of this
study and these findings,

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:13.000
that the person is really
terrific, that the relationship

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.970
that they've created
together is really exciting,

02:04:14.970 --> 02:04:17.970
novel, and challenging, that
there's a narrative around

02:04:17.970 --> 02:04:19.709
the relationship that
really has a lot to do

02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:23.020
with the dynamics between the
individuals, in particular,

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:25.400
that the person who really
likes self-expansion

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:27.210
is vital to that dynamic, okay?

02:04:27.210 --> 02:04:28.890
So it's not looking
down at the relationship

02:04:28.890 --> 02:04:30.140
as a set of equals.

02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:32.550
There is this bias
written into this of that

02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:35.030
this person is really
essential for the relationship.

02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:36.790
I'm not saying this is
something that anyone has to do.

02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:38.090
I'm not not saying this is right or wrong.

02:04:38.090 --> 02:04:40.160
This is just what the data say.

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:43.140
But what's remarkable
is that in the absence

02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:47.140
of those statements, people who have,

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:50.720
or that rate high on this
scale of self-expansion

02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:54.500
rate attractive alternative
partners as more attractive.

02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:58.070
Now, that's interesting to
me, because it may means that

02:04:58.070 --> 02:05:00.890
their actual perception
of others is changing.

02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:02.252
It's not that their opportunity

02:05:02.252 --> 02:05:04.940
to see others is changing, right?

02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:08.440
This is not a matter of
them somehow getting access

02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:11.180
or no access to attractive
alternative partners.

02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.560
Again, attractive alternative partners,

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.980
literally the language in
the title of this paper,

02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:17.180
they're still seeing all
these attractive people.

02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:21.490
It's just that if they're
feeling filled up, in air quotes,

02:05:21.490 --> 02:05:24.647
psychologically filled
up, emotionally filled up,

02:05:24.647 --> 02:05:28.460
autonomically filled,
enhanced in the language

02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:31.520
that we're using today by
the self-expansion narrative,

02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:35.320
well then the same set of
attractive faces appear

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:38.510
less attractive to a given individual.

02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:40.944
Now, whether or not this
predicts cheating or loyalty,

02:05:40.944 --> 02:05:43.020
[laughs] I certainly can't say.

02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:45.800
That would be very hard
to assess in neuroimaging.

02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:50.800
And there, of course,
people rarely if ever

02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:53.240
report accurately their cheating behavior.

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:56.240
There's some studies in which
confidentiality is assured

02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:59.200
to the point where people
seem to be more trusting

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.830
and willing to reveal cheating behavior.

02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:03.620
But if you look at the
statistics on cheating behavior,

02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:07.130
it's very hard to track
because people lie all the time

02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:09.250
about their cheating in
and outside of the context

02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:12.600
of psychological and neuroimaging studies.

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.267
But I find this study, again, the title,

02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:17.680
"Manipulation of
Self-expansion Alters Responses

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:19.180
to Attractive Alternative Partners"

02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:22.540
to be absolutely fascinating,
because again, it points

02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:26.830
to the fact that the
interactions with our significant

02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:30.480
others shapes our autonomic
arousal, shapes our perception

02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:35.250
of self and thereby shapes our
perception of other potential

02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:36.780
partners in the outside world,

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:40.140
or shuts us down to the
potential of other people

02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.500
in the outside world.

02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:43.040
So when I hear statements such as,

02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:44.660
it's important that you love yourself

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.220
in order to really fall in
love with somebody else,

02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:51.330
or it is when one is not
looking for a relationship

02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:52.710
that they're most likely to fall in love

02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:54.303
and form a stable relationship,

02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:58.970
I can filter that through
these findings to say that

02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:04.203
it's really the person who
needs a lot of self-expansion,

02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:09.140
stimulating statements or
actions coming from other people

02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:13.790
that is most prone to seeing
other potential partners

02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:15.750
out in the world as attractive.

02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:17.610
And in this sense,

02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:19.690
we can return to the
autonomic nervous system

02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:23.430
as a glass that it can be filled up

02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:24.520
through various contexts.

02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:27.280
It can be filled up through
our own ability to regulate it.

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.640
It can be filled up through
other people's ability

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:32.840
to enhance our sense of wellbeing.

02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:37.090
And in some sense, this points
to an idea where it is true

02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:39.070
that the better that we
can feel about ourselves

02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:43.560
in the absence of any
self-expansion type input

02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:45.670
from somebody else really does place us

02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:48.170
on more stable grounds,
such that when we do receive

02:07:48.170 --> 02:07:50.530
that praise, or we do receive
those acts of kindness,

02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:53.280
or service, or physical
touch or whatever they are,

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:58.280
that we are able to further
enhance the way that we feel,

02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:02.170
but that we don't necessarily
tether all of our feelings

02:08:02.170 --> 02:08:06.680
of self-worth or self-expansion
to that one individual.

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:10.250
So you might think that if
person A can only receive

02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:14.510
the self-expansion from the
statements, from the action

02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:16.750
of the they're involved with, person B,

02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:19.640
that that will form a very stable bond,

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:21.400
but what this study
points to is the fact that

02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:23.520
that's a very unstable bond.

02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:26.190
That person A is actually very susceptible

02:08:26.190 --> 02:08:27.480
to the attractiveness of others,

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:30.340
because they're so desperately
attached to this notion

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.580
of self-expansion, even
if they don't realize it.

02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:35.320
And so this really does
point to the idea that,

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:38.920
well, it is important to link
our autonomic nervous systems

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:42.370
to establish desire, love, and attachment

02:08:42.370 --> 02:08:45.910
that we want to have a stable
internal representation

02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:49.160
of ourselves, a stable
autonomic nervous system

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:53.330
to some degree in other so
that we can be in stable

02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:55.720
romantic partnership
with another individual,

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:57.410
if that what we're really trying to do.

02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:58.822
So until now, I've been
weaving together studies

02:08:58.822 --> 02:09:01.990
from the field of experimental psychology

02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:06.170
and the fields of neuroscience
in particular neuroimaging.

02:09:06.170 --> 02:09:10.500
But if you recall back to the
very beginning of the episode,

02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:15.430
when I was discussing how
odors, and how hormones,

02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:18.500
and how even birth control
can shape people's ratings

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:20.683
of attractiveness of others,

02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:24.710
you'll realize that there's
a deeper layer to all this,

02:09:24.710 --> 02:09:29.710
which is that our biology that
resides below our conscious

02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:33.220
awareness, things like our hormones,

02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:38.070
things like pheromones
even are shaping the way

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:43.070
that we choose, interpret
and act with other potential

02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:46.440
romantic partners or the romantic partners

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.400
that we already have.

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.680
Now, this cannot be
over-emphasized, right?

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.060
No matter how much we would like to create

02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:59.910
a top-down description,
meaning from the cortex

02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:01.860
and our understanding of things

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.680
onto what we find attractive,
who we find attractive,

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.630
what we enjoy, what we
don't enjoy in the pursuit

02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:10.750
in romantic interactions with others,

02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:14.170
there always seems to be,
and indeed, there always is

02:10:14.170 --> 02:10:18.120
a deeper layer in which
our subconscious processing

02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.850
drives us to find a particular person

02:10:20.850 --> 02:10:22.570
to be particularly attractive,

02:10:22.570 --> 02:10:26.040
or in which we have
chemistry with somebody,

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:29.220
or in which we lack
chemistry with somebody.

02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:33.810
And I would say that one of
the more exciting, fascinating,

02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:38.810
and indeed mysterious aspects
of desire, love and attachment

02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:41.390
are those subconscious processes,

02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:44.080
those things that we
call chemistry, right?

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.230
I mean, people will report,
for instance, that somebody's

02:10:47.230 --> 02:10:51.480
smell is just absolutely
positively intoxicating for them,

02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.890
or that somebody's smell is
absolutely repulsive to them

02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:55.770
and they don't know why.

02:10:55.770 --> 02:10:59.160
That the taste of someone's
breath, and I don't mean that

02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:02.510
in any kind of poetic sense,
I literally mean the taste

02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:05.000
of somebody's breath in some cases

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.340
can be very exciting to somebody.

02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.880
And believe it or not, we can
taste each other's breath.

02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:12.430
I talked about this in the
chemical sensing episode

02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:17.650
some months back, but we
actually have receptors for taste

02:11:17.650 --> 02:11:20.350
and smell that engage
in coordinated action,

02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:23.320
such that we can't really
separate taste and smell

02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.153
at some level.

02:11:24.153 --> 02:11:27.120
And this is especially true
when it comes to the formation

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:30.070
of romantic relationships
and what we call chemistry.

02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:32.830
Now is chemistry absolutely required

02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:36.930
for forming stable attachments
for love and for desire?

02:11:36.930 --> 02:11:38.373
No, of course, they're not.

02:11:38.373 --> 02:11:42.860
But in general, these
are primitive mechanisms

02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.460
that exist in all animals,

02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:47.380
they exist in special forms in humans,

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:51.063
but that they drive us
toward behaviors that will,

02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:55.610
as the theory goes, lead
to love and attachment.

02:11:55.610 --> 02:12:00.340
Not always, as Dr. Fisher pointed
out that sex and sex drive

02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:03.240
is one way to explore
potential love relationships,

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:05.840
and to explore potential attachments,

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.480
which, of course, are major investments

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:12.060
that extend well beyond one
night, or a week, or a vacation,

02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:13.460
or even a year.

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.370
When we talk about stable attachments,

02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:18.890
in general, that means
long-term attachments in humans.

02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:23.890
Now, there is a biology to
all of that chemistry stuff.

02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:28.850
And the studies of oral
contraception and men finding women

02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:32.520
more attractive at certain
phases of their menstrual cycle,

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.460
and women finding men more
attractive at certain phases

02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:39.620
of the women's menstrual cycle
point to the incredible power

02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:41.543
of those deeper biological mechanisms.

02:12:43.090 --> 02:12:44.670
In the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"

02:12:44.670 --> 02:12:47.630
I discuss both science
and science-based tools.

02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:50.770
And so I'd be remiss if
I didn't actually cover

02:12:50.770 --> 02:12:52.340
some of the tools that relate

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:55.160
to those deeper biological mechanisms.

02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.140
Now, the hormones,
testosterone and estrogen

02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:02.680
are almost always the
first biological chemicals

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:06.610
and hormones that are mentioned,
and described, and explored

02:13:06.610 --> 02:13:11.610
when thinking about desire,
and love and attachment, too,

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.193
for that matter since love and
attachment stem from desire.

02:13:16.810 --> 02:13:20.380
I did an entire episode about
the biology of testosterone

02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:25.180
and estrogen and ways to optimize
testosterone and estrogen.

02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:28.530
You can easily find that
episode at hubermanlab.com.

02:13:28.530 --> 02:13:30.620
It's timestamped, there
you can find all sorts

02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:34.270
of information about how
certain behaviors or absence

02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:37.710
of behaviors drive up or down
testosterone and estrogen.

02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:41.160
I also dispel some myths
about sexual behavior

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.600
and things like masturbation

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:45.720
and how they relate to
testosterone and estrogen,

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:48.520
as well as some myths about
how those hormones change

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.610
across the lifespan.

02:13:49.610 --> 02:13:52.610
I also talk about the role of exercise,

02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:55.610
I talk about supplementation,
and I also talk a little bit

02:13:55.610 --> 02:13:57.130
about hormone replacement therapy,

02:13:57.130 --> 02:13:59.710
although that will be the
topic for a future episode.

02:13:59.710 --> 02:14:01.970
So if you're interested in
the biology of testosterone

02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:05.220
and estrogen, two hormones
that absolutely influence

02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:08.970
things like libido and desire,
please check out that episode

02:14:08.970 --> 02:14:12.260
as well as what I'm going to
talk about in just a moment here.

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:14.700
The simple stereotyped
version of the hormones,

02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:18.760
testosterone and estrogen
are that testosterone drives

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:21.990
libido or increases it aka sex drive,

02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:25.630
and that estrogen somehow
blunts it or is not involved

02:14:25.630 --> 02:14:26.860
in libido and sex drive.

02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:28.672
And that is simply not the case.

02:14:28.672 --> 02:14:31.850
As I describe in that
testosterone and estrogen

02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:35.060
optimization episode and
as I'll tell you now,

02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:38.850
yes, testosterone and
some of its other forms

02:14:38.850 --> 02:14:43.650
like dihydrotestosterone are
strongly related to libido

02:14:43.650 --> 02:14:46.610
and sex drive and the
pursuit and ability to mate.

02:14:46.610 --> 02:14:51.490
However, the hormone estrogen
is also strongly associated

02:14:51.490 --> 02:14:53.670
with libido and mating behavior.

02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:57.810
So much so that for people
that either chemically

02:14:57.810 --> 02:15:00.980
or for some other reason
have very low estrogen,

02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:02.970
libido can severely suffer.

02:15:02.970 --> 02:15:06.290
So it's a coordinated dance
of estrogen and testosterone

02:15:06.290 --> 02:15:10.420
in both males and females that
leads to libido or sex drive.

02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:15.420
So I absolutely want to make
clear that it's not a simple

02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:18.560
relationship between
testosterone and sex drive,

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:19.610
or estrogen and sex drive.

02:15:19.610 --> 02:15:23.290
Both are required at appropriate ratios.

02:15:23.290 --> 02:15:28.290
Now, with that said, there are
things that can shift libido

02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:35.390
in both men and women in
the direction of more desire

02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:38.630
or more desire to mate,
either to seek mates

02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.750
or to mate with existing partners.

02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:44.350
And there's a quite solid literature

02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:46.750
around a few of those substances.

02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:49.600
Now, a common misconception
is that because dopamine

02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:53.640
is involved in motivation and
drive that simply increasing

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:57.470
dopamine through any number of
different mechanisms or tools

02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:59.920
will increase libido and sex drive.

02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:02.363
And that's simply not the case either.

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:09.080
It is true that some level
of dopamine or increase

02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:14.240
in dopamine is required
for increases in libido.

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:16.670
However, because of
dopamine's relationship

02:16:16.670 --> 02:16:18.430
to the autonomic nervous system,

02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:21.250
and because the autonomic nervous system

02:16:21.250 --> 02:16:24.450
is so intimately
involved, no pun intended,

02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:28.810
in sexual activity in seeking
an actual mating behavior,

02:16:28.810 --> 02:16:31.780
as I described earlier,
it's actually the case that

02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:35.680
if people drive their
dopamine system too high,

02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.670
they will be in states of
arousal that are high enough

02:16:40.670 --> 02:16:44.430
such that they seek and
want sexual activity,

02:16:44.430 --> 02:16:47.470
but they can't actually
engage the parasympathetic arm

02:16:47.470 --> 02:16:48.940
of the autonomic nervous system sufficient

02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:51.370
to become physically aroused.

02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:54.560
There's a whole description
of this that awaits us

02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:55.580
in a future episode.

02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:58.740
But I'll summarize now
by saying for people

02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:03.040
that are taking substances just
simply to increase dopamine

02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:06.152
in order to increase libido,

02:17:06.152 --> 02:17:09.820
that can be a potentially
hazardous route to follow.

02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:13.890
Because depending on whether
or not that dopamine level

02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:18.720
is high enough that it puts
them into a mode of seeking

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:23.110
mates or mating, but they
can't adjust their autonomic

02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:25.490
nervous system during
actual mating behavior,

02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:26.889
what essentially is I'm
saying is it can place people

02:17:26.889 --> 02:17:31.010
into a chronic pursuit but in
inability to perform sexually.

02:17:31.010 --> 02:17:33.280
And this is true for men and women.

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:37.157
Okay, so I would just caution
people against just thinking,

02:17:37.157 --> 02:17:40.810
"Oh, a lack of libido is
simply a lack of dopamine."

02:17:40.810 --> 02:17:41.960
That is not the case.

02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:44.850
It could be from lower levels of dopamine,

02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:47.730
but it could also be for other reasons.

02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:49.877
And so these systems,
these signaling systems

02:17:49.877 --> 02:17:53.150
and these neurochemicals
are very intricate.

02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:56.850
And just simply ramping up
dopamine has actually been found,

02:17:56.850 --> 02:18:00.100
for instance, in amphetamine
and cocaine users,

02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:02.540
there's a phenomenon in which
they become hyper aroused,

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:03.760
but can't perform sexually.

02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:06.750
This is also true for people
who take elevated levels

02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:11.080
of other recreational drugs
or who take antidepressants

02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:14.250
that increase the dopamine
system too much, right?

02:18:14.250 --> 02:18:17.060
Dosage has to be worked
out with your physician,

02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:21.050
with your psychiatrist,
such that mood is enhanced

02:18:21.050 --> 02:18:24.770
and the various aspects
of a healthy wellbeing,

02:18:24.770 --> 02:18:27.190
mind and body are enhanced,
but not so much so that

02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:31.450
that what we call the arousal
arc is locked with the seesaw

02:18:31.450 --> 02:18:34.560
in the sympathetic drive position

02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:37.610
such that sexual arousal
can't occur, okay?

02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:39.930
So this is an important point to make,

02:18:39.930 --> 02:18:41.870
because I think that a lot of people

02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:43.242
are under the impression that

02:18:43.242 --> 02:18:47.130
if they just drive up
testosterone, increase dopamine,

02:18:47.130 --> 02:18:49.280
and generally get
themselves into high states

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:51.920
of autonomic arousal that that's
going to increase the libido.

02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:54.670
But that's simply not
the way the system works.

02:18:54.670 --> 02:18:57.610
It's that seesaw and that
seesawing back and forth

02:18:57.610 --> 02:19:01.320
that is the arc of arousal
that we talked about earlier.

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:06.320
Now, there are substances, legal
over-the-counter substances

02:19:06.510 --> 02:19:09.290
that fall under the
categorization of supplements

02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:13.170
that do indeed increase
libido and arousal.

02:19:13.170 --> 02:19:15.040
And so I'm going to talk about
some of those in the context

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:17.660
of peer-reviewed literature now.

02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:19.000
I want to be clear, however,

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.630
that these are by no means required.

02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:24.330
Many people have healthy
libidos or have libidos

02:19:24.330 --> 02:19:28.293
that are healthy for their life
and what they need and want.

02:19:29.410 --> 02:19:32.550
And as always in any discussion
about supplementation,

02:19:32.550 --> 02:19:34.390
you absolutely have to
check with your physician.

02:19:34.390 --> 02:19:35.670
I don't just say that to protect us.

02:19:35.670 --> 02:19:37.160
I say that to protect you.

02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.470
Your health and wellbeing is
dependent on you doing certain

02:19:39.470 --> 02:19:42.120
things and not doing others,
and everybody is different.

02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:44.130
Nonetheless, there are studies that point

02:19:44.130 --> 02:19:47.470
to specific substances that
are sold over the counter

02:19:47.470 --> 02:19:49.380
that at least in the
United States are legal

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:53.580
and that have been shown to
be statistically significant

02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:56.210
in increasing measures of libido.

02:19:56.210 --> 02:20:00.970
There are many such substances,
but three that in particular

02:20:00.970 --> 02:20:04.300
have good peer-reviewed
research to support them

02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:09.300
are Maca, M-A-C-A, which
is actually a root.

02:20:10.505 --> 02:20:13.210
Tongkat Ali, also
sometimes called longjack,

02:20:13.210 --> 02:20:17.650
I didn't name them, forgive
me, and Tribulus, or Tribulus,

02:20:17.650 --> 02:20:18.850
it's sometimes called.

02:20:18.850 --> 02:20:21.470
I'm going to talk about
each of these in sequence.

02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:26.470
But on the whole, the studies
on Maca are quite convincing

02:20:27.970 --> 02:20:32.970
that consumption of two to
three grams per day of Maca,

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:36.763
which generally is sold
as a powder or a capsule,

02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:40.050
typically consumed early in the day,

02:20:40.050 --> 02:20:42.050
because it can be somewhat of a stimulant,

02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:44.930
meaning it can increase alertness
and you wouldn't want it

02:20:44.930 --> 02:20:48.690
to interfere with sleep by
taking it too late in the day.

02:20:48.690 --> 02:20:52.620
But in studies that include
both men and women of durations

02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:54.410
anywhere from eight to 12 weeks

02:20:55.350 --> 02:20:57.530
of athletes and non-athletes,

02:20:57.530 --> 02:21:00.590
and different variations of Maca,

02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:03.640
turns out there's black
Maca, red Maca, yellow Maca.

02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:06.110
There are a bunch of
different forms of Maca.

02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:10.080
But that they can increase
subjective reports

02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:15.080
of sexual desire, independent
of hormone systems.

02:21:15.210 --> 02:21:18.370
Meaning, it does not seem at
least based on the existing

02:21:18.370 --> 02:21:21.030
literature that Maca
increases testosterone

02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:23.410
or changes estrogen, at
least not on the time scales

02:21:23.410 --> 02:21:24.659
that these studies were done,

02:21:24.659 --> 02:21:27.810
or with the measures that were
performed in these studies.

02:21:27.810 --> 02:21:31.910
But that Maca, again,
consumed in doses of anywhere

02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:34.270
from two to three grams per day,

02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:37.550
has been shown to
significantly increase libido.

02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:42.550
And in fact, those dosages of
Maca have been shown to offset

02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:47.330
so-called SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.

02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:51.100
So there are various routes
to sexual dysfunction.

02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:55.200
The SSRIs are selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:57.310
They go by name brands
like Prozac and Zoloft,

02:21:57.310 --> 02:22:00.700
and there are many others now
on generic forms and so forth.

02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:03.660
Those don't always, I should point out,

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:04.950
lead to sexual dysfunction.

02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:06.910
There's a dose dependence.

02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:10.950
Some people do quite well on
SSRIs and don't have any issues

02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:11.783
with sexual function.

02:22:11.783 --> 02:22:15.310
Other people suffer quite a
lot from sexual dysfunction

02:22:15.310 --> 02:22:18.070
while taking SSRIs, highly variable.

02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:22.870
You need to work with a physician,
a qualified psychiatrist.

02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:26.550
But nonetheless, everything
I've been saying about Maca

02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:31.080
thus far has also been
explored in the context of SSRI

02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:32.040
induced sexual dysfunction.

02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:35.547
The paper that I'm referring to here is

02:22:35.547 --> 02:22:37.870
"A Double‐Blind, Randomized,
Pilot Dose‐Finding Study

02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:39.060
of Maca Root..."

02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:41.950
It goes by the name L. meyenii.

02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:42.987
These always have fancy names.

02:22:42.987 --> 02:22:45.820
And the Latin names in biology
are always more complicated,

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:46.977
but it's Maca root.

02:22:46.977 --> 02:22:49.920
"for the Management of
SSRI‐Induced Sexual Dysfunction."

02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:52.713
First author is Dording, D-O-R-D-I-N-G.

02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:56.090
This was a study done at Mass General,

02:22:56.090 --> 02:23:00.700
which is one of the satellite
locations around Harvard Med.

02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:02.780
It's associated with Harvard Med,

02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:06.980
that found significant
improvements in libido

02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:08.920
when people were taking a pretty low dose.

02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:11.997
It was actually in this
case, just 1.5 grams per day,

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:17.150
up to a high dose, three
grams per day of Maca.

02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.983
And they were doing this

02:23:17.983 --> 02:23:20.600
in 20 remitted depressed outpatients.

02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:21.843
So these are people that had depression,

02:23:21.843 --> 02:23:25.040
their depression was
successfully treated with SSRIs,

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:27.860
but they were suffering from
some of these SSRI related

02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:30.170
sexual effects and Maca seemed to offset

02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:33.720
some of those effects
significantly in this population.

02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:37.970
The other studies exploring
the lack of effect on serum

02:23:37.970 --> 02:23:42.770
testosterone in adult healthy
men was a 12-week study,

02:23:42.770 --> 02:23:46.690
again, consuming anywhere
from 1.5 to three milligrams,

02:23:46.690 --> 02:23:49.130
meaning one, excuse me, 1500 milligrams

02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:51.270
to 3000 milligrams or placebo.

02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:56.270
So again, this is 1.5 up to
three grams of Maca or placebo,

02:23:56.500 --> 02:24:01.500
and they rated sexual desire,
depression, and other measures

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:04.650
such as testosterone in the blood.

02:24:04.650 --> 02:24:08.540
Again, no change in
testosterone or estrogen

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:11.060
estradiol levels in men treated with Maca

02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:12.580
and those treated with placebo.

02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:16.600
But nonetheless, there was a
significant and positive effect

02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:19.440
on libido with this dosage of 1.5

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:20.877
to three grams per day of Maca.

02:24:20.877 --> 02:24:24.950
And there are several other
studies that also show this.

02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:29.370
Again, in people that taking
SSRIs and people that are not

02:24:29.370 --> 02:24:34.370
taking SSRIs, in chronically
over-trained athletes,

02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:36.220
this was also found to be the case.

02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:38.910
So seems like across the board,

02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:42.060
Maca is a fairly useful supplement

02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.690
for those that are seeking
to increase their libido.

02:24:44.690 --> 02:24:47.470
And there are fewer
studies involving women,

02:24:47.470 --> 02:24:51.070
but there are a few such studies
that also point to the same

02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:54.680
general positive effect on
libido in women taking Maca

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:57.460
at equivalent doses to
those I just described.

02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:00.150
I think it's noteworthy
that Maca supplementation

02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:04.220
does not seem to adjust
testosterone or estrogen levels

02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:07.470
to any significant degree,
but it does change libido.

02:25:07.470 --> 02:25:10.350
I think that points to the
fact that there are multiple

02:25:10.350 --> 02:25:13.060
systems in the brain and
body that influence libido,

02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:15.200
not just testosterone and estrogen.

02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:16.500
And indeed we know that to be the case.

02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:21.080
Things like PEA, which is a
substance found in chocolate

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:23.720
and is a substance that
some people supplement,

02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.130
is known, for instance,
to increase sexual desire,

02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:30.260
but also the perception
of sexual experiences

02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:32.700
as more stimulating for instance.

02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:34.970
So there are a lot of pathways
in the brain, in particular,

02:25:34.970 --> 02:25:38.680
in the hypothalamus, this
ancient area of our brain,

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.550
that harbors neurons and
hormone secreting cells,

02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:45.850
including neurons that
can shape our perceptions

02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:49.210
of even just our tactile experience

02:25:49.210 --> 02:25:51.820
of others and their attractiveness.

02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:55.270
And indeed can shift levels
of desire, independent

02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:58.170
of changing levels of
circulating hormones.

02:25:58.170 --> 02:26:01.170
Another substance that has
been shown to increase libido

02:26:01.170 --> 02:26:04.120
across a range of human populations

02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:06.830
is so-called Tongkat Ali.

02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:09.110
I've talked a little bit about this before

02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:13.420
on the "Huberman Lab Podcast"
in reference to testosterone.

02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:15.380
And I've talked about it
extensively as a guest

02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:16.640
on other podcasts.

02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:19.143
Tongkat Ali goes by a
number of different names.

02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:22.690
One of them is exceedingly
difficult for me to pronounce.

02:26:22.690 --> 02:26:26.833
It's Eurycoma longifolia,
also called longjack.

02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:30.430
But Tongkat Ali is the typical name.

02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:32.800
This is an herb, there's
a Malaysian version

02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.920
and an Indonesian version.

02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:37.530
My understanding is that
the Indonesian variety

02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:40.010
of Tongkat Ali is the
one that is most potent

02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:43.063
for its effects on libido.

02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:46.320
Previously, I've talked about Tongkat Ali

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:49.750
taken in 400 milligram per day capsules

02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:53.190
as a means to increase the amount of free,

02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:55.260
meaning unbound testosterone.

02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:58.970
So testosterone has a both
bound form and an unbound form.

02:26:58.970 --> 02:27:02.500
Very briefly, the bound
form is bound to albumin

02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:06.470
in the blood or to so-called
sex hormone binding globulin.

02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:10.650
When it's bound, it can't
be biologically active

02:27:10.650 --> 02:27:11.990
at many cells.

02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:14.220
It is important that some
of it be bound in order

02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:17.300
to get a time release
and proper distribution

02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:18.450
of testosterone through the body,

02:27:18.450 --> 02:27:21.580
but is the unbound free
testosterone that can really

02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:23.510
have its most potent effects.

02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:27.380
And there's some evidence
that Tongkat Ali can increase

02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:30.670
the amount of unbound
so-called free testosterone

02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:33.220
by lowering sex hormone binding globulin,

02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:36.310
although it is almost certain
that it has other routes

02:27:36.310 --> 02:27:38.600
of mechanism as well.

02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:42.760
Nonetheless, there are
some reports of Tongkat Ali

02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:45.110
increasing libido.

02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:49.020
One particular article,
last author, or I should say

02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:53.520
last name of first author,
excuse me, Ismail, I-S-M-A-I-L.

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:57.710
This was published in
Evidence-Based Complementary

02:27:57.710 --> 02:28:00.210
and Alternative Medicine, it's from 2012.

02:28:00.210 --> 02:28:03.850
Reports a significant increase in libido

02:28:03.850 --> 02:28:05.170
and sexual function.

02:28:05.170 --> 02:28:07.950
There are other studies,
not a lot of them,

02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:12.540
not as many robust, controlled,
quality peer-reviewed

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:14.170
studies as there are from Maca.

02:28:14.170 --> 02:28:17.550
Nonetheless, a number of people,
men and women that I know

02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:21.220
do take Tongkat Ali and it
seems to work well for them.

02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:22.960
The question always comes up around

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:23.920
discussion of supplements.

02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:25.460
Do you need to cycle these things?

02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:27.230
The only way to determine that is really

02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:29.960
to do your blood work,
monitor liver enzymes,

02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:32.210
monitor hormone levels and so forth.

02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:35.160
So I simply can't say
whether or not you need to,

02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:36.355
or you don't need to cycle them.

02:28:36.355 --> 02:28:40.970
Typically Tongkat Ali
and Maca are not cycled

02:28:40.970 --> 02:28:43.640
in any regular kind of
way that I'm aware of.

02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:46.330
But again, you really need
to check with your doctor

02:28:46.330 --> 02:28:49.260
if you're going to initiate
taking any of these things.

02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:51.440
And you certainly should
do your best to monitor

02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:54.330
your blood work as well as
subjective measures in evaluating

02:28:54.330 --> 02:28:55.460
whether or not they're working for you,

02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.770
safe for you and so forth.

02:28:56.770 --> 02:28:59.320
The third and final substance/supplement

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.000
that I want to touch on
as it relates to libido

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.763
is called Tribulus Terrestris.

02:29:04.770 --> 02:29:09.770
So that's T-R-I-B-U-L-U-S,
terrestris, T-E-R-R-E-S-T-R-I-S.

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:16.390
This is a commonly sold
over-the-counter supplement

02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:19.020
for increasing testosterone,

02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:22.620
for fitness purposes and so on.

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.690
Whether or not it actually does that

02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:27.710
to a meaningful degree, isn't clear.

02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:31.200
But I'm aware of four
peer-reviewed studies

02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:36.760
that were focused on
both males and females

02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:39.840
ranging anywhere from 18 years old

02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:42.130
all the way up to 65 plus.

02:29:42.130 --> 02:29:43.250
They say 65 plus.

02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:45.090
I guess it could be 70, it could be 80.

02:29:45.090 --> 02:29:45.923
I don't know.

02:29:45.923 --> 02:29:50.670
But a fairly broad age range
where people took anywhere

02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:55.670
from 750 milligrams per day
divided into three equal doses.

02:29:57.430 --> 02:30:01.370
So 750 total per day divided
into three equal doses

02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:05.440
of Tribulus or placebo for 120 days.

02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:08.750
This particular study
was focused on females.

02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:11.590
And according to the female
sexual function index

02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:13.980
questionnaire, no significant difference

02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:18.540
between any of the groups,
however free and bio-available

02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:19.820
testosterone increased in the group taking

02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:23.270
Tribulus Terrestris, total testosterone

02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:25.290
did not reach statistical significance.

02:30:25.290 --> 02:30:28.460
So this is the inverse
of what we see with Maca,

02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:31.160
where there do seem to be
increases in testosterone,

02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:34.760
which would predict that there
would be increase in libido.

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:37.930
In this case, this was
postmenopausal women,

02:30:37.930 --> 02:30:39.240
there was no increase in libido.

02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:41.150
There was an increase in testosterone.

02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:43.700
I mentioned it only because
there might be instances

02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:47.770
in which people want to
increase their testosterone.

02:30:47.770 --> 02:30:50.250
It does seem that Tribulus,
at least in that population

02:30:50.250 --> 02:30:51.860
is capable of doing that.

02:30:51.860 --> 02:30:54.470
Now there's a separate
study that was done,

02:30:54.470 --> 02:30:58.440
a double-blind study lasting
anywhere from one to six months

02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:02.350
that had a clear and
significant increase in libido.

02:31:02.350 --> 02:31:05.080
Now this was taking six grams.

02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:09.350
So that's 6,000 milligrams
of Tribulus root for 60 days.

02:31:09.350 --> 02:31:11.740
And it did seem to
increase various aspects

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:12.893
of sexual function.

02:31:13.950 --> 02:31:18.600
And there was what appeared
to be a substantial 16.3%

02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:21.800
increase in testosterone,
but in this particular study

02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:24.670
because of the variability
across individuals

02:31:24.670 --> 02:31:27.620
that did not actually arrive
at statistical significance.

02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:30.738
Now, there were a number of
other studies that explored

02:31:30.738 --> 02:31:34.670
the role of Tribulus, in
particular, in females.

02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:37.660
And one of those studies was a study

02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:40.710
that was actually quite short,
it was two to four weeks.

02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:43.070
It involved 67 subjects.

02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:46.530
These were subjects that had
experienced a loss of libido

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:50.070
and took Tribulus divided
into two equal doses,

02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:51.640
compared that to placebo.

02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:56.130
And they did see a significant
improvement in these measures

02:31:56.130 --> 02:31:58.070
of sexual desire and function

02:31:58.070 --> 02:32:00.440
on this female sexual function index.

02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:03.210
So there is some evidence
that Tribulus can be effective

02:32:03.210 --> 02:32:06.110
in increasing testosterone
in certain populations,

02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:08.790
in increasing sexual desire and function

02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:12.030
in certain populations
in particular in females.

02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:13.950
I think more studies are certainly needed.

02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:17.910
But these three substances/supplements,

02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:22.600
Maca, Tongkat Ali, in particular,
Indonesian Tongkat Ali,

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:26.260
and Tribulus can indeed create significant

02:32:26.260 --> 02:32:28.480
increases in sexual desire.

02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:32.060
And in some cases by
adjusting the testosterone

02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:35.040
and estrogen system, in
some cases not by adjusting

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:36.640
the testosterone and estrogen system.

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:40.690
Again, pointing to the
complexity of neurochemicals

02:32:40.690 --> 02:32:44.660
and features that adjust
things like libido aka desire.

02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:47.280
So we covered a lot of
material today related

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:49.130
to desire, love, and attachment.

02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:52.640
And yet I acknowledge
that it is not exhaustive

02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:56.800
of the vast landscape that
is the psychology and biology

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:59.140
of desire, love and attachment.

02:32:59.140 --> 02:33:02.230
Nonetheless, I hope that
you found the information

02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:05.810
interesting and hopefully
actionable in some cases

02:33:05.810 --> 02:33:08.910
toward the relationships
of your past, of present

02:33:08.910 --> 02:33:13.240
and potentially for the
relationships of your future.

Some of it is unique material only covered

02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:08.510
on Instagram and Twitter.

02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:10.820
During today's episode and
on many previous episodes

02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:14.050
of the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"
we discussed supplements.

02:34:14.050 --> 02:34:16.270
While supplements aren't
necessary or appropriate

02:34:16.270 --> 02:34:19.080
for everybody, many people
derive tremendous benefit

02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:22.760
from them, for things like
enhancing sleep, enhancing focus,

02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:26.640
or as discussed today for
enhancing libido and desire.

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:28.360
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:33.360
you can go to Thorne, that's
thorne.com/u/huberman.

02:34:34.290 --> 02:34:38.110
And there you can get 20% off
the supplements that I take.

02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:40.310
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site

02:34:40.310 --> 02:34:44.940
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:47.870
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:48.920
that Thorne makes.

02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:51.370
We partnered with Thorne
because Thorne has the absolute

02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:53.950
highest standards with
respect to the quality

02:34:53.950 --> 02:34:55.460
of the ingredients in their supplements

02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:58.240
and the precision of the
amounts of those supplements.

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:00.560
Thank you for joining me
for today's discussion

02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:03.050
about desire, love, and attachment.

02:35:03.050 --> 02:35:05.270
